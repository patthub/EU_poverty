PRESIDENT. \u2014 At its meeting of 7 April 1987 the enlarged Bureau drew up the draft agenda which has been distributed to you. At our meeting held this morning the chairmen of the political groups instructed me to propose to the House a number of amendments. Monday: I have been instructed by the Group chairmen to pro pose that we include at the end of today's agenda a debate on the statement made by the Commission on Friday, 10 April, concerning the free distribution of foodstuffs. Speaking time for this debate would be three minutes for each political group and for a repre sentative of the non-attached Members. As the Com mittee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities is currently looking into the problem raised by the application of the various paragraphs of Rule 40, I have to point out that the ",
        "No 2-352/2 Debates of the European Parliament 11.5.87 President holding of this debate can under no circumstances constitute a precedent. FORD (S). \u2014 Mr President, on Friday 10 April, my colleagues and I tabled a request for a debate follow ing the Commission's statement. I presume that there will be a vote this evening on the suggestion from the enlarged Bureau, which I fully support. The free food distribution was not as generous as it should have been. In the United Kingdom the value of the food distributed to the old age pensioners and others in need was less than the cost of stockpiling food for four hours. Butter, beef and cheese was dis tributed. But we have in fact more food in store after the free distribution of food than before. Certainly in the United Kingdom, there was a savage attack on the dignity of the old age pensioners who had to queue up, like in the food queues in the 1930s, to receive their free packs of butter. Many of the old age pen sioners could not afford the bus fares to collect the free food. Many of the charities spent more on admin istration than the value of the food they received. I hope that Members this afternoon are going to sup port the recommendation of the enlarged Bureau that there should be a debate this evening on this matter. Equally importantly, the distribution of the food was sadly abused in some cases. In Northern Ireland Mr John Taylor distributed food from the Commission through his group with paramilitary support. In New Mills, next to my constituency, Tory canvas sers were distributing free cheese when they canvassed for the local elections. If this had not been organized by the Commission and the Council of Ministers some people would have been prosecuted for the way in which this free food was distributed. I very much look forward to this debate which I hope that the whole of Parliament will support taking place this evening. TOMLINSON (S). \u2014 Mr President, the House has to have this most important debate. In supporting Mr Ford's proposal that the debate should take place can I ask whether Commissioner Andriessen will be in a position to give us an interim report? He said at the last part-session in April that he was in the middle of preparing a very detailed report and I hope therefore that Commissioner Andriessen will be here. Clearly in some parts of the Community the distribution of food stuffs was excellently handled to the great satisfaction of Community citizens. But in the United Kingdom we started off with a bang and finished with a whim per. (Protests from the right) We started with pictures of John Selwyn Gummer, a former chairmen of the Conservative Party, smiling somewhere between the little peaked cap and the top of his white apron as he announced with pride what a Conservative Government was doing, but when it came to criticisms of the food distribution he could not be found anywhere to answer the criticisms. There are major specific problems that need to be solved. For example, who is going to indemnify the voluntary organizations in the United Kingdom which suffered great loss? Who is going to indemnify the Salvation Army in the West Midlands, where the Cita del of the Salvation Army in Warley collapsed under the weight of the butter that was suddenly dumped there? Who is going to look into all the allegations of fraud in the distribution of foodstuffs in the United Kingdom? It is quite clear that some of the Com munity food that was supposed to be distributed turned up in many corner shops, or was distributed by political parties for political advantage and we need Commissioner Andriessen here in this debate to give us detailed answers about how the Commission is going to deal with these allegations. The fact that there was satisfaction in some parts of the Community cannot mask the total incompetence with which this distribution was handled in the United Kingdom. I hope that we can have this debate as a forerunner to the more detailed report that Commis sioner Andriessen has to bring before this House. PROUT (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I think the way that Mr Ford and Mr Tomlinson have spoken to this House gives us some idea as to how objective the debate, if we have it, is likely to be this evening. We all listened with interest to what Mr Andriessen had to say on the Friday of the last part-session. We all had an opportunity to put any questions we had for him then. He gave us the answers he could give but he also pointed out that until the Commission had time to study the matter in depth, produce a report and pres ent it to this House, there was no point in debating the matter any further. That is precisely the position of my group. We accept that the distribution of food throughout the Community was an excellent idea in principle. We hope that it will take place again in the future but we recognize that the administrative prob lems met with in a number of countries during the winter need analysis by the Commission so that we may be free of them next time. For this reason my group supports the debate. But we would wish to wait until we have the Commission's report in front of us so that the debate can be as objec tive and scientific as possible. (Parliament approved the proposal) TAYLOR (DR). \u2014 Mr President, Mr Ford, without having the courtesy to mention it beforehand to me, named me in this House. I want to make it clear that ",
        "11.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/3 Taylor what he said is absolutely untrue and it shows how lit tle he knows about the situation in Northern Ireland. It is true that paramilitaries were involved in the distri bution of this free food in Northern Ireland. I was the one politician in Northern Ireland who exposed it and condemned it. Far from being aided by the paramili taries, I condemned them and I was attacked publicly for so doing. I do hope, therefore, that he will have the courtesy to withdraw the unfounded allegation which he made. BLOCH VON BLOTTNITZ (ARC). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, would you be so kind as to check whether this new lighting, that is the two glaring blue flood lights, are necessary. There is such a glare that we here at the back can no longer see anything. Could we not perhaps switch them off? PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, it is light ing which is being tested for television work. As it is under test, we note your comments 1 \u00b7 2 . Thursday: Following a request from Mr Christophersen, the Vice-President of the Commission, I have been instructed to propose that we include on our agenda after the vote on agricultural prices, which would probably be at the beginning of the afternoon's sitting, the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft supplementary budget for 1987 and the prelimi nary draft general budget for 1988. That would be followed by a short debate with a speaking time of five minutes for each political group and a representative of the non-attached Members. ARNDT (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I have not yet quite understood what is happening. It is correct that this statement from the Commission is made pursuant to Rule 40. It is also correct that we can decide to hold a political debate, as has been suggested. Under the Rules of Procedure we must first have the opportunity to put questions after the statement from the Commission has been made. I presume that we shall hear the statement from the Commission on Thursday, pursuant to Rule 40, paragraph 1, then pur suant to Rule 40, paragraph 2, have the opportunity to ask brief and concise questions, and finally, pursuant to paragraph 3, hold the debate. The opportunity to put questions is compulsory, and we cannot do away with it. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Arndt, I also have the rules before me and under Rule 40 you will note that there 1 For other changes to Monday's agenda: see Minutes. 2 For changes to Wednesday's agenda: see Minutes. are two possibilities and we chose the former possibil ity rather than the latter one. So you make a choice, either we take the opportunity for each of the political groups to make its statement at that time, or we have a debate afterwards. Either of the rules cover this. Rule 40(2) is quite clear, it says: Unless Parliament decides otherwise, such a state ment shall not be followed by a debate. Members may, however, avail themselves of a period of thirty minutes in which to put brief and concise questions with a view to clarifying specific points in such statements. Obviously we can do that if it is the wish of the House. ARNDT (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, paragraph 2 comes into force automatically. No statement can be made without the Members's having an opportunity to put questions. Pursuant to Rule 40, paragraph 3, debate is optional and must be decided by Parliament. I asked if Parliament can decide to hold a debate in connection with these brief and concise questions. This is how I understand Rule 40. Therefore, I should not like to replace the debate with these questions, but neither should I like these questions to be replaced by the debate; because we must put questions to the Commissioner if we are to be able to adopt a parti cular position. It could well be that the Commissioner gives brilliant and exhaustive information, thus obviat ing the need to put questions. However, under the Rules of Procedure, Members must have the oppor tunity to put questions. PRESIDENT. \u2014 You are asking, Mr Arndt, as I understand it, for both. You are asking for a statement and you are asking for the opportunity for a debate afterwards. ARNDT (S). \u2014 (DE) I should like the questions to be put first and for every group then to be given five min utes in which to make a statement. A full-scale debate should not take place. PRESIDENT. \u2014 That was my understanding too, Mr Arndt. (Parliament approved the proposal) Friday: I have received a proposal under Rule 56(1) from Mr McMahon and 22 other Members to include in our agenda for the week a statement by the Commission under Rule 40(2), on the meeting of the Council of Finance Ministers on 11 May and the meeting of the Council of Ministers responsible for the Internal Mar- ",
        "No 2-352/4 Debates of the European Parliament 11.5. 87 President ket on 12 May. We discussed and debated this at the group chairmen's meeting this morning and they opposed this proposal on the grounds that, as regards the meeting of the Council of Finance Ministers, Mr Christophersen could deal with these matters in his presentation of the 1987 supplementary budget and the 1988 general budget and that the meeting of the Internal Market Ministers will not take place on 12 May. Nevertheless, I put this proposal to the House. last meeting all the committee chairmen agreed to this request and there is a letter to the Bureau from the committee chairmen. I should like the Bureau to con sider the matter. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Thank you, Mr Crespo, it is a mat ter which as you rightly say will come before the Bureau tomorrow which will consider it and report back. TOMLINSON (S). \u2014 Mr President, I do not quite understand what you are saying. Are you saying that it is Mr Christophersen's clear intention, during his statement on the preliminary draft supplementary budget and the preliminary draft budget for 1988, also to make a statement about the Ecofin meeting of 11 May? PRESIDENT. \u2014 He will indeed but I am not sure that the subject is going to be debated. It is not offi cially on the agenda but it may well be discussed, in which case, we shall get a report from Mr Christo phersen. We do not know yet whether he will be in a position to make a full report to us. TOMLINSON (S). \u2014 In that case, Mr President, I shall raise a point of order then if it is necessary. KLEPSCH (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, in reply to Mr McMahon I should like to say that it would per haps be more sensible if we first made it clear that we cannot put questions to specific individuals but only to the Commission as a whole. Second, we learned today that the previously men tioned meeting of the Internal Market Ministers will not take place, and therefore no report can be given. Third, if the President informs us that the Commission Vice-President, Mr Christophersen, will report on the question, if it is discussed at the Council of Finance Ministers, then for me the matter is settled. Further more, I should like to stress that it is not at all in the interest of this House for our agenda to become part of the election campaigns, which are currently taking place in some Member States. McMAHON (S). \u2014 Mr President, we, the signatories of the proposal, both the British and Portuguese Members, are rather perturbed that it is Mr Christo phersen who is going to report on this on behalf of the Commission. We would have preferred to have seen the whites of the eyes of Lord Cockfield on this occasion so that we could find out categorically whether or not he has proposals on this matter. There has been a great deal of public discussion recently in the newspapers in the United Kingdom and in Portu gal on whether or not he has some proposals hidden away in some secret cupboard in the Berlaymont building. We would have welcomed the opportunity to have questioned the noble Lord who, as a former expert on taxation, would be able to tell us whether or not he was planning to unleash anything on the unsus pecting European public in the near future. CRESPO (S), chairman of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment. \u2014 (PT) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, I wish to raise a matter concerning Fri day's agenda. The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment has prepared two reports, one relating to local employment initiatives and the other to adult vocational education. These two items have a bearing on the agenda of the Council of Ministers' meeting on the twenty-sixth of this month. We would therefore ask for these two reports, which are to be discussed by the Bureau tomorrow, to be taken on Friday. At their SUTHERLAND, Member of the Commission. \u2014 Mr President, in response to the issue raised by Mr McMahon the Commission is always willing and anx ious to provide the maximum degree of information to this House at times that are convenient to all con cerned. But the Commission, as Mr Klepsch has pointed out, does so through a representative of the college speaking on behalf of the college. With regard to the particular issue that has been raised, the Com mission's general policy on fiscal approximation was set out in the white paper and debated quite exten sively in this House. The Commission is not unwilling to make any further statements that may be required from time to time but I can tell the House that no such detailed proposals have been made, work is still pro gressing in the services and when that work is com plete the Commission will consider the matter. It has not done so to date and I would imagine that that is as much as could be said in the course of any discussion later in the week. I thought it appropriate to tell Par liament that at this stage. (Parliament rejected the proposal) MAIJ-WEGGEN (PPE). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I should like to say something in support of what Mr Crespo has just said. It is very regrettable that we should have to ask to have reports entered on the agenda, which will be dealt with by the Council in May. In this case it is the fault of the Bureau of Parlia- ",
        "11. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/5 Maij-Weggen ment, which has been dragging its feet on the matter, because it was on the agenda twice before. We in the Committee on Social Affairs are ready \u2014 I myself am one of the rapporteurs. I should like to ask the Bureau to adopt a resolution in favour of this tomorrow and simply to enter the matter on Friday's agenda. The two reports can be dealt with in a quarter of an hour and then Parliament will have fulfilled its democratic duty. PRESIDENT \u2014 Mrs Maij-Weggen, we take note of your request and its urgency. 1 (Parliament adopted the agenda thus amended) 2 for any demonstration, not with a view to prohibiting such demonstrations, but simply to ensure that they are conducted in an orderly fashion. In the present case, Mr Cicciomessere took part in three demonstrations, two against sexual violence and one against the way the RAI presents information. As I have said, these demonstrations had not been authorized by the Italian administrative authorities. That constituted an infringement of the Italian penal code. Obviously, these are minor offences, but that does not alter the fact that, since we have been asked to waive Mr Cicciomessere's parliamentary immunity, we must take a decision on the matter now. 3. Waiving of Parliamentary immunity PRESIDENT \u2014 The next item is the joint debate on : \u2014 the report (Doc. A 2-36/87), by Mr Donnez, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the third request for the waiver of Mr Roberto Cicciomes sere's parliamentary immunity: \u2014 the report (Doc. A 2-37/87), by Mr Donnez, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the fourth request for the waiver of Mr Roberto Cicci omessere's parliamentary immunity: \u2014 the report (Doc. A 2-38/87), by Mr Donnez, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verfication of Credentials and Immunities, on the fifth request for the waiver of Mr Roberto Cicciomes sere's parliamentary immunity. DONNEZ (LDR), rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, we have before us three requests by the Italian judicial authorities for the waiver of Mr Cicci omessere's parliamentary immunity. But with your permission, since they relate to the same Italian law, I shall deal with these three requests in a single verbal report, on the understanding that we shall have to hold three separate votes, since three decisions are required. The Italian judicial authorities accuse Mr Cicciomes sere of having taken part in three demonstrations without having requested the relevant administrative authorities for permission to organize (not to take part in) those demonstrations. You should know that under Italian law \u2014 and, indeed, under the law of several of our countries \u2014 prior official permission is required 1 For other changes to Friday's agenda: see Minutes. 2 Requests for urgency \u2014 Deadline for tabling amendments ana motions for resolutions \u2014 Speaking time: see Minutes. Let me briefly remind you of our established princi ples. We always apply Article 10 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Com munities. You know it well, so I shall not dwell on it. In the present instance, I shall mention only three of its basic principles. The first is that, since parliamentary immunity is designed primarily to protect this Parlia ment rather than any individual Member of it, the ren unciation of immunity by a Member against whom charges have been brought is relatively unimportant and, in the present case, Mr Cicciomessere's request that his parliamentary immunity be waived in response to the approach by the Italian judicial authorities, although perfectly honourable in law \u2014 and I respect his request \u2014 is not admissible. Naturally we should always try, as far as possible, to respond to the wishes of the Member against whom charges have been brought, since he may wish very strongly to have his immunity waived, if only to vindicate himself from particularly unjust or damaging accusations. But that is not the case here. Mr Cicciomessere regards this as a question of principle. He does not wish to take advan tage of parliamentary immunity. Our argument, how ever, in the light of the cases of precedent that have built up, is that since immunity is designed to protect Parliament as an institution, we must uphold that prin ciple and, in the present case, although Mr Cicciomes sere's request is perfectly honourable, it is completely unacceptable. The second point to which I should like to draw your attention is the duration of immunity. At the time the alleged offences were committed, Mr Cicciomessere was not a Member of the European Parliament, but was a Member of the Italian parliament. This is a legal anomaly that I shall raise with the Italian judicial auth orities. Those authorities did not ask the Chamber of Deputies to waive Mr Cicciomessere's immunity \u2014 as I consider, with all due respect, that they should have done \u2014 but waited, as it would appear, for Mr Cicci omessere to become a Member of our Parliament and asked us to waive his immunity instead. That legal anomaly aside, it is irrelevant when the alleged off ences took place. All we need to state is that, given Mr ",
        "No 2-352/6 Debates of the European Parliament 11.5. 87 Donnez Cicciomessere enjoys parliamentary immunity by vir tue of his membership of this Parliament, his immunity lasts for the whole period of his mandate. So it does not matter very much when the alleged offences took place, or whether they occurred before or after he entered our Parliament. What matters is the date on which the waiver of parliamentary immunity was requested. That occurred after Mr Cicciomessere became a Member of this institution. That being so, it follows from our established principles that Mr Cicci omessere enjoys parliamentary immunity. The third and last principle I shall mention is that we must refuse to waive Mr Cicciomessere's immunity because it is evident that his actions in connection with those three demonstrations were activities of a political nature. Mr Cicciomessere took part in those three demonstrations as a prominent member of the Italian Radical Party. He had an absolute right to do so, of course, even if the organisers of those three demon strations had failed to ask the Italian administrative authorities for the necessary authorization. And, in attending those demonstrations, Mr Cicciomessere was engaging in a purely political act. We have always said, and we must assert more strongly than ever, that whenever the actions of which a Member is accused form part, directly or indirectly, of his political activi ties, and whenever his political activities may be affected directly or indirectly, we cannot waive immunity, for the simple reason that we must protect democracy in this House. That is the case in this inst ance. That is why I ask you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to endorse the recommendations of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, which calls on you not to waive Mr Cicciomessere's parliamentary immunity in relation to these three matters and by three separate votes, as I explained at the beginning of my speech. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The joint debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. To vote in favour of the motions for a decision is to vote against the waiving of immunity. (In successive votes Parliament adopted the three deci sions) 4. Regional problems of the French Overseas Departments PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. A 2-250/86) by Mr Ligios, on behalf of the Com mittee on Regional Policy and Regional Planning, on the regional problems of the French Overseas Depart ments (FOD). GADIOUX (S). \u2014 (FR) Briefly, the problems of the French Overseas Departments can be summed up as having an economy requiring large transfers of public funds from metropolitan France, a society character ised by high levels of unemployment, and a rapidly increasing population. Our rapporteur describes this state of affairs in detail in his report. But the report has, above all, at least two major virtues. Firstly, it stresses the need for Community solidarity in relation to the FOD, and secondly, it emphasises the import ance of the FOD for the success of Community policy towards the ACP states. The FOD are therefore not simply beneficiaries of Community solidarity, but an essential element of one of the Community's key poli cies. A major effort must be made to help the FOD, which are an integral part of the French Republic and hence the Community, for their development cannot be left to the mercy of 'laissez faire' economics, which has already shown its inadequacy elsewhere. The rap porteur correctly defines the objectives of such action and the means to be employed. To avoid perpetuating the faults of the existing system, the rapporteur very sensibly stresses the need to develop the indigenous potential of the FOD in accordance with various objectives. The main point is to develop and diversify agricultural production with due regard to its specific characteris tics, particularly in the case of the traditional products: cane sugar and rum. Industrial development must be assisted, too, by encouraging investment to generate employment. It is also necessary to develop fishing and aquaculture and exploit these regions' considerable tourist potential by suitable projects that respect the environment. At the same time, emphasis must be placed on training, particularly for young people and women. Finally \u2014 and here, too, the rapporteur makes specific proposals \u2014 we need to build road infrastructures, improve transport and take energetic action to improve living conditions. If this many-sided policy is implemented properly, we can look forward to significant results in economic and social terms. But resources must be made availabe. The Community and the French Republic have already taken certain measures, and we must not underestimate the efforts that have been made. They have proved insufficient, however, and new approaches must be considered. Firstly, Community policies and regulations must be adapted to the specific circumstances of the FOD. Secondly, and above all, we must take determined action to launch ambitious and consistent multisectoral and multiannual pro grammes established in consultation with the relevant regional authorities and financed with strict adherence to the principle of the additionality of Community assistance. We support the precise and realistic proposals made by our colleague Mr Ligios, and particularly his insistence on the need for coordination between the structural funds, and between those funds and state aid, and his ",
        "11.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/7 Gadioux call for the introduction of adequately funded, inte grated programmes specifically geared to the FOD. We regard it as self-evident that the FOD can legiti mately invoke Community solidarity. It is equally obvious that they enable the Community to safeguard and increase its geopolitical vote. By virtue of their geographical position and their unique ethnic and cul tural heritage \u2014 which must be preserved \u2014 the FOD represent an effective European presence in the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean and South America. Europe's influence in these regions is being chal lenged, however, by the introduction of the US-backed Caribbean Basin Initiative. This 'Reagan Plan', does not only mean increased competition from neighbouring countries for FOD exports, but also, while purporting to be purely economic, is undoubt edly designed to reinforce the dominant political role played by the US in the region to the detriment of Europe. Hence the importance of the rapporteur's comments on the need for cooperation between the FOD and their ACP neighbours, in accordance with Annex VII of the Third ACP-EEC Convention. If such cooperation \u2014 which would be advantageous to all concerned \u2014 is to succeed it must involve joint projects requiring simultaneous intervention by the ERDF, the ESF, the EAGGF Guarantee Section and the EDF. To facilitate such initiatives \u2014 which, at first sight, seem impossible as the regulations stand at pres ent \u2014 certain minor changes need to be made in the rules governing the structural funds. The implementa tion of the Single Act will certainly provide an oppor tunity to do so, provided the will is there. Finally, con sideration should be given to the practicalities of interregional cooperation with Latin American coun tries. If we had to sum up these arguments in a nut shell, we might say that, if the FOD need the Com munity, the Community also needs the FOD. We might speak of reciprocal solidarity. That is what Mr Ligios calls for in his highly commendable report. And that is why the Socialist Group supports him whole heartedly, because that is how we, too, envisage soli darity. GERONTOPOULOS (PPE). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, first of all, on behalf of my parliamentary group I would like to congratulate our colleague Mr Ligios on his report. And this is no mere gesture on my part. It is an acknowledgement of the completeness and serious ness of the report, which can truly serve as a useful research tool, reliable and objective as it is. Thanks to France's Overseas Departments, Europe today continues to maintain a presence in the Indian Ocean and in America. In other words, those Depart ments secure a political and strategic presence which is of the greatest importance to the European Economic Community. However, the situation prevailing in those regions is not at all satisfactory. The coincidence of structural and cyclical unemployment makes for a particularly difficult situation on the job market. Pro fessional training and support for companies from the Social Fund to encourage absorption of the unem ployed, could contribute decisively to the elimination of this problem. But in the farming sector as well, there is great scope for solving the problems faced by the French Overseas Departments. Development of the farming industry combined with a restructuring of the crops cultivated will, I hope, considerably enhance the competitiveness of their products, and contribute to improving and safeguarding farmers' incomes. The dynamic developmental factors in those regions need the support of the European Community, which must not disappoint the citizens who place their trust in it. On the contrary, the integrated programmes cur rently being developed by the Commission which, apart from unemployment, also cover tourism, trans port, infrastructure and services, should guarantee the French Overseas Departments substantial support in the long term adapted to their special geographical, demographic and social features. The centre at Kourou in French Guiana is a character istic example of the way our joint efforts and the European presence can be combined in those regions. To our friends from the French Overseas Departments who are here as observers during this debate, I would like to address not just a welcome, but also a warm message of solidarity. BEAZLEY, Christopher (ED). \u2014 Mr President, on behalf of my group I shoud like to welcome the Ligios report and to confirm that, despite the fact that other Member States of the Community have historically held overseas territories in similar parts of the world to the French Overseas Territories, the different consti tutional development of the French Overseas Territo ries is perfectly understood and acknowledged \u2014 both as referred to in the Treaty and in the subsequent judgments of the Court of Justice. The Ligios report covers the full range of the econo mic and social concerns of the French Overseas Departments. I should just like to touch on a number of them. Firstly, the difficulties caused by the geo graphical distance from the mainland of the Com munity obviously bring into focus the importance of transport links. There was considerable discussion in committee on this subject and a call for liberalization of transport links, particularly with reference to air links. But, of course, there was also considerable res pect for the need to maintain a guaranteed service to the Overseas Territories. Secondly, there is the considerable importance of sugar cane and the production of rum to the econom ies of many of these territories and the call for a relax ation of current regulations, notably in France, in rela tion to quotas. This is supported by my group, but it should be noted that care must be taken that such ",
        "No 2-352/8 Debates of the European Parliament 11.5.87 BEAZLEY relaxation is not prejudicial to other spirits presently consumed in the Community. It is very welcome to see reference to the importance of fisheries in this repon and also to the Ariane project based in French Guiana and to the possibility that the construction of a port in the deep waters of the Cayenne river may be necessi tated by the future development of this project of great importance to the whole Community. Finally, the question of tourism. I think it is essential that this sphere of the economic life of the Overseas Territories be expanded, and not simply for the French-speaking world but for all Member States and all citizens throughout the Community. VERGES (COM). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will allow a Member from one of the overseas departments in question to stress the importance of this debate, which is the first we have ever held on the situation of the overseas departments in the European Economic Community. This debate is important because it gives Parliament the opportunity to take the lead in this area. It is important because it will enable Parliament to state its views in advance of the meeting the French government and the Commis sion are to hold in Brussels in a few weeks' time to dis cuss the same problems. It is important, lastly, because of the challenge the overseas territories will face in connection with the implementation of the Single European Act by 31 December 1992. This, then, is why the chairmen and delegates of the regional coun cils of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and R\u00e9union, together with Members of Parliament \u2014 both deputies and senators \u2014 and representatives of the consular chambers of R\u00e9union, professional organisations and the press, have travelled eight, nine or ten thousand kilometers to listen to the debate this evening and invite you to a reception tomorrow night. I welcome their presence in the gallery as symbolizing the contacts between Europe and the overseas territo ries. (Applause) Mr President, I am not going to deal with all the var ious points made in Mr Ligios' very detailed report, which was the outcome of close and constant coopera tion with the assemblies of the overseas departments and Commission and Parliament staff, and was approved almost unanimously by the Committee on Regional Policy. All I intend to do now is outline the salient features of the current situation. These regions' economic situation is deteriorating yearly as an auto matic consequence of the process of integration, as the figures quoted in the report clearly show. At present the FOD are experiencing growth without real development, a situation characterised by a low vol ume of exports and increasingly large injections of public funds which are not, however, having a pump- priming effect on the productive sectors. All the economic and social indicators are sounding alarm bells, and the FOD are still among the least favoured regions of the EEC. Per capita GDP is less than 40% of that in metropolitan France. Unemployment stands at over 30% in all the overseas departments, while the ratio of exports to imports varies from 10 to 24%. The economic structures of the FOD, like those of the developing countries, are uncoordinated and depend ent on external factors. They suffer from multiple han dicaps, including their remote position and island sta tus, a disproportionately large services sector, a low level of industrialization, and climatic features such as the cyclones to which they are regularly subject. Their human and natural resources have been badly used, or underexploited. The regional authorities are at a loss to deal with such problems as the large proportion of young people in all these regions, the population explosion in R\u00e9union, and an unemployment rate of between 30 and 49% of the working population. We must take action quickly, taking a broad view of pres ent circumstances and future prospects. The deterior ating economic and social situation of the FOD has not been fully appreciated yet either in Paris or Brus sels. The striking disparities that have always existed between the FOD and metropolitan France in the social field amount to fullscale discrimination, with wages and social benefits being lower in the FOD than in France, for example. In the Community context, the FOD are classified as top priority areas, but are not covered by all Com munity legislation. Thus between 1982 and 1985 there was a sizeable reduction of 25% in structural aid. This drop was particularly noticeable in the case of the ERDF, which fell from 137 m ECU in 1982 to only a sixth, 22 m ECU, in 1986. So this debate is timely, particularly in view of the fact that the overseas departments are likely to bear the full brunt of the implementation of the single market by 1992. Exceptional circumstances demand exceptional measures. Priority must be given to ensuring that the special status of the FOD within the EEC is recog nised, with regard to both the application of Com munity regulations and the preservation of certain special measures and exemptions, particularly in rela tion to tax. Here let me say that it is imperative to maintain exist ing provisions with regard to the definition and taxa tion of rum in order to protect cane sugar production in the FOD, in whose economy it still plays an essen tial role. This point is not contained in the Ligios report, which failed to incorporate the specific amend ment I tabled in committee. This is a major point of disagreement. Instead of vainly attempting to alleviate the effects of underdevelopment by injections of public money, we must atteck its root causes by ensuring the FOD play a decisive role in their own development. The main thrust of our efforts must be to upgrade the import ance of the regions' agricultural resources, both in ",
        "11.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2\u00ad352/9 Verges relation to existing crops and through diversification, and access to the Community market must be encour\u00ad aged. The potential of fisheries and tourism should not be overlooked, and the same applies to local industry, particularly since the Reagan plan for the Caribbean threatens to increase competition to the detriment of the overseas departments. There is an urgent need to reverse the sharp fall in the structural funds and improve their effectiveness. The best way of doing this, surely, would be to introduce special integrated programmes or IPFODs financed from the existing structural funds and a special budget heading, on the lines of the IMPs. The Ligios report rightly stresses the need for increased regional cooperation with neighbouring countries. There is an urgent need to move from words to action and launch some concrete exercises in mutually beneficial cooperation to enable the FOD to emerge from the stage of bilateral relations conducted almost exclusively with metropolitan France and the EEC and play their rightful role in the development process with other countries in the same geographical region. For this to happen, practical solutions must be found to the distortions of competition that are cur\u00ad rently adversely affecting the FOD in certain very spe\u00ad cific areas of their relations with neighbouring ACP states. I offer this analysis of the situation and these propo\u00ad sals, which generally chime in with those in the Ligios report, in the hope that today's debate will lead to the Community taking concrete legislative or financial measures to enable the overseas departments to stand up to the impact of 1992 and remedy the root causes of their underdevelopment. Let us never forget that, by virtue of their geographi\u00ad cal situation and influence, the overseas departments offer France more than they cost her, as the French government officially recognised recently. Let us ensure that Europe shows that it, too, is aware of that fact. PRESIDENT. \u2014 May I add my very warm welcome to yours, Mr Verges, to our friends who have come so far from the French Overseas Departments to listen to this very important debate. (Applause) TOURRAIN (RDE). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, this is the first time that Parliament has had occasion to discuss the general situation of the overseas departments in relation to the Community. We congratulate Mr Ligios on his interesting report, his lucid analysis and his realistic proposals. The situation of the overseas departments is serious and disturbing. Their economy is artificial, their economic and social systems severely imbalanced. This applies, for example, to their balance of payments: FF 3 000 million in exports as against FF 21 000 million in imports. It also applies to unemployment, which has doubled over the last five years; the unemployment rate is now three times as high as in metropolitan France and the Community average, and will probably get even worse, since almost 50% of the population is under the age of 20 compared to 30% in metropolitan France. France has made considerable efforts to remedy this very difficult situation, as the rapporteur emphasises. In 1987 alone, state spending on the FOD accounted for FF 15 000 million, to which should be added a fur\u00ad ther FF 5 000 million in various fiscal exemptions, mainly with regard to VAT, which of course render meaningless the figures for GDP per capita. On 31 December of last year, the French government passed a five\u00adyear framework law that will have a significant impact on the FOD. FF 3 000 million in extra funds will be allocated to them to encourage economic development, youth employment, mobility, and pro\u00ad gress towards parity with metropolitan France in gen\u00ad eral social terms. In the case of housing, which accounts for FF 1 000 million of this programme, an extra 1 000 million francs in funding will make these provisions exceptionally far\u00adreaching. However valiant the efforts made by France, they can\u00ad not enable these departments' economic level to be raised very far \u25a0\u2014 or very permanently \u2014 towards the Community average. So it is necessary both to increase Community aid available under the structural funds and to draw up development programmes, particularly integrated programmes specially designed for the FOD, or IPFOD's, and to implement as a matter of urgency the integrated development programmes under consideration at present. In addition to increased aid, it is also imperative to provide better protection for these departments' agricultural prod\u00ad ucts, which are their only resources, particularly as they are seriously threatened by the Reagan plan for the Carribbean. Our group would like to take this opportunity to emphasise most strongly the need to upgrade rum production in the FOD, support the production of traditional rums and ensure that suitable fiscal arrangements are applied. We also wish to ensure that banana production, which accounts for 40% of the Antilles' agriculture, is able to stand up to pressure from the American multinationals and penetrate the European market. These distant departments are of vital strategic importance to Europe. Kourou, the launch site for the European space shuttle, proves the point. Finally, let us not forget that these departments extend the sphere of French and European influence into America and the Indian Ocean. Our duty of soli\u00ad darity towards them accords with the interests of the European Community as a whole. (Applause from the right) ",
        "No 2-352/10 Debates of the European Parliament 11.5.87 IN THE CHAIR: MR SEEFELD Vice-President VANDEMEULEBROUCKE (ARC). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate Mr Ligios. This report presents a very clear picture of the rather precarious situation of the French overseas departments. The average income is scarcely a third of the average gross national product in France, and there is no end of discrimination, as indeed has been so well explained to us today by Mr Verges. The European programmes are therefore an absolute necessity in the most diverse economic areas and also at the level of infrastructure. But above all, these programmes must not in the first instance be conceived in Paris or Brussels. The very necessary endogenous development of these areas must as a mat ter of priority be devised and implemented through the people responsible in the departments concerned. Only then is sensible integrated management possible. The programmes must also respect unconditionally the eth nic differences of these regions. Furthermore, it is highly desirable that the Ligios report should be com plemented by a report on the French overseas territo ries. This report really anticipates the memorandum from the French government to the European Commission. Therefore, I should like to ask the Commission to assess this report together with the memorandum and to act upon it. I should further like to point out that there is a plan to give the French merchant fleet exclusive rights to pro vide services between France and the overseas depart ments. This contravenes the Treaty of Rome. I shall wholeheartedly support the Ligios report, but I would ask the Commission to examine it together with the memorandum from the French government and to report to us on the matter afterwards. GAUCHER (DR). \u2014 (FR) The Group of the Euro pean Right intends to make a number of comments on Mr Ligios' proposals and submit amendments to them. Our first point, which I consider the most important, is that it must be clearly stated that the fact that the European Community is introducing a regional pro gramme for the benefit of these territories must not jeopardise French sovereignty over them in any way. The second point, following on from the first, is that France possesses exceptional strategic interests in these regions, which contribute to the preservation of world peace and must not be called into question either. Thirdly, I wish to draw attention to the fact that one speaker mentioned that the standard of living in the FODs is lower than that found in most departments of metropolitan France. That is true, but it should also be said that their standard of living is markedly higher than that of the independent \u2014 or supposedly inde pendent \u2014 Caribbean countries, such as Haiti or Cuba. In the case of Cuba, Mr Verges must be just about the only person not to have noticed that fact. The fourth point \u2014 which has been made already, but I should like to emphasise \u2014 is that the planned con struction of a launch site for the Ariane rocket in French Guiana is extremely important and could make a major contribution to the development of that coun try by attracting European technicians and workers and simultaneously helping to improve local living standards. Finally, we believe that there must be no question of involving Cuba's Communist r\u00e9gime in this development programme, as it would inevitably be a destabilizing factor. That is why we shall submit six amendments. (Applause from the Group of the European Right) LIGIOS (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I should like first of all to extend a very warm welcome, as the President of the European Parliament and another speaker have already done, to the representa tives of the FOD who are in the Chamber to follow our deliberations. Their presence is further proof of their faith in us and our support of disadvantaged regions in the Community, particularly their depart ments. I thank them for the very extensive assistance which they gave to the Committee on Regional Affairs when it went to R\u00e9union and to me in my capacity as rap porteur when I went to the departments in the Carib bean. I benefited from their experience, and they prov ided me with all the information I needed to prepare my report. I should also like to thank the speakers, all of whom expressed satisfaction with my report \u2014 Mr Gadioux, who spoke on behalf of the Socialist Group, all the others, and Mr Verges, who went into the details of my report. I do not quite understand the remarks made just now by the Member of the Group of the European Right. Nobody is disputing the fact that these departments are in every respect French territory \u2014 I certainly did not dispute it in my report. We agree wholeheartedly that the standard of living in these departments is much higher than in the ACP countries or at any rate than in neighbouring countries. The comparison, Mr Gaucher, is not to be made with these countries, but within the regions of the Community. I have attempted to the best of my ability to do this in my report. There are several legal questions, Mr President, con nected with proposals in my report, which I think I should reiterate here, if I may. We must base our act- ",
        "11.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/11 Ligios ion on legal facts. First of all, the decision of the Court of Justice in 1978, the Hansen judgment affirmed once and for all the principle that all measures adopted in accordance with the Treaty of Rome are applicable in the overseas departments, save as otherwise provided. Since there is no other provision in any of the Com munity instruments, it is obvious that the instruments at our disposal can and must apply in these overseas territories. The second legal question, which has been referred to by several Members, relates to Annex VII to the Third Lom\u00e9 Convention, which entered into force on 1 May 1986. It encourages closer regional cooperation between the French FOD and overseas countries and territories and the neighbouring ACP countries, in their respective geographical areas, in the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean. These are outlying regions of the European Community, Community territories spread over various continents, under-developed in relation to the Community aver age and therefore needing the assistance and financial support of the Community. To give you an idea the level of these under-developed regions \u2014 or disadvantaged zones, to put it more midly \u2014 I shall simply quote you some figures. The overall ratio of imports to exports \u2014 this was referred to by a previous speaker \u2014 amounts to 10.08% in R\u00e9union; 14.35% in Guadeloupe; 15.15% in French Guiana and 22.57% in Martinique. These figures allow one to deduce the amount of subsidies given to these territories by metropolitan France to meet their needs. The gross domestic product per capita in these depart ments amounted, in 1984, \u2014 these are the only recent figures I have \u2014 to roughly 37.5% of the average for metropolitan France, while that of the most disadvan taged region in metropolitan France, the Limousin, amounts to 77% of the Community average. It is obvious therefore that we are dealing with Community regions which, like many others, are under-developed. Time does not allow me, Mr President, to go into the details or explore in depth the causes and characteris tics of this under-development. It is enough to think of the dramatic proportions of the level of unemploy ment, on average above 30%. Unfortunately, by the way, these are 1984 figures. Today, in several regions even within the Community here in Europe we are set to reach this figure. I come from an under-developed region \u2014 in my province the level of unemployment is 25 per cent. This is the dramatic situation affecting us all, and I am saying this in solidarity with members and friends from the departments, to make them understand how much I am aware of their problems and the extent to which I uphold their demands, which were so well presented. These problems stem from their great distance from metropolitan France and the European Community, of which they are, I repeat, an integral part. In the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy and in my opinion, economic and social development in various sectors for several years is justified and imperative, and should be implemented with the help of the Community and the national authorities. To tell the truth there has already been significant assistance in the past, but it should in future be more suitable and better coordinated than it has been. On the basis of studies and concrete initiatives already begun in the departments themselves in cooperation with each other \u2014 this I was able to see for myself \u2014 and the Commission, it is necessary to define pro grammes of Community interest and integrated development operations, and coordinate them and, where necessary, extend them, with the agreement of and on the basis of recommendations from the Euro pean Regional Development Fund. These programmes should comprehensively tackle both problems common to all the FOD, or some of them, and the problems which are specific to each department on account of its geographical situation. Aid from all the Community financial instruments should be coordinated as far as possible. The proximity of the FOD, Mr President, to different ACP countries and the economic and cultural ties sometimes existing between them as well as the com plementary nature of their production require a more precise application of Annex VII to the Lom\u00e9 Conven tion, as has been called for here. This has not hitherto been properly implemented. I believe, Mr President, that our efforts have already had some positive effects. The French government has already presented a third document to the Commis sion. There have already been initiatives from the French government and the Community, which I believe will bring about a speedier solution to these problems. (Applause) VANLERENBERGHE (PPE). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the French contingent of the European People's Party finds much of this report very interesting, for it con tains the first general assessment of the situation of the overseas departments in relation to the Community. We congratulate Mr Ligios most warmly on his work. The report is also timely because, apart from the struc tural problems mentioned by many speakers \u2014 the balance of payments deficit, the alarmingly high level of endemic unemployment \u2014 the overseas depart ments are currently coping with a double crisis. Firstly, Spanish and Portuguese accession to the EEC has resulted in competition from within the Community with regard to some agricultural products hitherto produced only in the overseas departments. Secondly, the Caribbean territories are having to face the conse quences of the Reagan plan to develop that region. ",
        "No 2-352/12 Debates of the European Parliament 11.5. 87 Vanlerenberghe The economies of the overseas departments, therefore, are having to face up to increased competition from their Caribbean neighbours. The difference in the sta tus of the FOD compared to the ACP states was of no great consequence while the ACP countries' export capacity remained low. But the Reagan plan threatens to develop that capacity, and then ACP products will have free access to the Community market. The Ligios report offers good proposals concerning these problems on the whole, but we feel some com ments are called for. In the case of rum, in particular, the trend of the market is towards diversification in type and quality, but it is essential for rum production in the FOD to remain a priority and be developed in future. We must, therefore, protect Caribbean rum production by drawing up a Community definition of the product and applying appropriate fiscal measures. In the case of forestry, the report argues that only the big companies are capable of carrying out every phase of the wood production process and exploiting the Amazonian forest both profitably and rationally. Yet experience has shown the failure of such firms to adapt to the production of multipurpose materials and the changing economic and technical features of a vol atile market to which smaller undertakings can adjust more successfully. The draft report is also silent on the subject of quality products such as vanilla and essential oils of geranium and v\u00e9tiver, although they are a not inconsiderable source of revenue in the case of R\u00e9union, where they involve 2 600 farms and 2 850 hectares, mainly in mountainous areas where the range of crops is limited. But the main problem is the low living standards of these departments compared to metropolitan France and the European average. France has made a consi derable effort to improve their economic and social circumstances. We must welcome the fact that the Community, via its various funds and policies, is con tributing, as a matter of priority and more effectively than hitherto, to measures which comprehensively tac kle both the problems common to all FOD or some of them, and the problems which are specific to each individual department. We hope that Community assistance to the FOD will be additional to the aid provided by the national auth orities and will not be paid to the latter as a form of partial reimbursement for that aid. To conclude, Mr President, the FOD are, by virtue of their peripheral position, outposts of the European Community which can become centres of influence and propagation of European achievements in such diverse fields as agronomy, alternative energy, aqua- culture, protection against diseases and vocational training, thus contributing to the human, social and economic development of the surrounding regions. The Community has an appointment to keep with the FOD. The Community must help turn them into a showcase for European civilisation in those distant oceans. (Applaus from the centre) TELK\u00c4MPER (ARC). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, our criticism of the Ligios report is not levelled at any of its detailed recommendations but rather at its seem ingly obvious requirement that the French overseas departments should be treated like any European region, and the objective of the report, which is to ensure equal treatment for these territories within the framework of the EEC. In our opinion, it must on the contrary be the primary objective of the European Parliament to contribute as far as possible to the rapid completion of the decoloni zation process and to assist overseas peoples and their freedom movements to recover successfully their sov ereignty and right to self-determination. Europe's desire to be present in space with the Ariane rocket is no argument against the irrevocable human right, of the Chinese for example, to sovereignty and self- determination. As a European Parliament, a gathering of freely elected representatives of those States who invaded what we now call the Third World, bringing colonial wars, slave trading and exploitation, it is our prime responsibility to carry through the demands of the D\u00e9claration des droits de l'homme of the French Revo lution, which have not yet been met. PFEIFFER, Member of the Commission. (DE) \u2014 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy and Regional Plan ning and especially the rapporteur, Mr Ligios, for this comprehensive report on the problems of overseas departments. The report presents an accurate analysis of the situation of the FOD and a series of noteworthy suggestions. These overseas regions, which are a part of this Community, are at a serious disadvantage on account of many factors, which were mentioned indi vidually in the report and were also referred to several times during the debate. Structural weaknesses lead to a huge deficit in the balance of trade, and on the whole, harmonious economic development in the regions is clearly rendered difficult. The Commission is fully aware of the difficult and multifarious problems facing the FOD and is prepared to contribute to their solution. With this in mind therefore it set up a working party for these regions last September, which covered various Directorates General and which is to coordinate work in the Com mission services and administrative contacts in national and local centres. These groups have started working, and I hope that within this framework satisfactory solutions will be found for many of the problems already referred to. ",
        "11.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/13 Pfeiffer I should like to deal with the question of regional policy in a little more detail. The FOD have in the past received substantial grants from the European Regional Fund and are among those regions receiving most aid. Reductions in grants from the European Regional Fund in recent years can mainly be attributed to a reduction in the demand for aid. The Commission is prepared to assist these regions with generous aid from the structural fund. A pre-requisite for this is however a proper request for aid. An example of future-orientated regional policy mea sures is the planned integrated development on R\u00e9u nion, which is currently being examined. Community resources together with national and local resources from the private and public sectors can be imple mented and concentrated to reduce the particular dis advantages of the region. Measures will concentrate on three main areas: economic structure, living condi tions and the foundations for technical and economic progress. The Commission services responsible have undertaken to reach a decision on this matter before the autumn. Finally, may I on behalf of the Commission extend a very warm welcome to the representatives of the departments present here. I should like to assure them all that the Commission is aware of the particularly difficult problems facing these regions and will do everything in its power to contribute to the gradual improvement of this difficult situation. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. (Parliament adopted the resolution) 5. Introduction of common border posts PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. A 2-34/87) by Mr Rogalla, on behalf of the Com mittee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Indus trial Policy, on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (COM (86) 524 final \u2014 Doc. C 2-138/ 86) for a regulation on the abolition of exit formalities at internal Community frontiers \u2014 introduction of common border posts. ROGALLA (S), rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that after this important report on the external regions of the Com munity, which has just been voted, we can now speak about the internal area of the Community. We have the opportunity this week to deal with the tiresome subject of frontier checks, that is the integration of frontier checks. There has been a single customs terri tory in the Community since 27.9.1968, for almost twenty years, and in spite of this, numerous checks are carried out on both sides of several internal frontiers. We are concerned in this report with the dismantling of the chaos in the customs union, which is incompre hensible to the people, and the ultimate recognition of the single customs territory, which has existed since 1968. For this reason also I have displayed for all to see these barriers, which are my trademark, so that you may have an idea of the extent of the delay which the Community is responsible for in this matter. The customs union is the workshop of the Com munity, as Article 9 of the EEC Treaty indicates. It is the precursor of what in the meantime has become known as the 'internal market', which is the centre piece of the Community. It should be completed by 1992 and finally give satisfaction to those waiting for the promises of the Treaty to be fulfilled, that is those at a social disadvantage and those who hope to benefit from economic and political cooperation. The internal market is a goal for all the people of this Community, a goal whose date, 1992, was cleverly chosen \u2014 it is neither too far away nor so near as to frighten people with the prospect of the changes con nected with it. In the realization of the internal market the Community will have to show unity for the first time. It is so to speak the journeyman-work, which this Community must produce as a sign of political and economic maturity, a journeyman-work, which also allows the Community to take a creditable place on the international scene, where it has other goals, for example in Geneva, Reykjavik, at GATT negotia tions or at the United Nations. The internal market must be accompanied by social measures. In the Community we must achieve a bal ance of interest between north and south in a spirit of peaceful collaboration. This is a task which we must all undertake. The social components of the internal mar ket, as stated in Article 117 et sev of the EEC Treaty, must under no circumstances be called into question. First and foremost there must be a balanced and coordinated employment policy, and also financial aid for re-training schemes, Community participation in the provision of alternative employment and the regional policy. When I say that we are concerned here with the jour neyman-work of the Community, then it is no surprise that the European Parliament has for many years had the internal market as its main goal and has ensured that the heads of state and of government were in the meantime working towards 1992 as a suitable date. All the EEC bodies together, the Commission, the Euro pean Parliament and the Council are called upon to show the political will which is the only guarantee that this goal will be reached. This Report presents in detail a little 'frontier practice', a little of everyday life. It means getting away from 'good' old habits, the many checks at internal frontiers. It is obvious once again here that progress, which we all want in the interest of our people, is naturally bound to technical details. ",
        "No 2-352/14 Debates of the European Parliament 11.5.87 Rogalla The dismantling of remaining frontier formalities should be made easier through the provision of a sin gle operation by the frontier authorities. Frontier for malities should be so coordinated as to necessitate not two stops but one \u2014 if at all. Nevertheless the single operation of the frontier authorities must eventually be replaced by no operation at all! This proposal is a stop-gap measure pending the aboli tion by 1992 of checks in intra-Community trade. Therefore, in Amendment No. 4 we have attached much importance to the provision of a report every year to the European Parliament on the progress achieved hitherto. Why is this proposal only being made today? As the old adage says, better late than never! Since some Members from different groups and of different nationalities last week quoted from the Loreley, a poem by Heinrich Heine, I should also like to say something: I do not understand why the Commission should only come up with this proposal today. I do not understand why in a customs union something should be set up with a directive, backed up by Article 235 of the EEC Treaty, which is already laid down in Article 9, dealing with customs union. I do not know either why the Commission is troubled with a preface to Article 235, when Article 9 is an already sufficient legal safeguard. You must surely be aware that the European Court of Justice in a recent case dealing with trade policy sup ported the Commission's theory that it was not Article 100 of the EEC Treaty that had to be chosen unani mously as a legal base, but the relevant functional Articles on trade policy, Articles 113 and 115 respec tively. Allow me to point out that the Single European Act was applied here for the first time. Our committee pre pared a so-called legislative decision. In paragraph 2 the Commission is called upon to inform Parliament of its opinion on the amendments \u2014 which in any case can only come about when the Single European Act comes into force. I hope that this new step on the way to a common internal market will receive the recognition from the public that it deserves. We are working constructively and on a step by step basis, and we regret that so much time has been lost. CORNELISSEN (PPE). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to make three important points. First, I agree with the abolition of exit formalities at internal Community frontiers. This will certainly lead to a reduction in delays at internal frontiers. This is urgently needed, because frontier checks are taking up much time and costing an enor mous amount of money. The costs of these frontier formalities and the ensuing delays amount to no less than 100 million guilders a day, that is approximately 35 000 million guilders a year. That is money down the drain! By way of a comparison: 35 000 million guilders is approximately a quarter of the much- maligned agricultural expenditure. Second, I should like to point out the serious consequ ences attendant on delays at internal frontiers. I am thinking mainly of the rush of many lorry drivers to make up lost time. This is understandable. It is essen tial that many products such as flowers, meat, vegeta bles should be delivered on time. Naturally, this rush is very serious from the social point of view as well as from the point of view of road safety. This sort of situ ation also invites undesirable practices, as for example the payment of bribes. I have proof of this. I would ask for concentration on all the formalities to be carried out at different frontier crossings and also that impor tant border posts should be kept open 24 hours a day. Is the Commission prepared to inform Parliament of the situation with regard to this? Third, a remark about the future of border posts. I wish to oppose the idea that these are doomed to dis appear. I do not agree with this either. Of course, checks which are connected with the internal market must be abolished. These however are only part of the activities at border posts. I see wonderful possibilities for further growth of activities as transport, trans shipment and distribution centres. In this way a posi tive contribution can be made to employment oppor tunities in frontier areas. This is necessary because in many cases unemployment is rather high there. Briefly, Mr President, this proposal is a good way for ward. The Council must adopt it quickly. We shall all benefit from it. There will be less exasperation, less delay and more savings. The money is so to speak for the taking in Europe, and this is important, especially since Europe is currently going through a financial crisis. (Applause) CASSIDY (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on a very thorough job, as one would expect from someone with Mr Rogalla's background. We speak in English of the poacher turned gamekee per. I think in the case of Mr Rogalla it is the game keeper turned poacher because he is a former customs man now devoted to trying to find ways around cus toms barriers. We all support him in that. You might think it odd that an Englishman should get up to speak on this particular subject but we do have internal frontiers in the United Kingdom. We have a frontier, for example, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. And other Members of our group, our Danish Members, have a frontier with Ger many while our Spanish Members have frontiers with both Portugal and France. So this is a matter of some ",
        "11.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/15 Cassidy concern to my group. There is, of course, regret that the Commission has not been able to go further with this proposal. It only relates, sad to say, to goods whereas in the United Kingdom and in my own group we would like to see relaxations apply to the move ment of people as well. To that extent I must say that we ought all to be aware, Mr President, that the Bri tish Government has just decided to set an example by doing away with outgoing passport checks for Euro pean Community citizens and replacing them merely with spot checks. This example might fittingly be fol lowed by other Member States, particularly the Mem ber State which currently has the Presidency of the Council, Belgium, whose outgoing passport checks at Brussels are quite disgraceful. Therefore my group supports unhesitatingly this report and we hope it will be adopted with no one against it. DELOROZOY (LDR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the formalities required on crossing the Community's internal frontiers must be counted among the technical barriers to the free movement of goods and of persons, as we have just been reminded. We have before us today a proposal for a Council regulation, submitted by the Commission for Parlia ment's consideration, which is intended to mark a fur ther step towards the simplification of formalities con cerning the movement of goods by providing for a single operation by the relevant authorities at the off ice of entry into or exit from a Member State. We know that circumstances do not yet permit free move ment without any formalities. That is the objective of the single European market to be established by the Single European Act. As matters stand, therefore, we are in favour of the proposed transitional arrange ments. But we wish to stress that we consider there could be some ambiguity in law with regard to the legal basis of the proposed text. The rapporteur, Mr Rogalla, refers to this possibility himself. He disagrees with the Commission on the interpretation of Articles 3c and 9 et seq.. That is why we have tabled an amend ment referring also to Articles 8a and 100a of the Single Act. There is another point on which we disagree with the position adopted by the rapporteur, Mr Rogalla, which is paradoxically at variance with his constant and often passionate advocacy of the removal of fron tiers, even if that will mean giving up the little barriers he erects whenever he speaks in this House. We pro pose reinstating in the text of the regulation the terms 'office of entry' and Office of exit' instead of 'frontier offices', for we want to see the removal of internal frontiers. It is to avoid perpetuating the existence of frontier posts that we ask Parliament to join with us in voting against amendments 2, 3 and 4 in Mr Rogalla's report. Finally, I should like to ask the Commission to clarify exactly what it means by the term 'regularly' in con nection with the forwarding of documents and reports under Article 6. It is important that the time limits for doing so should not be too long, so that action taken as a result of these measures can be supervised prop erly in this transitional period. To conclude, I appeal for these new provisions to be implemented as rapidly as possible, in other words by the end of this year at the latest, with no further exten sions being granted. The internal market will become a reality if the neces sary texts can be adopted in quick succession in token of a genuine political will to make further progress towards this goal with every passing day, week and month from now until 1992. PEGADO LIZ (RDE). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first let me say that the Commission could have found no-one in Parliament more able than the rapporteur, Mr Rogalla, to put the case for the proposal to abolish certain formalities at frontier crossings that we are debating today. And we should give full backing to the Commission's proposal for a regulation as amended by the Committee on Econo mic Affairs. But it is important to remember that the ultimate goal, enshrined in the White Paper, of mak ing the internal market a reality by 1992 is conditional on the complete abolition of frontier controls within the Community. Unfortunately the implementation of the European Single Act is delayed, but it is explicitly laid down in Article 8A that the internal market should comprise an area without customs frontiers. This clearly means that the easing and simplification of frontier formalities must be regarded as a purely tem porary measure. They cannot be seen as a substitute for the complete abolition of customs barriers within the Community, or as grounds for putting off the decisions needed to harmonize consumer taxes and level out the tax burden on companies, which is the only way to ensure fair and equal competitive condi tions throughout the Community. So, taking into account the implementation of the Single Act, with reference to Article 8A and para graph 1 of Article 100A of the Single Act, I fully agree with the rapporteur's suggestion for altering the legal basis of the proposal for a regulation. This regulation should be adopted to the extent that it is in line with complete abolition of fiscal barriers, as a condition for achieving the internal market. Furthermore, if the Committee on Economic Affairs had consulted the Commitee on Legal Affairs, as it might well have done, that Committee would certainly have supported its position. We should also support his amendments specifying the strictly temporary character of these measures and stipulating that they shall only apply until the date for the final completion of the internal market. By the same token, we are suggesting \u2014 and ",
        "No 2-352/16 Debates of the European Parliament 11.5.87 Pegado Liz this is my last point \u2014 a slight change in the working, which seems to us more in line with the spirit of the rapporteur's own amendment, and which we hope Parliament will adopt. SUTHERLAND, Member of the Commission. \u2014 Mr President, may I first of all thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy \u2014 and especially the rapporteur, Mr Rogalla \u2014 and the Committee on Transport for supporting this pro posal and for their continued support for Commission initiatives to streamline and simplify internal frontier formalities and controls in intra-Community trade, pending their complete abolition by 1992. The particular proposal we are examining today would abolish the remaining administrative checks on such goods and their means of transport on leaving a Mem ber State und replace them by a single operation at the point of entry in the Member State whose territory the vehicle is entering. As presented, this proposal should also meet with the approval of the Heads of State and Government who at their meeting in Fontainebleau in 1984 specifically called for the completion of formali ties at a single frontier post. As I mentioned, this pro posal is a stopgap measure, but it is an important one. The inconvenience and unnecessary cost to Com munity transporters and businesses of having to clear their goods both on exit from and entry to a Member State are well-known. The Commission's proposals would make such duplication a thing of the past and should produce considerable savings in time and money. It would also enable customs administrations of the Member States to begin progressively to rede ploy their staff away from internal Community fron tiers. In doing so it would ease the transition to the situation in 1992 when there will no longer be any controls or checks at Community internal frontiers. I should like to turn now to the nine amendments pro posed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Amendments Nos 1, 8 and 9 concern the legal basis which has also been referred to in the course of the debate. The Commission has based its proposal solely on Article 235 since the advice from the legal service is that Articles 3(c) et seq. of the Treaty do not confer specific powers for action and that such specific powers are of course required by this proposal. As soon as the Single Act enters into application the Commission will propose substituting Article 100A for Article 235. We cannot, of course, however, refer to the Single Act before it is ratified. With regard to Amendments Nos 2 and 3, there is no fundamental difference of opinion between Parliament and Commission. However, the terminology used in the current proposal reflects that used in several other Community acts and it seems therefore to the Com mission to be preferable. In order to avoid confusion and misinterpretation, therefore we would suggest that it should not be changed. Turning to Amendment No 4, the Commission does, in fact, submit to Parliament and Council each year a progress repon on the implementation of the White Paper on the completion of the internal market. The first such report was published in May last year. The second will shortly be submitted formally to Parlia ment. In addition to providing an overall picture of developments within the Community's three main institutions, the Commission's annual reports specifi cally review progress made on important proposals, such as the one we are examining today. A separate report in addition to this, as this amendment proposes, would simply duplicate this and is not, therefore, necessary. The time limit of 31 December 1992 proposed in Amendments Nos 5 and 6 is the deadline specifically set in the Single European Act for completion of the internal market, that is, an area without internal fron tiers. The transitional procedures in this proposal and in existing Community legislation will clearly have no future in an internal market which has no internal frontiers. But there is no need in law to lay down the date on which this or other proposed legislation will expire. As I have said, the deadline of 31 December 1992 for the completion of the internal market is fixed in express terms in the Single European Act. It is not necessary therefore to mirror this provision in the way Amendment No 5 proposes. Mr Cornelissen asked about progress on improving procedures at customs posts. A modification to the rel evant directive as adopted by Council last December which will improve the situation. We are examining what more can be done to make further improve ments. With regard to the question relating to the use of the word 'regularly' in Article 6; this I think is something which depends on the actual needs at the time and one cannot define specifically what regular reporting in that context should mean. I would hope that in the light of the explanations I have given, Parliament will be prepared to lend its sup port to the Commission's proposal. I should again like to thank all of those who have been concerned in this debate and particularly Mr Rogalla for his consistent and very obvious interest in this subject. I hope that the successful conclusion of this proposal will allow him to remove at least one of the barriers which is in front of him on his desk. (Applause) PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. Explanations of vote TAYLOR (DR). \u2014 Mr President, I welcome this report by Mr Rogalla and in particular the emphasis ",
        "11.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2\u00ad352/17 Taylor placed on the point that the only examinations will take place at the point of entry into each of the twelve countries in the European Community. However, I live a few miles from an international bor\u00ad der, the one between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland \u2014 and there are several points I wish to make, particularly since this border was referred to by Mr Cassidy on behalf of the European Democratic Group. One thing which was not clarified during this debate was whether or not there were going to be standard signs at all frontier posts. That had been reported in the international press when this regulation was first proposed. But there was no reference to that during this debate. That would have to be clarified before I could actually support the motion before the House. The second thing is that it is well documented that the border between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, to which Mr Cassidy referred is wide open and controlled by terrorists who use it to cross into Northern Ireland to kill many of my constituents. But we are not talking today about terrorists crossing the border, we are talking about goods. The trouble, inso\u00ad far as goods are concerned, is that that international border is not controlled by the United Kingdom auth\u00ad orities. The United Kingdom only provides customs supervision for a few hours per day. For the rest of the day the frontier is left open. There is much smuggling and much abuse amounting to millions of pounds of Community funds because of the failure of the United Kingdom to control that international boundary. It has been reported in the press that although this regulation is about to be approved by Parliament and the Council, the United Kingdom has already made it known that it will not honour the regulation. Unless that can be corrected and unless the Commissioner can give an assurance to this effect, I would not feel bound to support the motion before the House. PEARCE (ED). \u2014 Mr President, there are many other borders in the Community besides that between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This is a technical motion, but it gets to the heart of the Euro\u00ad pean Community \u2014 the Common Market. It is the thing that brings us all here \u2014 the creation of one market in western Europe. I thought we would hear today some signs of progress, of challenge and of driving towards the future that would show the progress that has been made \u2014 and I have not heard that. I remind myself of the fact that when I came across the bridge today at Kehl the tail\u00ad back of lorries was right across the bridge into Ger\u00ad many. I remind myself that the last time I went into the port of Ramsgate in the UK every single car on the ship I was on was stripsearched \u2014 the cars, not the people. Every single car had everything taken out of it \u2014 panels and everything. Why? I think it was a train\u00ad ing exercise for the British customs! Mr Rogalla talked about a litmus test. We have failed the litmus test. In thirty\u00adone years we have not prod\u00ad uced a common market. The people who have failed the litmus test are in the Commission. I thought we would hear stirring words today \u2014 stirring words about the new united Europe. What we heard was rather like a parish council debating admission to the village f\u00eate. We have failed. We should criticise the Commission. \u039b has failed. RAFTERY (PPE), in writing. \u2014 I welcome the Com\u00ad mission proposal and Mr Rogalla's report. In calling for an end to exit formalities at internal frontiers \u2014 with the only stopping point being at the point of entry \u2014 the Commission is making a wel\u00ad come move towards the completion of the internal market. However, as Mr Rogalla points out, the measures which remain are still too much, and this present pro\u00ad posal must only be seen as a temporary measure pend\u00ad ing the ending of all such controls in 1992. This leads me to two points. Firstly, the controls applied to ordinary travellers are still too severe. Ques\u00ad tions by officials regarding destination, purpose of visit, etc. are all too common at both exit and entry points for intra\u00adCommunity travellers. The Commis\u00ad sion must also act in this area. Secondly, I have to say to Mr Rogalla that the points he makes about using Articles 8A and 100A of the Sin\u00ad gle Act as a legal basis for the Commission's proposal, rather than Article 235 of the EEC Treaty, are to be welcomed. These articles provide for Community act\u00ad ion on the basis of qualified majority in cooperation with the European Parliament, rather than requiring unanimity. In other words, using the Single Act 'to ensure the smoother functioning of the Communities by enabling the institutions to exercise their powers under conditions most in keeping with Community interest'. However, unfortunately, I would also have to point out to Mr Rogalla that none of this can come to pass unless Ireland is able to ratify the Single Act. We in this Parliament must therefore in the coming weeks do all in our power to demonstrate to the Irish people the true purpose of the Single Act, which is the 'smoother functioning' of the Community \u2014 some\u00ad thing which is in the interests of every Member State, including Ireland. (Parliament adopted the resolution) ",
        "No 2-352/18 Debates of the European Parliament 11.5.87 6. Commission statement PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on the free distribution of foodstuffs. 1 NEWMAN (S). \u2014 The first question we should con sider is whether the distribution of the free food was a suitable response to the cold weather? The extremely harsh weather was the reason given for the distribution although perhaps it was more a public relations ges ture. Perhaps a better response to that cold weather would have been a heating fuel allowance to those on low incomes. Nevertheless, common market food distribution is a good idea in itself, providing it is a right for the reci pients and not charity. There were problems in a num ber of Member States. In the Federal Republic of Ger many, for instance, there was a three-week delay before the scheme got off the ground. But I really believe that most problems occurred within the United Kingdom. The UK government lauded the large amount of food distributed there. Nevertheless the maximum figures available for butter distributed \u2014 there are different versions \u2014 is 13,624 tonnes. And at the end of the scheme there were 225,676 tonnes of butter in intervention in the UK. 1,041 tonnes of beef were distributed. At the end of the scheme 55,512 tonnes of beef were in common market stores in the UK, 6,000 tonnes more than at the start of this scheme. No flour, sugar, vegetable oil, fish, fruit or vegetables were distributed in the United Kingdom, although the Commission's scheme would have per mitted it. Perhaps some people think it is better to destroy fruit and vegetables than to distribute them. The value of the food was less than half the weekly bill for storing and disposing of the food mountains. The charities were not suitable as the principal distributors of the food. They could have played a useful subsidi ary role. The charities incurred considerable costs, most of which are not being reimbursed. The Commis sion, I insist, should make sure these charities are fully reimbursed. The charities now are very reluctant to get involved in this kind of thing and they want much more consultation and safeguards. Local government and national governments agencies could have been involved but were largely excluded. The 'most needy' was a ridiculous categorization of the recipients. Enormous confusion, resentment and disappointment ensued over different interpretations by different charities or in different areas. There were even mini-riots in some areas over eligibility, queues and distribution problems. Clearly there was some abuse. There were tales of cheap EEC butter in pubs, clubs, ice-cream vans, street markets, shops and so See Verbatim Report of Proceedings of 10. 4. 87, p. 272. forth. So although we should operate this kind of scheme again, we need to operate it without using the excuse of cold weather. We need to see it carried out properly. In the long term we really need to see food prices coming down and the surplus food stores imptied. BOCKLET (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the contents of the previous speaker's speech were already discussed on the Friday of the last plenary sitting. Therefore, I do not really see that it serves any useful purpose to dwell on what was already explained then. I should like to point out that the representative of the Commission, Vice-President Andriessen, stated at the time that the Commission was prepared to give Parlia ment a final report, when all the information had been collected, in order to enable it to make a suitable polit ical assessment on such a solid basis. I can therefore only regret that a debate on this subject has been engi neered yet again today by a Member State for very obvious internal political reasons, although this report is not yet available. On behalf of my group I should say that we, in order to gather supplementary informa tion to enable us to make this political assessment, asked the leading organizations of welfare groups to inform us of their experiences, so that we could on the basis of these make a sensible assessment of all the measures and proposals on the improvement of things in the future. For this reason I wish it to be recorded in the minutes that we think it is unfortunate that a debate should be carried out here on these matters without our having before us any new facts, and when it is obviously moti vated by internal politics. (Applause in the middle and on the right) PROUT (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I think this was an example of the Commissioners reacting with speed and imagination to a crisis. They do not always react with speed and imagination to a crisis in the Com munity, so when they do, they deserve all the praise that we can heap on them! We do not yet know the final statistics. Indeed, we do not know the full story of the distribution. This is one of the reasons why the debate is happening too, soon. But we do know that the Commission distributed over 20 000 tonnes of butter and over 10 0C0 tonnes of beef in a very short space of time. The distribution was imaginative, because instead of doing the obvious which was to go through governmental channels, they chose charities. The charities are in much closer touch, I am sorry to say, with the requirements of those who are in need, than government organizations. I think the distribution in the United Kingdom bore that out! (Protests from the left) ",
        "11.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/19 Prout I think your reactions are contemptible! But not sur prising considering where they are coming from! Mr President, when you do things in a hurry you clearly do not do them as effectively as when you take some time over them. This applies equally to food dis tribution. If the Commission had had more time, clearly the operation would have been more effective. What we ought to do today is to try and establish what lessons we learned from this experiment. First of all, it is quite clear from the United Kingdom reaction that the charities want to repeat the experi ment. (Protests from the left) There is certainly no evidence that they do not. How ever, they want certain requirements built in next time. The first one is that they want more advance warning because with it they can give advance publicity, they can establish distribution points, they can let television and radio know and generally they can inform people in good time that the food will be available. Secondly, they want much stricter rules on eligibility. These rules must be written into the Community legislation. I am sure they would have been if the Commission had had time. It is not a matter, I think, for national legislation. It must be something set down by the Community. Thirdly, we must have a system of checking that those who under the legislation have a right to the food, get it. I think the charities ought to be authorized to insti tute certain checks that they were not allowed to oper ate' this time, in any of the countries. There is fourthly, a particular problem with the provi sion of beef. It has got to be cooked. It ought perhaps to be distributed in cans. The other side seem to be saying that in the very brief time available that the experiment was a failure or that it ought not to have taken place. I am referring parti cularly now to my Labour national colleagues; they hate the European Community to do anything suc cessfully and that is why they are shouting at me now! (Applause from the European Democratic Group) WURTZ (COM). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, in response to last December's appeal from us and various charita ble organizations, the Commission implemented a number or regulations enabling surplus food to be released from storage and distributed free of charge to disadvantaged groups. Thanks to the efforts of the charitable organizations, assisted by numerous local authorities, large quantities of beef, dairy products, flour and sugar were distri buted. Tens of thousands of families affected by the crisis benefited from this much-needed measure. The operation, which was supposed to end on 31 March, was extended for a further month. It was a step in the right direction, but still far from adequate in our opinion. For, as austerity policies con tinue to be pursued in the European Community, pov erty continues to spread and there are now hundreds of thousands of families who no longer have enough to eat. Of course, we must take action to fight the root causes of this gross injustice, and in particular the financial cancer that is eating the heart out of our economies and exacerbating social inequalities. We must not, however, overlook any opportunity to miti gate the effects of that poverty. On behalf of the Com munist and Allies Group, therefore, I reiterate our call for the free distribution of surplus agricultural prod ucts to be extended and turned into a permanent, year-round operation. This demand has also been made by various charities in my country. Next, we consider that we must not only assess the results of this operation up to now, but also draw the necessary conclusions to enable us to improve its effectiveness. Here, it seems imperative \u2014 as other Members have also emphasised \u2014 for the administra tive arrangements to be further improved and simpli fied, the organisations involved to be fully reimbursed for all the expenses incurred in this exercise, and, fin ally, for the list of eligible organisations to be extended to include all local authorities. (Applause from the left) MARTIN Simone (LDR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, lad ies and gentlemen, if there are times when we must criticize the Commission, there are also times when they are to be congratulated. In the present instance, what are we to say? We all agree that the purpose of the CAP should not be the accumulation of unsaleable surpluses. We must also recognise that the reforms introduced over the last few years have allowed us to avoid building up such surpluses again. That does not alter the fact that we still have surpluses in store. We have discussed them often here, and even asked the Commission to make very effort to dispose of them. The value of these surpluses is depreciating with every passing month and day. Looking after them is a heavy burden on Community spending at the very time that we can see that, in almost every part of the Com munity, some of our people, mainly those affected by unemployment, are becoming progressively poorer and people are suffering \u2014 and even dying \u2014 from hunger here in Europe. So what would have been pref erable, to keep this surplus food in storage until it was unusable and had to be destroyed, or, as the Commis sion did, sell it off cheaply or give it away to charities, leaving it up to them to ensure that it reached those most in need? On many occasions over the last few years, my group has called for operations of this kind to be organized. That is why we support the Commission's action. If, on this occasion, some organizations cheated \u2014 and I believe that only a very small number are involved \u2014 ",
        "No 2-352/20 Debates of the European Parliament 11.5. 87 Martin let sanctions be taken and measures introduced to ensure it cannot happen again. But let this not be used as a pretext to abandon an operation that we should like to see extended, if only for the sake of solidarity towards our fellow men. TAYLOR (DR). \u2014 Mr President, we in the United Kingdom welcome the scheme for the distribution of free food. We welcome it, but I do not praise the way in which the government handled this affair. We wel come it because the Commission acted promptly and in particular I would like to praise the charities who responded to an impossible situation in an excellent manner. I particularly mention in my own consti tuency Age Concern, The Salvation Army, the St. Vin cent De Paul Society and The British Legion. They took on this tremendous job at short notice but the government made no proper preparation for this dis tribution. Nor did it make any finance available. As I listened to the Member who is spokesman for the Bri tish Conservative Group, it seemed to me that either he had no contact with the charities or he did not know what the conditions of the poor in the United Kingdom were. But those of us who worked on the ground to try to make a success of this scheme were shocked at the lack of support from our own national government in Lon don. So far as Northern Ireland is concerned there were of course abuses, as there were elsewhere in Europe. But in Northern Ireland the abuse was by para militaries and I was the one Member of Parliament who exposed that and tried to get it stopped. I also encouraged the churches and political parties to seize the initiative and ensure the paramilitaries did not gain credibility by distributing free food provided by the Community. I therefore hope that Mr Ford will take the opportunity to withdraw the nasty allegation which he made because I more than anyone have opposed the paramilitaries in Northern Ireland and I have been shot seven times through my body for so doing. KUIJPERS (ARC). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, collective impoverishment in these times of prosperity is a fact, certainly for the poorest among us. Yet for years we have been destroying fruit and veget ables and allowing stored goods to rot or selling them cheap to the Soviet Union, for example. Distribution costs amount to only half of the storage costs. We should therefore continue this distribution, which proved successful. The Commission should continue, and we should set to work methodically, as for exam ple happened in Anderlecht; in Flanders we already have a foodbank. Every Member State should have a foodbank which functions efficiently. I would ask that these foodbanks should be extended to products such as fish, oil and vegetables. I am fully convinced that this debate is only a detailed debate on the ways and means, but in my opinion the principle must absolutely be expanded.

While we will be cooperative with the Commission in respect of these reports \u2014 and I have a draft report prepared \u2014 I would like it to go on record with the Commission that we are not happy with this method of doing business and that we hope it will not occur again in the future.

A 2-15/87 by Mr Colino Salamanca, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, on the olive oil sector. MARCK (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does not consider the lowering of prices to be an appropriate means of striking a better balance between supply and demand in the agricultural market. Restricting production is unavoidable in sectors where there are structural surpluses, but is must be done with measures appropriate to each sector. The simultaneous application of different measures to restrict production must be avoided or curtailed. Where restrictions are imposed on our own producers, it is unacceptable that imports should be left alone, although international agreements should be reached on import restrictions. From now on quality must have priority over quantity, but quality must be rewarded. It must be possible for the producers actually to obtain the prices fixed during this price round. The Commission must achieve this goal by administering the market better. Consumer prices must also keep pace with producer prices. In view of the major differences in prices and incomes in the various areas of the Community and between the various types of farm, direct incomes support can be considered under clearly defined conditions. But the market and price policies must continue to play the most import role in maintaining the incomes of family farms at a reasonable level. These are the main options the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has sought to introduce into this debate on prices. Anyone who has, rightly in some cases, criticized the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for having unclear or inconsistent views in recent years must admit that the language now being used is clear and courageous and steers clear of demagogy and easy success. Furthermore, an almost unanimous position has been adopted on the tricky monetary issue. We advocate the restoration of monetary orthodoxy through efforts to introduce a common currency and the accession of all the Member States to the EMS. In the meantime, we want to see both positive and nega tive MCAs abolished and welcome the Commission's proposals as a first step in the right direction. But we quite appreciate that producers face adjustment prob lems in countries with positive MCAs. Their incomes must not suffer as a result, and the existing agreements must therefore be honoured. The unanimity in the Committee on Agriculture, Fish eries and Food is an important hint to the Council, whose political haggling in recent years has resulted in the original, well-meant MCA system developing into an intricate jumble that simply causes distortion of competition and mismanagement. Anyone who reads the Commission's recent report can draw but one con clusion: the MCA system must be abolished as soon as possible and replaced with rules that ordinary people can understand. Before going on to the oils and fats issue, I should like to say a few words about the price package. No one denies that the situation in the sectors with structural surpluses is very serious. A large majority of this Par liament has called for the early disposal of existing stocks. Every sensible politician knows that long-term solutions presuppose international agreements on production levels, trade and the storage of agricultural products in the main producing countries. Every sensi ble politician knows that these negotiations will be dif ficult, involve serious risks and may also entail sacrif ices. But they must be tackled resolutely and unambi guously. To this end, the European Community must define its own policy, and we therefore propose that the volume for which a price is guaranteed should be fixed by the Commission each year on the basis of average con sumption in the Community, imports, exports, food aid and strategic stocks in the last five years. We are aware of the risk attached to a definition of this kind, but farmers too must know where they stand. I call on both the Commission and the Council to say what they think of this proposal. So far all Parliament has had is refusals in both the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Committee of Inquiry into the Stocks. This evasion is unacceptable and simply leads to more ambiguous compromises and to deci sions that are to the farmer's disadvantage. Where the cereals policy is concerned, we consider the Commission's proposals to be completely inconsistent with the avowed aim of restricting production and also with the policy pursued in recent years of supporting alternative crops. The Commission proposes that production should be restricted by reducing prices and above all by abolishing the intervention mechanisms, the result being a 15% price reduction. It is thus com pletely ignoring the conclusion drawn centuries ago that drastic price reductions induce farmers to increase production to safeguard their incomes. What is more, this will lead to the bankruptcy of thousands of small and medium-sized farms to the benefit of the large farms, which may be able to absorb the pressure of the price reductions by using even more intensive methods. What is totally incomprehensible is the drastic cut in the case of alternative crops, when the Commission claims that they could and should replace two million hectares under cereals. Not only is the producer dis couraged by this: he is also penalized by, among other things, the recent price decisions, and this solely for budgetary reasons. We accept that overproduction must be avoided in these sectors as well. We therefore approve the prod uction limits but certainly not the reduction in prices and support, which would do away with the policy ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/25 Marck that has been pursued in recent years. We are, then, definitely in favour of the restriction of cereal produc tion, not by means of price reductions but by means of support for alternative crops, and we also allow for land being taken out of production. Our friends on the Committee on Budgets asked about the effect on the budget. Let me make it clear that what the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is now proposing would, of course, cost more than what the Commission is proposing, but it would still make for a reduction in the current budget. The Commission's proposals would lead to savings primar ily through the reduction of support for alternative crops, which we consider politically unacceptable. I would also point out that the Commission's propo sals have come very late in the day, when the farmers have taken all their decisions. They will thus suffer without having any redress or defence. This makes the common agricultural policy untrustworthy and unreli able. I will conclude by saying a few words about the oils and fats policy, which will wrongly develop into the main issue in this debate. The Commission has pro posed a general package designed to help solve the olive oil problem, which, as a result of Spain's acces sion, threatens to impose a heavy burden on the budget and make the marketing of this product extremely difficult. The Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food approves the Commission's propo sal, apart from its general preference for price mainte nance. If the problem posed by the millions of olive oil producers is to be solved, and everyone is aware of the Community's limited room for manoeuvre, what will be needed is a financing proposal which is politically feasible in the short term. I have not yet heard of an alternative. The opponents refer to forms of financing which they know full well the Member States are not prepared to accept at the moment. I am not a fanatical supporter of a levy on oils and fats, but I consider it utterly hypo critical to say now that this levy must be one of the Community's own resources. Anyone who proposes this is trying to thwart the whole project by evading the issue. The other arguments advanced by the opponents are not insignificant, but they are not always sound. The disadvantage to the consumer did not count for much in the margarine industry, for example, when the prices of raw materials plummeted. The threat which the United States has made under pressure from its powerful soya lobby is a real danger. The United States is exaggerating the consequences of the levy, which will only affect products intended for other than human consumption. Furthermore, the Com munity needs to be able to formulate an independent policy for its own products rather than being con stantly blackmailed by this large trading partner. The fear felt by the developing countries might be an important argument if the repercussions were in fact serious. But if you look at the list of the Community's leading suppliers and take away imports for human consumption, you will see that what is left can only be described as negligible. We are also prepared to con sider compensation. So the choice is clear: either we try to find a solution for the millions of olive oil prod ucers who have no other prospects, or we submit to the powerful lobbies, who are acting entirely in their own interests. The Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has thus stated its position clearly on the three aspects of this round of price discussions. Never before were the problems so acute, never before have they been considered in such a down-to-earth and realistic way. But we have considered them at all times in the light of the objectives set out in the Treaty of Rome, which seeks to safeguard the well-being of family farms in the Community. Farmers and their wives must be able to reap the benefits of their hard labour as individuals and families. They must also see that their belief in Europe has not been in vain. Parliament must not dis appoint them in this respect. (Applause) MOUCHEL (RDE), rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr Presi dent, Community regulations for individual agricul- rural products were introduced a number of years ago to guarantee supplies to the consumer and to guaran tee price levels against sharp price increases due to shortages. This system also benefited the farmer and enabled production to expand thanks to the stability of prices obtained from levies or refunds at the Com munity's frontiers and thanks also to market organ ization and support. With the exception of olive oil, there are no such provisions for vegetable or marine oils and fats. Imports are at world prices and producers receive direct aids. This system has worked hitherto because the Community had a considerable deficit in vegetable oils and fats, but the situation has now changed greatly, partly because the Community now includes the Mediterranean countries which are big olive oil producers and partly because of the expanding prod uction of oleaginous crops in countries further north in the Community. Today there is a need to review this organization. The Community of Twelve in fact produces a surplus of olive oil, being 112% self-sufficient, but between now and 1992 consumption is likely to fall in Spain and Portugal as frontiers are gradually opened up to imports of alternative oils and fats entering at competi tive prices. The intervention cost to the EAGGF would then become intolerable and we should find ourselves in a ",
        "No 2-352/26 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Mouchel budgetary impasse. But there can be no question of abandoning this production which supports 2 200 000 producers, more than the milk producers who number only 1 700 000. It would also be impossible to convert most of the land used for olive oil, and abandoning it would cause difficult environmental problems. On the other hand, the European Community is only 63% self-sufficient in oilseeds and the system of direct aid will also be more costly as the areas under cultivation and the volumes produced increase. It is thus a matter of urgency to reorganize production and the market in such a way that olive oil consumption in the European Community can increase and that oilseed production, currently in deficit, can also increase. So how can we do this and yet remain within the Community's budgetary limits? The system of levies and refunds used for the other products does not seem a good idea because of the difficult negotiations it would entail with GATT. Purely and simply taxing imported oils and fats would also meet with opposition from our suppliers, being contrary to the GATT agreements because of the unfair competition it would create for third countries. The Community must now honour the commitment it made when Spain and Por tugal joined and work for a new policy on oils and fats. All these factors naturally generate proposals, which in many respects are convergent with the proposals made by the Commission. For each of the oils and fats con cerned which are intended for human consumption, a minimum guide price must be set and the consumer must be made to pay a variable levy equal to the differ ence between this price and the world price. This levy might also be charged to the producer if the world price were higher than the price set by the Com munity. The great advantage of this mechanism is that it would mean great consistency in prices on the Euro pean market. But it does not have the approval of the crushers or importers who have not fully passed on to consumers, far from it, the considerable fall in prices observed on world markets in the last three years. This levy would be paid both on Community-produced oils and fats and on imported ones, thus avoiding a distor tion of competition contrary to the rules of GATT. The revenue from this levy, quite apart from markedly easing the EAGGF's costs, would enable olive oil con sumption to increase and the price to the consumer to decrease, in exchange for aid to the producer, but would also, by means of production price support, enable production of products in deficit to be stepped up and would limit currency outflows from the Com munity. In this way, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we may find a satisfactory solution to a problem which is of concern to the taxpayer, the consumer and the farmer in all the countries of the Community; a solu tion which, contrary to what some people claim, can operate without any detriment to the developing coun tries. COLINO SALAMANCA (S), rapporteur. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, the report on olive oil now before Parlia ment was written prior to the Commission's proposals under regulations 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26. Regulation 19 to establish a consumer price stabiliza tion mechanism for vegetable and fish oils is especially relevant. This report deals with the special case of one oil, olive oil, and here some background information may be helpful; first, production of olive oil is concentrated in the Mediterranean countries, i.e. Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal, and the first two of these account for 80% of Community production. Output is subject to considerable seasonal variation and ranged from 1.2 to 1.6 million tons per year between 1980 and 1986. Costs are high because certain operations cannot easily be mechanized so production is highly labour-inten sive; also typical olive-growing areas are arid lands with steep slopes subject to erosion. Consumption of olive oil is almost entirely concen trated in the producer countries; average annual per capita consumption ranges from 10 kg in Italy and Spain to 20 kg in Greece. Finally, the enlargement of the Community obviously entails a considerable increase in the geographical olive-growing area and in Community production. Also there is, initially, a wide difference between the Community olive oil price and that of the new Mem ber States. The internal price ratio in the Community is 2:3 compared with a pre-membership ratio of 1:4 in Spain. Consequently when Spain and Portugal joined the Community the logical course was to set up a standstill system retaining certain elements of national policy, until such time as the Community vegetable oil surplus is eliminated, as agreed in the Joint Declara tion. For a large section of the Community the olive oil sector has a substantial economic, social and ecol ogical role which must be given due weight in the decision-making process. When proposing future solutions, the Commission should bear these factors in mind and seek a certain balance; we oppose a policy whereby the eventual sac rifices and adjustments needed to bring the market into equilibrium fall wholly and exclusively on the producer. A clear requirement of the present liberal import regu lations for oilseeds, oils and fats that those who benefit from such a policy should contribute to Community equilibrium in the sector. To put it another way, in our opinion the Commission's proposals \u2014 abolishing monthly increments, cutting of intervention except for the last four months, maximum guaranteed quantities ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/27 Colino Salamanca \u2014 presuppose sacrifices which cannot be demanded unless the future of the sector fulfilling the functions mentiond earlier is guaranteed. The consumer price stabilization mechanism can be turned into a means of guaranteeing that future, if it produces the level of financing up to 1991 estimated by the Commission to cost the Community 6 000 million ECUs. As has just been said, the argument that the stabilization mechan ism is an attack on the consumer lacks substance. Indeed, one may speculate as to whether lowering the prices of raw materials seeds has not already placed the consumer in a better position. In any case, my view as rapporteur is that additional measures are needed in the olive oil sector, and I would like to highlight four of them: first, a campaign to promote olive oil con sumption in countries where the product is virtually unknown; second, implementation of such structural measures as will make possible a good return on oil production and a moderate prices policy; third, improved product quality; and finally, a continuing policy of control but avoiding the creation of bureau cratic deadweight with no real guarantee of substantial benefits in terms of efficiency. In conclusion, Mr President, the aim of this report is to bring new hope to a sector that is vitally important to certain regions of the Community, regions plagued by the severe social and economic problems of unemployment side by side with the grave ecological and environmental threat of a high degree of land erosion. Finally, a request to the Commission in the light of experience; if the Commission \u2014 and this Parliament \u2014 conclude that the stabilizing mechanisms are non discriminatory and conform to international commit ments, could the Commission please resist the pressure it may come under and not sacrifice the interests of Community growers? The maize and sorghum pur chase agreements are recent enough to justify the fears of certain Member States on whom the possible conse quences may fall. HOFF (S), draftsman of the report by the Committee on Budgets. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's farm prices package was called a 'declaration of war' by the Federal German Minister of Food, Agriculture and Forestry. A package in which the prime intention, reflecting the financial position of the European Community, is to make good economic use of public funds, something which to the Com mittee on Budgets goes without saying. The Committee on Budgets, for which I speak, has by its reaction to the farm price proposals supported the Commission's endeavours, because it too wishes to bring order to the chaos of the present financial situa tion. The resolutions of the Agriculture Committee, however, mean that further billions have to be found: some 500 million ECU for cereals, some 10 million ECU for fruit and vegetables, 250 million or so ECU for monetary compensation, etc., etc. The sum total is then some 4 000 million ECU! From the viewpoint of those receiving these blessings from the Community's coffers this is no doubt all very right and proper. But there is no way these payments can be met. Anyone who now approves even a single ECU of additional expenditure must realize that he is adding not just, to the surpluses mountain but to the debt mountain as well. We all know that the additional expenditure needed for the agricultural policy will already necessitate a supplementary budget, and 1987 is not even half gone yet! We all know too that the gap between income and expenditure in the Community yawns ever wider. The result will be a budget deficit of some 6 billion ECU this year, and more than twice that next year. This is all common knowledge now, and as a result all of us here must support appropriate proposals accordingly. The debt mountain \u2014 caused above all by the spiral ling costs of the CAP \u2014 is more of a threat to the Community's present and future existence than any amount of negative prejudice amongst the population and any political antagonism. This year's farm prices debate with its varying objec tives has seen many suggestions for solving the current budget problems. The true objective \u2014 the preserva tion and continuation of the EC as a whole \u2014 has often been lost sight of altogether. Totally irrelevant arguments primarily from the Germans in the person of their Agriculture Minister are blocking any chance of solving the conflict. It is significant that many peo ple, and I specifically include Mr Kiechle, completely fail to grasp the basic rules of economics. I think one thing has to be said here quite clearly.' market equilibrium always has two sides \u2014 supply and demand. A measure of regulation is always the price of restoring market equilibrium. Market imbalances can not therefore be countered in the long term either by restricting supply or by encouraging and promoting demand. It can only be done via prices, and that is an unassailable law. Anyone who in ignorance or thoughtlessness talks of preventing necessary farm price cuts is fooling them selves. It is not the forthcoming and certainly pressing farm price cuts which have 'economically and socially forced a whole occupational group out on to the peri phery', but years of standing idly by whilst market forces drifted farther and farther apart. Those most responsible for this miserable state of affairs are those who are shouting loudest today, for example Mr Kiechle and others! Declarations of solidarity within the Community and the anticipation of lower incomes for farmers cannot hide the fact that the only way out of this dilemma is through prices. The preservation of agricultural struc tures, means of compensating farmers for losses of income, are quite a different kettle of fish. These cer- ",
        "No 2-352/28 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Hoff tainly have to be discussed too, but please not as part of the farm prices debate but somewhere else, because what we are dealing with here is simply the restoration of a viable market. I thus reiterate what the Committee on Budgets has resolved. The Committee on Budgets endorses the Commission's farm price proposals. It also urges the Commission to conduct its planning activities on a pluriannual basis in the agricultural sector too, espe cially as regards prices policy and related measures. The Commission should also, without delay, start international negotiations to ensure that all agricul tural trading countries proceed at the same pace in solving their structural and surplus problems. Lastly the Commission should, without delay, put forward concrete proposals to solve the income problem of the many small and medium-sized agricultural holdings by providing direct income aids to offset the income losses which these sustain. If possible these income aids should be paid by decentralized agencies and, in the case of the poorest Member States, out of the Community budget. The Committee on Budgets voted by a mere 17 votes to 16 in favour of introducing a tax on oils and fats. I myself think that this tax will not solve our problems. It will bring us a small amount of revenue, and for budgetary reasons too we should not accept it. Our overall revenue problems in the Community will not be solved by the introduction of a tax on oils and fats. On the contrary: we shall have to build up an enor mous administrative apparatus to deal with it, and this will create new problems. In addition, of course, cer tain products such as margarine will become dearer to low-income groups of the population; I myself am also opposed to this. As I said, this decision was passed by the Committee on Budgets by the smallest of margins when not quite all members were present. MARK (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, as rapporteur I must also ensure that the truth is told. I was present at the meeting of the Committee on Budg ets, and it approved only the proposals concerning nominal prices. In other words, it did not approve the associated measures or any of the proposals concern ing oils and fats. I feel this needs to be said to prevent this Assembly from forming a different opinion. PRESIDENT. \u2014 (GR) Mr Marck, it has been explained that Mrs Hoff was expressing a personal view on the matter, and was not speaking as a repre sentative of her committee. FR\u00dcH (PPE). \u2014 (DE) I should like to make just one point. I too attended the relevant meeting of the Com mittee on Budgets and witnessed the approval of the motion for a resolution. Amongst the many personal observations made by the draftsman of the Committee on Budgets I found few echoes of the Committee on Budgets' approval. I thus submit, Mr President, that a committee rapporteur, when he speaks here, should in future confine himself to the approval of the motion in committee, even if the result was not what the rappor teur would have wished. (Applause from the centre and right) HOFF (S), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. \u2014 (DE) I totally reject the reproaches made by Messrs. Marck und Fr\u00fch. I have outlined the position of the Committee on Budgets here verbatim; it is a matter of record. I made a personal comment and identified it as such. But what you have said sug gests that I did not reproduce what was decided in the Committee on Budgets. That is not the case, and I reject it. Please read the record: I outlined the position of the Committee on Budgets here verbatim. NORDMANN (LDR), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. \u2014 (FR) For my own part, at the risk of seeming a little dull, I shall confine myself to reporting strictly on the opi nion of the Committee on Development and Coopera tion concerning the farm price proposals. This opinion comprises general approval, together with two reserva tions, or rather the expression of two matters for con cern. There is general approval of the Commission's strategy of applying the guidelines set by the green paper for achieving a better balance between supply and demand on the Community's agricultural markets. The Committee on Development and Cooperation thinks that this trend which will gradually use up the Community's farm surpluses is a step in the right direction and cannot fail to have beneficial effects on the economies of developing countries. Despite this general approval there are two matters for concern, two areas which cause reservations and which were the subject of debate in committee: firstly, the question of sugar and secondly, the proposed tax on vegetable oils and fats. As regards sugar, the Committee on Development and Cooperation thinks that the proposed cut is part of a policy which places too much importance on regula tion through prices and that this type of regulation can have negative effects on the economies of developing countries; it thinks that a system of quotas, which does exist but should be applied more effectively, would allow a ceiling to be put on Community production and would at the same time allow the revenues of the sugar-producing ACP countries to be maintained at a reasonable level. In addition to wanting better use to be made of the quota system, the Committee would like to see economic provisions to extend the Interna tional Sugar Agreement. As for the tax on vegetable oils and fats, the Com mittee on Development and Cooperation is against ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/29 Nordmann this proposal and is worried about the consequences it will have on the access of developing countries to the Community market. The theory that world prices will rise again as a result of this tax seems to the Com mittee to be a rebalancing operation fraught with diffi culty which would not offset the short-term handicap, an immediate handicap in the case of the developing countries. These, Mr President, are the main lines of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. ROBERTS, Dame Shelagh (ED), Draftsman of an opi nion of the Committee on External Economic Relations. \u2014 Mr President, I should like to draw attention to the two most salient points in the Committee on External Economic Relations' opinion. Firstly, the committee registered a firm commitment to the liberalization of agricultural trade throughout the world; secondly, an equally firm opposition to the proposed oils and fats mechanism. On the first point I would warn the House most strongly against seeking a solution to the Community's problems of surplus production and surplus stocks by increasing protection for the farm sector and restricting traditional imports. The economic costs of doing this would be prohibitive. Valuable resources would be directed away from sec tors which could increase our exports, and thus employment, and we should invite retaliation from our trading partners. It is our view that greater discipline should be brought into international agricultural trade in GATT. That goes for the United States, for Japan and for other developed countries, as well as the Com munity. In this round of price fixing we recognize that the Commission's proposals do demonstrate the Com munity's intention to reform the agricultural sector and we welcome the price proposals. Not so the oils and fats mechanism which the REX committee voted by a substantial majority to reject. It is indeed arguable whether it is even legitimate in GATT terms. It is indisputable that it is against the standstill declaration taken at Punta del Este only a few months ago. It is indisputable that it would arouse the hostility of the United States and other countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria who have protested vigorously. We saw how close we came to the brink of a trade war over the problems that arose from enlarge ment which the United States had supported. Here we have a proposal which the United States most certainly would not support and which, in my view, would have infinitely more serious consequences. It is also indis putable that the proposal is a threat to the developing and indebted countries of the world, which I should have thought was against Community policy. I would urge the Commission, therefore, even at this late hour, to have second thoughts. The introduction of a proposal of this nature would provoke the threat of a trade war, would provoke demands for compen sation from Third World countries and would destroy the credibility of the Commission's own price propo sals insofar as they are a determined attempt to reform the agricultural sector. I would urge the Commission therefore even at this late hour, to have further thoughts. (Applause) JACKSON, Caroline (ED), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. \u2014 Mr President, the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on the agricultural price proposals is composed of congratulations tempered by misgivings. I shall concentrate upon the misgivings. We were unanimous in deploring the lack of consul tation with consumer and environmental interests which lies behind the agricultural price proposals this year. You will look in vain in any volume of those pro posals for any evidence that DG VI has consulted any other DGs in the European Commission. The evidence of lack of consultation is very obvious in two areas in particular. In cereals the Commission is proposing a number of measures \u00b7\u2014 price cuts, price freezes, alter ations in intervention limits, etc. There is no evidence that the Commission has considered at all the possible impact on the environment of what it is proposing. The obvious consequence of what it is proposing is to increase production of cereals. That may well have a very detrimental effect on certain parts of the Euro pean Community. You will not be surprised however that our main mis giving about the consultation of consumer interests \u2014 and this is expressed in paragraph 16 of the opinion \u2014 was to do with the oils and fats tax. It is utterly deplor able that there is no statement in the price proposals this year of the likely impact on consumer costs of the oils and fats tax. The estimates have varied so widely that the European Consumer Bureau's estimate of the impact on costs is more or less twice that of the figure loftily given out by the Commission. The tax would discriminate in favour of fats which nutritionists say should be reduced in our diet. So much for the Com mission's own statement in its document \u2014 The Inte gration of Consumer Policies with other Policies \u2014 that we should take account of nutritional concerns. It will affect the cheaper brands of margarine most and its nomenclature is very strange indeed. It is described as a price-stabilization measure. The last thing it will do is stabilize prices. What a pity that the French Royal Family at the end of the 18th century did not have the advice of DG VI to help them put across their bread tax as a price-stabilization measure. No doubt they would still be ruling in France. The oils and fats tax is, of course, a skeleton which has been concealed in the Commission's cupboard for a very long time. It has now fallen out upon Mr Andriessen and the best thing we can do is to bury it six feet deep. But I am also to represent the view of the committee and you will see in paragraph 15 that an ",
        "No 2-352/30 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Jackson amendment was proposed by Mr Avgerinos of the Socialist Group \u2014 and I hope that the British Social ists, in including Mrs Castle, can live with this \u2014 which stated that the mechanism for stabilizing the prices of oils and fats proposed by the Commission is the first positive step towards rationalization of that sector. This proposal came from the Socialist Group and was supported by a number of other Members from the Christian-Democratic and Liberal Groups. I hope they can live with the fact that it will put up con sumer prices and not solve any of the Community's problems. Community for us to spend two or three meetings examining a subject, first in general terms, then going on to all the various sectors. That would not have been appropriate in this case, and I therefore began by devoting a whole day to bilateral contacts, the discus sions on the following two days being concentrated on the main aspects: the cereals sector, the oils and fats sector, fruit and vegetables and, finally, the agri- monetary problem. This debate produced a number of elements that might be called building blocks, some in the form of alternatives, with which a solution can be constructed. I should like to say a few words about this. IN THE CHAIR: MR CLINTON Vice-President DE KEERSMAEKER, President-in-Ojfice of the Council. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, the debate on agricul tural prices is more important this year than in other years because it concerns not only the fixing of the prices but also the continued adjustment of the com mon agricultural policy, which the European Com munity began in 1984. The Commission wanted to make an earlier start, and perhaps we began rather too late. The first decisions were not taken until 1984. The work continues. This debate must also be viewed in the light of the 'triptych' that is today being worked on in the European Community: the reform of the agricultural policy, the financial aspect and cohesion. We started work late this year, as the rapporteur, Mr Marck has already pointed out. But I should like to congratulate Parliament and the rapporteurs on the work they have done, despite the late start. It was in fact towards the end of February before the Commis sion's proposals were submitted. The same was true of the Council, and it would perhaps be well to say a few words about how the agricultural problem has been tackled so far. The first three Council meetings under the Belgian Presidency were devoted entirely to elaborating on the decisions of principle which we took in December at the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers under the British Presidency. This preparatory work was designed to precede the deliberations on the pro posals from the Commission on the fixing of the prices and the decisions taken in connection with the dairy and beef sectors and on the socio-structural measures. It was not until the Council's meeting of 30 and 31 March \u2014 exceptionally late, in other words \u2014 that we began our deliberations on the Commission's propo sals on the fixing of prices in the European Com munity. We continued these deliberations at the Council meeting of 27, 28 and 29 April. As President of the Council I prevented them from developing into an endless debate. It is the custom in the European I will begin with the cereals sector. The discussions on this subject soon revealed a large measure of agree ment on the main objectives, the need to find a more market-oriented way of adjusting the policy in this sector, which is so very important quantitatively. After what we have done in the dairy and beef sectors, we must bring both production and costs under control. But as soon as the discussion turns to how this should be done, opinions usually begin to differ, and so a solution is not yet in sight. As you know, the Commis sion would prefer to avoid drastic price reductions as such and is instead trying to bring about an adjustment of the intervention and grading mechanisms. There are delegations who say that this is not the right way, that we should take direct action through pricing and that the intervention mechanisms should be left as they are. What certain other delegations have said may perhaps be seen as a middle line, which can be explored, but we have not yet reached that stage. The discussions at a future Council meeting may reach a conclusion. In the oils and fats sector there is agreement, perhaps not quite so broad, but agreement nonetheless, on the need to bring the production process and, above all, the sharp rise in costs under control. When I was still a Member of this Parliament, the cost of the olive oil sector was well below 3 000m ECU. The figure today is 4 000m, and if we leave the regulations as they are and also include Spain and Portugal, another two and a half million people working in this sector will have to be added. Those who do not agree with the Commission's pro posals, then, must offer an alternative where this trend in costs is concerned, unless we proceed from the idea that we do not need to worry about the fate of the two and a half million people working in this sector. We did not accept that for the dairy sector, which also employs almost two million people, and we shall not accept it for the cereals sector either. That, then, is the problem. Nor has the Commission opted for drastic price adjustments but for a production threshold and, to ensure that it functions efficiently, for the abolition of the cut-off. That is a story in itself, Mr President, the discussions on the cut-off, during which many delegations said it could not simply be abolished. It was asked hypothetically whether it could not be retained on condition that the percentage was higher ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/31 Keersmaeker or progressively increased. This debate continues, but the Commission is sticking to its position. It has said, rightly I feel, that what has been proposed for the oils and fats sector is a single package and everything that is done about restricting production is directly linked to the stabilization mechanism. You know of the differences of opinion on the stabili zation mechanism, but I can say that, despite these dif ferences, which were only revealed, of course, in the Council of Ministers, we have had a reasonable, prac tical discussion on the subject. We also found the Commission sympathetic to certain difficulties which national positions brought to light, and the possibility of solutions being found on the basis of certain con cessions or adjustments cannot be excluded. But this is still an important political point, which concerns, as what I have heard some of the rapporteurs say here also reveals, the European Community's international relations. On the fruit and vegetables sector I can be brief. It is a very complicated subject, which we have subjected to a thorough technical examination. I think there is will ingness here to go some way down the restrictive road indicated by the Commission, but only on condition that a serious, credible effort is also made to achieve a more continental type of production. Finally, the agri-monetary aspect. We have divided this into three parts. I will just say a brief word about the first two, the last, the franchise, being rather tech nical. Firstly, the abolition of the positive MCAs \u2014 you know how things stand, particularly as regards one delegation in the Council \u2014 and the abolition of the negative MCAs, which the Commission not unjus tifiably, in my opinion, relates to the credibility of the efforts the Council must make. It would not be easy to argue that all the negative artificial MCAs that have accumulated as a result of the switchover that came into force in 1984 should simply be abolished. Here again, everything is interlinked. I must say that the views on the positive MCAs do not make the views on the negative MCAs any easier and vice versa. We are aware of that. It will therefore be necessary to con sider how things will stand in the future. I can tell you that the majority in the Council is not yet in favour of the retention of the present system. This has the added disadvantage of having an inflationary effect, and this is forcing us into a situation where we are having to solve virtually all the problems \u00e0 la carte. We cannot go on like this in the European Community. It will not be easy, but the Council takes the view that we must try to establish a system on the basis of the status quo ante, because that is the legal position in the absence of an alternative, and then we shall have the same situation as before 1984, but on the basis of automatism. By automatism I mean based on as objective criteria as possible. This is the difficult task we are now tackling, and the die is not yet cast. With these building blocks and with account taken of the budgetary restrictions and the international con text, we must try to find a solution. The Presidency has announced that it will take the risk of putting for ward a proposal along the lines indicated by the Com mission and try to adopt a position which has the approval of a majority in the Council. It is my task to organize the discussions in such a way that a solution is found in the European Community which respects the objectives we are pursuing. I am happy that the reports by Mr Marck, Mr Mouchel and Mr Colino Salamanca agree on certain basic principles: the need to bring production under control, the control of costs, with account taken of the international context, and a supportive social and structural process. We are doing this on the basis of the Commission's proposals. Things are not going so smoothly. We have taken what are known as socio-structural decisions, from which we have extracted the pensions aspect, and that is now being considered in the Council together with proposals regarding incomes support. The European Parliament will also be asked for its opinion on this second aspect. I see from Mr Marck's report that we are expected to decide on this at the same time as the prices. I see Mr Marck is shaking his head, so perhaps I am mistaken. To be honest, that would have been ideal, but it cannot be done in the time available. But, to remain credible, we must act as quickly as possible. That goes without saying. That is the situation in the Council of Agriculture Ministers. Next Monday we shall resume our work with a view to making progress in what is a difficult task for the European Community in the present cir cumstances. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Thank you, Mr President-in-Office. May I say that it is grand to have a former Member of Parliament with us today in the person of Mr De Keersmaeker as President-in-Office of the Agricul tural Council. MARCK (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, for the sake of absolute clarity, I would point out that we are in favour of incomes support, but not necessarily through the decisions on prices. We accept that incomes support can be considered under well defined conditions. WOLTJER (S). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I am glad that that misunderstanding between two compatriots has now been laid to rest. If they have misunderstandings, I wonder how we stay together in Europe, speaking so many different languages as we do. When we consider this debate and the proposals before us, the first con clusion we are bound to draw is that a large package of proposals has been submitted to us. I should like to express my admiration for the Commissioner \u2014 as I have done in the past in this Chamber \u2014 for his per severance in tackling the problems which exist in agri culture and none of which we can now ignore. I say this because from time to time I get the feeling that he ",
        "No 2-352/32 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Woltjer too must see this as a thankless task, considering the progress that is actually being made and the discus sions that keep breaking out. In other words, I congra tulate the Commissioner on his consistency and his perseverance, because that is abolutely essential if the common agricultural policy is to be preserved. I have just heard the President-in-Office of the Coun cil speak, and the conclusion I draw is that this is in fact a debate of despondency. What the Vice-Presi dent of the Council essentially said was: 'We are not in agreement in the Council. We are busy. We are hav ing discussions. We have an analysis, but we do not have a joint solution.' And it has been going on like this for years. Happily, some small steps have been taken in the past, and they at least give us some hope that some small steps will again be taken in the future. But at the same time we know that the problems are constantly growing in magnitude and in number and that this slow progress towards the solution may prove disastrous if we do not work faster. I therefore urge the President of the Council to do everything he can to ensure that courageous decisions are taken by the Council, because that is essential if the common agri cultural policy is to be preserved. I believe he agrees with us that this is essential for the European Com munity. My group has indicated on several occasions that it wants to see a number of clear priorities and objectives set for the agricultural policy, the cost aspect being one of the most important priorities. Besides the cost aspect, we want to emphasize a number of social objectives. In our view, this cannot mean tackling the social problems by producing more and more sur pluses. We must choose other methods. I am afraid we are now using the social problems \u2014 and this is what makes me despondent \u2014 to put off the real solutions and to avoid tackling the problems. If I voice a few criticisms here, I do so not because I want to discourage the Commissioner even more but because we of the Socialist Group have been very con sistent from the outset in setting a number of priorities with which we must compare the Commissioner's pro posals. First, cereals. The Commissioner has made various proposals and rightly placed considerable emphasis on the problems in the cereals sector. They are among the most serious problems we face at the moment. I some times think these problems have unfortunately receded somewhat in the last twelve months because of the lower yields, which makes it seem that they are attracting less interest. I think it right that the Com missioner should put forward proposals for tackling this problem and that he should not be sidetracked by cyclical reductions in yields but prepare for the struc tural problems we shall be facing in the cereals sector. Although I am convinced that the price proposed by the Commissioner and the restriction of intervention he has proposed are necessary measures at the moment, I also feel \u2014 and this is my criticism \u2014 that these measures will not in the end produce an effective solution in the European Community. I now come to a point that has now been recognized in the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: if we are to tackle the problems in the cereals sector effectively, we must find a different way of going about it. We are glad that the Commissioner has come forward with proposals, but I should like to have seen rather more depth in the Commission's proposals for taking land out of production and putting it to other uses. I should like to have seen the problem tackled at its roots rather than through the effects which prices have, which will not work in the long run. I feel this is a definite failing. We must not therefore say that, despite all the discus sions, nothing will come out of the Council. Because the Commission will not be taken aback if the Council says it will not accept the price proposals as they stand. The Commission will then get its way. I should like a definite answer from the Commission to this question: are you prepared to come forward with a clear idea on this point in the coming year, perhaps with a report indicating what possibilities you see in this respect and how you think we should tackle these things? We are willing to discuss this with you in depth but, as I have said, there must then be proposals on the table. I would ask you to submit a report soon and to give us the opportunity of exchanging views with you. The Socialist Group at least has done its best to make pro gress in this respect. As Mr Marck has pointed out, a few amendments on this have already been approved by the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. We advocated a system of premiums for farmers who are prepared to include green manure crops in their crop rotation scheme. The Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food accepted this proposal. We would point that we have said on several occasions that, as long as we have the coresponsibility levy on cereals, we would use the revenue to get to the root of the problem and use the land concerned for other pur poses. The second major problem concerns small farmers. I think the Commission was right to propose an income supplement. Unfortunately \u2014 and I do not therefore agree with Mr Marck on this \u2014 this proposal does not form part of the debate on prices, even though we are, after all, having a general, broad debate on agriculture at the moment. I think this is a pity. It is just like last year, when the socio-structural measures were consid ered separately from the prices and we eventually took a whole year to draw various conclusions on these socio-structural measures. That meant another year has passed. I am afraid \u2014 and I repeat that I am no pessimist \u2014 that precisely the same thing will happen here, that we shall take another year and so go on put ting off the problems. I stress once again that that must be avoided. ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/33 Woltjer We feel something needs to be done now about the problems facing small farmers. We must not wait for the kind of discussions the Council has. We have made a number of proposals. We have proposed, and the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has accepted this, that the resources available for small cereals producers should be increased from 120m to 200m ECU. As you well know, the sum concerned was really very small. Why did yout not show your politi cal will and do rather more about this than your pro posals reveal? You often say yourself, Commissioner, that you want to give small farmers more help in this respect. We have also called for an increase in support for the production of durum wheat. We consider such aspects essential, and we will approve your price pro posals provided you accept that something must also be done about the incomes problem, especially where small farmers are concerned. I will conclude with a few words about the levy on oils and fats. This is a complex issue. We admit that. In my group too it was the subject of a heated discussion. It was a political issue, which we discussed at length and in depth. I would almost say it was a little like the debate in the Council. The subject was considered from all sides. Various effects, various national angles came to light. In fact, our discussions \u2014 I am sad to admit \u2014 simply reflected what happened in the Coun cil. But after a long debate we adopted a position. It was admittedly a majority position, and the minority said it would oppose it, even during this debate, as you will be hearing this morning. The majority position is that we are prepared to accept this stabilizing levy on oils and fats if there is a policy for this sector. We agree with the Commission and with what the Presi dent of the Council has just said : if we accept a levy of this kind, we must also do something about the increase in production. The two aspects belong together, and the Commission must not ignore the increase in production. I should like to hear what it has to say about this. It must not say, all right, we'll drop the rest of the package and simply retain the sta bilizing levy. That would be unacceptable to us, and we would oppose it. We feel this levy must have a genuinely stabilizing effect. In this respect we are rather confused by the information reaching us from various sides. I would be grateful if you would say something about this in your statement. Will this levy have a stabilizing effect or will it not? Our argument for accepting this levy was that the deficiency payment system could then be retained. We realize you need stabilization for that, but we also say that that must then actually be the objective and that it should not be swept aside with a few fine words. We believe a number of conditions should also be attached, and I hope Parliament will endorse them. Firstly, we feel everything should comply with GATT. I would ask the Commission to say something about this. This levy must comply with the provisions of GATT. What we do must be legal. We are not out to wage a trade war, and we are not prepared simply to be repulsed by the United States. At the same time, we say that if we do not act in compliance with GATT, we are opposed. Another condition is that we do not want to derive revenue from the developing countries. They are already suffering under low world market prices. If we introduce a levy of this kind, I feel that what is col lected on the products of developing countries should be recycled through the diversification and agricul tural development programmes. The final condition is that the Commission must also do everything possible to ensure that this tax is not paid entirely by the consumer. The policy must prev ent this. The consumer has not \u2014 as Mr Marck has said \u2014 benefited from the fall in prices, and he should not, of course, now foot the bill for the increase in prices. The Commission can find a means of prevent ing this. I will finish by congratulating Mr Marck. As I have said, we do not agree in every respect. Mr Marck has tried to achieve a consensus so that Parliament may exert maximum pressure. That we do not agree with Mr Marck about the cereals sector is regrettable. We shall fight for our views, and I hope we can come to an agreement on this point in the next few days. BOCKLET (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party follows a clear line on this round of farm price nego tiations. We say no to all price cuts, whether direct price cuts or cuts via related measures concerning, for example, the dry matter coefficient. We are also reso lutely opposed to such price cuts by the back door. In this we have a good ally, who has no small reputa tion in the EC and shouldn't have in the Socialist Group either, Mrs Hoff. I mean Sicco Mansholt. Two weeks ago Sicco Mansholt said that price cuts would not have the effect of limiting production, rather the contrary. And he also said that price cuts of as little as 10% would create a situation in which only 4% of real agricultural holdings would be able to achieve a level of income equal to the gross national wage. This is a somewhat late conclusion, but it is not too late to reach the right conclusion. This socialist has not so far managed, alas, to have any influence on his fel low party members or in the Federal Republic, but I can assure Mrs Hoff that she, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, has succeeded in shrouding the entire subject in fog instead of shedding light on it. Why do we think that price cuts are not necessary? We think it is perfectly possible to cut back production without having to resort to price pressures, by laying land fallow, encouraging renewable commodities, ",
        "No 2-352/34 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5.87 Bocklet encouraging products in which we have a deficit, by afforestation and by ecological land balance. One thing should be clear: we cannot follow a selec tive policy here. If we support price cuts, it cannot be for cereals alone. We must then agree to cuts for fruit and vegetables too. For it won't do to let some keep what they have and take away something from others. We have a clear line: no price cuts at all. That goes too for products of which we have a shortage. Thus we also think there should be no cuts in aid to oilseeds. We are glad to see that the resolution by the Com mittee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food stresses the importance of the role of market and price policy. We are glad that we Christian-Democrats managed to include in the resolution rewards for rural achieve ments, the achievements of agriculture for environ ment and nature. This means a measure of balance and it places farmers' incomes on a broader basis. I would like to make the point that this was included in this motion for a resolution at the request of my Group. As regards the monetary situation: we all know that this is a difficult area for decisions. We have one coun try in which the farmers are very definitely adversely affected by the problem, and we have eleven others which feel less affected or which see the problems dif ferently. Given this background it was certainly an achievement in committee to have agreed on two things: firstly, that agriculture under the CAP suffers from the fact that monetary union is incomplete, and secondly, that we have to help ease the disadvantages suffered by farmers as a result of the situation I have just described. But \u2014 and I will not hide the fact \u2014 opinions differ as to how these problems should be solved. In this we are one with the Council and the Commission, I might add. I was interested to hear that the Council President considers one possibility to be a return to the system we had prior to 1984. In my own view that might not be the worst solution. There have seldom been so many dramatic utterances in this House as on the tax on oils and fats. This has a twenty-year history; it is not a new thing. But this time the Commission has approached the matter in such a way, and I congratulate it, that it may perhaps suc ceed. Our financial requirements are 4 000 million ECU and will be 6 000 million ECU in 1991. We need to restrict production and find a stabilizing mechanism. Purely because we support the restricting of production, we also support this stabilizing mechanism in the form of a tax on oils and fats. I would stress that for us this is a single package, and anyone seeking to take bits out, for example the limiting of production or the limiting of cost increases, will not have our support on the tax to stabilize this market. To sum up: we Christian-Democrats have put forward a self-contained, financially workable solution. We think that both sides, consumers and farmers, can live with it and that it will ultimately mean no increased costs to the Community. (Applause) NAVARRO VELASCO (ED). \u2014 (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner: I represent the European Democratic Group, which seeks a strong and healthy agriculture. By strong we mean competitive in international markets, and by healthy, we mean an agriculture free of debt and financially able to adapt in structure. I shall refer again later to the United States, our prin cipal competitor, when I deal with specific sectors. Its strength and its ability to make that strength felt in international markets, represent a constant threat of trade war for the European Economic Community. But it always seems to be forgotten in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy that the US operates its own support mechanisms and farm subsidies, in other words, it does apply internal preference. We believe it should be possible for exporters and importers to do business in agricultural products on the international scene as in Lord Plumb's proposal for maintaining a constant up-date on internal demand and export opportunities. And we want to see our agriculture developing in a free market where the forces of supply and demand can operate freely. We do not understand why Spanish strawberry growers who demonstrate greater efficiency should be exposed to risks, nor why Scottish sheep farmers should be in constant danger and attack, nor yet why an efficient agriculture like that of Denmark in the streaky bacon or dairy sectors should be subject to permanent threat without adequate support to depend on. But today the debate is the Common Agricultural Policy and farm prices. For us the most important fac tor in these prices is now Community preference and the future elimination of all the distortions of agricul tural markets that arise from the measures associated with intervention or direct taxes. Today farm prices do not reflect the true money value of the product; instead they are substantially affected by a whole series of related measures. For example, better quality stan dards such as higher specific weight, lower water or impurities content, remove large quantities, particu larly of cereals, from the market. We have no objec tion to better quality cereals, but our approach to the problem is quite different from that of the Commis sion: the Commission is raising the quality level and abolishing intervention for products which fail to meet the qualities fixed for the international market. We propose the contrary: instead of eliminating products which cannot achieve these specific weights or water contents because they come from arid zones with unfavourable climates there should be a premium on better quality products; what is more, the Commission ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/35 Navarro Velasco is setting these levels on top of its price and interna tional measures. The intervention timetable is another factor that deter mines prices, and hence farmers' incomes. It is obvious that under the Commission's proposal to reduce the intervention period to only four months the farmer will inevitably have to bear the cost of storage and insurance, if the market is depressed, until he can claim intervention for his crops. So we are in favour of six months' intervention in the cereals sector, covering the end of November to the beginning of May, which accords with our philosophy of the free operation of market forces; it is at harvest time that the market is most fluid, and subsequently large stores must be kept, so that intervention is needed until May, when the market can operate freely again. We have repeatedly protested against the co-responsi bility levy and demanded its abolition. It should not be regarded as another addition to general funds but should be used specifically to promote consumption of products subject to the levy, for rebates, and to ensure better organized and more flexible marketing struc tures for the products involved. We are extremely concerned about the Community surpluses problem, especially in dairy products and cereals, and I would like to comment briefly on the cereals sector. The fact is that the enlargement of the European Economic Community has meant an agree ment with the United States which ties down a Mem ber State and definitely, if indirectly, distorts the inter nal cereals market; because of dairy surpluses and the tastes of piglets, the demand for cereals as fodder has fallen considerably in one Member State, Spain, where for four years 2.5 million tons of maize and 500 000 tons of sorghum had to be imported. The agreement the Community has made not only stands the principle of Community preference on its head \u2014 since the market could be opened up to the other Community countries \u2014 it also makes unnecessary concessions to competitive sectors, contravening the rules of Com munity preference. There has been considerable disagreement about the oils sector \u2014 even within my group, as later speeches by British members opposed to the oils and fats tax will show. I would just like to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council, and also of all the Members, to certain socio-structural circumstances \u2014 mentioned in the Colino and Mouchel reports \u2014 which substantially affect the employment of labour in the EEC's olive-growing sector. First the actual importance of the vegetable oil and olive oil sectors relative to other Community sectors needs to be recognized. It was just suggested here \u2014 and I refer to Mr Bocklet's speech \u2014 that we were making too much fuss about the vegetable oils and fats tax. But these people do not baulk at allowing a mere 1 700 000 milk producers to create a surplus problem worth more than 3 000 million ECUs. Our problem is two million farmers in the south affected by the rate of duty on oils. What worries me most is something I sense both in Committee and in Parliament itself: there is a great deal of talk about not re-nationalizing the Common Agricultural Policy; the great concern is to prevent the CAP from being nationalized again. But, Mr Commis sioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are regionalizing the Common Agricultural Policy. A confrontation between North and South is being provoked; a con frontation is being created between the agricultural policies of the North and those of the South. In both cereals and olive oil distinct and antagonistic positions are emerging, pursued with such intolerance that the result is friction between the policies of North and South. Let us beware of leaping out of the phantom frying pan of nationalization of agricultural policies into the real fire of regionalization, and the mutual antagonism of two distinct agricultural policies. Naturally we support the tax as a lesser evil. But as I have said before, and this is the agreed policy of our group: no taxes, and no intervention quotas either. We would be in favour of doing away with the 1 350 000 tons olive oil intervention quantity for a very obvious reason: whenever a ceiling is imposed, there is always the risk that it will be lowered later. But in none of the regulations have I seen any mention of an important matter that greatly concerns us in my country, prose cution of fraud, as the effects of this tax could actually be obtained through greater vigilance. Mr Commis sioner, I guarantee that if this were done there would be no surpluses in the vegetable oil sector. GATTI (COM). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, Mr Commis sioner, the Communist Group disagree with the pro posals put forward by the Committee on Agriculture on 1987/1988 prices. We consider that these proposals tend to perpetuate the old mechanisms of the common agricultural policy, which has caused deep imbalance in production and enormous wastage of resources. In particular, the amendments which we intended as a timid start to the restoration of equilibrium in the Community's farming industry, were not accepted, and we have re-presented them to the Chamber. It was decided not to use intervention as an instrument against those who are looking solely for the weak points in the Community's organization, and not those in the market. Approval was not given \u2014 and it is the only regulation that the Committee on Agriculture rejected \u2014 to the regulation on standardisation in the oils and fats sector. A few countries do not accept the agri-monetary measures for dismantling compensatory amounts. We are therefore faced with a repetition of history \u2014 Mr Bocklet even reminded us of Mansholt of distant memory, whom we all know very well. Two years ago, when the 'Green Paper' was presented, we put forward a detailed document for the reform of the CAP, but instead of taking a positive line the political ",
        "No 2-352/36 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5.87 Gatti parties, both sides of industry and the ministers of the various governments preferred to pigeonhole this 'Green Paper'. I know that Commissioner Andriessen does not like this statement, but it is a fact. A great responsibility is therefore borne by ministers as well as by the Commission, which did not have the strength to impose this document as a good basis for the reform of the CAP. Today the Commission's proposals, which have been made worse in a number of places by the Committee on Agriculture, offer a number of interesting ideas that this Parliament must give consideration to, such as the reduction of the intervention period, the link between price and quality, the tax on oils and fats, and the agri-monetary measures. They are \u2014 I said this before, and I say it again \u2014 interesting, courageous measures on the part of the Commission and the Com missioner but, taken overall, we find at the end that there is still no sign of a clear turning-point in the common agricultural policy. Well, the ministers, \u2014 some of them particularly so \u2014 the President of the Council and the political parties have been very forthright about these proposals, going so far as to envisage, even with a report in writing, presumed catastrophes and disasters if these proposals are implemented. Reprisals, even, and grave consequ ences are threatened if measures are adopted in accordance with the principle of the majority: in other words, these politicians are asking in practice to con tinue along the lines of the past. But, ladies and gentle men, as Mr Navarro said just now, these people who talk of national disasters, these members of Parlia ment, these political parties, these ministers \u2014 do none of these people ask themselves how millions of people are placed, and what difficulties are faced by millions of workers, farmers, as the result of this situa tion that has become firmly established in years of common agricultural policy? Years of correct common agricultural policy which, however, must today be changed. Is it possible that nationalism is so strong that it makes these countries shut their eyes and not see, for exam ple, that other countries have accepted certain mea sures for restoring equilibrium? I should like to quote the example for restoring equilibrium? I should like to quote the example of wine, which is sacrosanct for everyone, and we Italians, together with our French colleagues, must remind the others of this. We accepted certain measures in the name of a certain principle; and why should these principles not apply to the German cereal producers, or the milk producers of the other countries? Should these measures, these standards only apply when one is not involved with these crops oneself? That is why we are not calling for revenge, we are ask ing for a restoration of the balance in the common agricultural policy; we want the EEC to hold advan tages and disadvantages alike for North and South, and for all the produce of the North and South. That is why our proposals are aimed at the acceptance and furtherance of these positive statements set out in the Commission's proposal, that we recall as new objec tives for the CAP. Above all, we do not want any one-way penalization, with action being taken \u2014 yet again \u00b7\u2014 on prices policy alone. In conclusion, I would like the President of the Coun cil to remember that we are not asking for the socio- structural measures to be launched immediately, the day after the adoption of the prices package. But, Mr President of the Council, you must remember that they are fundamental measures that are part of the overall picture; because, at a time when we are asking the farmers to make certain sacrifices that are neces sary in order to restore equilibrium to the CAP, we must also, at the same time, give them support and integration, above all in certain disadvantaged areas that have paid and that are absolutely unable \u2014 I do not say unwilling, as some colleagues say \u2014 to pay. We shall therefore assess our proposals in the light of the way in which Parliament votes. We hope that our amendments will correct the balance of certain of the Committee on Agriculture's proposals and that, as I said before, they will really mark a turning-point in the common agricultural policy. MARTIN Simone (LDR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, lad ies and gentlemen, it was only a few weeks ago that Mr Delors in this very chamber made a kind of decla ration of faith in the CAP and its principles. Whilst acknowledging the need to adapt to the new market conditions \u2014 and who could deny that need? \u2014 he went on immediately to make the following points. Farmers had to be induced gradually to change their choices of production in line with the circumstances of European and world markets and to seek new outlets. The Community had been following this line since 1984. Thus the reforms made to the common agricul tural policy since then had brought budget savings of some 6 000 million ECU, at a constant dollar rate. This was a measure of the valiant efforts made by our farmers and answered the erroneous criticisms levelled at the CAP. But this policy clearly ran the risk of aggravating the income position of those farmers whose situation was the most vulnerable. It could well transform the rural face of Europe, which had been deeply marked by the family-based type of holding, and yet culturally and socially, this had proved itself to be economically and ecologically efficacious. It thus had to be preserved, he said. And there were ways of doing this. If these measures were not enough, since the Community could not refuse to grant aid, it would not be able to refuse to assist incomes, or others would do it in the Community's place, with the danger of renationalization which we wanted at all costs to avoid. Further on he made the following point: ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/37 Martin A better balanced and better structured system of Community action for market support and income support had to be found. We also had to lay the foun dations for rural development which was vital to regional development, establish a good balance between man and nature and, lastly and above all, maintain a way of life which was typical of many regions in the north of Europe and in the south. Our farmers would not understand if we were the only ones to make this effort of adapting to the new world situation. Our world agricultural partners also had to understand it. Only concerted action could obliterate the harmful effects of successive fluctuations in prices on world markets which had been made worse by the confusion in the monetary system. This, then, is what Mr Delors had to say. But how much of these declarations is apparent in the price proposals and related measures put to us by the Com mission over which he presides? All we have is price cuts, limitation of intervention measures, 15 to 20% reduction of support which sometimes causes produc tion prices to fall, notably for cereals, colza and pro teins. What is gradual about that? Has not the aim been essentially, indeed solely, to make budget savings without taking into account the consequences they will have for producers? For who, after several years of stagnation, could cope with price falls on this scale? Where are new outlets to be sought? Even the produc tion of crops of which the Community has a shortage, like oilseeds and proteins, is to be subjected to price and production restrictions, is it not so, Mr Andries sen? How, in these circumstances, are we to preserve the rural face of Europe to which Mr Delors claimed to be so attached? Where are the compensatory and restructuring measures? The development of alterna tive crops? The search for markets for farm products, including industry? Export policy? Agreements with the major exporting countries? And yet what has hap pened and what is still happening in the milk produc tion sector should enlighten us here. We have cut our production, and are still doing so, but that has not improved the market, because we had no agreements with the major exporting countries, no guarantees of simultaneous and similar measures on their part, and so they have taken back the shares of the market which we have lost. The Commission's proposals are thus far removed from its declarations and rhetoric. In these circumstances, and though I must admit that not everyone in my Group \u2014 for budgetary reasons \u2014 shares this approach, how can we fail to support the proposal of the rapporteur, Mr Marck, whom I con gratulate in passing on his proposals and his strategy, which amounts to maintaining the broad lines of the status quo, in the absence of any global package offer ing any prospects to the producers? In the case of cereals, how could we agree to lump together price cuts, limitation of intervention to four months in the year plus abolition of the monthly incre ments, without for a moment imagining that that could be done without disrupting the markets and producing intolerable falls in production revenue? In the case of milk, given the sizeable efforts required of producers to limit production, I for my part would have welcomed a move towards increasing prices, something which will nevertheless have to be consid ered. Because one cannot go on for ever imposing freeze, production cuts and co-responsibility. I can, however, endorse the rapporteur's proposal for an ini tial dismantling of this co-responsibility levy and, ulti mately, its abolition. For the benefit of the Commission I would also add that, whilst a first step has been taken to reward the efforts made by farmers to implement the recent mea sures to limit production, more needs to be done. We must provide incentives to farmers to give up milk production, to take early retirement, so that the indus try can be restructured and viable units set up, and above all so that young farmers can be brought in, because milk producers are getting older and older, which is not healthy. Most producers are in areas which, even when not classified as mountainous or disadvantaged areas, afford little scope for doing any thing else. We thus run the risk that these areas may become desertified. A brief word on the subject of beef and veal and sheepmeat production. We have to go along with the Committee on Agriculture. But in the case of beef and veal we must insist on the need to continue reducing stocks and to monitor changes in supply. This brings me to the two points which pose the grea test problems \u2014 oils and fats and the monetary com pensatory amounts. To take oils and fats first, and I must say straight out that my Group is divided on this point. When we sought and accepted the accession of Spain and Portu gal to the Community we knew that this problem, already present, would inevitably become much more acute and that solutions would have to be found. The proposals put to us are doubtless no panacea, but even those who oppose them had nothing better to offer, and they do at least have the advantage that they are consistent with the rules of GATT and require sacrif ices of both Community producers and importers without, I am sure of it, penalizing the consumer too much. For the processors, who were anything but quick to pass on to the consumer the benefits of the fall in the price of their raw materials, have doubtless kept a margin for doing the same thing the other way round. I shall address myself now to those who wish to reject these proposals which, I am sure, are our way out of the impasse. They should consider all the implications, especially those for the budget, and the implications are serious. ",
        "No 2-352/38 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Martin In concluding I would say again, ladies and gentle men, how important it is when we speak of adapting the agricultural policy to move gradually, and towards this end I hope that the majority of the House will endorse the proposal of the Committee on Agricul ture. (Applause) IN THE CHAIR: MR ELIO Vice-President KILLILEA (RDE). \u2014 Mr President, it is important for all of us to realize that less than 1% of the Com munity's gross domestic product is absorbed by the common agricultural policy, which is no more, and in some cases less, than in other developed countries, notably the United States of America. At the same time it affects over 3% of the Community's popula tion, which is substantially more than in the United States where only 1.5% of the population is directly involved in agriculture. When the activities servicing agriculture and food pro cessing are taken into consideration, agriculture is by far the Community's largest and most important industry. In that context, the cost of the common agri cultural policy is very modest indeed. Agriculture is more important to Ireland than to any other Community Member State. It is the most impor tant single contributor to our gross national product and is also the largest single employer. And yet there has been a fall of 25% in farm incomes in Ireland in the years 1985 and 1986 combined. Last year alone more than 12 000 Irish men and women were forced to leave the land, many of them with no alternative but to join the dole queues or. emigrate \u2014 both the grea test obscenities of our time. Even the Commission recognizes that Irish agriculture is still seriously lag ging behind its EEC partners, both in terms of produc tion, structures and income. Irish production is less than 65% of the European average in all major farm products. Now we are being told that that is as far as we are being allowed to go, that this is the end of the road. The latest Community price proposals signal yet again the failure of those responsible for the Community's farm policy to devise suitable instruments to deal with the problem of surplus production without hurting the vast majority of family farms and marginal producers, whose contribution to farm surpluses is therefore mar ginal. These hostile farm proposals both reflect and fuel the anti-farming bias in the European Com munity. I attach supreme priority to the preservation of the family farm as a vital element in social and economic stability, not only in Ireland but indeed throughout the Community. Furthermore, it is my conviction that a stable European agricultural industry, based on the family farm, cannot survive without market and price stability and Community preference ensuring a rea sonable income. A delicate balance must be achieved between effective measures to curtail farm spending and reduce surpluses and the effects of those measures on farm incomes, particularly those of small producers who may be driven out of farming, and also the effects of those measures in regions where agriculture plays a significant role in the economy as a whole. The Commission's price proposals for 1987/1988 totally fail to meet those requirements. Ireland's prin cipal concerns relate to the proposal for cereals, agri- monetary matters, butter intervention and a stabiliza tion arrangement for the oils and fats sector. The proposals principally involve an intervention price-cut for feed grain, limitation of intervention for the Febru ary/May period and a restricted and reduced monthly increment system. (Applause) DEVEZE (DR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are serious times for the 12 million farmers still remaining \u2014 for how much longer? \u2014 in the new Community of Twelve. In addition to farm prices for 1987/1988 this debate should consider the Commission proposals ratified by the Council in April 1986 for cereals and in December 1986 for milk and beef. With these new Community and national measures of direct aid to incomes, the Commission thinks it has done its duty of reforming the common agricultural policy. We believe on the contrary that the Commission is thereby signalling the decline of the CAP, perhaps its demise, and in any case its renationalization. What will the agriculture ministers decide? When it comes to disagreements, each will try to save his own agricultural economy, sacrificing that of the others if need be. The Commission syndrome is catching. What are we to think of the Marck report? We believe it is a balanced report, underpinned by five major ideas: pro tection and development of family-based holdings, market and prices policy as an essential part of the income of agricultural holdings, an effective structural policy, a tax on oils and fats, except for olive oil, and the dismantling of all the monetary compensatory amounts. Nevertheless this report does not go far enough in defending the achievements of the common agricul tural policy and forgets certain proposals which are essential to its survival. For this reason we tabled a number of amendments in committee and shall defend them in the plenary. ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/39 Deveze We should support the Marck report after amending it, reject some Commission proposals and await a deci sion by the Council \u2014 these, ladies and gentlemen, are the suggestions I put to your judgment and your wis dom. One needs only to look again at the Commission's proposals to see that they are devoid of imagination and good sense and are, furthermore, a threat to fam ily-based agriculture. Small and medium-sized hold ings are particularly at risk. The Commission's mea sures are \u2014 and I choose my words carefully \u2014 a real challenge to the European farmer. The countryman with a herd of 15 freely grazing cows is doomed to disappear, whilst the agricultural industry of the north can raise 160 cows in the stall using imported cereal substitutes and will continue to prosper. The Commission seeks to justify its agricultural reform by the size of the surpluses and the imbalance between supply and demand, leading to a cut in prices and sharper competition on world markets. The first duty of an executive is to foresee and the second, to administer. The Commission seems to have done neither. Instead of introducing measures some time ago to slow down production, it steered it towards alternative types of production or ones where the Community had a shortage. It is now reacting brutally by cumulative measures which penalize both produc tion and prices. Feeling that the farmer is about to die of this overdose, he is being given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in the form of direct aids to income. I am not exaggerating. At the beginning of the year Mr Delors outlined to Parliament the Commission's pro gramme for 1987. The Commission, he said, proposed to follow a policy of limiting prices, to make the inter vention guarantees and system more flexible and to increase the co-responsibility of producers, using the quota system. Sensing that these measures would be unacceptable without compensatory measures Mr Delors added that a better balance had to be achieved by the Community between market support and income support. It has all been said, the result speaks for itself and you know what it is: the freezing or cutting of all types of farm production, including those for which there is a shor tage such as oilseeds and proteins; the restricting of intervention buying up of cereals, butter, milk powder and beef; retention of the co-responsibility levies paya ble by the producer for cereals and milk; tightening of the quality criteria for cereals and olive oil; lowering of the production quotas for milk, tomatoes and an additional absorption tax for sugar. Proposals on structural matters were expected from the Commission to ease the effects of these restrictive measures. We learn to our amazement that the pro gramme of aid to incomes is to be decided on by the Twelve by the end of the year but it is not tied to agri cultural prices. Logic is not the strong point of this Community if it dissociates farm prices and compensa tory amounts. The Commission's declared objective is to restrict production, absorb the surpluses and seek improved competitiveness by bringing world prices and Community prices closer together. In place of this static, penny-pinching management by the Commis sion we propose a dynamic management based on the farmer and his family, working on a modern holding. Man must always come before machines and economic calculations. VAN DER WAAL (NI). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, reform of the common agricultural policy geared to the two central issues, the problem of overproduction and the control of costs, is urgently needed. Taking these objectives as our yardstick, we welcome the Commission's price proposals, except the proposal for a reduction in the prices of products rich in protein. We can hardly slash the prices of crops whose cultiva tion we have been encouraging and intend to continue encouraging as alternatives to surplus products. But, on the whole, we consider the price freeze, or price reductions, and the related measures, in a somewhat weaker form, feasible and desirable. Just as the price policy has in the past been a factor that has contri buted to today's overproduction, a restrictive price policy is conversely one of the instruments which we believe can have the effect of discouraging production. But lower prices on their own will not be enough: they are only one means. Autonomous technological devel opments have done more to increase yields than prices. The resulting increase in production will undoubtedly continue at a pace that will exceed the growth of demand. A restrictive price policy combined with a more flexible intervention system and the abolition of the MCAs must therefore clearly be accompanied by supplementary measures. Judging by the Commission's package of proposals, I cannot completely avoid the impression that the Commission is expecting a very great deal of the price mechanism to restrict produc tion or is guided to a very great extent by budgetary considerations. Supplementary structural measures are needed, as several speakers have said, and we feel they must be designed to reduce production and must include a number of options that act as incentives to farmers to reduce production. In the economically weak areas a system of differentiated support for small farmers who get into difficulty will be unavoidable. A single, uniform price level throughout the Communtiy designed to strike a balance between supply and demand will, after all, hardly be enough for all small farmers in all regions. As regards the levy on oils and fats, we intend to sup port the Commission's proposal. Even if the Commis sion's forecast of the cost of the future financing of these products looks gloomy, there is still likely to be a very heavy burden on the Community budget. But as the potential effects of the levy are rather complicated, we have a number of questions to ask. Of particular interest to us is its effect on international trade rela tions. I should also like to hear from the Commis- ",
        "No 2-352/40 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Van der Waal sioner what distinction will be made in the application of the levy between vegetable and animal oils and fats, with fish exempted. If this is so, is this system not administratively so complicated that it will be particu larly susceptible to fraud? To summarize, Mr President, we feel that the Com mission is going in the right direction with its policy, which deserves our support, but the mistakes that have been made over many years cannot be rectified in a few weeks. ANDRIESSEN, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I should like to begin by express ing my gratitude to the parliamentary committees which have been involved in the preparation of this debate. I say this, firstly, because the committees have been willing to make a special effort to enable this debate to be held today, prepared in this way. The proposals were submitted late, and it has been hard work making these preparations. I am grateful for this. Secondly, I am also grateful for the quality of the work that has been done. Even though my statement will show that in a number of respects Parliament and the Commis sion continue to differ over what should be done, I must say that I greatly approve the growing measure of agreement in Parliament and between Parliament and the Commission about the foundations on which the common agricultural policy must be based in the future. I detect this in many of the comments made by the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which I will come back to. I detect it in the report drawn up by the Committee on External Economic Relations, although I disagree fundamentally with this committee on the oils and fats levy. I shall, of course, be discussing this. The Committee on Development and Cooperation makes this criticism, but it also says the Commission has opted for the right course with this policy. Let me begin by saying something about the general framework of the price proposals. Mr Gatti has said that to some extent the Green Paper has been con signed to the waste-paper basket. He said I would not like to hear this, and he is right there, because it is not true. And things that are not true I do not like to hear. The opposition to various aspects of the policy, which puts into effect guidelines set out in the Green Paper, demonstrates that in many respects the Green Paper still determines the policy which the Commission pro poses should be pursued. I will explain this with three comments. Firstly, where the market and price policies are con cerned, we still take the view that a package is needed to get things under control. We are not opting for one model, we are not opting solely for the restriction of prices or solely for the restriction of production as such. We are opting for a model of which a restrictive price policy, more flexible intervention, the co-respon sibility of producers and encouragement of high quality all form part. You will find this idea clearly reflected in the policy conclusions which the Commis sion has drawn from the debate on the Green Paper. The second element is the socio-structural policy. Too little too late, Parliament says. We were indeed rather late, and it is not yet enough. I admit that. But I would point out that the Commission has resubmitted to the Council, albeit in an amended form, the proposal con cerning early retirement or, if you like, the early ter mination of farming. Mr Woltjer says the Commission must persevere. All right, we will. We have submitted new proposals on this point. We have included in our socio-structural proposals a number of elements which will themselves result in production being reduced and in agricultural land being taken out of production, something the Socialist Group has again urged today. That is another idea you will find in the Green Paper. My third comment concerns the incomes policy. You say the proposal should have been submitted earlier. I wish that had been possible. But, Mr President, Rome was not built in a day. Things are not progressing as quickly with all these reforms as the Commissioner responsible for agriculture would like. But proposals have been made, and that was the third part of the Green Paper. Chapter 4 of the Green Paper considers the integration of the agricultural policy into society, with incomes support an important aspect, although at the time it was rejected by almost everyone, by both professional circles and many people in politics. I know, Mr Woltjer: you thought differently. It is now beginning to be realized that we must have measures here if market and price policy alone is incapable of ensuring adequate incomes for agriculture as we want it, that is, consisting of family farms. I feel these are three clear indications that the Green Paper has not been consigned to the waste-paper basket and that we are in the process, or at least the Commission is in the process, of implementing much of it. Now a brief comment on the budgetary situation. I realize it is dangerous to talk about the budget in an agricultural debate. But it is not for nothing that in this Parliament too a growing interest is being taken in the budgetary implications of the agricultural policy. And rightly so. It is unacceptable that just about the only real integrating factor in the Community so far, the agricultural policy, should now prevent or seriously hamper further integration. This danger exists because of the trend in agricultural spending. I will say here in this Parliament that the common agricultural policy and the farmers in the Community have an interest in ensuring that we continue to recognize this dimension of our policy. I am therefore prepared to include this aspect in the policy. Then there is a third consideration, which has also been referred to this morning, and that is the interna tional aspect. Let us make no mistake about this. While ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/41 Andriessen here in Parliament we call on the Community, and rightly so, to take action in the international arena to bring about closer cooperation and encourage more orderly trade in world markets, the world is also look ing to see what we are doing with our own common agricultural policy and wondering whether or not we are prepared to reform it. I can assure you that the Community's position in international fora, be it the OECD or GATT, is strengthened if it is believed that the Community is making a serious effort to tackle the reform of the common agricultural policy. That is a line I should like to stick to when recognizing that the Community should be active particularly at interna tional level. I now come to a number of comments of a more specific nature. I will begin with prices. I should like to make it abso lutely clear to Parliament that simply freezing prices is not enough. It is not enough if what we understand by a restricitive price policy is to have substance. Firstly, I would point out that in most Member States our agri- monetary proposals will result in the price decisions having a different effect in national currency from their effect in ECU and that, if the prices in ECU are simply frozen, there will be significant price rises in the Member States with weaker currencies even though the trend in agricultural costs in those Member States does not justify a price adjustment of this mag nitude. Secondly, it would weaken much of our effort to improve relations at international level. Thirdly, I would also refer to the budgetary situation. There is a fourth point: the trend in costs. If we look at the trend in costs in real terms, taking a rough average for the Community, it is clear that, if we did precisely what the rapporteur's resolution advocates, that is, if we had taken account of the trend in costs when fixing the prices, some of the price proposals would be different from what the Commission has actually proposed. That is why I stand by my opinion that prices should be reduced rather than frozen. Should the annual volume of supply, as the resolution proposes, be fixed, as it were, on the basis of a specific key? I am hesitant about this. Why? Fixing the volume of supply that we intend to subsidize or guarantee can not be regarded simply and solely as a Community matter. We are producing in a world and for a world market in which we have positions we want to main tain. Nor do I quite see how it would be done in prac tice, what the consequences should be of exceeding a level of production guaranteed in this way and whether it would not pose all the problems we now encounter when we introduce thresholds on the subsi dization of certain products. This brings me to the related measures which \u2014 I admit \u2014 play an important part in the package this year. And why is this? For the simple reason that we believe not only that there should there be a restrictive price policy, but that the intervention mechanisms should revert to their original function, an idea that is, moreover, expressed in the rapporteur's resolution. That is why this year we have placed the emphasis on a further adjustment of the intervention mechanisms, having achieved results in this respect in the dairy sec tor and in the beef sector this year. These aspects have, I am pleased to say, been successfully reflected in deci sions taken under the Belgian Presidency. I realize that this is causing some tension between what the Com mission is proposing and what Parliament wants, because these related measures have the indirect effect on prices that is anathema to so many Members. I nevertheless feel that we must continue in this direc tion if we want the guarantee system in the Com munity to revert to their original safety-net function. There are a few points I should like to deal with more specifically at this stage of the debate. First, there is the agri-monetary problem. One thing is certain. We cannot go on as we are. The system is \u2014 I do not hesi tate to use the word \u2014 perverse. Rather than helping to improve or ensure the continuity of the conditions of competition in the Community, the system is help ing to create distortions and undesirable trade flows. We must therefore abandon this system. We cannot go on creating artificial negative monetary compensatory amounts, which then have to be reduced by means of price rises and in the final analysis simply have the inflationary and production-stimulating effects that we do not want. On what needs to be done our views do not, I believe, differ so fundamentally. There is per haps less agreement on this with a number of delega tions in the Council of Ministers. But I do not rule out the possibility of a significant improvement in this res pect, at least technically and legally. There remains the political dimension of the implications for the farmers. On that I must say, if I am to avoid wrongly stimulat ing production, that the purely artificial negative monetary compensatory amounts resulting from the currency or exchange rate adjustment in January are excluded from the measure. This also raises the question of the current positive MCAs. If we were to take up the idea of a price freeze and compensation for the abolition of positive MCAs, as the rapporteur proposes, the net result would be an even sharper rise in prices in the Community. Is that in line with the idea put forward in the resolution itself? I have my doubts about that for the moment. I now come to the oils and fats. A great many Mem bers clearly have yet to read the proposal carefully. Although it can be said that a tax on oils and fats has been under discussion in the Community for fifteen years, the proposal that has now been submitted is completely different from anything the Commission has proposed in the past. The least I can ask anyone, including people outside this Parliament and in third countries, is to judge the proposal on its merits and not by the lack of merits of proposals that have been made in the past. That is the first thing I have to say. Secondly, what we are talking about here is a package. One of the main elements of our proposal is that it ",
        "No 2-352/42 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Andriessen cannot and must not be left solely to the producers to foot the bill for the restructuring of the oils and fats sector. If we were to allow that to happen, I am firmly convinced that olive oil production in the Community would get into the worst possible difficulties. We can not allow this to happen to the group we are con cerned with here. That is why we have put forward a proposal for a kind of burden-sharing and are asking the consumer to bear some of the burden. It is now being said that the consumer is then the one to suffer. Let me just say this in passing: it has not been calcu lated what overall effect the package now before us would have. I think if we worked it out, the consumer would not come off too badly, because the whole ten dency of the package is towards depressing prices. Will this instrument bring stability? I think so, because it closely follows the fluctuation in world market prices, and even if they settle at a level above the Com munity level \u2014 very unlikely at the moment \u2014 the system itself provides for a subsidy. The system will bring stability, I think that is very clear. Does the sys tem comply with GATT? Some say yes, almost nobody has said that it does not comply with GATT. The Committee on External Economic Relations says it is debatable. I am absolutely convinced, and we would not have come forward with this proposal if we had not been convinced, that it complies with GATT, just as it does not infringe the Punta del Este standstill principle for the very simple reason that that concerns matters which do not comply with GATT. We there fore believe we are doing no wrong here. But like many Members of this Parliament, almost every one, I realize that the proposal poses problems at interna tional level. So we must face up to them. We must talk about them and see how we can solve them. But I find it too easy, given the problems involved here, to say that, as various third countries, especially the United States, are not happy, we will not go ahead. Very many Members of this Parliament would severely criti cize the Commission if it adopted this position in dif ferent circumstances. This brings me more specificallly to international rela tions. I should like to say this on this subject. We of the Commission advocate greater international cohe sion in the solution of problems. In the case of cereals, we should like to see better agreements with the major producers, and we are working on this. But it is not only up to us, of course. Others are just as much involved, and I must tell you that at the moment the prospects are certainly not very hopeful. I believe a serious decision taken here on the common agricul tural policy could in itself make a contribution to a development of this nature. To conclude, I have something to say about a few spe cific products. I shall be very brief. Where cereals are concerned, the resolution calls for \u2014 and Mr Woltjer echoed this appeal \u2014 a report on taking land out of production. We are working on this. This is an extremely difficult subject, and it would be going too far to discuss it at length at this stage. But I am willing to speed up activities in this area as much as possible and to comply with this request, but I cannot promise anything before September. As regards milk, there was an appeal for a partial and phased removal of the co-responsibility levy. As long as the dairy sector imposes such a burden on the budget as a result of the surpluses that still exist, I feel it will be difficult to put this idea into effect. If the policy on the restructuring of the dairy policy is really to begin bearing fruit, I feel this is a point that should be considered when the milk policy has been estab lished in its final form. As for regionalization or rena tionalization, we do not believe our proposals will result in an unacceptable level of regionalization. What we do want to achieve, particularly in the socio-structural policy, is on implementation of this policy which is centralized and geared to the regions. We feel that would be a good thing. The rules on per sonal incomes support are designed precisely to prev ent renationalization. In a number of sectors the Community has already taken major steps to improve the situation. For various other sectors practical proposals have now been put forward: for the cereals sector, where our opinions still clearly differ, for the oils and fats sector, for the agri-monetary problem. There are also socio-struc tural proposals and decisions and proposals on incomes. The Commission believes these proposals in themselves indicate the broad lines of a new architec ture for the agricultural policy and hopes that Parlia ment will cooperate constructively in this process. (Applause) COLINO SALAMANCA (S), rapporteur. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, taking the price proposals and asso ciated measures for the 1987-88 financial year as a whole, it is quite apparent that, understandably obsessed by the budgetary consequences of the Com mon Agricultural Policy, the Commission has taken a single-minded view of the options. The Commission of this Community seems determined to pile restriction on restriction: maximum guaranteed quantities, remo val of monthly increments for certain production, price restrictions, co-responsibility levies, changes in quality and in the intervention timetable, all of which denotes a brave effort to hold back spiralling agricul tural costs. But in the end one is left wondering whether renewed surpluses can be prevented in this way and whether this highly restrictive policy does not overlook differences between growers and between regions, introducing mechanisms that are progressive rather than proportional. It is also doubtful whether this policy is in line with the stated aim of protecting family farms. Meanwhile the socio-structural propo sals outlined are gradually building up a certain resent ment towards the European Community amongst the farming population. We are afraid the final outcome ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/43 Colino Salamanca may be that we are left with nothing to show for it all but a substantial drop in farmers' incomes. To this may be added the general feeling that the Community is making these efforts alone, while third country exporters fail to take equivalent measures, and that the EEC ought to be simultaneously introducing pro grammes to promote output of substitute products in areas of deficit to take the place of products in surplus. It needs to be remembered that prices policy cannot be separated from quality of production, and changes must take place gradually so that farmers can adapt accordingly. And, whatever else it does, this prices policy must guarantee farmers a minimum income. In parallel with the restrictions on cereals production, we are asking for further measures to be taken to assist the switch to alternative crops, tailoring the maximum quantities to the results of the cutback in cereals prod uction. Every marketing year there should be a re-evaluation; industrial use of agricultural output must be intensified and the risks of depopulation in certain areas need to be carefully assessed. We have made clear our concern about the position of small growers. Their position must be taken into account, as must the location of certain hill farms and farms in less-favoured areas. Some measures, like the intervention timetables, must be drafted with greater attention to their consequences for these farms, bear ing in mind that their position is weakened because marketing is less well organized so that faced with a market in surplus they are unprotected and this can only lead to a serious worsening of the situation. As regards assistance to production the Commission's decision to distinguish between various producers seems right, although in certain cases, such as olive oil, the limits that have been set need revising. Finally, some of the Commission's proposals are too sweeping and too strict when seen through the eyes of the poorer farmers. We want to see the negotiations with other large agri cultural producer countries intensified so that agree ment can be reached under the GATT to contribute to better equilibrium in the world market, not forgetting the legitimate interests of developing countries. In conclusion European farmers must be given some indication about the future of their farms. We cannot tell them not to increase their production of cereals, milk or meat because the EEC is in surplus and in the same breath forbid them to increase, say, soya, sun flower or fodder output because, although we are in deep deficit in those sectors, the CAP costs us a lot of money. The Commission and the Council need to be reminded that the construction of the European agri cultural market is bound to need a budget and ECUs have got to be spent. If we are not prepared to do this, sooner or later the CAP will inevitably be renational- ized; in fact that is already happening. If the trend is consolidated the logical next stage will be greater intra-Community protectionism and the collapse of the single agricultural market. Balancing the budgetary imperatives against the need to consolidate and ration alize the Community's agrarian policy is certainly no easy task. M\u00dcHLEN (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party believes that the Euro pean Parliament should urgently decide on its position and shoulder its responsibilities as regards the overall policy on oils and fats. It feels that a whole series of reasons need to be invoked to justify the urgency of the need to agree on an overall policy on the market in oils and fats. Firstly we must in the near future find ways of cover ing additional expenditure of 2 000 million ECU due to the fall-off in olive consumption which will occur when in 1992 the markets of Spain and Portugal cease to enjoy protective measures and will be fully exposed to the effects of importing substitute oils and fats. But the problem cannot be reduced to simple budgetary terms. The question is also whether we can afford to go on standing idly by in the face of the grave imbal ance affecting the market as a whole and in the face of the flood of substitute products coming in. We must also bear in mind that there can be no ques tion of extending the standstill measures granted to the Spanish and Portuguese markets. My Group is aware that the Commission proposal to introduce a mechanism to stabilize the market in oils and fats is the only concrete one to have been made. This means that we do not have the luxury of making a choice and weighing the pros and cons of two or more possible solutions. It also means that acceptance of the formula proposed by the Commission must not necessarily be interpreted as an unconditional acceptance. My Group welcomes the fact that the idea of balanc ing out the market by means of a tax on oils and fats other than butter and olives has been abandoned. Use of a mechanism to stabilize the market by means of a system of equalization seems a better idea and more in line with the spirit and logic of the common agricul tural policy. Here I should like to thank the Council President Mr Paul De Keersmaeker, who not only outlined the options bravely \u2014 just as bravely as our rapporteur, Mr Mouchel \u2014 but also made the point that opponents of the Commission's proposed formula ought not to retire into a disapproving huddle, but should propose alternatives. I will not pretend that these Commission proposals met with unanimous approval from my Group. Even though those opposed to the draft were unable to put forward concrete alternatives, they nevertheless voice their reservations about the Commission's proposals, casting doubt on their compatibility with the rules of GATT and their expediency in the context of the EEC's external economic relations policy and express ing their fears that this system may go on and on. It is ",
        "No 2-352/44 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 M\u00fchlen precisely on this point that opponents of a stabilization mechanism need to be given reassurances. For my own part, I believe that, whilst we back the Commission's proposals, it is essential that these should be accompa nied by a system of gradual restrictions on olive prod uction, phased in such a way as to guarantee the provi sional nature of this stabilization mechanism and ensure that it only lasts for a certain length of time. As my honourable friend Mr Bocklet has just said, the two are linked. I shall conclude by asking Parliament to shoulder its responsibilities on this important matter without delay, or to share responsibility for the failure of our overall policy on oils and fats. JACKSON, CHRISTOPHER (ED). \u2014 Mr Presi dent, the 1987 farm price decisions must take account of four fundamental problems. First of all, shortage of cash: we read today of President Delors' dramatic appeal for an additional five billion ECU. Yet it used to be a ritual, at the time of the farm price decisions, for Members of Parliament and members of the Coun cil to vie with each other in distributing largesse for farmers. Even today with soaring costs threatening the CAP with collapse, too many of the Agriculture Com mittee amendments are set to increase expenditure. We believe we must support the Commission's policy of restraint. There is no point in giving the kind of so-called support to farmers that leads them into a cul-de-sac of producing unwanted products at high prices. The second problem is productivity and surpluses. Continuing increases in productivity affect cereals, liv estock and horticulture alike. The resulting huge sur pluses are not only an embarrassment to us; they divert expenditure away from our farmers. They create havoc on world markets. They create trade ten sions with the United States. They cause damage in some cases to the economies of developing countries. We must control surpluses and by international nego tiation get others to do so as well. The third point is adjustment. Since the beginning of the CAP \u2014 someone earlier referred to the Mansholt Plan \u2014 numbers employed in agriculture in most European countries have continued to fall. This pro cess will, I believe, inevitably continue. The triumph for the CAP so far is that adjustment has been a rela tively painless process, but earlier the transition was against a background of expanding industrial employ ment. Today our concern is that the necessary adjust ments to the CAP could result in severe unemploy ment in less-favoured rural areas. This must be avoided. This leads to my fourth point, support. We must recognize the special contribution that small farmers make to the rural economy. This must be protected, and for that reason we increasingly favour direct income aids to small farmers in less-favoured areas, plus consideration, as others have mentioned, of 'set- aside' and afforestation. While we largely support the Commission's position, there is one area where British Conservatives are in complete disagreement, that is the oils and fats tax. The Commissioner invited us to consider this tax on its merits: I gladly do so and offer him five demerits. First, it is a regressive tax bearing most heavily on Europe's poorest citizens. It will increase the price of margarine, by over 40% in the case of cheaper brands. It will add 50% to the price of cooking oils. It will hit the poorer people in Mediterranean areas by putting up olive oil prices. Second, an oils and fats tax will severely increase trade tension with the United States and will precipitate retaliation. Third, the tax will hurt the many developing countries who have a high dependence on oil seed exports to the European Community. Do we really want to harm those whom we profess to help? Fourth, the tax discriminates against vegetable oils in favour of animal fats. In view of the risk to health posed by the current level of consumption of animal fats, it makes no sense at all to reduce the attractive ness of healthier unsaturated fats by putting a tax on them. Fifth, the tax avoids Parliament's budgetary control by providing over 2 000 million ECU outside the budget ary framework. Can Members seriously want this? I believe this to be a damning list of objections and I cannot believe this House will, if it reflects on them, support this tax. We have other areas of concern, the beef sector, the problem of the ewe premium and the question of MCAs, but I see my time is running out and so I will just conclude by saying that last year Parliament took its lead from the report by James Provan. It supported the Commission in its task of bringing agricultural supply and demand back into balance. That was a triumph for common sense. This year Parliament must again give the Commission its support on farm prices. IN THE CHAIR: MR MEGAHY Vice-President PRANCHERE (COM). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the adoption on 13 November last by a majority of the House of the budget amendment tabled by the Social- ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/45 Pranchere ist and Christian-Democratic Groups for a new reduc tion in the milk quotas was a stab in the back to the producers and its effects are still being felt in our debates. The Commission has fallen into the abyss with its proposals to freeze or cut prices, block prod uction and regulate markets. Mr Delors confirmed as much when he presented his programme for 1987. This policy will be continued and even speeded up, for it is part of the aim of the internal market by 1992, based on liberalization and deregulation. This policy can have only one outcome, a reduction in the agricultural potential of the EEC, with dramatic consequences for farm incomes, jobs and rural life and greater Community dependence on imports. The Commission is hand in glove with the Council. The spurious squabbles among politicians which make headlines cannot hide the fact that there is actually agreement within the Council. The French agriculture minister, Fran\u00e7ois Guillaume, is not the least accom modating. We have seen this in the dispute with the US in connection with enlargement. Recently he actu ally proposed a cut in cereals prices even larger than that proposed by the Commission. According to the press he is poised to approve a massive influx into France next June of soya-based milk substitutes. This policy born of budgetary discipline was first launched by ministers Rocard and Nalet. He is now its unwor thy perpetuator. The European Parliament, often a sounding board for farmers' protests and a focus of resistance to Commis sion and Council, has surrendered. The very clear deterioration seen in 1986, the first year of the enlarged Community, has got worse, as is apparent from the Committee on Agriculture's report. Some compare it to a Spanish inn, where there is something on the menu for everyone. That is wrong. I myself find there nothing but dishes cooked up by the Commis sion. And Commissioner Andriessen has made no secret of it. Even the rather hotter dishes, like the tax on vegetable oils and fats and the MCAs, are made heavier and indigestible. Between Unilever, the American exporters, desertifica tion \u00e0 la Delors-Mansholt and the interests of French farmers, I have made my choice. I choose to safeguard the proper use of all the achievements of our agricul ture and to defend the incomes and future of these workers under Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome. It is no use budget phantoms rattling their chains, they cannot make us forget the dead weight of exemptions from Community preference and the easing of the contribution: billions of ECU squandered every year and wrongly charged to the CAP. Budget funds are available, in abundance, to improve the income of farmers which depends essentially on production prices. I favour the zero option on arms reduction, but I am totally opposed to the Commission's less than zero option on prices. This is why I propose a revaluation of Community prices by zero to 2% depending on the type of prod uction, which would mean an increase in French prices of 2 to 5%. This proposal would be useless without measures to improve the market support mechanisms which the Commission is dismantling day by day, one type of product after another, whilst all MCAs must be abolished and the tax on oils and fats introduced which ought only to have been levied on imports from non-developing countries. Defending our agricultural potential is a priority mat ter. The example of the milk sector is a significant one. The EEC has lost sections of the market. It had 60% of them. Its share has fallen to 43% of the world mar ket. That is the proof that we must rebalance the EEC's agricultural trade, introducing a trade policy and restricting imports. NIELSEN, Br\u00f8ndlund (LDR). \u2014 (DA) Mr President, there has up to now been a line in the Community's agricultural policy aimed at ensuring that the Com munity could supply itself with its food needs. At the same time we have followed a line aimed at building up a modern European farming industry. I should like to use my short speaking time to try to get an appeal heard by the Commission. It is an appeal I have made before and I think it is a very important one, but I do not think that it has been given sufficient attention in the Commission. Efforts have been made to build up an efficient Euro pean family farm. In that process support has been given to some, for example, to abandon dairy farming, while at the same time others have invested in herds. That is something the public has not always been able to understand. But there was sound logic in it, since what we expected to achieve in the end was a farming industry able to produce good quality products at low prices and farms on which hard, inhuman working conditions were no more but which were modern and family-owned and run. I do not think that sufficient consideration is being given to this type of concern in the reforms which the Community is now trying to get through at great speed. I think that we should do some thinking on this and that the Commission should also come up with some initiatives on ways in which these farms in particular will be able to make the contribu tion we expect from them. The fact is that, while this type of farm has received support for its investment, it has at the same time taken out very considerable loans \u2014 in many cases at very high rates of interest, as in my country for exam ple \u2014 in order to accomplish its task. These farms must therefore not be left in the lurch now because the Community is eager to press ahead with reforms. But I regret to note that that is precisely what is happening. I realize that there must be an adjustment of the Com munity's prices, but it should not be carried out at such speed that it wrecks the other line of policy we have pursued in the Community, namely the develop ment of a common agricultural policy which can help ",
        "No 2-352/46 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Nielsen, Br\u00f8ndlund to make the Community a single unit, which the EEC package now set to take effect will also contribute to. That is a line we seem to be abandoning, and what will be the result? We have already seen it. We shall see the introduction of a whole series of national measures, and that is something no-one can really want. I should like to repeat my appeal that the line we have pursued hitherto be adhered to, and I think that Mr Marck's report and motion for a resolution make a reasonable contribution to this. BOUTOS (RDE) \u2014 (GR). Mr President, nobody doubts that the attempt to revise the CAP can have no other purpose than to adapt agriculture to market forces, so as to eliminate the surpluses. Only within the framework of a competitive and healthy market can farmers' incomes enjoy long-term protection, and the family character of European farming be pres erved. But what are the market forces? That is the basic question for me. Do the large subsidies of American farming, whether overt or covert, and grants within the framework of GATT make for a uniform international market, or do they disrupt it by introducing other, extra-economic and extra-agricultural factors? How long will Euro pean farmers have to shoulder the burdens of promot ing exports of industrial goods or supporting the aims of foreign policy, as happens with the importation of butter from New Zealand or oil from countries in North Africa? I think that though its proposals are on the right lines, the Commission is tragically underesti mating the social and political dimensions of farming for the southern countries, which are of course the least well developed. It is going against the traditional principles of the CAP, in other words the system of uniform prices, solidarity, and Community preference. It is prolonging the existing antithesis between North and South, and albeit unwittingly, leading towards the nationalisation of agricultural policy with all its conse quences, familiar and undesirable as they are to us all. Finally, with the probable replacement of monetary compensatory amounts with special equivalences, it is institutionalising the permanent division of the Com munity into regions, so putting paid to any idea of unifying the market and establishing the European Monetary System. A little while ago I listened to the explanations given by Commissioner Andriessen concerning the so-called agri-monetary problems. I am afraid I disagree with his statements, and I stress my concern about the suc cess of the system as he envisages it. But what is extremely important to my mind, Mr President, is that with its proposals the Commission is demonstrating the Community's unwillingness to take up the burden of implementing the new policies. For how can we speak of new policies when we are trying to transfer the financial burden of realising them onto the should ers of European farmers? I very much fear that from the time our vocabulary took on board notions such as inflexible financial dis cipline or fair rebates of national resources, we have distanced ourselves considerably from the vision of the United Europe envisaged by inspired men and des cribed in the initial founding acts of the Community. GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (ARC). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I see that the real and only opposition to this destructive agriculture policy stems from our Group. The groups and parties in Parliament argue about how big the price cuts for farm products should be, whether they should be real or nominal cuts, but they do agree that a further restrictive policy on prices is necessary and in this they support the policy of the Commission. One has the impression that these groups do not know the situation of Europe's farmers, for three-quarters of agricultural holdings do not have an adequate income, 50% of them live on their capital and one-third of them \u2014 I refer to the full-time farmers \u2014 have incomes below the social welfare level, that is to say below the minimum subsistence level. But it takes a long time for farmers to die off, and the indebtedness of the Community's agriculture is increasing. It has reached levels which threaten the existence of many holdings, which have become dependent on the hand-outs. The debts owed by agri culture to banks and industry are comparable to those owed by the third world to the industrialized nations. Only very few, the growth holdings which represent about 25% of the total, can exist at these prices. These are the assisted growth and industrial holdings which were deliberately encouraged to expand and which, with their streamlined production, can make a decent income even at these prices. But the mass of farm holdings are underpaid for their work. The effect of this policy is to make huge numbers of farmers redundant and destroy holdings. 350 000 holdings go under each year in the EC, 500 000 jobs are lost, and in the meantime the 25% of holdings producing at these prices have taken over 75% of production. This production is also concentrated on areas which are favoured in natural terms and in terms of transport access. It acts destructively here, whilst in the so-called disadvantaged areas production is no longer economi cally viable so that the small and medium-sized farm ers, whose work is ecologically the most beneficial, are being forced out of business. As a result the central point of policy is no longer the preservation of jobs but their loss, no longer the con servation of the countryside but its destruction.

The objective is no longer attachment to one's own land, but exploitation of the third world via feed imports on which industrialized farm production is based. We must find a different policy, and this means we must safeguard precisely these holdings which are ecologically the most beneficial in operation. We need them, not just to provide an ecological counterweight to destructive agricultural production, but because they are important, because in an ecologically inten sive production system they can provide healthy food and at the same time preserve our environment. We are the only group to say it \u2014 we do not need a policy of price cuts, but higher prices. We need drasti cally higher prices for basic quotas of agricultural production, basic quotas per holding and for all prod ucts. Production prices must rise, and if quotas have to be reduced, it must be where they are produced. The mass of small and medium-sized producers are not responsible for these surpluses, and it is really too bad to threaten them with price cuts and ruination as a result. But it is important that this preference for basic quotas should not take the form of premiums such as the fat tening premium or VAT in the Federal Republic. It ought to be tied to prices, because otherwise the receiving authority makes these premiums part of a price cutting policy and thus takes the funds for itself. A further word or two on oils and fats. We support the introduction of a tax on oils and fats because we think it will provide a safeguard for the many olive prod ucers. But a tax on oils and fats is not enough on its own. What we must do is use the resources made available in this way to support the small olive prod ucers \u2014 in the same way as is done in Norway, where a tax is levied on imported feedingstuffs. These funds must then be used to the advantage of the small hold ings, so that streamlining of olive production does not force the small holdings out of production, with a resultant dying out of farming activity on the scale already seen in other areas of production. TAYLOR (DR). \u2014 Mr President, Commissioner Andriessen has a major problem but it is not a problem of his own making. It arises out of inaction by the Council of Ministers in previous years. Of all the Members of the Commission, Commissioner Andries sen deserves the support of this House in his determi nation and courage to try and sort out the problems of the common agricultural policy. I hope in so doing that he will act in a manner which is biased in favour of the small farmers throughout the Community, because in that way he will help preserve the fabric of our society and maintain employment at its present levels. I would like to place on record our appreciation in Northern Ireland of the patience and interest he has brought to the particular problems we have drawn to his attention. As far as the oils and fats reform is concerned, we already know of the problems within GATT, the implications for the Third World and the United States of America. But it would mean an increase in the cost of living and, secondly, it seems to me a mea sure which would simply prolong surplus production in some other commodities since more funds would be made available to support such production surpluses. On beef I would like to see a reduction in the delay of the intervention payments. Currently they are running at a maximum of 140 days and I would like to see this brought down to something in the order of 30 days. In the case of sheep I would like the Commission to consider giving advance payment of ewe premiums, to be made to all flock owners and not just to those in the less favoured areas. When we come to milk, given the effects of the quota system, the justification for the payment by producers of a coresponsibility levy can no longer be sustained. The levy cost Northern Ireland milk producers in 1986/87 over \u00a34 million. Moves should be made to have this levy abolished. Finally, I would like to thank the Commissioner for helping to retain the coefficient of intervention for the Bramley apple crop which is centred in Lough Gall in Country Armagh at Unity. We appreciate that initia tive which helps an area where there is high unem ployment. ULBURGHS (NI). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the agricultural policy, especially Mr Marck. His report is realistic. I find the emphasis he places on the importance and dignity of small farmers particularly important. One of the main causes of overproduction has, of course, been the phenomenon of large farms, which are to blame for the enormous stocks we now have. They have also disrupted the markets and seriously threatened the self-sufficiency of the European public and communi ties. A sound agricultural policy based on small farms can easily strike a balance between production and con sumption, provided that the incomes of small farmers continue to be guaranteed. These small farms can help to solve the problem of the tragically high level of unemployment in Europe, particularly among young people. There are 13 million unemployed in the Com munity, including 5 million young people under 25. We detect a strong movement among young people to return to the land. Quite a number of them are look- ",

If society assures these potential young farmers of a guaranteed income, the movement to the land and worthwhile employment will be stimulated. Help should go not to large farms but to cooperation between small farms, which may also support small and socially oriented initiatives. In the short time allocated to me I should like to stress the importance of the relationship between agriculture and the environment. Small farms in particular can harmonize perfectly with the landscape and the envi ronment. Large farms are often guilty of overcropping. Woods, hedges, environmentally valuable areas are often ruthlessly destroyed. They drastically alter a his torically beautiful landscape and, worse, the structure of the land is often disturbed by erosion, the intensive application of fertilizers and the excessive use of herbi cides, pesticides and so on. I congratulate the agricul tural organizations on the growing emphasis they are placing on education and creating awareness and on the environment, in solidarity with the European peo ples, the European Community and also the Third World. Finally, I welcome the promise of a social and struc tural process to help farmers. I would therefore stress the importance of eliminating social discrimination, especially against small farmers. If the small farmer and his family have an equal social system as regards health insurance, pensions, child allowances and so on, the occupation of farmer will also gain in stature. WETTIG (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, when we speak of reforming the agricultural policy, which the present round of farm price talks is to take one step further, we must of course remember that we are in an extremely difficult situation, with enormous budgetary constraints, stagnating domestic markets and a stagnating world market, which must mean big problems for the farmers who are dependent on a Community agriculture policy which works prop erly. This burden is forced on the farmers because in the past we failed to change tack early enough in our agri cultural policy and because the signals sent for a long time to farmers from their associations and the agri culture ministers of the Community were the wrong ones. This is the origin of our major problems, and means that the corrective measures now being taken approximate to an emergency stop. Emergency stops always mean a hefty jolt and may also mean a few scrapes and bruises along the way. To quote just one instance in the past, in 1980, very early on, we drew attention in a farm price debate to changes in this system and urged that we should not give absolute pre-eminence to prices policy but should supplement it by direct income aids. This proposal by the Socialist Group, which I drafted together with my honourable friend Mrs Castle, was broadly rejected by the House and also by the Commission. We are glad to see that the Commission has now introduced a new policy with its green paper and is now making the ele ments of direct income aids part of its policy. There will be no lack on our side of constructive cooperation which the Commissioner has called for in today's debate here. As regards the price proposals themselves, I must con fine myself to just a few points. I agree with the Com missioner that the problems facing European agricul ture cannot be solved by a policy of thresholds and quotas, but that greater movement towards a system of that kind would intensify the problems because it would be even harder to manage a market with thres holds and quotas. I must make it clear that I cannot agree with the German agriculture minister's proposal of national quotas for cereals. We favour the policy of relaxing intervention, though we do not agree with some details of it, and we think the Commission would do well to look at it again. This applies particularly to the shortening of the inter vention period for cereals which would, if it had force of law, hit particularly the small cereals producers. We think the Commission was far too moderate in its pro posals on fruit and vegetables, and given the scale of intervention here, which nearly always means destruc tion, we do not think we should approve the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture, which would entail further squandering of resources. As regards the tax on oils and fats, I can only say on behalf of my friends that we see in this another Loch Ness monster popping up in the Community's agricul ture policy. This tax is not the way to solve agricul ture's problems on the oils and fats market; although I too think it is consistent with GATT, it would most certainly cause serious problems in world agricultural trade. In my estimation it would be more sensible to retain the status quo here and not create a climate for new conflicts. But the most important point is that the tax would spread the financial burden in an extremely one-sided fashion. I do not think it would be right to make con sumers pay for problems caused on the producers' side, because that too could have very one-sided effects and because consumption of oils and fats is also to be considered in a variety of ways. If general funds are to be used for it, they can be raised only by a gen eral tax and not by so specific a tax as the proposed one would certainly be. For this reason we cannot approve the proposal. Since the question of changing the agri-monetary sys tem is a very hot one in the Federal Republic I will end with a few comments on that. We believe the Commis sion's tendency to keep returning to the abolition of the monetary compensatory amounts is in principle ",
        "12. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/49 Wettig right and that a system of that kind must not go on for ever. We also think there has been too much concern with the subject in the Federal Republic, but that it would be right for the Commission, as originally intended, not to abolish them in one fell swoop, because this would cause excessive problems for the income situation in Germany's agriculture. For us this means that we shall not vote for the Commission's proposal in its current form. The Socialist Group has tabled a proposal which would make it easier for us, but which deviates from the Commission proposal, which we cannot go along with. To sum up: we support the Commission's basic orien tation. We have difficulties over a number of details, but that will not mean that we reject the Commission's package. GAIBISSO (PPE). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I wish to dwell in particular on the question of olive oil, which has given rise to a lively, animated debate. I must say, that taken overall, Mr Colino Salamanca's report is a balanced one: it is concerned to avoid the olive oil sec tor \u2014 in which production provides a livelihood for over two million workers \u2014 ending up as another sec tor in surplus and becoming a greater burden on the Community budget. Whilst it is true that the Com munity's present rate of self-sufficiency is over 100%, it is equally true that the sector sends only small quantities into intervention, at a financial cost that the Community's coffers can still stand. The need for rationalization is imperative in order to avoid crises in the sector, which would have the effect of substantially reducing present aid for production and consumption. This rationalization must however be effected through a whole spectrum of actions, which will review the terms, especially as regards man agement and the measures for monitoring aid prov ided for the sector. The action to be pursued falls under the following main headings: better management of the areas under olive oil production; the launching of a programme for the reorganization and, wherever possible, the conver sion of the olive groves; a prices policy that takes into account the inferior status of the olive sector com pared with other sectors that are more advanced and more quickly adaptable to the market; an overall oils and fats policy, capable of achieving a better balance between the consumption of olive oil and other veget able oils respectively, favouring the former because of its structural weakness, because of climatic and geo graphical conditions, and because of the biological longevity of the trees and hence the objective difficul ties in the way of possible conversion; and, finally, a shrewder monitoring policy so as to check, on the one hand, the authenticity of the production volumes declared and, on the other, to avoid fraud on both the EAGGF Guarantee section and the final consumer. It should be remembered that olive oil comes under the oils and fats sector, and that part of the problems today lies in the common market organization that governs it. Unlike other sectors, in fact, the olive oil sector has been left without commercial protection, especially in relation to imports into the Community of vegetable fats on a free basis, and hence without customs duties. That has caused budgetary imbalance in the oils and fats sector, and has made it necessary to apply complementary policies in order to support the production and consumption of olive oil and other oils such as colza oil, sunflower oil and so on. The Brussels Executive's proposal to apply a price sta bilization mechanism to the consumption of oils and fats of vegetable or marine origin, so as to make it possible to improve the relationship between the price of olive oil and that of other fatty substances, meets with approval in the Colino Salamanca report, and in the Mouchel report on the overall oils and fats policy. We are in favour of the introduction of this mechan ism, even though we know that some countries are firmly opposed to it; and we are in favour with a view to achieving a better balance between demand and supply where vegetable, animal and marine oils and fats as a group are concerned and, therefore, with a view to fostering new budget revenue, so as to streng then the inadequate resources available today to finance the healthier, more balanced management of the common agricultural policy. I will also add that olive growing has to be taken into account as a characteristic productive activity of cer tain Mediterranean areas, without which the protec tion of the environment also would be at risk. JEPSEN (ED). \u2014 (DA) Mr President, it seems to me that Parliament's Committee on Agriculture has never been as realistic as it is today. It has at long last got through to the committee that a restructuring of the agricultural policy is necessary. It is only natural that we should not be able to agree on how to do it. The fact that we have come to this realization five years too late, why that's just too bad! If we had acted very differently and had got a firm political grip on the problem years ago, we should have been the ones in control of developments, instead of now having to face the harsh fact that developments are controlling us. If we had been a little more forward-looking, the Commission would also not have been forced to prod uce the very restrictive proposal now before us. We owe it to our farmers to provide a rather longer period to implement the necessary changes than will be the case if we give full support to the Commission's pro posal. Over the years so many different elements have been incorporated in the agricultural policy that we should be justified in calling it a general store. How many farmers, ladies and gentlemen, can understand the common agricultural policy in its entirety as it is today? Surely nobody can. Only a few officials in the ",
        "No 2-352/50 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5.87 Jepsen Commission have the remotest chance of understand ing the many rules that have accumulated over the years. Let us simplify matters! We shall then be in a better position to control them. The key role should go to market and price policy. There should be no direct income support. The EEC is not a social benefit office. If assistance is to be provided, it should be funded by the national budgets. I have said so before, but clearly the Commission does not listen. It is my view that, if we are to secure a reasonable income for family farms of an adequate size, the farmer who can not live from his farming must understand that he has to supplement his income from part-time work on the side. Support should therefore be given to the develop ment and establishment of firms in rural areas, so that he has a decent chance of getting extra work. All other solutions will be shortsighted ones. It is patently obvious that we have now reached a point where we must limit production in many areas. However we must work to get agreements with other major agricultural producers, so that those limitations can be brought about worldwide. Otherwise our farm ers will be the only ones to pay the price, and that is not what we want. Although it might look that way. When we contemplate introducing a co-responsibility levy for grain produced in the Member States without at the same time imposing a duty on imported grain substitutes, it must look as though we are adept at finding all kinds of ways to make things difficult for our farmers. Let us instead get rid of this opportunity for fraud \u2014 yes, I said opportunity for fraud, and that is what I mean \u2014 before the illegality gives rise to unacceptable consequences. Let us instead show that we are able, by way of an intelligent and effective agri cultural policy, to overcome our problems by produc ing quality products, quality products of course for which there is a market. All things considered, bureau cratic levies and protectionist duties are not the way forward in a world in which stabilization needs to be based on agreements, not on war. That is also why we should not introduce the oils and fats tax; it is too provocative an example. I hope that the worst thorns will be weeded out of the Marck report so that we four Danish Conservatives can vote for it, because it is in fact a very good report. ADAMOU (COM) \u2014 (GR). Mr President, about a fortnight ago in Katerini \u2014 very near Mount Olympus \u2014 the farmer Vassilis Harisopoulos burned himself alive. In full view of thousands of farmers who were protesting about their unsold tobacco, he poured petrol over himself, ignited it, and blazed like a fire work. He committed suicide in this dramatic way to condemn the EEC's agricultural policy. In the cassette recording he left behind, he says: 'I have decided to protest on behalf of all the farmers in Greece. We demand a radical change in the agricultural policy. We remain hungry; industrialists make billions, while farmers content themselves with crumbs.' Mr President, there are no longer any gods on Mount Olympus to protect the poor Greek farmers. Today's gods, in other words the EEC's Executive Commission and Council of Ministers, live in Brussels and work out ways and means for the major entrepreneurs to make yet more billions and the poor farmers to receive still fewer crumbs all over the Community. Their pro posals, which we are now debating, prove that this is so, since they lead to price freezes and reductions, and to crushing burdens upon agricultural production. Concerning Greek farming products in particular, these proposals take no account at all of the five-fold rate of inflation, the enormously higher production costs, and the other special features of Greece's agri cultural economy. For example, it is proposed that there should be no increase at all in the price of fruit and vegetables, that prices for peaches, apricots and mandarins should be reduced by 5%, and those for lemons and oranges by 2.5%. A guarantee threshold and co-responsibility levy are being defined for oil. The intervention price for durum wheat is being reduced by 4.7%, there are insignificant increases for some Greek tobaccos, and reductions of up to 10% for others. Thus, the low prices, combined with quotas, co-respon sibilities, and various restraints upon production, will cause the income of poor and medium farmers to plummet, leading to the disappearance of thousands of farming households and to an even more acute crisis in Greece's agricultural economy. According to the Eurostat statistics, Greek farmers have the lowest incomes, while their productivity is only 40% of the average within the Community. Because of the common policy, livestock breeding is rapidly declining. In cattle alone, the livestock capital fell by 22% between 1981 and 1985. Yet Greece is having to pay a price as a result of the effort to reduce the Community's beef surpluses. Mr President, the Commission does not want to effect radical changes in the agricultural policy for the ben efit of poor and medium farmers. For example, it dares not oppose the aspirations of the USA, where agricul tural products are subsidised so that they can compete against the Community's products at prices amounting to dumping, so enlarging the Common surpluses. Mr Mouchel makes all this quite clear in his report. And something else besides. 80% of the EEC's subsi dies and interventions in the agricultural sector go to the major manufactures and traders, as the Committee on Budgets also mentions in its own report. Mr President, in support of the vital interests of hundreds of thousands of farm holdings in Greece, and in acknowledgement of the sacrifice by the tobacco producer Harisopoulos, we regard the Com mission's proposals as unacceptable. We condemn its attempt to load the EEC's financial difficulties on the ",

I think the Commissioner agrees with that argument himself, but we must do a lot more to sell this to the international community. MAHER (LDR). \u2014 Mr President, because I have so little time I must condense my remarks. I wish to ask the Commissioner why it is that the income support measures he has proposed are not being introduced at the same time as the prices. Is this another case of a measure that has been held out to us but is on the long finger? When will these measures, in fact, be introd uced? The other point which I would emphasize very strongly is that if these are put into effect in the way that has been suggested, as a mix of finances coming from the European Community together with finances from the Member State, then I believe it is another way of renationalizing the CAP. This should be a Community-funded policy and not a mix of national and Community money. These income supports are intended to replace price support measures, and price support measures are European. Now we are going back to partially getting money from the Member States. I would point out to you that this can bear very unevenly as between Member States. In some coun tries, such as my own country of Ireland, where agri culture is a large part of the economy, this can be very serious in terms of the demands made on our national purse, whereas, in a more highly industrialized coun try with a smaller number of farmers or where farming is only a small part of the economy, it will make very little difference to the national budget. This has not been taken into account. With respect to the income support measures, we have to be exceedingly careful that we do not push farmers into a poverty trap in the long run. When people receive money as a hand-out, there is a tendency for them, as experience in other sectors shows, to become more and more dependent on that hand-out. The essential difference between using money to support prices and using money to pay farmers directly is that if the money is given by way of payment for some thing, even for preserving the environment, it is a heal thier way and the farmer is in a better position in the long run. He is more independent and does not feel as demoralized as he would if he were receiving aid or some kind of direct subsidy. On the question of oils and fats, I would not be happy with this tax if it were not part of an overall package. I wish to underline the point that farmers in the Euro pean Community are now being asked to make very heavy sacrifices indeed. We are all aware of the prob lems. But when you bring it down to the level of the individual farmer, he finds it very hard to cope with this serious decrease in his income. We have to be able to explain more effectively to the Community in Europe and also to the international community, that we are making very heavy sacrifices and that we are also asking for some sacrifices from other sectors that My final question is this. Does the Commissioner know how many farmers are going to be displaced as a result of the policies he is now proposing and what will be the effect on unemployment in agriculture as a whole; not just in total but country by country? It is very important for us to know the effects of these poli cies now being proposed, in terms of unemployment and the money that will be needed in social aid to take account of that unemployment. (Applause) MARQUES MENDES (RDE). \u2014 (PT) Mr Presi dent, ladies and gentlemen, the measures put forward in the agricultural package for 1987/88 are intended to be pivotal in changing the direction of the Common Agricultural Policy; we are in broad agreement with this. But our broad agreement cannot be sustained if the vote here in Parliament later or in the Council of Ministers next week, leaves this coherent list of mea sures hopelessly watered down. As we all know, the agri-monetary measures and the oils and fats stabiliz ing mechanism form the core of the package. And if either element is sacrificed relative to the other, we shall not be able to accept this agricultural package. For our part, we are in agreement with the proposals relating to oils and fats; we see these as essential, both for dealing with problems anticipated in the oils sec tor, which, may I remind you, employs two and a half million Community farmers, and to promote oilseed output, where the Community has a notorious deficit. Having said this, Mr President, we must emphasize that we disagree with certain points in the proposals relating to prices and changes in market organization. For instance, in the oils sector, the proposed guarantee threshold is unjustifiable in view of the existing regula tion restricting production to defined areas planted with olive groves. While we support variable aid for small olive growers, we must point out that 100 Kg is a completely unrealistic limit, the sort of production level obtained in a garden, not on a farm. The reduc tion of the intervention period to the last four months of the marketing year and the abolition of the monthly increments are also unjustified given the characteristics of this sector. Nor can we accept the price reductions proposed for fruit and horticulture; we have not forgotten that price reductions are already implied in the recent changes in standard qualities, nor indeed does the current level of market supply justify them. This is particularly true of Mediterranean products. The same criticism applies to protein products, a sector where the Community is in deep deficit, as everyone knows. ",
        "No 2-352/52 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Marques Mendes Finally, we also consider the proposal to withdraw vine-replanting rights unacceptable, given that mea sures already exist in the sector to limit the production of wine, and that in a country like Portugal it could involve serious risk and certainly intolerable ageing for the national vineyard. So, Mr President, our position on the package of measures is favourable, assuming the incorporation of the changes I have just men tioned. These appear in the list of proposed amend ments due to be voted on next Thursday. VANDEMEULEBROUCKE (ARC). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there have already been quite a number of criticisms during this debate, but everyone will agree that Commissioner Andriessen has made an extraordinary effort to put the agricultural policy on a better footing. But when I read the Green Paper, I still feel slightly short-changed as regards the protection of the mixed family farm. The rapporteur, Mr Marck, says that one of the priorities should be the protection and development of the fam ily farm, and I would urge the Commission and Coun cil to take up his proposal that the additional reduction in dairy quotas should not apply to farms producing less than 60 000 litres. This is in fact an absolutely minimum requirement. In my opinion, we must even tually devise a system of differentiated prices under which farmers are paid a higher guaranteed price for a given quantity produced and progressively less the more they produce thereafter. On the other hand, a rigorous price policy cannot simultaneously eliminate surpluses and immediately guarantee farm incomes in every region. This can only be achieved by immediately linking the price policy to the structural policy, which we feel should account for 25% of the whole agricultural budget. Only then will we have a structural policy that is geared to people rather than products. A note of criticism for the rapporteur's ears. In my opinion, too little emphasis is placed on measures to combat fraud, which should surely be one of the high est priorities. It is unacceptable that farmers should be asked to make an effort when billions of ECU are winding up in the pockets of people who are fiddling the agricultural fund. I also support the rapporteur's view that not enough is being done to combat the trend towards substitute products. Finally, I feel more attention should be paid and more financial resources should be devoted to scientific research into new crops. This is a very sound and very balanced report. I congratulate the rapporteur. We shall therefore vote for this report. BUTTAFUOCO (DR). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, this year once again the Commission proposes measures which, in our view, would once more question the functioning of the majority of the common market organizations on which the common agricultural policy is based. In addition to the decisions already taken as regards milk, beef and certain fruit and veget ables, the Executive's proposals will end up by causing a new fall in prices at the point of production and in the incomes not only of the farm workers but also of everyone for whom farming is their main employment; and they will have a particularly harmful impact in the Mediterranean regions of the Community, which are most hit by the Community's present policy. Taking due account of the way the economic situation is developing and the enormous surpluses that exist, and until such time as a long-term agricultural policy is introduced, we agree with the Commission's propo sal to keep prices at their present level, and we hope to see this price control applied to all agricultural prod uce. We also hope that effective measures can be prop erly worked out in advance, and that they will be tho rough enough to guarantee the efficient management of the markets. We hope that the programmes for the disposal of the stocks that are at present in existence, and that have an adverse effect on market prices, will immediately be implemented. We hope that the princi ple of Community preference will be strictly re-estab lished, promoting the research and development of alternative products that are at present under-prod uced within the Community, and that the sectoral and regional balance will be improved, with temporary aid to agricultural workers in difficulty and the launching of a rural policy designed to underpin an agricultural base in areas that have natural or socio-economic dis advantages. Convinced that a return to a system of single markets and, as a result, standarized price is a matter of abso lute priority, and convinced also of the need for economic and monetary stability, so as to allow the abolition of monetary compensator)' amounts, we express our support for the Marck report, with the inclusion of the amendments presented on behalf of the Group and approved by the Committee. CASTLE (S). \u2014 Mr President, I always enjoy it when Mr Andriessen gets his dander up and hits back at the farming lobby in this Parliament, though I am sorry that he has got himself diverted into the dangerous and costly irrelevancy of the oils and fats tax. Any sup port I give him today must be taken to exclude that completely. Of course he is right when he says that he has to talk about the budget. Agriculture must fit into the overall budgetary situation just as any other section of the economy does. When we come to look at the budget ary situation, we find that the Commission's price cuts, freeze and related measures constitute the absolute minimum to begin to deal with the budgetary deficit. The Commission has told us that that deficit will be running at 3 500 million ECU in the current year and the new measures will only save 1 200 million ECU in 1987. It is true that the Commission claims there will ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/53 Castle be much bigger savings in 1988 \u2014 savings of 3 500 million ECU. But, of course, two-thirds of that is due to come from the oil and fats tax which, I can assure the Commissioner, he will never get through the Council of Ministers. Meanwhile the economic non sense of the CAP continues virtually unchecked. It is outlined vividly in the Commission's Explanatory Memorandum, Volume I, and shows that we are still not finding an economic market for the vast amount we produce. So it is clear that the Commission's proposals should have gone much further. Most farmers could have taken much bigger price cuts without hardship. Their costs have been falling dramatically, as the Commis sion shows, in the past year: electricity costs, for example, are down by 20%. Smaller farmers, on the other hand, should be helped by far more generous direct aids. My British Labour colleagues and I have tabled an amendment to that effect, which I hope the Commission will accept. Nonetheless we will accept the Commission's propo sals as a minimum first step in the long overdue pro cess of reform, provided those proposals are not weak ened in the course of the voting. We tabled amend ments to carry the Commission's proposals to their logical conclusion. Take cereals, for example. The Commission has pointed out that the structural surplus is rising relentlessly and that by 1993, if we do not do something drastic, the stocks will amount to 100 mil lion tonnes. So the Commission proposes a small price cut for barley, rye and sorghum, but only a price freeze for common wheat of bread-making quality. I want to know why there is a difference, particularly as Table I of the Explanatory Memorandum in its ori ginal form did visualize a cut. Now we have received a corrigendum. Why? Because intervention has become an outlet in its own right, as the Commission puts it, in this sphere as well. I take also the position in oil seeds. Again the Com mission has pointed out that production has expanded rapidly in the pursuit of the mistaken policy of self- sufficiency in oil cake at any cost. What has been the result? Inevitably we get an excess of the oil. Rapeseed oil will be running at 148% of self-sufficiency this year. Ridiculous! Sunflower oil will soon be catching up. It is the encouragement of this production which has heightened the difficulties in the oils and fats sec tor. The right way is not to pass the burden onto the consumer through an oils and fats tax but to reduce the maximum guaranteed quantity. This, again, we are proposing in our amendments. I am sorry Mrs Jackson is not here, because I wanted to reply to an attack she made on me, among others of my colleagues, in the piece of pre-electioneering she introduced into her report, which she was supposed to be delivering on behalf of the committee as a whole. She said: 'Look at our committee \u2014 a Greek Socialist voted for the oils and fats tax. How can Mrs Castle live with that?' She knows perfectly well that the Bri tish Labour Group is unanimously opposed to the oils and fats tax and launched into its campaign against the Commission on this long before the Conservatives found that it was, from their point of view, respected. But she knows also that there is a division between North and South agricultural interests in our common agricultural policy. It is true that the Socialist Group is divided on this oils and fats tax, but so are the Euro pean Democrats. Mrs Jackson failed to mention the fact that the 14 Spanish Conservatives have demanded and got the right to a free vote on this oils and fats tax in order that they can vote for it. So what hypocrisy to mention the one Greek Socialist! The question is this: are we going to be consistent? Are the European Democrats going to be consistent across the whole field of the restraints on the economy which are absolutely necessary? For example, will the European Democrats vote for our proposed price cut in the intervention price of common wheat of bread- making quality. As the Commission has pointed out, in 1985 25% of the common wheat production could not be sold without subsidies and the stores are groaning with the surpluses. Will the European Democrats accept the Commission's limitation of ewe premiums? Of course they will not, because they say it is in their national interest. So let us have a little bit of under standing and sympathy for our Greek and Spanish col leagues who have got a problem in the olive oil sector. But let us, nonetheless, point out firmly to them that they are going about it in the wrong way when they try to railroad us into this nonsensical oils and fats tax. Finally, Mrs Jackson says: 'Don't we, on this side, think of the burden of the oils and fats tax on the con sumer? My heavens we do!' But the burden of an oils and fats tax on the consumer will be as nothing com pared to the burden of value-added tax being added to food, which is what the European Democrats secretly support, though they got Lord Cockfield to withdraw his proposals for VAT being imposed on food in Brit ain. They were to have been introduced at the begin ning of May. Now he suddenly tells us they will not be ready until the end of June. May I just point out to this Parliament that there will be a general election in Britain on 11 June and that that is why the date has been changed. So I support the Commissioner in his attempts on everything but the oils and fats tax, I encourage him to do more and I denounce the Con servatives' hypocrisy.

        "No 2-352/54 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 IN THE CHAIR: MR AMARAL Vice-President had no knowledge of this vote. Second, I repeat, the relevant documents were distributed and were avail able in all languages before the vote. What was decided was therefore carried out. McMAHON (S). \u2014 Mr President, I should like to raise a procedural point about the vote this morning concerning the food stocks. Many Members were una ware that a vote was going to take place and docu ments were not available in all the languages. Mr See- feld, who was in the Chair yesterday evening, closed the sitting without announcing that the vote on the request for an early vote would be taken this morning at 9 a.m. Neither did he read out the agenda for today, although the minutes approved this morning imply this. If he had done so, more Members and members of staff would have been available for that important vote. I draw your attention to Rule 40(3) which says that Parliament shall decide 'as soon as the motion for a resolution has been distributed'. This is an interpreta tion of Rule 42(5), on which the amended version of this Rule 40 is based. It has always been accepted in this House that a motion for a resolution must be available in all languages before a vote. The motion submitted by the British Labour members on this ques tion of food stocks was not available in the Chamber in all languages at 9 a.m. this morning, and I wouid appeal to you, Mr President, to have a further vote on this at 9 a.m. tomorrow. NEWMAN (S). \u2014 Mr President, it was not stated last night that there would be a vote this morning. It may say in the Minutes that today's order of business was announced at the end of the sitting. Those few Mem bers who were at the close of the sitting last night well remember Vice-President Seefeld hurriedly closing the sitting \u2014 to put it tactfully \u2014 and certainly the full announcement which appears in the Minutes was not, in fact, made last night. All that was said was that the sitting was closed and would resume again in the morning. The vast majority of the Members of the House were not aware that this vote would be held this morning. I am the author of one of the resolutions and I did not know. I do not think that was due to any fault of mine or of my advisers. Perhaps certain people who did not want that early vote to take place con tacted Parliament's services and made sure that they knew that there was a vote which would take place without the vast majority of Members knowing, but many Members of the House were here at 9 a.m. and could have been present if they had known a vote would take place. I do not think that vote represented the will of the House and it is important that it should take place tomorrow when everyone knows that it is on the agenda. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr McMahon, I would point out that before the vote, before 9 a.m. this morning \u2014 this was confirmed by staff now present \u2014 the documents were translated into all the languages and distributed to all Members before the sitting began. McMAHON (S). \u2014 You did not make it very clear, Mr President, whether or not we were going to have a vote tomorrow as I suggested. My information is that the documents were not available. I do not know what kind of advice you are getting on this, but I am relia bly informed that the documents were not available. Some of my British colleagues in the European Demo cratic Group had tabled resolutions in English which I did not receive until after 9 a.m., after we had taken that very quick vote this morning, which was very poorly attended because many Members were una ware that a vote was going to take place. So I appeal to you to reconsider your decision and to allow us to have a vote again at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr McMahon, I am sorry I cannot give you a further explanation at this moment. Cer tainly the Bureau can give you in private the explana tion you wish, but I repeat it was announced at the end of the sitting yesterday that the vote would take place at 9 a.m. and therefore no Member can say he PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Newman, obviously I can have nothing to do with your questioning of the intentions of the Chair in deciding that the vote would be held at 9 a.m. There can have been no intention on the part of my colleague in the Chair to keep Members from being present. Once again, I maintain that the inten tions of the Chair were perfectly correct. I would just say, to close the matter, that I shall submit the issue to the Bureau as soon as I have completed my time in the Chair and, naturally, you will be given a reply by the Bureau in due course. 1 LUCAS PIRES (PPE). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposals have already been subjected to detailed analysis in several speeches and I therefore prefer to concentrate on the background to the proposals as they affect my own country's relationship with the European Economic Community. I have to say that we view the develop ment of the Common Agricultural Policy with a cer tain sense of injustice. Why this feeling of injustice? Debate on topical and urgent matters of major importance (list of subjects selected) \u2014 Announcement concerning the vote on the Baron Crespo/von Wogau report: see Minutes. ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/55 Lucas Pires Because 25 years ago the various countries grouped together to form the European Common Market were told to produce more, to produce better quality, to produce dearer goods. And now that Portugal and Spain have joined, European countries and European farmers are being told they must try to produce less. We are appalled by the fundamental injustice of the situation: the fact that for 25 years there was an explo sion in European agricultural output while in my country there was stagnation, virtual stagnation, or even, as in the last 10 years, an actual decline in prod uction. What we were hoping for from Europe, at least for agriculture, was the opportunity to increase our production. For us in Europe modernization means growth, parti cularly agricultural growth. We cannot modernize our agriculture without the chance to increase output. This fact must be recognized. I appreciate that penalties must be introduced to cut back the Community sur pluses but this must not be done without taking account of the wide variety of circumstances. It is true that we have some protection, some shelter up to 1990. But in farming three or four years are nothing and we will not be able to reconvert our agriculture in so short a time, at least in the biological sense of the term. That is why we find these proposals broadly negative on balance, although we have to understand them from the point of view of the position Europe has got into. But I want to ask the Commission to consider this point: cohesion between the countries of the Com munity is general, not just agricultural, and affects every aspect of development, but for Portugal priority must go to agriculture because 24% of our population depends on it and we surely represent a uniquely unfortunate case within the European Community. This is why it is essential that Europe help us make the technological leap needed to reduce agricultural prod uction costs, for example, so that, through this reduc tion in costs, we can face up to the price-stabilization that is now taking place. We understand the reasons for the Commission's decisions and we recognize the positive efforts that President Delors and Commis sioner Andriessen have made to promote goodwill in this area. But agriculture and farming in Portugal have to recover, and we must also ask the European Econo mic Community to increase its support for sectors such as woodland cultivation, whose viability is vital to our country's agriculture. In the name of unity, cohesion and solidarity, and with the rapid approach of 1992, this is the very least we can ask for. This is also the reason for our particular disagreement with the oils and fats tax which particularly conflicts with our inter ests. In spite of the intended positive effects of this tax, the few positive effects, and the amendments that have been introduced in consideration of the related inter ests of Mediterranean countries, we must inform Par liament that its effect on our country will be on bal ance negative and costly. It will also have grave domestic and international consequences. Europe must preserve this European olive oil and wine, which may be new to the European map, but is no less a part of Europe's future for that. If the policy is to develop high quality European supply, there is no doubt that olive oil is Europe's own oil and a foundation for bet ter quality. So we are not satisfied with the proposals in terms of economics, even though they may be finan cially necessary. Finally I want to thank the Commission again for the efforts it has made in the spirit of European solidarity, but I do so in the hope that the Europe which came into being and was enlarged for the sake of the weak may continue to develop along those lines. PROVAN (ED). \u2014 Mr President, may I start by thanking our colleague, Mr Marck, for all the work he has done in bringing this report before Parliament today. He has had a difficult year and has come through it exceptionally well. The overall position of the Commission, as far as agri cultural policy is concerned, can be summed up as moving in the right direction. But I regret that this year \u2014 and I am sorry Mr Andriessen does not seem to be listening very attentively at the moment \u2014 the Commission has taken a new direction which it was trying to reverse last year. In bringing forward a fats and oils tax, it is interfering further with market forces, rather than allowing the market to orientate itself in a freer area where we could have a proper consumer choice developing. Further, I do not believe that the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which last year took some very basic principles on board, is really facing up to those same decisions this year. That is unfortunate. The 1992 objective of abolishing green currencies in the Commission's proposals is to be welcomed. We have 32 agricultural policies at the present time and farmers, as I think everybody would accept, should get paid the same in all Member States if we are going to have a common agricultural policy. It is totally wrong that beef farmers in Germany. Holland and Italy, for example, are getting almost one-third more for their beef animals than farmers in the UK. The same is true of wheat. Why should UK producers expect 30% less for their products than other producers in the Com munity? It is not good enough if we are going to have a common policy. We have to move Europe forward: this Parliament must start moving Europe forward and if we are ser ious about a common agricultural policy, we should be having a common currency at least for those farmers to be paid in too. I know we all base ourselves on the ECU so why do we not stand up for what we believe in. Abolish MCAs, have agricultural trade and farmers paid in ECUs at their option. Border problems would thus be removed and we would not have problems in 1992. I am afraid the dilly-dallying that the MCA/ green currency situation is causing at the present time means that it will be impossible to reach a proper ",
        "No 2-352/56 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5.87 Provan internal market arrangement by 1992 unless Mr Andriessen does something about it rapidly. I now turn briefly to the beef sector. It is not in a good state at the present time. The dairy sector is interfering with the beef sector and it is wrong for decisions that are taken to control milk production radically to inter fere with a different agricultural sector. But that is what is happening. I hope the Commission will accept an amendment which has been accepted by the Agri culture Committee for further private storage or inter vention to be made available for surplus dairy cows. Sheep are obviously an area that is going to be a hot subject for the next 12 months at least. I accept that all regimes require monitoring and review. It would be wrong if we did not review existing regimes. The sheepmeat regime is one of the greatest benefits that the European Community bestows on Scotland and we must make certain that we do not write off our less-favoured areas as has just been said by the pre vious speaker. Sheep are vital to the survival of the less-favoured areas and ways must be found of helping the people and not necessarily the product that comes from those less-favoured areas. Assistance should therefore, I believe, be tied to the people on the farm, or labour units if you like, and thus the people and industry and the whole rural economy would be gain ing support from that regime. If that means tying the ewe premium to a limited number of ewes on the farm so be it. But do not propose a maximum number of ewes per farm. A maximum number per person but not per farm. If I can very quickly conclude by saying that the legal base for the oils and fats tax is not correct. I am quite convinced that some Member State somewhere will take the Commission to court on the legal base of the oils and fats tax. I would like to ask the Commissioner where that would leave his price proposals today if that is to be challenged in the court. The agricultural policy will be billions of ECU short and the whole structure of European agriculture will therefore suffer. What can he do about it? other agricultural products should not be limited, and of course we must put high cost surpluses behind us without penalizing those who did not and do not con tribute to them and are barely affected by them. So although the Commission's proposals claim to tar get some of the objectives referred to earlier, we think it is a blinkered policy; it is certainly not neutral, prin cipally because it pays no attention to the fact that some countries have specific agricultural problems. How can the kind of policy set out in the Commis sion's proposals be applied to Portuguese agriculture without grave consequences, given that Portugal is already in deep deficit in food and other agricultural products, with prices substantially higher as a rule than those prevailing in the Community? The Treaty of Accession provides for harmonization of prices, to take place during the transition period, for cereals in particular, and this is only going to be achieved through an already drastic reduction in farmers' incomes, even assuming a significant devaluation of the Escudo relative to the ECU. The introduction of alternative crops is hindered too, either by lower prices, by reduced intervention or by lack of aid as in the case of sunflowers. Olive oil production is increas ingly controlled with intervention increasingly limited, while derisory aid is allocated to a minute number of growers. Qualitative changes are to be introduced in the restrictions on vine-replanting. The intervention price for beets will have serious repercussions in the Azores, putting a question mark over the economy of this autonomous Portuguese region. And as if that were not enough \u2014 and there are many more exam ples we could mention \u2014 the suggestion is that Portu gal should contribute to the cost of the surpluses, for instance the butter surplus, added to which, though different in character, there is the intended introduc tion of the oils and fats tax. As mentioned before, in the unacceptable situation which faces us today serious measures capable of achieving significant change are urgently needed, but not just any measures. And we especially reject measures which only multiply and aggravate the problems because they ignore individual, but important, circumstances. MIRANDA DA SILVA (COM). \u2014 (PT) An agricul tural policy which simultaneously creates huge and costly surpluses and fails to prevent substantial imports, wipes out thousands of farmers, especially small farmers, absorbs the majority of the Community budget and has caused a notorious financial crisis, and, worst of all, favours the economically stronger countries to the detriment of the weaker, is an untena ble policy. Therefore urgent and far-reaching mea sures are needed which clearly cannot be limited to price and intervention, but must take proper account of the great variety of different countries and regions in the EEC. The interests of small farmers must be protected, economic balance maintained and crop div ersification made possible; the production of regions and countries that are heavily in deficit in food and GARCIA (LDR). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, fixing farm prices in the EEC has never been easy. In this crazy annual head-to-head, the various interests, farm lob bies and political strategists of the different countries engage in obvious or subtle games, but always against a backdrop of mutually recognized parameters: the excessive cost of agriculture in relation to other Com munity activities, an annual budget made meaningless by unwanted output coupled with a glaring lack of own resources. The Commission's proposals, and indeed the analysis of the Marck report, clearly demonstrate that the 1987-88 farm prices are influ enced almost exclusively by budgetary constraints. 1987 seems to be 'the year of living dangerously', for we are getting dangerously close to introducing a tax ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/57 Garcia on oils and fats whose purpose is neither evident nor transparent, but which is apparently indispensable for these budgetary reasons. We are left bewildered. And the doubts and queries surface. In the first place, who is going to gain from this tax? Certainly not the con sumer who will pay more. In fact, at 330 ECUs/ton, we forecast an increase of 100% on imported and 50% on Community-produced oilseeds, and 15% on olive oil. So should we not oppose the measure? But if the tax is not applied, there would have to be addi tional expenditure from the EAGGF amounting to 4 000 million ECUs. No-one can support a deficit like that. Should we then be in favour of this tax? We are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea because both options are bad and open to severe criti cism. But one thing the tax could bring is the hope that the savings it produces could be channelled into mod ernizing agriculture in less-favoured areas, promoting alternative crops or, most important, protecting small family farms. Moreover, in the long term farm prices must be a means to a reorganized Common Agricultural Policy which must involve strengthening the structural pro grammes \u2014 and here good intentions are not enough \u2014 running down the surpluses, and this requires real financial power not budgetary artifice, and a stable intervention system, which implies adapting supply and demand correctly. Finally, it would be interesting to find out to what extent the future interests of the agriculturally weaker States, like Portugal, will be safeguarded, because agriculture is only one element in a vast world trade, as some on the other side of the Atlantic are well aware. The weak cannot be made to pay for something they were not responsible for and did not want. That would be immoral. BARRETT (RDE). \u2014 Mr President, fundamental issues are at stake in the Commission's proposals on farm prices for this year. Issues such as the Green Pound adjustment, cereals, butter intervention and the whole question of the oils and fats policy come immediately to mind. Last year quotas were reduced while the arrangements for intervention for dairy products and beef were adapted. The farm price pro posals for 1987/88 represent a further step in changing the direction of the common agricultural policy as we know it. The proposals are typified in price freezes, reductions and stepbacks. The decisions that are to be taken will have a crucial impact on the incomes of more than 1C million farmers in the Community. Allied to this is the major consideration of the family farm. In a country such as Ireland the importance of ensuring an adequate income for the family farm is interlinked with the Community's farm price deci sions. What do the present proposals mean for us? They mean either a freeze in prices or reductions in the sec tors which are of major concern to Ireland. Some of the price freezes that are envisaged relate to milk, beef and sheepmeat. In other words, the backbone of the Irish farming industry. I want to underline the fact that the fall in Irish farm incomes in Ireland for 1985 and 1986 has been in the order of 25%. This is totally unacceptable. It makes a mockery of the principles of the common agricultural policy aimed at ensuring a fair standard of living. Nor should the employment element be forgotten since agriculture and its related industries are our largest employer. The problems in the oils and fats sector have been compounded by the fact that the Council has failed over a period of years to take appropriate action. The problem now is that expenditure in the oils and fats sector can no longer be sufficiently controlled without a stabilization system. Action is overdue. A stabiliza tion arrangement for the oils and fats sector will, I believe, also improve the competitive position of butter and butter-oil. I have one concern, however, with regard to difficul ties for the fish-oil producers in Ireland. They are located on the West Coast which is the most disadvan taged area of Ireland. Their vulnerable position must be taken into account. I am proposing that some form of compensation of grant aid be considered for fish-oil producers. CHRISTENSEN (ARC). \u2014 (DA) Mr President, we have no confidence in the Commission's proposals for measures and prices as a means of getting the over production of farm products under control. We are even less confident that the proposals will be suited to the task after they have been discussed in the Council of Ministers. It is the very principles on which the agri cultural policy is based that are fundamentally wrong. When you guarantee prices and markets regardless of the cost to taxpayers, consumers and the environment, irrespective of demand and without regard to trading partners and the world in general, things are bound to go wrong. The solution is not increased protectionism, planned-economy measures and levy penalties \u2014 all that is what created the problems. The solution is a systematic and unwavering adjustment to the market and assistance over a long transition period to farmers who have to leave the industry. What is really new in the Commission's proposals is the introduction of an 'oils and fats tax'. The consu mers' organizations, the food industry, business asso ciations, the trade union movement and our trading partners, including those in the Third World, have expressed their unanimous and vehement opposition to this monstrosity. Such an oils and fats tax would be a direct violation of the Community's obligations under Gatt and the Lom\u00e9 and Asean agreements. It is socially undesirable and a charge on the consumers, and it is illegal because the Community does not have the right to levy taxes. All things considered, it can be said that the Commission's intentions are good, but the remedies it proposes will in many respects make ",
        "No 2-352/58 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5.87 Christensen the illness worse and its chances of getting them through the Council of Ministers, to the extent that the proposals are good, are slim. That applies, for example, to the restrictive policy on grain prices. Clearly there is a need for the total collapse of the entire agricultural policy, before anything effective is done. EYRAUD (S). \u2014 (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the Single Act we are required this year not simply to draw up a general resolution on farm prices but to propose amendments to draft Commission regulations, which are often extremely technical. Quite apart from the question of substance, this poses two questions. The first is legal in nature: on what proposals can Parliament table amendments? The other is political in nature: has Parliament the means to amend Commission proposals and is it appropriate for it to do so? Some of these proposals, which feature in the document submitted to Parliament by the Com mission, are not subject to an official consultation. The Council of Ministers claims that since they are imple menting and administrative measures rather than policy regulations, Parliament is not required to state its views. But the efficacity and political significance of a text depend closely on the way in which it is applied. Bernard Thareau and I have retained a number of amendments deemed unacceptable in the Committee on Agriculture because we believe that Parliament, a democratically elected political institution, ought to be free to state its views spontaneously on texts which are not officially put to it for consultation. Also, the price proposals imply calculation and econo mic analyses which Parliament is perhaps not equipped to make. Is there not a danger that it may fall victim to demagogy, and concentrate on the small points whilst overlooking the big ones? A more appropriate job for Parliament would, it seems to me, be to draw up a report on the marketing year now past, from which Parliament could sketch broad lines for the next three years. We are in fact faced with an astonishing paradox: just as it is normal and oppor tune for us to be consulted on technical implementing texts if we feel that there is a political stake behind them, it appears difficult to tinker with the price pro posals and preserve their technical coherence whilst at the same time steering them in the desired political direction. We shall have to bear this contradiction in mind when, in future marketing years and with the Single Act in force, our consultation will be an even more important and solemn matter. Now to the substance. The current agricultural con text makes it obvious which measures must or should be taken on prices for the next marketing year. The agriculture crisis is worldwide. All, I repeat all farmers in the major producing countries are receiving aid. In the Community, the system of guarantees across the board and unlimited as to volume has led to stocks for which there is no market, a concentration of agricul ture and the squeezing out of the small holdings. Budget funds are stagnant and the CAP is distorted by agri-monetary problems. As a result, the measures taken must be commensurate with the interests at stake. Those really to blame for the surpluses are the big intensive agricultural concerns, which are big users of imported substitute products, fertilizers and are thus big polluters. They should be the prime targets of any measures to limit production volumes. Falls in prices must not mean the disappearance of the small farmer. The widespread granting of direct income aids, hard to accept in social terms and a heavy burden on the budget, would in my view only delay the disappear ance of family-based agriculture, which is wrongly deemed unprofitable, without any attempt to develop its potential. The related socio-structural measures which are needed have been put off for too long. And one wonders what kind of development will be attracted by the Commission's latest proposals? We for our part say no to a freeze on land use, which is synonymous to us with desertification, a flight from the land and unemployment. We would prefer to see the countryside developed. This would be done via greater attention towards sectors in which there is a shortage, the launching of programmes to conserve the soils and the environment, promotion of tourist and leisure amenities on land which has been taken out of agricultural production. It also means rejecting the cumulative penalties which have been imposed. No one denies that we need to control production vol umes. But restrictive prices coming on top of quotas and/or co-responsibility levies will inexorably mean the disappearance of the small farmers, especially those in areas which cannot be converted to other pur poses. It is also a matter of record that any measure applied uniformly to large and small farmers, in rich areas and poor, is inegalitarian. We thus propose dif ferentiated measures. For example, exemption from the co-responsibility levy for those producing less than 25 tonnes of cereals per year, exemption from the milk quotas for those producing less than 60 000 litres of milk. We also support seasonalization and a ceiling on the ewe premium pending overall reform of the mar ket in sheepmeat which would open up the system of variable premiums to all the Member States and thus restore simple justice among them. Although efforts must be made to stop some producers systematically producing for intervention, there can be no question of doing away with intervention. It must remain as a regulating factor. At the international level the Community can in no event consider unilateral agricultural disarmament which would mean the loss of these markets. It must stand firm and speak with a single voice to third coun- ",
        "12. 5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/59 Eyraud tries within GATT. Any effort which the Community makes to control production must thus be extended to similar imported products. Similarly, the production and importation of products which contribute to sur pluses trebles the cereal substitute products. One word more, if I may, Mr President, to say that we endorse the tax on vegetable oils and fats proposed by the Commission, which will thus be borne in a non discriminatory manner by both Community and third country producers. The monetary compensatory amounts must be abolished altogether. You will find these proposals in the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group and the French delega tion. I trust that the House will take account of them. BLUMENFELD (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I should also like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Pol Marck, for a report which, given the controversial situation here in the House, is in many respects a good piece of work. But I do not know what gives me more reason to tear my hair: the lack of perspicacity shown by the finance ministers in the Council as regards the decisions which are years overdue on financing the costs of the com mon agricultural policy, or the one-sided defence of their own interests by many agricultural lobbyists, here in this House too. But I can no longer get excited about the finance ministers who, for more than 5 years now have left themselves, the national parliaments, the Community media and us too in the dark about the true position of the European Community's finances and resources. In view of the short speaking time available to me I shall talk only of the controversial tax on oils and fats proposed by the Commission, which Vice-President Andriessen has vigorously defended today, though without convincing me and other members of the House. I challenge the Commission, Sir, to prove that you had no way of financing the market organization in oils and fats other than by a levy or tax. I also urge you, if this tax on oils and fats is approved, to demonstrate and guarantee the efficiency of such a measure for your systems. I don't think you can. It is not our job as Parliament to devise alternatives for you, but we are required either to approve or to reject a Commission proposal and thus give the Council, which regrettably has the sole power to decide, an indication of our views. For many years I have spoken out against any form of tax on oils and fats. The reasons, briefly, are these: One: no tax has ever been abolished! They also have the inbuilt ability to be increased further and further, and in view of the proven increase in costs on the oils and fats market this will doubtless be unavoidable. Two: this tax would set a significant precedent, because the national parliaments will ask us what new source the EC will be tapping in future \u2014 a tax on energy, beer, or something else? Three: this tax is not subject to normal budgetary con trol. It circumvents the budget, and that is a serious matter. Four: its legitimacy vis-\u00e0-vis GATT and the EEC Treaty is in dispute, and nothing the Commissioner has said convinces anyone in this House. Five: it is a burden on the consumer, as already out lined. Six: it conjures up a grave external conflict with the developing countries and the US, which will be a grave threat to Europe's industrial economy and to free trade. For all these reasons I speak out decisively, on behalf of many of my colleagues too, against any tax on oils and fats. (Applause from the centre) CATHERWOOD, Sir Fred (ED). \u2014 Mr President, Field Marshal Montgomery once told me that the first rule of war is: never march on Moscow. Our first rule today should not be quite so dramatic, it should be not to provoke a trade war which cannot be won. The oils and fats tax is the most provocative action we could possibly take against America. In one quick blow it would hit half of the exports of half a million Ameri can farmers and destroy the economy of their indus try. The Americans do not want a war, they want peace with Europe. But they are in a mood to be pro voked. The protectionist Omnibus Trade Bill has already gone through the House. An oils and fats tax would add fuel to the flames, it would help to drive that bill through the Senate and into law. The imme diate effect of that would be to divert Japanese exports from America to Europe, and that would do great damage to our trade, our industry and our employ ment. Our industry, our jobs and our economic future depend on the 90% of our exports which do not need subsidy and not at all on the 10% of our exports which are sold at a heavy loss. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Americans at every level \u2014 in the Administration, the Senate, the House \u2014 all want to negotiate for peace between us in farm trade. I know, because I have talked to them over the last four years and very recently. They want to sta bilize production, raise prices and cut subsidies. I know they would respond very positively to a proposal that three wise men on either side \u2014 political heavy weights like yourself, President-in-Office \u2014 should negotiate a bilateral agreement which could then be incorporated into a wider agreement in GATT.

In their present mood they would most cer tainly cut us out of every international market. They would exclude us wherever we compete with them and shatter the finances of the CAP. That is one reason to reject the oils and fats tax, and it is reason enough. We should solve our problems through peace and not through war. ROSSI (COM). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, the firm con viction of the Italian Communists, that the CAP, which has now reached such an acute state of crisis, must be very radically changed, is well-known. Equally well-known is our rejection of any corporate or national refusal to look facts in the face: an overall, harmonious view is necessary, in order to put in hand a Community agricultural strategy that will meet the requirements caused by the changes that have taken place in recent years. There is no question of scrapping the 'Green Paper'! On the contrary, as Mr Gatti said this morning, we have to implement it. We cannot however proceed along these lines without consistent decisions in conformity with the principles of the Treaty of Rome. We cannot accept a two-tier approach \u2014 the sort of approach, Mr Commissioner Andriessen, that we again find reflected in the Com mission's decisions so far as Mediterranean products are concerned. Even though we support much of the Commission's approach, we cannot accept that it should on the one hand propose a price freeze for continental production, which is already massively protected by the guarantee mechanisms, whilst pro posing, on the other hand, in respect of Mediterranean produce, which has already been hit by last year's decisions, an appreciable reduction in prices. In effect, we do not accept that it should always be the weakest who pay. The call for a prices freeze for Mediterranean prod ucts, which we nevertheless support, is not sufficient: in order to get rid of imbalance and disparities we have to put in hand, decisively, a structural investment policy, so as to make Mediterranean products compet itive both in quality and as regards production costs. Above all, this seems to us the road to avoid recourse to the immoral practice of withdrawing produce for destruction. DI BARTOLOMEI (LDR). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament is finding it dif ficult to face up responsibly to the complexity and all- embracing nature of Community problems, and some times it seems to me that it is ready to conform to sectoral interests. Three different positions that are emerging \u2014 one the Council's, one Parliament's and one the Commission's \u2014 are too many. If we do not stick to the Commission's positions, the Council of Ministers will continue to avoid taking decisions. If, therefore, we wish to show that we have a sense of responsibility, we have to express our opinion on agri cultural prices taking into account not only the con cern of the farmers \u2014 which is justified \u2014 but also the consequences, in terms both of the budget and of external relations. As far as the budget is concerned, the Commission has outlined to us the disastrous situation on more than one occasion: not only is there no margin for new increases, but even the proposed price reductions are insufficient to enable agricultural expenditure to be met. In this connection, Commissioner Andriessen did some very clear talking. Of course, the European Par liament supports the need to increase resources, but we have also always said that new resources must above all else be used to finance structural measures, to promote economic and financial cohesion, and to transfer resources from the more developed regions to the more backward regions. The outcome of the com mon agricultural policy has instead been to give more help to the very people that needed it least \u2014 that is to say, the more efficient farmers in the economically more developed regions. That is why, Mr President I cannot agree with the Committee on Agriculture, which proposes amend ments that, where cereals alone are concerned, would involve increased expenditure to the tune of over a million million. I shall therefore vote, along with the Republican and Liberal members of the Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group, in favour of the Com mission's original proposals. On the other hand it is true that the price reductions should be accompanied by structural measures designed to offer alternative production and help for the lower income groups, and from this standpoint the delays of the Council and the Commission itself must be decisively condemned, as Mr Gatti condemned them this morning. I hope that the measures now put forward by the Commission will finally have the effect of convincing everyone of the need not to delay reform of the CAP any further. With regard to the consequences of our agricultural policy on external relations, I, too, should like to emphasize the risks that we might run as far as exter nal trade relations with the United States and the Lom\u00e9 Convention countries are concerned, if the so-called 'tax on oils and fats' were introduced. Fin ally, I hope that Members \u2014 those Members to whom the fate of the developing countries is of importance \u2014 will allow me to say that, if we want those countries to continue to keep their markets open to our prod ucts, we must keep our own markets open as well. If we really want to extend a helping hand to President Alfonsin, to the young Argentinian democracy, we have to decrease our protectionism, and that will do far more than a hundred fine declarations of intent. ROMEOS (S). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the Executive Commission is putting before us for debate an incom- ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/61 Romeos p\u00edete package of prices, since it concentrates only on cereals, fats and oils, and monetary compensation amounts. The fragmentary nature and diverse timing of these decisions do not allow us to grasp all the aims of the Commission's policy, both product for product and in relation to production category. It is obvious, how ever, that the Commission is perpetuating its restrictive policy on prices and placing limitations on the inter vention mechanism in an unfair way and without due perspective, by a parallel definition of guaranteed quantities. Such a policy may lead to some cutback of expenditure, but will certainly reduce the incomes mainly of the smaller producers. For example, if the Commission's proposal to reduce cereal prices by 2.6% and at the same time reduce intervention to four months is implemented at once, without a period of adaptation, serious problems will be created, mainly for the small producers. The Committee on Agriculture noted this danger and supported the functioning of the intervention mechan ism for six months. At the same time, however, we will have to relate the intervention mechanism to the quality of the product. I refer especially to durum wheat: it is unacceptable for Member States who are not traditional producers and cultivators of durum wheat to produce vast quantities, with qualitative cri teria which do not respond to those laid down, and then to have recourse to intervention and hence create serious financial problems. And now, Mr President, I turn to the particularly con troversial matter of amending the situation concerning fats and oils. I consider that the Commission's propo sal offers no substantial solution for problems in that sector, but will certainly contribute to improving the prevailing situation. On the Agricultural Committee I supported Mr Mouchel's initial proposal to impose variable contributions, as the most dynamic solution to problems in the sector of fats and oils. Today, how ever, we cannot vote against and reject the Commis sion's compromise proposal, because it too can contri bute to solving the financial problems in that sector, which have become particularly severe in recent years because of the continual fall in the international prices for oil-bearing seeds, virtually to the level of interna tional dumping. The consequences of this situation are particularly det rimental, both for the Common budget and for the Community's oil-seed producers. As for the impact on consumers, I could term it an illusory problem since the Community can negotiate with multinational com panies within its territories to have them absorb the increase, as in fact happened some time ago with raw material prices. Concluding on the fats and oils sector, I should like to point out that once more it will be olive oil which is sacrificed to balance the market. However, I consider it totally unfair to reduce the intervention period to four months. Olive oil's most important problems were clearly expressed in the report by Mr Colino Salamanca, this morning. Mr President, considering the proposals on agricul tural prices as a whole, I emphasise that the Commis sion is persisting in a policy of discrimination and une qual treatment of the Community's products. At least, it is inexplicable why the Commission should propose more favourable prices for products in surplus as opposed to products from the Mediterranean coun tries in particular, which are almost all in deficit. The provocatively unfair treatment of nearly all products from southern countries comes just after the disaster of Chernobyl and the recent bad weather. Quite clearly, this policy is leading the CAP into an even greater impasse. It encourages surplus productions and wipes out those in deficit, which are usually the prov ince of the smaller producers. And on this point it must be stressed that the measures to support small producers are trivial, if indeed any exist at all. Still worse, most of these measures refer to national sup port. Anyone can see quite easily that such a policy will increase discrimination between producers, since the level of national support will be directly related to the economic strength of each Member State. And the smaller producers do not usually live in countries with a strong economy. The system of income support introduced by the Commission does not serve the basic aim of the CAP, namely to secure a satisfactory income for producers, particularly those in mountainous and problematic regions. Finally, the Commission's proposals omit the most important measure for a review of the CAP, namely socio-structural measures. The pricing mechanism cannot safeguard market balance and farmers' incomes at one and the same time. Mr President, as I said at the beginning, the Commis sion's proposals point the way to the CAP's new orien tation. Specifically, two main directions are emerging: derestriction, and re-nationalization. Quite sincerely, we are unable to follow the Commission's intentions. All the Community's institutional bodies have accepted that the Single Act will never materialise unless we progress decisively towards economic and social cohesion. Tomorrow, we will once more have an opportunity to support the basic intentions of the Delors proposals. But it should be made clear from now that immediate derestriction and renationaliza tion of the CAP undermines every effort towards cohesion. Mr President, we, the elected representatives of the countries in the South, note with concern the contin ual weakening of the CAP's role. If, in our inability to agree a balanced review of the CAP, we propose its destruction as a solution, in other words re-nationali zation, then I no longer understand what kind of United Europe we can be talking about in this Euro pean Parliament. Let us understand that the continual discrepancy between words and deeds leads to loss of ",

IN THE CHAIR : MR MUSSO Vice-President KILBY (ED). \u2014 Mr President, the oils and fats tax proposal would cost one company in my constituency of Nottinghamshire two million pounds per year and another company, one million. Manufacturing process changes were in hand to reduce the saturated fats con tent in their products in line with Comma recommen dations. They would have to change direction yet again if the Commission's proposals are adopted. These imposed cost increases would be passed onto the consumer thereby fuelling inflation. Understandably, such companies vigorously oppose the measures and are dismayed at having to cope with two politically inspired schemes which are contradic tory. When normally supportive managers lose confi dence in the Commission they also lose confidence in Parliament. Those who believe in free trade and fair competition will surely vote against proposals which are blatantly protectionist and which discriminate against those countries which are internationally com petitive. Such proposals also appear to run counter to GATT rules and to the posture taken by the Commis sion in the recent GATT round. The Commission seeks to resolve current trade differ ences with the United States, but these proposals expand the area of disagreement. Those who believe in aid to the Third World know full well that the propo sals will hit many poor countries. In summary, the Commission is proposing the wrong strategy to solve the agricultural budget problem which rightly concerns us all. Perhaps it is looking for the solution in the wrong direction. If you have a defi ciency payment scheme which finances the difference between EEC and world prices, don't you also have a built-in budget inflation factor? If this is so, isn't the answer to the problem to change the deficiency pay ment scheme and tackle the social problems separately using structural funds? Protectionism is not the answer to the social problem. When you protect one group of workers you penalize the majority who end up footing the bill in higher prices and taxes. I support the broad thrust of the Commission's proposals but not the oils and fats tax. IVERSEN (COM). \u2014 (DA) Mr President, every so often one hears the view put forward that the problem of the Community's farm policy is that it has been too successful. A quantitative increase in agricultural prod uction of over 20% since 1973 leads easily to that con clusion. But the truth is that the price of that increase in production has been much too high. This is without considering the environmental damage, which has per haps been the most serious of all. But let us stick to a purely economic view of the situation. The price has been the production of unsaleable surpluses, at collos- sal expense to the Community. We see that expendi ture on the EAGGF Guidance Section in the period from 1973 to now has risen by 80% at constant prices. There have in addition been a number of national sup port measures. All in all support to agriculture, according to new American studies, cost each Com munity citizen 1 500 kroner in 1986. Consumption just could not keep pace with supply. That is a fact. But the argument that the EEC is still a net importer of agricultural products prompts the idea on occa sions, the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Den mark for example, that the solution is to be found in a more aggressive exporting policy and greater protec tionism, including the proposition that animal feeds should be covered by the normal levy system. The truth is that, while EEC imports of agricultural prod ucts in the period 1980-86 expressed in ECU rose by 21%, exports increased by as much as 40%. Further more it is a fact that net imports of grain substitutes have remained constant over the past six years. The strategy is therefore to set the scene for international confrontation in trading policy, which is also a slap in the face for the developing countries. We have great sympathy with parts of the Marck report and the Commission's approach, but we reject both the oils and fats tax and monetary compensatory amounts. We also reject income support arrangements and early retirement measures because we consider that they confuse agricultural policy with social policy. Let me finally say that new figures show that the oils and fats tax will mean an absolutely unacceptable price increase of over 100%, and we are resolutely opposed to that. BUCHOU (RDE). \u2014 (FR) Very quickly I should like to stress the problem of cereal production. I know that in Europe this production poses a number of prob lems, which have been raised in a variety of forms, but it must not be forgotten that this production of cereals is part of the great wealth of Europe. It helps the equi librium of the balance of payments of various coun tries and the equilibrium of the entire agricultural economy of Europe. I wanted to make the point because we must stop always seeing only the negative aspects of something which is one of the essential ele ments of the Community's wealth. And in this context I would urge that in the mechanisms introduced, inter vention should be extended to six months. This is what the Commission wants, and I should be glad if special account could be taken here \u2014 Mr Andriessen knows what I am talking about, because we had a meeting in Brussels recently on this subject \u2014 of the special case of maize. The harvesting dates of this cereal are not ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/63 Buchou the same as for wheat, and the intervention period needs to be extended in the case of the maize market. As regards oils and fats, we face a clear reality, and the proposals made are serious, coherent proposals which further the building of Europe. We must think of that. What surprises me is the frequent evocation of the fear, a fear which is not even respectful, of the power and capacity of the United States for retaliation. This is something rather surprising. If it is a pretext, never mind, we can sort it out, we shall talk about it. But if it goes deeper, if it is really a fear which is graven on our hearts, that the US is capable of making Europe trem ble, then that is something more serious. It is far more serious, because we represent a power which is equal to that of the United States in economic terms. That country does not hesitate, when its interests are at stake, to take a number of retaliatory measures. So, Mr President, I merely wished to end by hoping that we shall not go in fear of the United States for ever over the economic problems which beset us. VERNIMMEN (S). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year as every year, though this time with some delay, we have the debate on the Commis sion's price proposals. If this debate on prices is to be accorded the political value it deserves, it must not, in my opinion, be seen in isolation from the general problems, which the President of the Council has sum marized very satisfactorily. We must also, I feel, stop the pathetic game of knowingly advocating price rises, despite the Commission's proposals, when we all know full well that our demands often cannot be met, let alone paid for. We must ensure that the debate on prices is at last used to tackle the real essence of the matter, as indeed the Treaty requires. As part of the macroeconomic policy the common agricultural policy can only meet the economic demands made on it if a genuinely restrictive price policy is pursued. I am therefore able to accept the Commission's price proposals, while the rapporteur prefers to opt for a price freeze. The related measures must fit into the overall price package. I therefore feel that a slightly longer intervention period should be allowed in the cereals sector. The price level in the Community must also be gradually brought into line with the world market level. Apart from these purely economic objectives, due account must be taken of social and environmental cri teria. The socio-structural measures needed to pres erve family farms must therefore be taken simulta neously, and I stress the word 'simultaneously', because it is rather pointless talking about the price proposals today when the other measures will not be debated until later. When I refer to socio-structural measures, my thoughts turn first to one or other form of direct incomes support, which must above all benefit small farmers. In short, a new, realistic price policy with appropriate structural measures is condition No 1 for the reform of the agricultural policy. The non-food sector still offers many prospects provided, however, that our prices are competitive with world market prices. A brief word about oils and fats. I am personally able to endorse the Commission's position: stabilization mechanisms by means of a levy on imports are, I feel, necessary and desirable. I therefore believe there is sufficent scope in this sector since the prices of raw materials are lower today than they were in 1971 and it is clear that the processing industry, and I am not anti-industry, can afford a levy. It is not a question of abusing the consumer today for the sake of certain objectives. That needs to be said. It is not a question of holding the Commission responsible. Various multina tional undertakings are responsible for certain high prices in certain sectors of the oils and facts industry. That also needs to be said. To accuse the Commission of all the sins that have been committed is quite simply wrong. We must find a solution for our own produc tion. FR\u00dcH (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, this prices debate is different from its predecessors. Not only is it very late, and that is not the fault of the Commission, which is usually blamed, but a debate of this kind and in this form \u2014 and anyone familiar with this proce dure in our Parliament, I see that the Council Presi dent is smiling his agreement, will confirm that \u2014 has never before taken place. We are currently in the midst of a process of truly enormous efforts to reduce stocks. It has not been easy, but we have managed it. We are discussing quo tas and extensification in agriculture, socio-structural measures which are becoming a decisive moving force in the agricultural policy. The countryside as a whole is being rediscovered. And, one scarcely dares say it \u2014 part-time farming is nothing old and outmoded, but something new. Great importance is also being given to regionalization, even if there are those who fear that it might turn into renationalization \u2014 our Irish friends will know what I mean. We can discuss all that, and then it will be clear to everyone that this is a completely new farm debate. It is thus a pity that the chamber is so empty, that so many members are leaving and not listening to what is being said here, and are for the most part not listening to what the Commission is proposing. If these people had stayed in the chamber, many a speech would not have been possible. Do not misunderstand me, Mr Commissioner, Sir, it is not thanks to you alone that there is now a degree of momentum in the agriculture policy, but it is partly thanks to you. It is not the fault of the Council Presi- ",
        "No 2-352/64 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Fr\u00fch dent alone that it has taken so long. But the difficulty of accommodating all the additional factors was more the fault of the Council than of the Commission, and this needed to be made clear. Much has already been said today, and I shall thus go into detail on just three points. The position of my Group was made clear by the rapporteur, to whom I am truly grateful. He has presented a report the like of which we have not seen before. If the House goes along with the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food it will be approved by a majority. This report even threw the Committee on Budgets into confusion. My dear Marck, I salute you! The simplistic formula held hitherto \u2014 prices down, and all will be well \u2014 is now defended by only a few pundits, and I could almost count them on the fingers of one hand. It no longer has credence even in the Commission, not even with one of your great prede cessors, Sicco Mansholt who, as my honourable friend Mr Bocklet said, sees things very differently today. We thus hope for your understanding. All the measures which the Commission has labor iously churned out and which have encountered great difficulties in the Council, and I mean all the measures including the transfer of revenues, are in fact useless if one follows a consistent policy of price cuts, because they never bring in as much as they lose. Withdrawal from production? Fine, all right. But then let there not be a few agriculture ministers in the Council who seek to intensify and produce even more, but later want to send their over-stressed farmers on holiday to the hill farmers, because they are not farm ers any longer and thus get the chance of a holiday on a farm ! Just one sentence on the subject of monetary compen sation. I was very glad to hear the Commissioner refer to this as a 'good thing'. New thought should be given to the matter of negative monetary compensatory amounts. He was right to say so! They stimulate prod uction and ease inflation. That is a starting point for discussion. Lastly, I would have liked to know \u2014 and I am very sorry that my honourable friend Mr Blumenfeld is no longer here, or I would have asked him \u2014 what was the origin of the paper in our pigeonholes which speaks of the inadmissibility of a tax on non-butterfats under the EEC Treaty. I must say, anyone who talks of butterfat and tax has still not understood the discus sion which has been going on for the last fifteen years. I should be grateful if the Commissioner would clarify one thing: it is not the green front, not the incorrigible farmers who have brought this question up, but the Commission by its proposal to limit production vol umes. If this proposal is not consistent with GATT, then the entire CAP is a priori not consistent with GATT. We should not keep avoiding this. Mr Wettig put it very neatly: 'we have nothing against it, but it has to be a general tax.' And yet we know full well that a general tax will not get through the national parliaments. And that is an end to the matter. It is bad that the Council repeatedly quarrels over national attitudes. You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have a solemn duty not to keep taking your differences of opinion out on the CAP! The same goes for high officials in the Council of Ministers who sound off in leading German newspapers about the impossible agricultural policy. From their high posi tions in the Council of Ministers they ought to do rather more to help solve the problems! FIMNIS (COM). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the Commis sion's proposals on farm prices were drawn up in the context of the more general economic climate which prevails today, and in the face of common budgetary difficulties. We certainly understand those difficulties, but the Commission's proposals only take account of the financial cost, and ignore other very important aspects. The functioning of the CAP is not unrelated to whether economic and social cohesion are to be prom oted or inhibited. Because we certainly cannot think that the Funds alone are responsible for cohesion, as opposed to the Community's policies as a whole. In the past year agricultural production in Greece sus tained two major disasters: contamination by radioac tivity from Chernobyl, and the recent cold spell, which destroyed over 30% of the crop production. The price fixing proposed by the Commission fails to distinguish between products in surplus and those in deficit, between the products of major agricultural enterprises and those produced mainly by small family undertak ings, or between products from rich as opposed to poor regions, and so drives large groups of producers to despair and impels us towards the re-nationalization of the CAP, despite the Commission's very correct assertion that such a thing must be avoided at all costs. Finally, the Commission does not accompany its pro posals with specific measures of socio-economic sup port for producers in mountainous regions, as it had promised to do. It now asks us to lower prices, with out linking that reduction with any measures of sup port for the regions so sorely tried. More specifically: there has been no move towards the measures her alded by the Community, such as promotion of alter native cultivations, production of differentiated and qualitatively improved products, production of harm less forms of energy, support of farmers' incomes by promotion of parallel activities for the conservation and improvement of the environment, and immediate and effective support for the incomes of small family undertakings in mountainous regions. FICH (S). \u2014 (DA) Mr President, I readily acknow ledge that the Commission has taken a courageous ini- ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/65 Fich tiative on the Community's formidable problems in the farm sector. But at the same time I do not think that its initiative has been especially wise in all fields. I would mention three points on which I do not think the Commission has got the right approach. The first area I would mention is the grain sector. I agree with the direction the Commission has indicated here for the grain sector. There is no doubt that inter vention must be limited and that prices must be reduced. But the effect of what the Commission pro poses is a de facto price cut of 10-15% to the prod ucers this year. This consequence in my opinion is too severe. I do not think there are many producers who will be able to absorb it in a single year. I therefore think that it would have been more appropriate for the Commission to proceed in the manner now proposed by the Socialist Group, ie to spread this action over several years, so that it becomes a gradual process. In other words we go along with reduced intervention at the present time \u2014 not as much as that proposed by the Commission, but a reduction nevertheless \u2014 and call on the Commission to come back and continue the same policy over the next few years. In this way the correct objective, as laid down, will be achieved, but in a somewhat gentler manner for the producers. The second area I wish to deal with is the question of the oils and fats tax. I am absolutely opposed to this tax. I think that it is an anti-consumer tax. It has been said many times that it will mean higher expenditure for the consumers, for example on margarine. That is not what worries me most. What worries me is that the oils and fats tax will reduce the consumption of veget able oils to the advantage of other types of fat. Doc tors in my country \u2014 and I suppose in other countries too \u2014 all maintain that it is in the interests of every one's health to use vegetable oils. I therefore think that the Commission is displaying an anti-consumer atti tude here. I also share the view that the tax will lead to a trade war, quite apart from the whole discussion on whether it is in conformity with GATT. That discussion is in fact fairly irrelevant. I think it will lead to a trade war, because the USA will not accept the introduction of such a mechanism. The worst aspect of all this is per haps that the oils and fats tax will not solve the real problem, namely overproduction in our oil and fat sec tor. In my view it is nothing more than a financing instrument. Although I realize that the Community's funds are in deficit, I think that the correct approach would be to try to limit production so that it adjusts to consumption. Let me add in this connection that, if we decided to introduce a financing levy, we should in my opinion do so under Article 201 of the Treaty of Rome. I do not see any other possibility, nor can any of us here. That means that it has to go through the national Parliaments. The third point I would mention is the question of the monetary compensatory amounts. Here I am to some extent in agreement with the Commission. But I do not think that it is being bold enough. The Commis sion should act faster to phase out the monetary com pensatory amounts and, amongst other things, I do not think it is being bold enough on positive monetary compensatory amounts. We all know that that will create problems in a single country. But it has to be seen from the point of view that the producers in that country have for years had an advantage which is now being taken away from them. We cannot maintain that advantage just because they are upset at the prospect of losing it. I am glad to see that the Marck report clearly states what should be done concerning the negative mone tary compensatory amounts. They should be abolished here and now and not, as the Commission proposes, only the turn of the year 1988/89. It is important to uphold the principle that every country has the right to devalue its green currency when there has been a cor responding adjustment in the country's general exchange rate. There was a currency adjustment on 12 January, and my country for example has not so far had the possibility of making a corresponding adjust ment in the Danish green krone. This is a violation of the principle accepted hitherto that the green curren cies should be allowed to follow the normal currencies on devaluation. Finally I should like to say that some time may elapse before the price package is finally adopted, and that of course creates great uncertainty for the producers, which is unreasonable from all points of view. It is par ticularly unreasonable because it is nothing new. It is a situation we get every single year. We are never ready \u2014 almost never at least \u2014 on 1 April, when we really should be, to let the producers know for certain where they stand. I would therefore conclude by saying to the Commission: there is an old proposal that the pro cedure for the farm price negotiations should be adv anced, so that we might be sure of being ready on 1 April, and I should like to reiterate that proposal. TOLMAN (PPE). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, today's debate does not concern insurmountable differences of opinion. I believe it offers a real opportunity for a compromise between the Commission and Parliament. There are various reasons for this. Firstly, this debate on prices is less important than it has been in previous years primarily because some very radical decisions have been taken in the meantime. Where milk produc tion is concerned, there was, for example, December's decision to cut production by 9.5% and then the agreement reached by the Agriculture Council in Feb ruary putting an end to the authomatic nature of inter vention in the butter and milk powder sectors. This means that the often very divided Agriculture Council has decided that the fixed and total guarantee is a thing of the past. I must also say that the Com mittee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has changed ",
        "No 2-352/66 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5.87 Tolman its tune dramatically. Last year a restriction of inter vention was out of the question, as we can see from various reports. Paragraph 34, and I congratulate Mr Marck on this result, is very revealing: it says that intervention must be made to function once again in its original role of a safety net. This bears witness to a sense of reality. That is the second reason why a price debate is less important. After all, a discussion on prices where intervention is limited in the case of market organization products is more theoretical in nature. It is in some respects a dis cussion on 'paper' prices. The enormous disparity in farmers' potential earnings within each Member State of the European Com munity leads to the following harsh conclusion: the price policy is no longer able to provide adequate guarantees for the development of the incomes of all farmers, or it results in the formation of immense stocks and, consequently, in uncontrollable spending. The better production areas are well able to produce in a way that is geared to the market with a lower guarantee. Direct aid to support the incomes of small farmers \u2014 paragraph 34 \u2014 is therefore unavoidable, which is why I consider paragraph 34 one of the most important in this report, unless we are prepared to pursue a quota policy in every sector. I feel that would be impossible and undesirable. The millions now being spent on the milk quota without achieving anything would then spread to other sectors. We must simply get back to the premise of the com mon agricultural policy: production where produc tions is cheapest. Parliament encourages new technical and industrial developments. European agriculture must not be relegated to a second- or third-rate posi tion by curbs on production in fertile areas. It is now time to pursue a market-oriented policy in agriculture and a social policy for the problem areas. Finally, a word of criticism to the Commission for leaving the growing of alternative crops of which there is a shortage in the lurch too soon by drastically reducing prices. And a compliment on the balanced and particularly important proposal for the oils and fats policy. With these two points at the end of my statement I feel I have indicated the weakest and strongest aspects of the proposals. DALSASS (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, in view of the extremely difficult position we find ourselves in it was anything but easy to come up with acceptable price proposals. But it can fairly be said that the farm prices package outlined by the rapporteur and approved by a large majority of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is an extremely bal anced one. As others have done before me, I have to congratulate the rapporteur on a job well done. But the proposal is also very responsibly couched because on the one hand it takes account, in setting the prices, of the Community's very difficult budget ary position and because it also, in rejecting the Com mission's proposed price cuts, goes as far as possible towards meeting the demands of the farmers. That merely underlines once again that a policy of pressure through prices is unacceptable because it does not limit surpluses but does harm the farmers. For me that would be reason enough to vote for the price proposal. But there are other considerations. Firstly, mention is made with regret of the absence of a proper Community monetary policy and of the negative effects of this when it comes to setting com mon farm prices. These common farm prices unfor tunately take effect differently in countries with a stronger or a weaker currency, which is why the sys tem of monetary compensation was introduced to cor rect any distortions. But this system itself seems to be in need of correction. It was mentioned here earlier. The Commission must come up with something here, to prevent farmers in some countries suffering detri ment for currency reasons, otherwise there is the dan ger that gradual renationalization of the CAP will ensue. A further reason for approving these proposals is the introduction of the mechanism to stabilize the market in vegetable oils and fats by means of a levy. This will give the Community an additional source of revenue to make use of. Even more important: the entire sector will be brought under control and an explosive rise in the relevant EC budget spending will be avoided. The Council above all should take this to heart and act accordingly. Only in this way can it prove that the agricultural policy still means something to the Coun cil and that it is still interested in reforming it. It should not be forgotten that the proposals to stem the milk surpluses without harming the farmers came from Parliament. The Council should thus not miss this second chance. Certainly there is room for criticism that these price proposals have not more firmly incorporated all the socio-structural measures, because these measures are now particularly necessary to improve the income pos ition of family-based and smaller holdings. Unfortun ately they were submitted to Parliament too late. We shall consider them in detail later, because they are particularly important. Despite this negative point I shall vote for this price package and I hope that Parlia ment will do the same. STAVROU (PPE). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, all that we have heard in the House today about our colleague Mr Marck's report on farm prices, leads me to con clude only that the breath of optimism that stirred with the publication of the Green Paper has disappeared, without any trace to justify some hopes of solving the ills of the CAP. Neither the Damoclean sword of ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/67 Stavrou re-nationalization, nor the immediate threats to the Community's very existence from the explosive situa tion generated by the Augean stables represented by the agricultural surpluses, have proved factors suffi cient to bring to their senses any of the Community's three institutional bodies which carry the entire res ponsibility for the mire in which its agricultural policy is immersed. And first of all, Parliament itself Mr President, which this year unfortunately again chose the method of hundreds of amendments, largely inspired by regional or national interests, to provide solutions for structural problems; in other words, problems which could only be solved by a truly European policy of solidarity. The Minister told us this morning that all this is hap pening because the Commission's proposals were put before Council very late, not until February, and even later before the Committee on Agriculture. I am sorry to disappoint him, but I must tell him that even if these proposals had been ready by the end of last year, the situation would have been still worse. From Parliament we would have had a few dozen more amendments, and from Council a few more all-night marathons. What is lacking, Minister, and what could really untie the Commission's hands, is our own, and by extension your political will to bring about a real break. I repeat for the umpteenth time in this House, the question: When will the twelve Ministers decide defin itely and irrevocably to produce in the north what is appropriate to the north, and in the south whatever it is advantageous to produce there? When will the Commission interchange the proportion of expendi ture on guarantees with the proportion on restructur ing? And finally, when will we stop financing and issu ing uncontrolled guarantees for quantity to the cost of quality? In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to add a brief comment to say that the mechanism proposed by Mr Mouchel is now necessary if we are to salvage from the CAP what can be salvaged, in the hope that this kind of 'aspirin' policy will swiftly be followed by an inspired European policy, the only thing that can solve the now permanent problems that we face. This same train of thought is echoed in the magnifi cent report by our colleague Mr Colino Salamanca, and I would like to add that his proposals'for a wider campaign on behalf of settling the ills of the produc tion-trade cycle pertaining to a refined product such as olive oil find me in complete agreement. MORRIS (S). \u2014 Mr President, it has been a long debate, but I hope that it will sway the Commission, especially when it comes to the issue of oils and fats, because what the Commission proposes as a so-called stabilization mechanism in the oils and fats sector is no more and no less than a tax on oils and a tax on fats. In my opinion it is ill-conceived. It is a tax that will obviously push up the price of a whole range and variety of foods, such as margarine, cooking oils, bis cuits, cakes, confectionery, chocolates, soups and, of course, the traditional British fish and chips. The con sequences of this tax will be to increase the price of food, especially those foods which people on low incomes \u2014 the old age pensioner, the unemployed and the low-paid \u2014 find essential to their lives. If they are compelled to spend more money on food, they will obviously have a lot less to spend on other necessities. So the oils and fats tax will hit the consumer, but the less well-off consumer. There is also another threat, and that is the threat to those employed in the margarine manufacturing sec tor. In Liverpool alone, an area where there is deep deprivation and job starvation, it is reckoned that the introduction of an oils and fats tax could put a possible 6 000 jobs at risk. Just as important or even more important to some of us \u2014 in the North we are sufficiently strong because of our traditional working-class organizations such as the trade unions \u2014 is the fact that this tax will also harm the people of the poorer part of the world, the Third World. In a year when Christian Aid wants to give more power to the poor, what the Commission proposes flies in the face of our claim to be encourag ing the Third World to develop its own agriculture to the point where it is not only self-sufficient but can even earn its way in the world alongside the more prosperous nations like ourselves. It is a cruel piece of self-deception on the part of the Commission and cer tainly a cruel piece of deception to perpetrate on the Third World to imagine that the money raised from such a tax can be redirected to Third World producers as a compensation to offset the decline in the oils and fats prices of the goods that they would export to us. Administratively, this is unworkable. Even if it were workable, the money would find its way at the end of the day into the pockets not of the poor of the Third World but of the landowners and the factory owners. I therefore hope that this Parliament will do what my group intends doing, and that is to vote against the oils and fats proposals. HAPPART (S). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, politics is the organization of life in society. It is the moral duty of men and women in politics to give back hope to the young people who all want to work. These young peo ple in the agricultural sector are ready to play a posi tive part in developing our supposedly modern society. They do not want to be condemned to subsist or to suffer a negative policy. They are not social parasites. It is unfair and insulting to call them life-long spon gers. In the specific field of agriculture the farmers expect, what am I saying, demand of you that you practise a ",
        "No 2-352/68 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Happart determined policy geared to the future. The farmers are not responsible for the various mountains and lakes created by the agricultural surpluses. Their only sin is to be too good at their jobs. They have quite simply followed the advice and directives given by the Community. Governing is foreseeing, so they say. But we have had everything, except foresight. There has been an unac ceptable lack of initiative. It is not that too much is spent on the Community's agriculture, but that it is spent badly. Obviously, this money badly spent is not wasted for everyone. Think of research into uses of agricultural products for purposes other than food. When there are 34 million people seeking work in Europe, 16 million of them unemployed, it is criminal to freeze land here whilst the multinational financial powers invest in Indochina the profits they have real ized in Europe. They are developing the industrial use of vegetable carbons which are indispensable as raw materials and as parts of the new composites needed by industries based on the new technologies which manufacture biodegradable plastics, for example. Attack is the best means of defence. So we must attack, rather than spend considerable sums on distill ing poor quality wines, or storing and destroying but ter which is not needed because of unfair competition from oils and fats imported duty-free and at a price which does not even provide a decent living for the farmers who produce them. Another and final point: we could very usefully employ a few million of the unemployed to clean up this Europe of ours which is polluted by the lure of immediate gain, with no thought of survival and of the only collective wealth we possess, our planet. RAFTERY (PPE). \u2014 Mr President, it is a clich\u00e9 to say that the CAP has really been a victim of its own success because it has produced so many surpluses which have created a problem for all of us. The gen eral thrust of the Commission's proposals is to bring the market more into balance, and this, of course, is the correct approach. Pressure must, however, be brought to bear on other producers of surpluses, nota bly the United States. It is not fair to expect the Com munity to solve the surpluses worldwide on its own. In the milk sector the quotas which were introduced will do much to solve the problem of surpluses and, in addition, will help to solve the beef surpluses, because with less cows there will in time be less calves. How ever, there is an urgent need to make the quota system more flexible to allow new entrants into dairying and to enable those with small quotas to take up the quotas of those who wish to give up all or part of their quo tas. Surpluses in other sectors, however, notably in cereals, will, I fear, be much more difficult to solve. The Com mission's proposals on restricting prices, less interven tion, co-responsibility and stricter quality standards amount, particularly for Irish farmers, to one thing, a reduction in prices of roughly 14-15%. For cereal growers in other more favoured regions of the Com munity, the price drop will be less. Cuts on cereal prices, I repeat, will not solve these surpluses. On the contrary, cereal producers in the more favoured areas will increase production using more modern technology, while those in the less-favoured areas and the smaller farmers will be forced out of production. We will thus end up with more cereals surpluses, less farmers, and longer dole queues. On oils and fats, I support the Commission's proposals for a tax for a few reasons. Firstly, unless such a step is taken, the cost of supporting oils seeds and olive oil will be roughly 5 billion ECU by 1988, thus draining the budget of necessary funds for regional and social policies and indeed for research. Secondly, imports of corn oil, mainly from the US, are displacing home- produced fats for human consumption, particularly butter fat. Many of those imports are used in animal feed to produce products which the United States itself will refuse to buy from us. Thirdly, the extra cost to the consumer would be minimal. Certainly, for the Irish economy such a tax is infinitely preferable to bankrupting the Community budget. Finally, I wish to urge the Commission once again to seek other solutions, such as alternative uses for land \u2014 the production, for instance, of timber, fuel crops and fibre crops \u2014 and alternative uses for products, using biotechnology research to make new products from our surpluses. In addition, there must be discour agement of the factory-type farming found in many parts of the Community, which is contributing not only to surpluses but also to the detriment of our envi ronment. CLINTON (PPE). \u2014 Mr President, we have now reached a point where there is general acceptance of the fact that certain basic adjustments have to be made in the agricultural sector. These changes are carefully set out in Mr Marck's report. It must be realized that the bringing about of these changes will cause considerable hardship not only to Community farmers but also to the greater number of people outside the farmgate who depend for their live lihood on the processing, distribution and sale of the end products. This needs to be emphasized particu larly to certain people in this Parliament who foolishly feel that all we have to do is to hit the agricultural producers hard enough and all our problems are over. The reality, of course, is very different. If we go too far too quickly, we will create more problems than we will solve and the cost will be much greater. The first move must be to get rid of existing stocks, and a start has been made on this already. The quota ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/69 Clinton system, at least in the short term, is the only way to ensure that stocks will not rebuild. Most other mea sures have failed. The curtailment or cutting off alto gether of intervention at times of oversupply, such as harvest times, could cause prices to plummet quite unnecessarily, and this applies to cereals, beef and but ter. The Commission has a responsibility to guard against this. In many cases adequate storage is not available, and in the ordinary course of things buyers will hold out to get products at the lowest possible prices. The past two years were disastrous for Irish cereal growers, due both to weather conditions and a 9% reduction arising from last year's proposals. When we add this year's proposals, which are much more dras tic, Irish growers could be put out of business alto gether. It must be realized that reducing intervention on a blanket basis will disproportionately penalize countries with high interest rates such as Ireland. The Commission should also consider applying co-respon sibility to imported cereals substitutes. I regret very much that the Commission has not seen fit to propose full elimination of negative MCAs for those countries who could accept such a measure. I have to ask the Commission then: where are we when we talk about a common support policy? I hope that the Council will find a solution to this before the price package is finally agreed, otherwise we are going to have a continuing situation of restricting the scope of price increases in weaker-currency countries. The Commission must keep the word 'cohesion' contin uously in the forefront of its mind. Ireland is very unhappy about the Commission's pro posal to end intervention for salted butter in 1988. In our view this is premature, and we also feel that at least some intervention should be available for sweet- cream butter for the foreseeable future. We fully agree with the Commission's proposals for stabilization arrangements for the oils and fats sector. Community farmers are facing a reduction of 9.5% in the milk quota and we also have a co-responsibility levy. How can we expect farmers to take this when we are still importing large quantities of oils and fats with out levy and also importing approximately 70 000 tonnes of butter, also without levy? We cannot go on insisting that Community farmers must cut production to Community needs and, at the same time, refuse to give them economic prices. (Applause) DE KEERSMAEKER, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this debate I should like to say a word of thanks on the Council's behalf to the rapporteurs and the spokesmen of the political groups and the many Members of Parliament \u2014 62 by my reckoning \u2014 who have taken part in this debate. I feel that after this debate we know exactly what Parliament thinks about the problem we are concerned with. I am pleased to say that we are generally agreed on the fundamental approach, which I would outline as follows. Firstly, the reform of the common agricultural policy that we are working on must be so designed that it continues to have an economic basis. Secondly, there must be no more renationalization of the common agricultural policy. Thirdly, the cost of the common agricultural policy must be prevented from rising too high. And finally, this cannot be done without related and, where necessary, compensatory measures to ensure the viability of the 'independent' family farm. But when it comes to the details of the policy options that we must in fact take on the basis of the Commis sion's proposals, there are as many or even more opi nions in Parliament than in the Council of Ministers. There is no denying that, and the spokesmen of the political groups have themselves admitted that they cannot state the unanimous views of their respective groups on the Commission's proposals. I therefore have no difficulty at all in saying that the same is true of the Council. To Mr Woltjer, who com plained that I did not come here with a solution, that I took the risk of anticipating a solution and gave a real istic report of the differences of opinion in the Coun cil, I would say that, not only do I detect the same differences here, but as President I cannot vote or make any proposals. Institutionally, that is not the President's task. All I can do in the Council is try to mediate, to create good will and to strike a balance, and that is what I am doing. I hope that on Monday we will have a basis on which to work out a solution. I realize it will not be easy. On the various sectors I should like to say the follow ing. Where cereals are concerned, I want to go on looking for an interim solution. We must after all suc ceed in controlling production and controlling costs. In the search for suitable means the aim must be bal ance in the reduction of prices and the effects of the mechanisms. As regards vegetable oils and fats, I agree with those in Parliament who share the Commission's view that what we have here is a cohesive package of proposals, restriction of production on the one hand and stabili zation mechanisms on the other. The differences of opinion on this last aspect are the same as in the Council. I heard Sir Fred Catherwood refer in a kind of declaration or appeal to the many disadvantages of a stabilization mechanism of this nature, and the Vice-President of the Commission also discussed this aspect of the matter. We are also aware of this in the Council. This has a great deal to do with our international relations. In the quest for reasonable conditions in terms of produc tion, prices and costs it must be ensured that the grow- ",
        "No 2-352/70 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5.87 De Keersmaeker ing of olives can continue in the Community of the Twelve after a standstill period for Spain and Portu gal. Those who oppose this stabilization mechanism do not, regrettably, offer an alternative policy or alter native means. It would be easier for the President of the Council to allow the members of the Council to choose between two alternative forms of policy in this area, and that, I must say, puts the Commission in a strong position. It is its task to put forward proposals. But those who reject the Commission's proposal must be able to offer an alternative. That has not been the case today. I do not have the feeling that the burden is evenly dis tributed between the producer, the EAGGF and the consumer. I believe balance should be the goal. The search for balance will be the Council's task from next week, as will the search for a solution to the agri- monetary problem. I have already said that the contin uation of the switch-over system does not have the support of a qualified majority in the Council and that we shall therefore be forced to revert to the pre-1984 situation. What we must find is a system based on as objective criteria as possible so that the abolition of the monetary compensatory amounts can proceed under conditions which do not distort competition, as has been the case in recent years. You agree, I believe, that all this cannot be done with out related socio-structural measures on the one hand and aid to incomes on the other. I think I can say the same of the Council. We have already taken decisions on the sociostructural measures. They have not been published yet because Parliament has requested concil iation. That will be taking place shortly. Where the policy on aid to incomes at European and national level is concerned, the European Parliament has been asked for its opinion, and we shall consider it as soon as possible. The discussions on all this will continue next Monday, the fixing of prices being, of course, at the top of the agenda. I have explained the circum stances in which this will be done in view of the differ ences of opinion on the budgetary restrictions and the international aspect. I shall give an account of what I have read in the valuable reports by Mr Marck, Mr Mouchel and Mr Colina Salamanca and what I have heard here and of the way the voting goes. ANDRIESSEN, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I trust I may exceed the time allot ted by a few minutes to do justice to the importance of the debate that has taken place today. I thank all those who have spoken in the debate since the political groups explained their position this morning and I had the opportunity to give my initial reactions. Various Members have quoted from the introductory statement made by the President of the Commission in this Parliament a few weeks ago and suggested there is some conflict between that introductory statement and the Commission's proposals or \u2014 worse \u2014 that the views of the President of the Commission and the Commissioner responsible for agriculture differ. I emphatically deny this. The Commission's proposals follow on directly from what was said by the President of the Commission at that time and by the Commis sioner responsible for agriculture on earlier occasions, and if you read the documents carefully, you will see that is the case. Some Members of this Parliament have said that the Commission is proceeding too quickly, chat it is rush ing things. Others say that it is not moving fast enough and must act more quickly because there is not much time left. I expect the truth lies somewhere in between, and we may have chosen the right pace, which cannot, moreover, be seen in isolation from the fact that we were late in starting the reform. Many Members have pointed this out, and they are right. We should have started earlier, and we have repeatedly said so in this and the previous Commission. The pace in any race is determined not only by the speed with which the fin ishing line is to be reached but also by the time at which the race started. I feel both factors must be borne in mind. A very great deal has been said about aid to individual farmers. I am pleased about this because it shows how much the thinking on this has changed in the last two years in Parliament as elsewhere. I consider that to be an important statement at the end of this debate, because it gives us the chance to continue looking in a constructive manner for solutions that combine a mar ket-oriented policy on the one hand with a social approach on the other \u2014 as Mr Tolman very suc cinctly put it. I think it right that under the system of aid to individual farmers we should try to introduce as many elements as possible to ensure that farmers are paid for something they actually achieve, as Mr Maher said. And in the socio-structural policy you will there fore find many elements relating to extensive produc tion and environmental policy, in which the farmer is rewarded for a given achievement. But we say that, if this does not help, it must be possible to incorporate a genuinely social component in the policy. And the Commission's proposal is therefore worded in this way. When will this come into effect? I know the Pres idency intends to do all it can to ensure that decisions are taken this year. Mr Mansholt has been quoted may times during this debate, and in a way that I would not have considered possible in this debate a few years ago. The Christian- Democratic Group put forward Mr Mansholt as an advocate of the idea that you cannot reduce produc tion by reducing prices. When the Commission brought out its Green paper last year or two years ago, I was told by members of many groups in this Parlia ment that it was a second Mansholt Plan, and that was meant very pejoratively. I stand by my view that a price policy, provided it is pursued consistently and as part of a package, has an effect on production. And those who do not believe this should take a look at ",
        "12. 5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/71 Andriessen New Zealand. I am not saying that we should allow prices to have the effect that they have had in New Zealand's milk sector in the last year. What I am say ing is that prices can have an effect on production. I would add in passing that this method is currently making a real contribution to the reduction of produc tion in New Zealand's dairy sector, just as under the influence of the world market Argentina is helping to reduce the production of cereals. It is not true, then, that we are the only ones to be doing anything in this respect. More is being done in the world, and steps should be taken to ensure that in some way these var ious actions are combined. Although that is the Com mission's intention, it always respects the principle of Community preference. A brief word about the agri-monetary situation. I said this morning that it is extremely difficult to find a means of compensating for the positive monetary compensatory amounts, because that would lead to price rises. I said this on the assumption that this should not require national contributions, which would, of course, stop prices rising at Community level but have other, serious consequences. The question of oils and fats has naturally attracted a great deal of attention in this debate, with fierce sup porters and fierce opponents. I should like to add this to what I said this morning. Firstly, I quite appreciate that it is rather difficult to refer to a stabilization mechanism each time. It is a long phrase and difficult to get the tongue round. It is easier and quicker to say 'tax', but it is not a tax. If it were a tax, it would have a different structure. It could not, for example, be a negative tax at a time when world market prices rise above a given reference level, and there are other aspects to be considered. Secondly, in recent years we have seen very considera ble fluctuations in the prices of oils and fats in the world market, larger than the tax we are now propos ing, because we are taking a five-year average. What have we learnt? We have learnt that this movement in prices has not, or not significantly, affected consump tion of the various types of oils and fats. We do not therefore expect this stabilization mechanism to have any effect, or any significant effect, on consumption. Thirdly, I am well aware that there are countries which as a consequence of a specific arrangement \u2014 I refer in particular to Spain and Portugal \u2014 would have specific problems following the introduction of this mechanism. If the specific arrangements made by these countries in connection with accession give rise to this situation, it will have to be seen how it should be taken into account when the tax is introduced. I am quite prepared to consider various technical adjustments that the discussions have shown to be desirable. What happens if the Court of Justice rejects the legal basis for this mechanism? I am convinced it will not do so, and we have not therefore given any serious thought to this eventuality. The disposal of stocks continues to be a major element of the policy. We are looking for ways in the 1988 budget of finding a specific solution to the beef prob lem caused by the restructuring of the dairy sector. I cannot yet say anything about the nature of this solu tion, but the Commission is giving it very careful con sideration in the preparation of the 1988 budget. As regards cereals, I would say that solutions some where between what the Commission has proposed and what others are proposing are, of course, conceiv able. The essential aim is to reduce intervention in the cereals sector as well. How, if it is modified as the Commission is proposing, this should be translated into total figures is another matter. But here again the Commission can keep an open mind. If we tax grain substitutes, there are two factors to be borne in mind. The first is that we will then change the nature of the co-responsibility levy. It will then change from a levy on producers to a levy on consumers. Secondly, it will, of course, have serious international repercussions. Finally, reference was made to the prices of fruit and vegetables and to more continental products. If you work out the overall direct and indirect effect of our proposals, it cannot, to my mind, be said that one product will be put at a disadvantage and another at an advantage. It has been said that the procedure must be speeded up. I agree, and I feel that, if Mr Prout's proposals for Parliament's Rules of Procedure are implemented and there is no real change in the agri cultural problem, we shall be forced to speed up the procedure very considerably. (Applause) IN THE CHAIR : MR SEEFELD Vice-President MOUCHEL (RDE), rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr Presi dent, in my innocence I thought that Parliament was a place for discussions and exchanges engendering reflection prior to decision-making. But I am surprised to hear all too often the same erroneous arguments. Do we or do we not want the truth in order to take the best possible decisions in the general interest? Why is it so often claimed here that a tax on oils and fats would be against the interests of the developing coun tries, since that is not true? The stabilizing of prices which this system would bring, would of necessity benefit the developing countries because the tax on oils and fats would stop world prices from collapsing. If we truly want to help the developing countries \u2014 and for my part I do \u2014 let us assure them that we will ",
        "No 2-352/72 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Mouchel take from them a guaranteed volume at a price to be set in agreement with them. So, a guaranteed volume, and a fair price, what could be better for the develop ing countries? That is where their true interest lies. We must stop putting forward false arguments to defend interests which have nothing to do with those of the developing countries. Would it not be better to evoke here the interests of the Americans, who are against this measure? And would it not then be pref erable to have directly involved in our work an Ameri can representative with a right of veto? Then things would be clear! But enough joking. If we want Europe to be an inde pendent entity, we must operate our own economic policy. Consultations with third countries are necess- sary, but they must take place outside this Assembly, in another forum. In the European Community we have 2 200 000 olive producers. Are we to abandon them? A clear answer is needed to this question. If not, they must be ade quately paid for what they produce. But the Com munity budget will be inadequate in 1992. There will thus be restrictions, and one cannot close ones eyes to this fact for ever. It is true that there are none more blind than those who will not see. But even so, blind ness has its limits . . . For years we have been proposing a system of taxes on imported vegetable and marine oils and fats. We were told that this was unacceptable under GATT, as it would distort competition for third countries. Fine! We are allowing for this and proposing that the tax should be applied to our own production as well as to imports. According to Commissioner Andriessen this proposal is not contrary to the rules of GATT. There is outrage at the fact that the consumer will have to pay too much. But I did not hear anyone protest three years ago that the consumer was having to pay too much for imported oils. It is true that we have since seen a collapse of more than 50% in world prices. For some oils the price per litre has fallen from 7 to 2 Francs without any benefit being passed on to the consumer. Before making the consumer pay, why should the importers not first have to repay to the Community a sizeable portion of the profit they saw fit to pocket? I know they would not exactly welcome such a measure, but we must realize that the victims of this system are the consumers and producers. Let us be consistent and go beyond a Community of sectorial interests. Let us face up to the real nature of the prob lems and implement the solutions which are essential. Is that not the price we must pay to build Europe? (Applause) MARCK (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I shall be very brief because this debate has revealed a very wide measure of agreement in this Parliament, even with the Commission and, reading between the lines, even with the Council on a number of aspects of this debate on prices. They include the monetary aspect, the need to strike a better balance between supply and demand and the avoidance of certain cumulative effects in the restriction of production. I take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for opening the door to the abolition of the co-responsi bility levy in the dairy sector. He has also clearly opened the door as regards the beef sector and the proposal which Mr Provan and I have made, which means that in this sector too there are definite open ings. The Commissioner has said we must consider the trend in costs. I agree that, if we had used the objec tive method this year, we might have achieved some thing other than the price freeze. But that is precisely where the difficulty lies. At the moment it is no longer possible to apply the objective method because it is based on officially determined prices and they do not correspond to the prices the farmer actually obtains. I feel that this last factor is particularly important and that in this respect we can in fact go on to the zero option for prices. I must also admit, and everyone else has admitted, that there is a considerable disparity among the regions and particularly among types of farms and that one of the difficulties with the agricul tural policy is that these types of farms should not be played off against each other too much and that here in particular appropriate solutions need to be found. Apart from the price policy, aid to incomes may be decisive in the years to come. But I would then say to the members of the Committee on Budgets that aid to incomes may cost a great deal more than the present price support system and that they will suffer some disillusionment in that respect. Some Members were also concerned about the situa tion outside the European Community. I sometimes had the impression that one or two speakers were more concerned about the Americans and others than about their fellow inhabitants of the Community. We must, of course, take account of international rela tions, and we must be very consistent in that respect, but we must also think of our own people. I have two things to say about Dame Shelagh's claim that free trade will create more employment. Firstly, there is also employment in agriculture and horticulture, and it would come under serious pressure if the measures proposed by Dame Shelagh were taken. We would then have many unemployed farmers in the Com munity. Someone else said, speaking of free trade, that there is something in the Treaty of Rome about 'Com munity preference', and I never hear Dame Shelagh refer to this. Finally, I would call for a resolute policy, and this was one of the points emphasized here. That leaves one point, the question of procedure. We have to vote on Thursday, and it is the custom for the rapporteur to ask the Commission what it thinks of the amendments that have been tabled to the proposed ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/73 Marck regulations. I realize that at this stage of the Council's discussions it is almost impossible for the Commis\u00ad sioner to answer this question. He has given a number of indications today, which come very close to what Parliament's Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has proposed, but I assume he cannot translate this into actual amendments to his own proposals for regulations, not for the moment at least. That is why \u2014 and I say this now so that there may be no misun\u00ad derstandings on Thursday \u2014 I shall certainly not be requesting the referral of the proposals back to the committee, because I feel that would be showing a lack of a sense of public responsibility, because we would simply be delaying matters, and that is not Par\u00ad liament's intention. What we shall be asking for, and this is in fact set out in one of the final conclusions of the resolution, is conciliation with the Council if its decisions depart too far from what this Parliament has proposed. But I am sure, and Vice-President De Keersmaeker will undoubtedly make sure, that this is not the case and that conciliation will not therefore be necessary, but we shall hold this sword of Damocles over the Coun- (Applause) PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 10 a.m. on Thursday. 4. Question Time PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the first part of Question Time (Doc. \u0392 2-296/87): We begin with the questions to the Commission. Question No 1 by Mr Rogalla (H-1047/85): Subject: Security measures by the Member States What national legislation on security (particularly relating to terrorism, drug trafficking and policy towards aliens) have the Member States passed in the last two years and in what way did they coor\u00ad dinate such legislation or discuss it in detail with other Member States and/or the Commission? COCKFIELD, The Lord, Vice-President of the Com\u00ad mission. \u2014 The Commission has no detailed informa\u00ad tion on the security measures taken by Member States during the last two years. Concerted action by Mem\u00ad ber States has essentially been conducted in the frame\u00ad work of inter-governmental cooperation. Two main forums are involved. The political cooperation machi\u00ad nery and the ad hoc group on immigration established by Interior and Justive Ministers at their meeting in London on 20 October 1986. The Commission is involved in both. The mandate given to the ad hoc group sets its work clearly in the context of the Single European Act which in turn refers specifically to the Commission's White Paper on the completion of the internal market by 1992. The group's work, which was reviewed and approved by Ministers at their meeting in Brussels on 28 April 1987, which I myself attended, provides a particularly valuable basis for the further proposals the Commission will need to make in the field of visa, asylum and extradition policy. PRESIDENT. \u2014 I would remind you that we decided together that questions should be short, that a ques\u00ad tion would take a recognizable form, and the supple\u00ad mentary would not exceed 30 seconds. Let us please keep to this arrangement. ROGALLA (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, on a point of order: do the conditions you have just listed also apply- to the main questioner? PRESIDENT. \u2014 Yes. ROGALLA (S). \u2014 (DE) I shall of course abide by your ruling and use my ten seconds to thank the Vice-President for his information which was, as ever, precise and comprehensive. My very concrete supple\u00ad mentary question is this: is the Commission aware that Aids sufferers from neighbouring countries, 'foreig\u00ad ners', have recently been detained at the border by order of the Federal Government, and is it prepared to take further action towards harmonizing security mea\u00ad sures? COCKFIELD, The Lord. \u2014 May I start by saying how much the Commission and myself personally appreciate the help that Mr Rogalla has always given to us on internal market matters. So far as his supplementary is concerned, it is really covered by the first part of the answer that I have given, namely, that the Commission has no detailed information on measures taken by individual Member States. So far as harmonization is concerned, we can only harmonize where there is divergent legislation which requires harmonization and legislation by one Member State does not, therefore, provide such a basis even if the issue were within the treaty competence. HOON (S). \u2014 I am particularly concerned with that part of Mr Rogalla's question which deals with aliens. What view does the Commission take of various legis\u00ad lative proposals in different Member States which will effectively make airline companies, shipping compan\u00ad ies and other carriers responsible for determining whether or not someone is a genuine refugee? ",
        "No 2-352/74 Debates of the European Parliament 12. 5. 87 Hoon Would the Commissioner agree that such proposals effectively privatize government decision-making and indeed result in governments abandoning their tradi tional and historic responsibilities? COCKFIELD, The Lord. \u2014 One of the major diffi culties in this field has been the question of the extent of Community competence. Until quite recently Min isters of the Interior and of Justice took the view that there was no Community competence. Nevertheless, as a result, first, of an initiative by the Italian Presi dency, and subsequently followed up vigorously by the United Kingdom Presidency, the Commission has now been associated with this work. But it has, of course, only a limited competence in this field and that does not necessarily cover everything. Many of the mea sures which are taken and need to be taken can be taken only by the individual Member States. As soon as the Commission is in a position to put for ward any proposals of its own on the question of aliens, these proposals will be submitted to Parliament and to the Council of Ministers. PRESIDENT. \u2014- Question No 2 by Mr Escuder Croft (H-298/86): Subject: Drawing up of a non-quota programme for islands What measures has the Commission adopted to implement paragraph 24 of the European Parlia ment's resolution of 20 June 1983 concerning the Harris report (Doc. 1-105/83)? PFEIFFER, member of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) Since Parliament adopted the resolution on the Harris report the European Community has stepped up its measures to help the islands and maritime peripheral regions with a number of measures under the non quota sections of the European Regional Fund. These measures apply primarily to the islands and maritime peripheral regions of Greece, Italy and France, the border region of Ireland and Northern Ireland and certain fishery and shipbuilding areas in France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Following the entry into force of the new regulation on the European Regional Fund of 1 January 1985, the Fund can now act both through national pro grammes of Community interest and through Com munity programmes which have replaced special pro grammes under the earlier non-quota sections. The first two Community programmes approved so far, the STAR programme for better access to advanced com munications and the Valoren programme for the development of endogenous energy potential are pri marily of benefit to the peripheral regions, including the Greek islands. They concern Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Northern Ireland, the overseas d\u00e9partements and Corsica, the Mezzogiorno and most areas of Spain. In devising new proposals for the Community pro grammes the Commission will endeavour to see that account is taken of the special situation of the islands and other peripheral regions of the Community. ESCUDER CROFT (ED). \u2014 (ES) The Commission is apparently finding it very difficult to adjust to the fact that the entry of Spain and Portugal has meant a significant change to the structure of the European Community. The Commissioner seems to be unaware that there are any new island regions or new peri pheral regions, since he makes no mention whatever of these Portuguese and Spanish islands and outlying regions. So my question to the Commissioner is this; what research, what investments, what programmes has the Commission carried out for the benefit of the new island regions since 1 January 1986? PFEIFFER. \u2014 (DE) I would repeat that I included Portugal in my account. I think there is a misunder standing here, in that the original question speaks only of islands, whilst, if I understand correctly, Parliament and Commission have hitherto always spoken of the islands and maritime regions, with good reason. I should point out that the maritime peripheral regions of the Community of Twelve including the islands have a population of 119 million. But if we take just the islands of the Community, the population is only 13.2 million. So what has the Commission actually done since enlargement? I expressly mentioned the two STAR and Valoren programmes. These were the first programmes which we very quickly launched after enlargement. I can assure you that the Commis sion has given very careful consideration and priority to applications from the new member countries. I am not able at present to list all the individual programmes and funding operations involved, and I hope you will forgive me for that. If the honourable member so wishes, I will of course gladly give him an answer in writing. EWING (RDE). \u2014 Is the Commission aware of the additional costs that are involved in living on islands? Moreover, as the representative of 80 islands of the Community could I ask him with regard to the Harris report, whether any pilot projects were carried out where road equivalent tariff, which would be the sin gle most helpful thing that could affect islands is con cerned. If no pilot projects \u2014 which were called for in this report \u2014 were carried out, could I know why, and if the Commissioner cannot supply the informa tion today could I have a written answer very quickly? PFEIFFER. \u2014 (DE) I assume the honourable lady refers here specifically to the question of subsidies and aids to island transport costs. The Commission has ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/75 Pfeiffer repeatedly said that under the current legal position such subsidies are not possible. But the Commission is prepared, and it has repeatedly said this too, to co- finance ferries, for example, as part of aids to infras tructure, in order to make these things easier. Because of the current legal position I cannot unfortunately adopt any other position here. MUSSO (RDE). \u2014 (FR) The Commissioner has just mentioned the STAR and Valoren programmes, the States which are benefiting from them and, within those States, the regions which are benefiting. I sent him a letter asking exactly what portion, in France, was granted to the overseas d\u00e9partements and Corsica. His services did not reply, whilst in Corsica official figures were released. It is unacceptable for the Commission to tell me that it has no official figures when those figures have been published locally. PFEIFFER. \u2014 (DE) I am sorry, I am not aware of this letter. I can only assure the honourable member that I shall look into it at once, because it not my style to leave letters unanswered. If that has happened, I can only apologize and promise to sort the matter out as quickly as possible. PRESIDENT. \u2014 As the author is not present, Ques tion No 3 will be answered in writing. 1 Question No 4 by Mr Musso (H-898/86): 2 Subject: EAGGF \u2014 Guidance Section, Corsican forests Can the Commission inform Parliament of the method of payment of funds from the EAGGF Guidance Section earmarked for certain schemes for Corsican forests? Does the Commission make sure that these funds reach the recipients in proper time, without previously being 'tapped' of various administrative costs by local organizations cov ered by the local authorities? ANDRIESSEN, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) The contributions financed by the EAGGF to forestry projects in certain Mediterranean areas are paid out to the authorities in those areas which are designated by the Member States. Where the projects in Corsica are concerned, France has designated Audarc, the service for the development of agriculture and rural areas in Corsica, for this purpose. At the request of this authority the sums intended for the financing of the Community part of these projects are 1 See Annex 'Question Time'. 2 Former oral question without debate (0-170/86), con verted into a question for Question Time. deposited in its account with the Caisse Nationale du Cr\u00e9dit Agricole. The Commission has been able to establish that Audarc disburses the Community's share immediately after the beneficiaries have presented their invoices. Audarc is also responsible for the trans fer of the French contribution to these projects. As regards the reimbursement of administrative costs, I can say that, according to our information, Audarc charges for the relatively low rate of reimbursement of about 1.3%. MUSSO (RDE). \u2014 (FR) My thanks to the Commi- sioner. I should be glad if he would send me his answer in writing. PRESIDENT. \u2014 As the author is not present, Ques tion No 5 will be answered in writing.' Question No 6 by Mr Saridakis (H-722/86): Subject: Community milk production quotas in Greece Average per capita consumption of fresh cow's milk in Greece is considerably lower than 50% of the Community average, and the country's geo graphical situation prevents it being supplied by its Community partners. The only possibilities open to it are domestic production and supply by neigh bouring third countries. Further reducing the quota for Greece frustrates, in effect, any possibility of increasing fresh milk consumption or leads to imports from third coun tries, at high prices and at the expense of Com munity preference. Furthermore, applying the per sonal quotas system in areas with large numbers of small producers (usually owning fewer than five cows) leads to acute administrative problems and disproportionately high costs. In practice, the sys tem proves to be unworkable. In drawing up its proposals on the subject, did the Commission take Article 39(2) of the Treaty of Rome seriously into account? ANDRIESSEN, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) When in December of last year the Council reached political agreement on the measures to be taken in the future with respect to the dairy sector, the Commission emphasized that it intended to take ser ious account of the problems arising with respect to fresh milk in Greece. In connection with a number of new health measures which Greece had taken and which affect milk supplies and the associated structural consequences of the delivery of milk, the Commission decided on 21 April to transfer 70 000 tonnes of the direct quota, that is, the quota for direct sale, to the quota for supplies. This concession largely compen sates for the reduction in milk quotas which the Coun cil introduced for the 1987/1988 and 1988/1989 milk price years. The quota also stayed higher than the ",
        "No 2-352/76 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Andriessen present level of supplies in Greece. I therefore feel that due account has been taken of the specific problems to which Greece rightly drew the Council's attention. SARIDAKIS (PPE). \u2014 (GR) Of course, the question was tabled before that decision had been taken by the Commission, and I presume that the Commission therefore plans to differentiate the conditions of milk production and marketing on a regional basis, to satisfy countries with shortfalls as you have said. ANDRIESSEN . \u2014 (NL) It is my impression that the measures, as adopted by the Commission and includ ing a number of specific provisions taking account of the administrative and management situation, are such as to satisfy the Greek Government at the present time. If for one reason or another this should prove not to be the case, it will always be possible to deal with particular difficulties later. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 7 by Mr Raftery (H- 797/86): Subject: Seaworthiness of vessels operating in Community waters Following the recent disaster involving the iron ore carrier 'Kowloon Bridge' off the south-west coast of Ireland and the near-disaster of the oil tanker Capo Emma in the same area, what action will the Commission take to ensure higher stan dards of seaworthiness of vessels operating in Community waters? CLINTON DAVIS, Member of the Commission. \u2014 The honourable Member raises a very important ques tion. May I begin by saying that I remain convinced that flag state control must remain the primary way of applying standards. Nonetheless, the development of port state enforcement is proving to be an effective way of combating the operation of substandard ship ping. The application of port state control in European wat ers under the Paris memorandum of understanding extends beyond the eleven European Community Maritime States to Norway, Sweden and Finland. No less than 10 000 ships are being inspected each year by these maritime authorities in order to ensure respect for the relevant international conventions. The Commission is encouraged to note that the Cana dian and United States coastguards are now making their inspection reports available to the European authorities. Since Japan is also instituting a system of port state control, we should soon be in a position where it will be virtually impossible for a substandard ship to contemplate a visit to any Community port with any degree of equanimity. I would not wish to give the impression that I am com placent about the progress of port state control. Indeed, two members of the Community are still a long way behind with their inspection timetable and I shall be keeping a close check on the progress that they make this year to meet their obligations. Moreover, I am not convinced that enough is being done about the port state enforcement of ILO stan dards. It has been argued that it is more difficult for an inspector to check for compliance with International Labour Organization standards than with, for exam ple, the Solas Convention. There may be some truth in that, but it is not a justification for neglecting those standards altogether. Accordingly, the Commission intends to set up a small working party with the ILO, the port state control secretariat, ship owners and sea faring unions, to examine these practical problems in an attempt to draw up more positive guidelines to surveyors on these human aspects of the port state enforcement of international standards. So in this way we would hope to contribute to the eradication from Community ports and Community waters of shipping which is substandard in the widest sense of that word. RAFTERY (PPE). \u2014 Thank you, Commissioner, for your very comprehensive answer. Could I ask, what proportion of the ships are being checked for their seaworthiness, and whether a higher proportion of ships flying flags of convenience are being checked than ships flying normal national flags? Is the Com mission going to be more active in this whole area in future in the light of the two serious disasters which occurred off the south coast of Ireland and one almost equally serious disaster which miraculously was just avoided? CLINTON DAVIS. \u2014 I think I am right in saying that about 60% of ships visiting ports are in general terms now being checked. I stand to be corrected as to the exact proportion, but I think that is roughly the situation. Yes, more flags of convenience ships are being inspected than has been the case hitherto. I have given an average figure for the number of inspections being carried out. Last year the figure in fact rose to some thing like 12 0\u00d60 inspections. Just over 300 ships were detained or delayed until deficiencies were put right. The number of flag of convenience vessels is higher than the number of Community ships but, nonetheless, it is a matter of grave concern to me that Community ships should be defying these essential safety stan dards. Community shipping of course has no right to derogate from those standards at all. So we are extremely vigilant about these matters. We shall con tinue to be and I hope that the number of inspections over the forthcoming years will be substantially increased. ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/77 MARSHALL (ED). \u2014 Can I first of all thank the Commissioner for his very full answer, but would he agree that the recent tragedy at Zeebrugge emphas ized that it is not just unseaworthy vessels that we have to worry about, but also the quality of seamanship and the design of ships? Can he tell us what he is going to do to deal with those two problems? CLINTON DAVIS. \u2014 I have already commented in this House on the tragedy at Zeebrugge. The honour able Member will know that very comprehensive and detailed enquiries are being carried out both in the United Kingdom and in Belgium. It would be prema ture in those circumstances for me to enter into any reflections about the conclusions one might draw from the evidence thus far. But as far as the question of ro-ro ferries and port state control are concerned, the Commission has raised this issue in the port state control committee because there has been some sort of understanding that for reasons of economy and speed, ro-ro ferries should be exempt from port state control. I have to say though, that there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that ro-ro ferries are in fact breaching any ILO or IMO conventions. Nonetheless, as I have indicated, the Commission is being vigilant about these matters within the competence that is allocated to us. One thing is abundantly plain and that is that it is absolutely wrong in my judgment, and I am sure in the judgment of this House, that anyone should cut cor ners where safety is concerned. STEWART (S). \u2014 I would like to thank the Commis sioner for some of his answers. It is reassuring to learn of the progress currently being made. But does he not consider that real safety at sea will only be achieved when legislation is applied to ensure that safety mea sures are carried out? Does he not think that the recommendations from the Commission to the Coun cil of Ministers should be for a form of coastal control so that ships with dangerous cargoes can be monitored coming into Community waters? CLINTON DAVIS. \u2014 The honourable Member has raised an important point concerning enforcement in relation to any aspect of Community law. If the Com mission were to allow the law to remain unenforced it would bring that law into contempt and that is not the job of this Commission. So, certainly enforcement is a very important matter and I am glad to say that port state control is an area where enforcement has been extremely effective, as I have indicated with the statistics I have quoted. As far as the question of coastal monitoring is con cerned, that is not included in the matters that have been agreed by the Council thus far, but as the hon ourable gentleman knows, the next phase of shipping policy which will be produced by the Commission, will be more profound and far wider ranging than has been the case hitherto, though I do not in any sense hide from the fact that it is going to be a difficult set of pro posals that will have to emerge that will require a great deal of thought and consultation and I hope that this can be dealt with as rapidly as possible. PRESIDENT. \u2014 As the author is not present Ques tion No 8 will be answered in writing. 1 Question No 9 by Mr Christodoulou which will be taken over by Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou (H-882/86): Subject: Availability of lead-free petrol in Yugos lavia In response to my Question H-574/84 of 16 April 1985 2 on the availability of lead-free petrol in transit countries which are not members of the EEC, the Commission undertook to make an approach to the Yugoslav Government to ensure that lead-free petrol was available on the main arterial road through that country to Greece. Would the Commission state whether this matter is covered by the negotiations on transport-related matters which it is conducting with Yugoslavia, what steps the government of that country has taken and how many petrol stations supplying lead-free petrol have been set up on the above- mentioned road? CLINTON DAVIS, Member of the Commission. \u2014 The problem of unleaded petrol has been raised by the Community at the initiative of the Commission at the Cooperation Council set up under the EEC/Yugosla via agreement. The Community delegation has under lined that given the geographical importance of Yugoslavia as a transit country between Greece and the other Member States it would clearly be in the interests of both the Community and Yugoslavia to ensure that availability of unleaded petrol on its main arterial roads. This indeed would be desirable for implementation before 1 October 1989 when the rel evant Community directive enters into force. At the Fifth EEC/Yugoslavia Cooperation Council the Yugoslavian authorities indicated that unleaded petrol would be on sale on Yugoslavian territory during the course of 1986. According to the information cur rently available to the Commission, 56 service stations providing unleaded petrol exist in Yugoslavia, 20 of these are situated on the trans-Yugoslavia autoroute and in practice the location of these stations is such that transit through Yugoslavia for vehicles using unleaded petrol can be made without undue difficulty. 1 See Annex 'Question Time'. 2 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-325, April 1985.

GIANNAKOU-KOUTSIKOU (PPE). \u2014 (GR) I am very grateful to the Commissioner, Mr Clinton Davis. From his answer it of course emerges clearly that there have been discussions with the Yugoslavian Govern ment. However, I would like to ask him, since the matter is in essence not just relevant to Greece but to the Community as a whole, granted that Greece is an international transport route, to tell me whether the talks with the Yugoslavian Government were confined to a theoretical level, or whether they resulted in a specific timetable? Because of course the 56 service stations \u2014 the length of Yugoslavia is well known \u2014 are not at all sufficient. That would be of great help to the Community. CLINTON DAVIS. \u2014 No, it is not something that is on a theoretical level. The fact is that as a result of dis cussions that have taken place and of the necessity which is emerging due to market demand, the Yugos lavians are already responding as I indicated in the answer that I gave a few moments ago. I certainly do not regard this matter with any degree of compla cency, I think there is still room for improvement. But it is clear that the Yugoslavian authorities are respond ing very positively and that can only be a good thing. PRESIDENT. \u2014 As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 10, 11 and 12 will be answered in writ ing. 1 Question No 13 by Mr Wogau (H-961/86): Subject: Regulation on control of concentrations On 2 December 1986 the Commission again mod ified its proposal for a Council regulation (EEC) on control of concentrations (OJ, C 324 of 17 December 1986, p. 5). It still bases its proposal for a regulation exclusively on Article 235, although Article 87(1), second subparagraph, would enable regulations to be adopted by a qualified majority. Can the Commission explain why the draft regu lation should not also be based on Article 87(1) and \u2014 after the modifications to the Treaty have entered into force \u2014 also on Article 100a(l)? judgment in Continental Can, in order to control mer gers that strengthen the pre-existing, dominant posi tion. Without wider powers it would not be able to exercise controls systematically over any merger by which firms not only strengthened but acquired a dominant position in the Common Market or a sub stantial part thereof from which they could impede effective competition. I now deal with the point raised by the Honourable Member in relation to Article 100a(l). Article 100a(l), introduced by the Single Act applies to measures for the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which have as their object the establishment and func tioning of the internal market. Even supposing the new Article 100a could be applied to a measure for har monizing national legislation on merger control, that only at present exists in France, Ireland, Germany and the United Kingdom. It could not be used to give the Community powers of control over Community scale mergers that went beyond the powers enjoyed by the national authorities. VON WOGAU (PPE). \u2014 (DE) I merely wished to ask the Vice-President what plans the Commission has to achieve real progress in this area, which has long been stagnant, and we all know that in the open mar ket we shall have established by 1992 merger control will be even more important. COCKFIELD, The Lord. \u2014 I entirely share the Hon ourable Member's sense of frustration at the lack of progress which has been made in this field. We have pressed the Presidency of the Council to take action but so far that has not been matched by deeds. We shall continue to press but if in fact no action can be obtained we may seriously need to consider withdraw ing this regulation and substituting a new one. ROGALLA (S). \u2014\u00b7 (DE) I am interested in the legal aspect of this matter. Article 235 requires unanimity, but also requires that the Treaty shall not have prov ided the necessary powers. We now have the Commis sion tending to dodge Article 235 over the customs union; we have it over trade policy, in this area too. My specific question is this: does the Commission not feel that it should rethink the legal aspect of invoking Article 235? COCKFIELD, The Lord, Vice-President of the Com mission. \u2014 The draft regulation which the Commis sion laid before the Council on 20 July 1973 is based both on Article 87 and Article 235. It was necessary to include Article 235 because the Commission consid ered it needed wider powers than it already has under Article 86, according to the Court of Justice's 1973 See Annex 'Question Time'. COCKFIELD, The Lord. \u2014 The question of legal base for proposals is always a difficult and, at times, a contentious one. The underlying problem, as both Mr von Wogau and Mr Rogalla have identified, is that Article 235 requires unanimity. Obviously the objec tive of all of us is to get away from unanimity if we can. Unfortunately, Article 86 does not provide a wide enough base for the proposals we wish to put forward. Therefore we have reluctantly to add Article 235. ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/79 Cockfield Merely extending Article 235 in the way the Honoura ble Member suggests would not only require a Treaty amendment but more importantly it would leave unan imity in place. FALCONER (S). \u2014 I would just point out to the Commissioner when he answers questions that he should beware of speaking of all of us wishing to get away from unanimity. Some of us want to respect the right of countries to veto proposals made by the Com mission which can have an affect on their economy. COCKFIELD, The Lord. Member's disclaimer. I note the Honourable non-governmental organizations. But what is the Commission's position on the agreement the European Community has concluded with the Moroccan Government in connection with the fisheries agree ment? As you know, Morocco has unlawfully occu pied Western Sahara and this occupation is not recog nized by a single country. CLINTON DAVIS. \u2014 Mr President, with respect, the honourable gentlemen himself indicated that this supplementary was far removed from the question itself. Having said that, I will draw the attention of my colleague, Commissioner Cheysson, to the question he has raised and no doubt he will wish to write to the honourable Member about it. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 14 by Mr Ulburghs (H-990/86): Subject: Extra emergency food aid for the Sah- rawi refugees The Sahrawi Red Cross and a consortium of NGOs have asked the Community to make avail able an additional 960 tonnes of sugar, 600 tonnes of dried fish and 400 tonnes of butteroil for the refugees from the Sahrawi region. Aid supplied previously was not enough to last through the last few months of 1986 and the first few months of 1987. Sugar is very useful for the green tea which every family makes three or four times a day. Dried fish is a way of increasing protein content in the diet; butteroil is especially appreciated in winter. Is the Commission ready to provide this further aid as requested? PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 15 by Mrs Hammer ich will be taken over by Mr Christensen (H-1002/ 86): Subject: What is the Commission doing at night? Why are all the lights on in the Berlaymont build ing all night \u2014- even at weekends \u2014 and how much do these illuminations cost each night? Is this part of the Community's energy savings programme? What are the thousands of Commission officials doing in the building at night, and do they need the lights on? Has it ever occurred to the Commission that this waste of energy is an insult to the many poor peo ple living in Brussels who have to save electricity to survive? CLINTON DAVIS, Member of the Commission. \u2014 The Commission is fully aware of the difficult situa tion faced by the Sahrawi refugees. This is why we have been supplying their Red Cross with large amounts of aid via various non-governmental organi zations such as Oxfam, Caritas, the Ecumenical Coun cil of Churches, and so on, for a number of years. In the context of its 1987 NGO programme, the Com mission has been able to approve an increase in aid for Sahrawi refugees that brought the total quantity up to what had been requested by the NGOs. The products concerned were cereals, milk-powder, butteroil and a few allocations of sugar. If during the course of the year additional aid such as fish is needed, the Commis sion will consider any further requests in the light of the reserves available. Those acting on behalf of the consortium of non-governmental organizations in question have been informed of this and have expressed satisfaction with the proposed allocations. ULBURGHS (NI). \u2014 (NL) I thank the Commis sioner for this information, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has reacted to the specific requests from the Red Cross and the consortium of CHRISTOPHERSEN, Vice-President of the Commis sion. \u2014 (DA) Very briefly, the question is: what does the Commission do at night? The background to the question is that Mrs Hammerich has noticed that the lights are often on in the Commission's Berlaymont building late into the night. That caused surprise. There is no reason for that; the explanation \u2014 and I hope that Mr Christensen will pass it on to Mrs Ham merich \u2014 is simply that the Commission's staff often work at night. They work on many things. I would point out that we have offices around the entire globe; we have permanent representations in a large number of developing countries, in Tokyo, Washington, New York and many other places, and that fact alone means that the Commission's offices are often at work for most of the twenty-four hour day. There are also other reasons why staff work long into the evening in the Berlaymont building. I will not go into detail on the drafting of answers to questions from Members of Parliament \u2014 that can also take time; but many of the tasks that fall to us have to be completed from one day to the next. I am glad to have this opportunity to draw attention to the rules that have been laid down. I myself have ",
        "No 2-352/80 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Christophersen introduced rules which ensure that the consumption of electricity is kept to the minimum necessary. There are quite clear instructions as to when power should be switched on and off. The power supply to various sec tions of the Berlaymont building is switched off at 10 p.m., unless there is an express wish from staff to work on with lighting still provided. In addition these rules on the procedure for switching off power are laid down in the contracts the Commission has entered into with the cleaning companies which clean the Commission's offices. That is, the staff sent by these companies into our offices have a contractual obliga tion to turn off the lights when they leave. Of course the Commission checks that all these rules are observed. I therefore ask Mr Christensen to explain to Mrs Hammerich that, when she notices on her way round Brussels that there are lights burning in the Commission's windows, it is because the Commission is getting on with the tasks it has been asked to per form by the Council of Ministers or Parliament, whichever the case may be. CHRISTENSEN (ARC). \u2014 (DA) I thank the Com missioner for his very full answer to this important question. The reason why it was put is that one may have one's suspicions that work is being done on not very serious matters \u2014 if indeed work is being done at all \u2014 for I also have to pass the offices in the evening, and there are many lights but the premises are abso lutely empty. But it is clear that the Commission is not idling away the time, and I thank the Commissioner for his answer. CHRISTOPHERSEN. \u2014 (DA) I just want to express my gratitude for the full understanding which now exists of the fact that the Commission's staff also have to work in the evening. ious areas of work \u2014 regional, economic, agricultural and environmental questions for example? If that were the result, we would gladly take on board a small waste of energy, because it would save us a lot of work later. PRESIDENT. \u2014 That goes a bit beyond the original question, but such questions can of course be put in the context of the Commission's work at night. CHRISTOPHERSEN. \u2014 (DA) I am happy to con firm that the Commission, precisely by working in the evening, seeks to achieve the best possible coordina tion of its proposals. FERNANDES (RDE). \u2014 (PT) I do not think the Commissioner's reply was either convincing or a satis factory explanation. We are told that only some mem bers of staff are working at night yet the whole build ing is lit up. I asked whether there was no system of light switches in the Commission building. CHRISTOPHERSEN. \u2014 (DA) The power is auto matically switched off at 10 p.m. by the duty techni cian, unless there is an express request for lighting in rooms in which work has to be done. So there are quite clear rules. NORD (LDR). \u2014 May I conclude from this very important debate that the Berlaymont building is not a place as described by Clemenceau when he was asked what a government department was, namely a place where those who leave early meet those who arrive late. McMAHON (S). \u2014 Would the Commissioner be pre pared to deny the rumour that the lights are on in the evening to allow Lord Cockfield to burn the midnight oil to produce his devious plans to extend the rate of value-added tax to cover books, clothes and children's food? As Commissioner Sutherland said to this House yesterday, the Commission is engaged on studies. Per haps those studies necessitate burning the midnight oil in the Berlaymont in Brussels. Would the Commis sioner care to confirm or deny this? CHRISTOPHERSEN. \u2014 (DA) Here I have to say that it is my personal experience that Lord Cockfield prefers to get on with his work in the early morning. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The Commissioner is nodding approvingly, Mr Nord ! Question No 16 by Mr Andrews (H-8/87): Subject: South Africa How dependent is the Community on imports from South Africa of the following minerals: gold, platinum, manganese, vanadium, chrome, asbes tos, uranium, iron, silver, coal and nickel? In the event of comprehensive sanctions against South Africa has the Commission undertaken stu dies concerning the possibility of alternative sources? BLOCH VON BLOTTNITZ (ARC). \u2014 (DE) We are no doubt right in assuming that the entire Commission works at night, well into the small hours. Does this mean that the Commission will in future produce pro posals which are largely coordinated amongst the var- NARJES, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) The Commission thanks the honourable member for his interesting question. With an eye to the Rules of Procedure I must confine myself to a summary answer here. ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/81 Narjes South Africa accounts for 48% of the world's gold production. 30% of the Community's imports come from South Africa. South Africa plays no decisive role, as there are many other sources of supply, such as Latin America, North America and Oceania. In the case of platinum 80% of the world's supplies come from South Africa and 13% from the USSR. There are no other significant sources of supply. South Africa is thought to account for 30 to 50% of the Community's manganese imports, depending on whether one ascribes imports whose origin is unclear to that country or not. Although South Africa and the USSR have 70% and 20% respectively of the world's deposits, it would be possible to increase production in other mining areas \u2014 Australia, Brazil, Gabon \u2014 within about five years. The Community depends on South Africa for about 30% of its vanadium. The irregularity of supplies from alternative sources could cause problems in the long South Africa is thought to account for 50% to 74% of the Community's chrome imports, depending on whether one ascribes imports whose provenance is not clearly identifiable to South Africa or not. Since Zim babwe's exports are channelled through South Africa it may be said that there are no truly alternative sources of supply. Asbestos imports from South Africa are negligible. South Africa provides 10 to 15% of the Community's uranium requirements. If necessary uranium can be imported from other producing countries instead. South Africa's provision of iron ore is negligible. The same goes for silver, the main deposits of which are in Latin and North America and Oceania. South Africa provides only 5% of the Community's coal consumption, largely for thermal power stations. Not only does the Community produce a lot of its own, there are also alternative sources of supply on world markets. South Africa's provision of nickel is negligible; the main suppliers are Canada, Oceania and the USSR. The situation gives cause for concern largely, there fore, in the case of platinum, vanadium and chrome. The Community has no immediate plans to restrict imports of these minerals from South Africa. Nor does the Commission need further studies on the matter; the situation here is familiar enough from earlier investigations. Several years ago the Commission sug gested building up emergency stockpiles of these products, but most Member States thought they could not find the necessary funds. Some of them also believe it is a matter purely for private industry to implement the necessary safeguards. Industry would be obliged to replace vanadium and chrome with other alloys, whilst a high degree of recy cling could be done for platinum, essential for the catalysts used in petroleum refining and fertilizer production. But there would be at least a 25% short fall in requirements. Research work aimed at using platinum substitutes for catalyst manufacture might also find a solution, parti cularly by studying certain rare earths. But no precise time scale can be set for this. ANDREWS (RDE). \u2014 I want to thank the Commis sioner for his courtesy and for his reply. I hope he will give me more details about the possibility of alterna tives and will send me the necessary figures. But it strikes me as an appalling indictment of the European Community that we have not thought of alternative sources for these precious metals and other valuable commodities, in particular coal. I want to question the Commissioner on the fact that only 5% of South Afri can coal is imported into the Community. That is not my understanding. I would suggest to him that, in view of the results of the recent whites-only election in South Africa, . . . PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Andrews, your speaking time is up. NARJES. \u2014 (DE) To make sure there is no misunder standing: imports from South Africa accounted for 5% of Community consumption, that is to say 22 mil lion tonnes in 1982. That is 23% of all Community coal imports. In 1987 coal imports from South Africa are likely to be lower. Experts say they will be down to about 17 million tonnes. That would mean that some 18% of Community imports came from South Africa. SMITH (S). \u2014 I want to ask a question on two of the minerals mentioned in the question, uranium and coal. Is the Commission aware that South Africa does not demand a peaceful end-use commitment for its exports of uranium? I was interested to note that the Commis sioner mentions that we import 15% of South Africa's uranium into the EEC. Could he also tell me what proportion of their military uranium is imported from South Africa into EEC countries? The next point relates to coal. The British Government continually tells us it is opposed to apartheid, but it has increased its imports of coal from South Africa by 300% since 1980. Is this not a totally hypocritical pos ition to take? NARJES. \u2014 (DE) On the subject of uranium, our information is that some 10 to 15% of the Com- ",
        "No 2-352/82 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5.87 Narjes munity's uranium requirements are met from South Africa sources and that in our view alternative sources are available and can be developed. But we are not in a position to give you a statistical breakdown of imports for military purposes. In quantitive terms the Com munity as a whole imported 8 500 tonnes of uranium from third countries in 1986, 10 to 15% of them from South Africa, as I have indicated. As for coal, I do not wish to pass judgment on indivi dual Member States. The Commission, in reply to an earlier question by Mr De Clerq, has already said that the decision to ban imports is a purely political deci sion and that this decision is thus awaited in the con text of political cooperation. DURY (S). \u2014 (FR) I see that the Commission is tak ing refuge behind the decision-makers, who are the foreign ministers and the Member States themselves. But I would like to ask what new initiatives the Com mission has taken vis \u00e0 vis the Council of Ministers, for example, to follow the example of the Netherlands which decided on a more far-reaching embargo. Is the Commission not in fact exhibiting a kind of passive attitude, which is perhaps somewhat reprehensible? NARJES. \u2014 (DE) The Commission has regularly taken part in the debates of the ministers meeting in political cooperation. At present there is no apparent majority there in favour of the measures awaited by the honourable lady. ULBURGHS (NI). \u2014 (NL) The Community has no gold or uranium, but it has enough coal for the next 200 years. Why, instead of boycotting South African coal, are tens of thousands of workers being made redundant? In Limburg, where I live, tens of thou sands of mineworkers are being made redundant this year, partly as a result of the import of this South Afri can ' apartheid coal''. NARJES. \u2014 (DE) Community coal has given way to imported coal \u2014 and not just South African coal \u2014 because imported coal is considerably cheaper than Community coal. Particularly since the collapse of the Rand, South African coal has gained a place on the world market, especially in Asia, which might provide considerable food for thought. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 17 by Mr Visser (H- 98/87): 1 Subject: Driving and rest periods in road transport Is the Commission prepared to put forward pro posals as soon as possible for the amendment of Regulation 3820/85 1 (laying down conditions for driving, rest and duty periods, changes to the sys tem of payments and better control procedures) in the light of the results of a survey carried out at Dutch borders among Dutch and foreign lorry drivers, from which it emerged that there is large-scale tampering with the tachographs, Regu lation 3820/85 is largely disregarded, the working week is unjustifiably long, and drivers frequently fall asleep behind the wheel and cause accidents? CLINTON DAVIS, Member of the Commission. \u2014 In the light of experience and practice, it has become clear that the previous legislation had been inflexible and difficult to enforce. Accordingly, the objective of the amending regulation was to provide greater flexi bility for the operator and transport planner while safeguarding safety and maintaining sensible working conditions. Honourable Members will recall that I set out the opi nion of the Commission on all aspects of this question, notably the impact of the proposed changes on drivers, when it was debated in the European Parliament some time ago. Social progress, road safety and harmonized conditions of competition lie at the heart of the aims of the common transport policy, and, of course, the Commission works to these objectives. It is far too early, however, to draw any definitive conclusions as to the effectiveness or the consequences of the application of this relatively recent regulation, having regard to these objectives. As I stated to the Council and to the Committee on Transport of the European Parliament, the Commission would not hes itate to amend the regulation should circumstances indicate that this would be required. VISSER (S). \u2014 (NL) I am grateful to the Commis sioner for his answer, but I still have a serious prob lem. The survey I refer to in my question revealed that, instead of an average of 45 hours, drivers are working 75 hours a week and that a quarter of the drivers questioned said serious tiredness had at some time or other resulted in their falling asleep at the wheel, causing serious accidents. According to the regulation, the evaluation will not take place until the autumn of 1989. In view of the disturbing results of the survey, does the Commissioner not feel that the evaluation should be brought forward and the control measures tightened up? CLINTON DAVIS. \u2014 I am aware of the evidence being formed on this matter and the research under taken thus far and, of course, it follows that serious claims of this kind must be and are being investigated. Former oral question without debate (0-1/87), converted into a question for Question Time. OJNo L370, 31. 12. 1985, p. 1. ",
        "12.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/83 Clinton Davis As I indicated before, should the overall pressures of this kind indicate that there is a requirement for change, we shall certainly take that into account. If it is a question, of course, of the regulations being breached, we shall take action to enforce them. But at the moment not all the Member States are in fact applying the regulation. Insofar as the implementing measures are concerned, a number of Member States \u2014 four in fact \u2014 have still failed to translate the regu lation into their law. We are negotiating with those Member States to ensure compliance. If it is not forth coming, legal action will be taken. ROGALLA (S). \u2014 (DE) I should like to ask the Com missioner if he is aware that workers, lorry drivers in the various Member States, including the Federal Republic of Germany, feel hard done by as a result of this directive, because both driving time and working time have been increased. Does he agree with my impression that the employers' interests have decidedly prevailed over the interests of the workers? CLINTON DAVIS. \u2014 That is, of course, summing up, in a way, the views that I expressed on behalf of the Commission when this matter was debated by the Transport Council. Of course, I had other views about the matter too, all of which drew the conclusion from me, on behalf of the Commission, that the decision made by the Council was not one that was going to move ahead satisfactorily. It was for that reason, therefore, that I have given this House every indica tion that we are holding the present regulation under the closest scrutiny, and that is why, in fact, it may be necessary to bring forward an amending piece of legis lation in the not too distant future. PRESIDENT. \u2014 As the author is not present Ques tion No 18 will be answered in writing. 1 Question No 19 by Mr Barrett (H-23/87): Subject: Study on the costs of introducing a tax incentive scheme to encourage employers to take on employees in the least-advantaged areas In replying to my report on a regional incentive scheme for the development of less-favoured regions of the European Community (Doc. A 2- 79/85), Commissioner Lord Cockfield said that the Commission was willing to carry out a further study of the problem, though it would be difficult for the Commission to report back in a year. 2 Can the Commission now state its position with regard to this matter? PFEIFFER, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) Pur suant to the European Parliament's resolution on the See Annex 'Question Time'. Debates of the European Parliament, No 2-329, Septem ber 1985, p. 298. honourable member's report the Commission commis sioned a study to examine the economic aspects of the regional incentives proposed by the honourable mem ber. The study will in theory and on the basis of avail able empirical findings clarify the economic advan tages of various types of regional aids. The aim is a cost-benefit analysis of various types of regional aids, investment and labour market subsidies, and thus a picture of the relative cost-effectiveness of the various types of aid mentioned in Parliament's resolution. For these reasons the study is running somewhat behind schedule. The first draft was received by the Commis sion in March. The final report is expected in summer of this year. BARRETT (RDE). \u2014 I thank the Commissioner for his reply, but I would like to ask him whether there is any possibility of the Commission giving its findings in the fairly near future. It is now approaching two years since this passed through Parliament. There is another reason why I would ask him to do everything possible to let us have the findings fairly soon. I now have a report on peripheral, maritime and island regions before the Committee on Regional Policy and Regional Planning, and it would be most helpful if we could get some information as to what is happening in the Commission with regard to that report. PFEIFFER. \u2014 (DE) Mr Barrett, I can assure you that when preparing this answer to your question I checked whether we could draw some conclusions from the first draft. I came to the conclusion that this would be very dangerous, and I therefore did not. But I can assure you today that if we can deduce some results in advance, that is to say before the summer, and help you in your work as rapporteur, then we shall of course do so. I cannot promise more than that today. I hope you will understand. FALCONER (S). \u2014 My question is indirectly linked to Mr Barrett's. Whilst I am in favour of incentive schemes to encourage employers to take on employ ees, our experience in the United Kingdom is that the incentive schemes, such as job-training schemes and youth-training schemes, have not actually created employment. In fact, most of the youngsters who were previously employed on them are now facing derelic tion on the dole queues in Britain. Can the Commission advise us whether it has done any reports on the long-term advantages of such schemes, i.e. how many are actually in full-time employment after the training schemes? PFEIFFER. \u2014 (DE) The object of the study is pre cisely to determine the effects which measures of this kind have, which areas we should concentrate on and which we should leave alone. I cannot answer your question today because the study is not yet complete. ",
        "No 2-352/84 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 SCOTT-HOPKINS, Sir James (ED). \u2014 Would not the Commission agree that one of the great difficulties at the moment is the lack of skills amongst young peo ple and that training schemes such as those being run in the United Kingdom are bringing skills to young people which will be of use to them in their later active working life? PFEIFFER. \u2014 (DE) The Commission has made no secret of its belief that occupational training and fur ther training is extremely important, particularly during the process of industrial restructuring we are witnessing at present. It will also be necessary to try to learn from the conclusions of this study how we can improve the currently unsatisfactory situation. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 20 by Mr Koloko tronis (H-26/87): Subject: Fire protection measures in the new sum mer season The Commission's Twentieth General Report (p. 241) refers to 1986 as a crucial year for the development of Community action on forestry. Moreover, 1987, as everybody knows, is the Year of the Environment. With summer now in view, and bearing in mind that last summer fires caused enormous damage to the forests of the Mediterra nean countries, is the Commission making prepar ations, in cooperation with the governments of the Member States, to implement in good time suita ble measures? Are there any plans in high-risk areas, such as Greece, Italy and Spain, for the swift implementa tion of an effective fire prevention policy? ANDRIESSEN, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) As the honourable Member knows, the Commis sion requested in its proposals not only some power with respect to fire prevention but also some power with respect to fire-fighting. Parliament also knows that after difficult negotiations in the Council the fire-fighting aspect was removed from the proposals and that the Commission's activities are therefore con fined to fire prevention. The Commission has received proposals from the Member States for projects in this area. In all, there are 46 of these projects. We con sulted the Committee on Forestry Protection on the projects and programmes proposed by the Member States very recently, on 6 and 7 May, and will thus be able to take a decision shortly on these projects and on the way in which they might take advantage of Com munity financing. I would point out in this context that the Community contribution to these projects is modest, at least in the budget we are now discussing. But it does seem that a start can be made on the pro jects that qualify as soon as the decisions have been taken, which means that they can go into operation at about the time the danger is at its worst, if that should be necessary. KOLOKOTRONIS (S). \u2014 (GR) As a supplementary, I would like to ask: firstly, within the scant margin available to the Commission and with the finance envisaged from the budget, will it be possible next month, or within two months, to implement these preventive measures in an effective way? Secondly: is there a possibility \u2014 if I understood cor rectly \u2014 that the Commission may also dispatch tech nical aid? ANDRIESSEN. \u2014 (NL) The amount included in the budget is small. This means that the number of pro jects that qualify for Community financing is also small. To the extent that we are able to contribute from the budget towards the financing of projects, we are able to act very quickly. So that is no problem. The Commission can also provide technical assistance within its limited means. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 21 by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz(H-37/87): Subject: Stade nuclear power station In 1987, Stade nuclear power station is being operated in such a way as to breach the directives of the Technical Inspection Authority. Despite widespread embrittlement, a precarious supply of cooling water and an unreliable emergency elec tricity supply, the reactor is running at full capac ity. How does the Commission view the granting of operating licences in the light of these technical conditions? What does the Commission know about the safety situation at the Atucha nuclear power station in Argentina, which is of the same design? CLINTON DAVIS, Member of the Commission. \u2014 The licensing of nuclear power plants, their supervi sion and inspection during operation are all matters falling under the competence of national authorities. The Commission is aware of the fact that during 1985 and 1986 measures were undertaken to adapt the Stade nuclear power plant to the actual technical state of the art. More specifically, enlargements and modifi cations were made to the cooling circuit. The decay heat cooling and the safety injection systems were adjusted to take advantage of the most recent tech nical knowledge. At the same time, diesel emergency power generators were updated. All these adjustment and improvement measures were carried out under the constant supervision of the German Technical Super visory Association, T\u00dcV, and the competent inspec- ",
        "12. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/85 Clinton Davis tion authorities. The Commission has no evidence that the plant in question is being operated in breach of any aspect of the European Treaty. The Community has no competence with regard to the Atucha nuclear power station in the Argentine, but it is incorrect to say that it is of the same design as the PWR at Stade. BLOCH VON BLOTTNITZ (ARC). \u2014 (DE) But the Commissioner must be aware that T\u00dcV, the Tech nical Inspection Authority, has not approved this power plant and that the emergency cooling systems have not been installed in accordance with the latest state of the art. All that was said is that cold water must no longer flow over the embrittled pressure ves sel, it has to flow from above, so that it is warmed by the fuel rods, otherwise the cold water might cause an explosion. I cannot understand the Commissioner and should be glad to hear how it is that we, who are res ponsible for safety, can be so frivolous about the possi bility of a nuclear meltdown in a city with a population of millions. CLINTON DAVIS. \u2014 Having regard to the debates that have been held in this House on matters affecting nuclear safety, I regard it as an affront on the part of the honourable lady to suggest that I have been frivo lous about this matter or indeed about matters affect ing nuclear safety. Not only do I resent it but of course it is utterly untrue. As far as the questions she raises are concerned, if she disputes the evidence which has been drawn to the attention of the Commis sion, she is perfectly entitled to do that and I suggest she make representations to the German authorities, having regard to the fact that I indicated at the very beginning of my answer to her question that the licen sing, supervision and inspection questions to which she has drawn attention are within the competence of that authority and not the Commission. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 22 by Mr Boutos (H- 39/879): Subject: Decision in respect of an EIB interest- subsidized loan for the re-establishment of victims of the Kalamata earthquake Having regard to the European Parliament's emergency resolution of 9 October 1986 calling for an EIB loan financed through the Community budget and the New Community Instrument on the basis of a decision by the Council of Ministers, could the Commission state whether it has put forward a proposal to the Council for such a deci sion and, if so, what are the terms of the loan (the amount and interest subsidy)? NARJES, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) The Commission viewed with satisfaction the broad agreement between the wishes expressed by Parlia ment in its resolution of 9 October 1986, to which the honourable member refers, and the actions outlined by the Commission the day before in its communication to Council and Parliament on emergency Community measures to help the Kalamata region after the earth quake. The Commission points out that it announced in this communication an immediate payment of aid totalling 1 million ECU, together with its decision of principle to introduce special measures for the areas affected, using the funds earmarked under Article 550 of the budget for Mediterranean programmes and the pre paration of integrated programmes. The Commission subsequently made available in December 1986 a sum of 15 million ECU, 40% of which have already been paid out as an advance. The Commission measures also provide for additional special aid, which will be the Community's contribu tion to the investments required for reconstruction work. Consultations on this are currently under way with the Greek authorities, which made due applica tion on 24 April of this year. We now have to decide what form the Commission's financial contribution to the investments needed for reconstruction should take, what kind of loans should be granted, or whether we can also do something out of the own resources of the Investment Bank. All this is under discussion. The Commission would remind the House that loans under the first tranche of the new Community instrument approved by the Council have all been paid out, except for those under the IVth new Community instrument, which is earmarked pri marily for small and medium-sized businesses. As soon as consultations are completed, the Commission will put forward proposals accordingly. BOUTOS (RDE). \u2014 (GR) I thank the Honourable Commissioner for his answer. However, I ask him, in the spirit of goodwill for which he is known, to answer me also about the following matters, first, why did the talks with the Greek Government take such a long time, and secondly, what are the exact sums which have not only been approved, but have also been absorbed and placed at the disposal of the Greek Government for the purposes mentioned earlier? NARJES. \u2014 (DE) The application was made on 24 April. The application can only be discussed sub sequent to that date. If today is the 12th of May, that means that 18 days have elapsed. I do not quite understand about rates. What is meant exactly? BOUTOS (RDE). \u2014 (GR) What I am asking is this: what are the reasons for the delay, granted that the earthquakes happened in September 1986, while the ",
        "No 2-352/86 Debates of the European Parliament 12.5. 87 Boutos applications and negotiations began in April and have still brought no results? Secondly, what amounts have really been approved up to now, and how much has been placed at the disposal of the Greek Government? Not just what has been approved, but also what has been handed over? NARJES. \u2014 (DE) I repeat what I said before. To begin with, one million under Article 690, then a deci sion to give 15 million, 40% of it paid as an advance, and now the application of 24 April, the history of which I do not know because it is an internal Greek affair and cannot therefore be commented on by the Commission. And this application is being looked at in detail. The question is how the Community should help finance the reconstruction work via loans. There are several options. Probably five or six different com binations, and we are currently considering which of these options is feasible and can be meaningfully put into practice. I have made special reference to the IVth new Community instrument, the only one currently available, though the Council of Ministers has ear marked it for small and medium-sized businesses. But if I understand it correctly, that does not mean that it cannot in principle be used in Kalamata too to finance reconstruction work there. PRESIDENT. closed. 1 The first part of Question Time is ber States \u2014 and put into the intra-Community emer gency fund. Perhaps the Commissioner could give us some of the reasoned arguments behind this. CHRISTOPHERSEN. \u2014 (DA) I think I can solve Mr McMahon's problem. A number of the emergency measures in the Member States which were put into effect in March were extended, so that they continued to apply in April. The Commission felt that was right in view of the climatic conditions, but we have no information from Member States at the present time on the financial cost. As soon as we receive it, we will of course send Parliament a report detailing the budg etary consequences of the payment in April too of special emergency aid on an intra-Community basis. CRAWLEY (S). \u2014 I refer to page 3 of the report on action taken, the second report by Mr Wedekind. I refer specifically to the common system of value- added tax mentioned throughout that report. It is unfortunate that Lord Cockfield, the VAT man of the European Community, is not present as I am com menting on this report. I would ask Commissioner Christophersen who is standing in for Commissioner Sutherland to forward my question to Lord Cockfield. When will Lord Cockfield stop playing games with the British electorate and come forward with his income slashing proposals for imposing VAT on presently zero-rated goods and services? 5. Action taken on the opinions of Parliament PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the communication from the Commission on action taken on the opinions of Parliament. 2 McMAHON (S). \u2014 On page 6, paragraph iv of the report on action taken, namely Information, on emer gency aid granted between the end of March and beginning of May, we notice there is a blank page here. Earlier on we were talking about electricity being wasted in the Berlaymont Building. It looks as if the Commission here is either wasting paper or it has no proposals. This is rather strange. As far as we are aware the proposal for aid for the victims of cold weather was extended beyond 30 March and I wonder why there is no mention of the amounts which were transferred after 31 March. On the same subject, I should like to ask the Commissioner about a transfer of appropriations. A few weeks ago the Committee on Budgetaiy Control received a transfer of appropria tions. Money was taken out of the aid for the projects mentioned on page 7 \u2014 emergency aid to non-mem- 1 See Annex 'Question Time'. 2 See Annex. CHRISTOPHERSEN. \u2014 (DA) I understand that it is not the intention that I should answer the question but that I should pass it on to Lord Cockfield. I will of course do that. CICCIOMESSERE (NI). \u2014 (IT) With regard to the Commission's report on action taken on the resolu tions relating to the nuclear question, which were adopted in the April session \u2014 and I refer amongst others to the Seligman, Bloch von Blottnitz, Schmid and Alber reports \u2014 I would like to ask the Commis sioner what action was taken on paragraph 4 of the Sp\u00e4th report, adopted on 8 April, which asked the Council to convene, in the months following the adoption of the resolution, a Conference of represen tatives of the governments of Member States, in order to set in motion the revision of the Euratom Treaty along the lines indicated by Parliament during the complex debate. CHRISTOPHERSEN, Vice-President of the Commis sion. \u2014 (DA) The report we are dealing with here does not concern a proposal which has been presented by the Commission as such. It is rather a call from Parliament to the Council for the holding of a confer ence. It would therefore be more appropriate for the question to be put to the Council. It is for the Council ",
        "12.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/87 Christophersen to indicate how it will react to the call from Parlia ment. MARSHALL (ED). \u2014 Would the Commissioner con firm that no proposals have been agreed in respect of a common form of VAT? Would he also note the hypo crisy of Mrs Crawley for in fact it was a Labour Government which imposed VAT on food in 1974 with Mrs Shirley Williams as the then Prices Minister. CHRISTOPHERSEN. \u2014 (DA) It is not for me to involve the Commission in the internal political debates of individual Member States, but I can con firm that the Commission has not taken any decision at the present time on a proposal for the alignment of the Member States' VAT rates. CICCIOMESSERE (NI). \u2014 (IT) I should like first of all to make clear that the resolutions that I quoted were addressed directly to the Commission, calling for a series of measures regarding safety standards. With regard to the revision of the Treaty the Commission also has an active part to play, and it therefore seems to me that the answer is unsatisfactory. I now ask, in particular \u2014 and thus put another question \u2014 to know what initiative the Commission has taken with regard to the urgent resolution, adopted on Thursday 9 April, on the question of action with the Syrian government, to ensure that it allows the Syrian Jews, the Jewish community in Syria, to leave the country. This call was addressed expressly to the Commission. CHRISTOPHERSEN. \u2014 (DA) I still think that what I said in my original answer is correct. We are not dealing with reports on Commission proposals, but with initiative reports. I am sorry if I misunderstood the question and, in the light of what has just been said, I will of course arrange for a written answer to be provided, in which we will explain how the Commis sion views this initiative report. It is our practice to supply an account of this kind every six months. But I will gladly arrange for an answer to be given as quickly as possible on the Commission's view of Par liament's initiative report in this area.

Approval of the minutes McMAHON (S). \u2014 Mr President, I refer to page 17 of the Minutes. Yesterday afternoon when Mr Amaral was in the Chair there was a point of order about the vote yesterday at 9 a.m. Many of us felt that the pro per procedures and practices had not been followed. The previous evening Mr Seefeld, who was in the chair, had not indicated that there was going to be a vote in the morning. Secondly, the documents had not been distributed in all the languages. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? I raised this issue yesterday afternoon and was given an assurance by Mr Amaral that the matter would be referred to the enlarged Bureau. I want to know what the decision of the enlarged Bureau was on this issue. ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/95 PRESIDENT. \u2014 It was raised at the meeting of the enlarged Bureau, quite correctly, and the enlarged Bureau, having looked into the matter, concluded that the Rules of Procedure had been applied correctly. TOMLINSON (S). \u2014 Mr President, how did the enlarged Bureau, in coming to that conclusion, man age to rationalize the fact that the motion for a resolu tion on which the vote took place was not available in accordance with the Rules of Parliament in all Com munity languages? The Bureau has tried to rationalize something which cannot be rationalized. We are enti tled to have any motion for a resolution on which an early vote is taking place available before us. At that stage it was not available. PRESIDENT. \u2014 My understanding, Mr Tomlinson, is \u2014 and I stand corrected if I am not right \u2014 that it was translated and available in all languages. MARSHALL (ED). \u2014 Mr President, is not the real trouble that Mr Tomlinson and some of his friends were not here yesterday morning? There were only 15 people here to vote the way he wanted them to vote. Where were they? PRESIDENT. \u2014\u00b7 That is not the point at issue. The enlarged Bureau considered this matter. It decided, quite correctly, that the Rules of Procedure were applied. That, therefore, is the end of the matter this morning. PRANCHERE (COM). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I wish to raise a matter under the Rules of Procedure of this House, which state that all Members are entitled to interpreting services in their respective languages at any of the various meetings in which they take part. From 21 to 26 June a meeting is to take place in Lis bon between the delegation for the parliaments of Central and Latin America and the delegation from the countries of the European Community. However, interpretation is to be provided in only five languages at this meeting, with the result that some parliamentar ians, myself included, are not going to be able to play a proper part. While we are in favour of keeping the costs of such trips in check, two comments are never theless called for here: first, the meeting is being held in Lisbon \u2014 within the Community, therefore; secondly, this is a case where democracy should be upheld, and that means treating all languages on an equal footing. In France, for instance, we have never been expected to understand two or three languages, or otherwise where would we be heading? We would be heading for an antidemocratic society, for a system in which groups like manual workers and farmers were deprived of representation. The Bureau should, it seems to me, look into this, since the delegation has already taken a quite firm stand. I therefore put this question to you, Lord Pumb: if the delegation were to say that it did not accept the Bureau's position, should we cancel such a conference, and what would be the effects as far as the Latin and Central American parliaments were con cerned? PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Pranch\u00e8re, I note your point and your concern on this matter. It is not a matter, however, for the House to determine. But, obviously, the enlarged Bureau and the group chairmen must be aware of the views that you express and that other Members might express on this particular issue. Naturally, we have looked at this very carefully. We looked at the whole question of languages and the availability of both translation services and interpreters for delegation meetings. I have to tell you that the cost of these services goes on increasing all the time, and this is of great concern to us. Therefore, the enlarged Bureau must take its responsibilities seriously and look at the possibilities available under the Rules of Proce dure of the House. But I merely repeat that we note your comments and will take them into consideration as we determine these matters in respect of the various delegations. CRAWLEY (S). \u2014 Mr President, this is a point of order by way of thanks to yourself. According to that wellknown political journalist, Terry Wogan, you sat through the entire performance of the Eurovision Song Contest last Saturday on our behalf. It must have been a training session for the farm-price vote later this week. But you will have noticed, and I hope with satisfaction, that Turkey's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest did not get one single vote, which must prove that they are musically, as well as politically, out of tune with the European Community and should not be given House room. PRESIDENT. \u2014 I had no influence at all, of course, on the final outcome or the vote. (Laughter) You will note, of course, that my own country gave maximum points to Ireland so I hope they will ratify the Single European Act which, of course, is very important.

BAR\u00d3N CRESPO (S), rapporteur. \u2014 (ES) Mr Presi dent, fellow Members, the construction of a United Europe is a long and painstaking task, requiring the combined qualities of intelligence with willpower and patience with determination. The impulse provided by Parliament in drawing up the treaty of political union and its statement on the Citizens' Europe has lead directly to the Single Act. As part of the Single Act, the European Council undertook to continue taking specific steps to bring the European Union nearer. Following a lengthy process of discussion and ratifica tion in all the parliaments of the Member States, and within the European Parliament, the Act is now about to come into force. Approval, qualified by some criti cism, has been the general judgement expressed, for the reason that the Single Act is not going to result in complete union. It should, however, be remembered that referenda have had to be called in two Member States, Denmark and Ireland, to gain approval for it. The Commission has proposed a working programme for making a success of the Single Act to Parliament, as a result of which a special committee has been set up with the task of proparing a reply. It is now up to the European Council to breathe life into it and give it some definite shape \u2014 bearing in mind that the Euro pean Council brought it into being in the first place. It does not, of course, represent the finishing touches to the shining palace of European Union, but is neverthe less an important step forward in the construction work. A comprehensive work programme, containing a large number of inter-linked elements, has been pre pared for the achievement of a Europe without bor ders by the end of 1992. The creation of the internal market involves the removal of barriers, which must be accompanied by the laying down of the foundations for a common social entity and the structuring of an economic entity, dependent on economic and social cohesion. The achievement of the internal market will go hand-in-hand with the development of these aspects, and of the other new agreed policies \u2014 tech nology, the environment and security \u2014 and a rear rangement of the current distribution of resources. The Common Agricultural Policy must be moder nized, and the financial capacity and budgetary auton omy of the Community have to be reinforced. An inter-state conference of the GATT type is all that would be required if a simple free-trade customs union was at stake, but we are dealing with the creation of a secure and shared foundation, cementing the real, everyday aspects of the Community. These moves must enable us to overcome the cost of those areas in which we are not united, which currently exceed the Community's budget, and which put our technological future at risk and perpetuate our client-status in the area of security. This projection of Europe clearly creates opportunities for the entrepreneurial sector, offering, through its size, the advantages to be gained from an economy of scale. However, it also associates economic regions and systems of production with varying levels of development, encouraging concentration processes which, left to themselves, will increase inequalities and discrepancies. The Community stands in need of its own North-South dialogue if it is to lay down the bases for a real, effective European citizenship by means of cooperation rather than confrontation. With regard to the cooperative growth strategy, it must be borne in mind that under current world economic circumstances, there can be no doubt that the basic force behind growth will, over the next few years, come from our internal market. Japan's armour plating and the United States' increasing protectionism are making external opportunities scarce, and they cannot easily be replaced by the Third World, which is heavily in debt and is also trying to promote its own export capacity. These factors confer a role of capital importance upon the cooperative growth strategy. There is no doubt that the economic policies of the Community nations are gradually falling into line with each other. But the job creation process must be speeded up, as unemployment, like inflation, becomes a common problem in a single market, making econo mic policy particularly important. Convergence of economic policies presupposes the consolidation of monetary policy, involving a streng thened EMS and the creation of an autonomous Euro pean central banking system, speaking with a single voice in the international forum and enabling the ECU to be stabilized. It is somewhat ironic that we, as mem bers of the Community, are able to achieve monetary cooperation within the IMF or at conferences which we attend individually, but are unable to do the same thing at home. A failure to make progress in this area means leaving de facto domination by the strongest currency intact \u2014 rendering any coherent economic management quite impossible. The work which remains to be done is not restricted to intergovernmental or civil service circles. In an open economy context, the social partners have an indis pensable part to play. This explains the importance of consultation policy, which the Commission itself has promoted \u2014 we only have to look at Val Duchesse to see the results \u2014 but to which it has not, however, ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/97 Bar\u00f3n Crespo given sufficient emphasis in its programme. The prac tice of negotiating agreements as opposed to syste matic confrontation is a distinctive feature of Euro pean societies, and is something we should defend. To do so we must give priority to a comprehensive \u2014 and I stress the word comprehensive because it is missing from paragraph 8 of the translation of the motion for a resolution \u2014 European social programme and specific resources to deal with safety and health at work, pro fessional training and social security so that the inter nal market should not involve any detriment to work ers' rights or encourage 'social dumping'. Policies regulating the Community area are of particular importance in building up this Europe without fron tiers. Firstly, the transport and communication infras tructure must be organized and conditions promoting profit-making must be created, to be accompanied by competition protection policy, a common external policy covering trade and developmental aid, and stringent minimum standards to safeguard the envi ronment. We consider economic and social cohesion to have been a fundamental element in European integration ever since the Treaty of Rome was signed. It has not, however, developed as substantially as it should and, moreover, the successive enlargements of the Com munity have served to increase the differences. History shows that the processes involved in creating large markets lead to a concentration of activity and income in certain regions. These processes do not continue for ever, as the Community today embraces regions of traditional industry which are in evident decline along with regions which are underdeveloped in the conven tional sense. The Commission's objectives should then meet with approval. However, with regard to the duplication of funds forecast for the next five years, the figure could be kept to an absolute minimum, until we are shown how this can make a real contribution to achieving cohesion. The reinforcement of the structural funds is not, how ever, the be-all and end-all of this matter; cohesion is another aspect which must be taken into account within the structure for growth and when realizing the potential of the less developed economies, which at the moment are distorted by industrial subsidization poli cies which often neutralize the effects of regional policy. Cohesion policy is, from all points of view, a significant element in the Community's future, some thing which cannot be measured using the narrow and short-sighted criteria offered by national budgetary balances. Instead, the mutual advantages to be gained through a single market should be taken as the yards tick, bearing in mind that prosperity for all means prosperity throughout the constituant parts. I should like, Mr President, to refer briefly to two other aspects: firstly, the reform and the modernization of the CAP, one of the pillars of the Community which, due to its very success in terms of production and because of trends on the world market, is now causing serious problems and is not providing proper benefits for farmers or contributing to a balanced Europe. The Community is today spending more on storing sur pluses than it is on achieving cohesion, it is spending more on cows than on creating employment, more on cereals than on research. The surpluses must be got rid of, and a restrictive price policy should be applied to alter the intervention mechanisms in order to prevent them building up again. In our opinion, the future should be grounded on the protection of the family- based farming enterprise, with particular support for small-scale operations, though structural measures involving direct aid, along with an incomes policy, special attention towards environmental protection, in order to preserve the ecological balance, and an adjustment to the real needs of both European consu mers and the world market. Secondly, there is the matter of financial capacity and budgetary autonomy. In this area, we are faced with a double challenge: on the one hand, restructuring a Community which is on the brink of bankruptcy and, on the other, obtaining sufficient resources to realize the aims of the Single Act and economic and social cohesion. There is one fundamental condition: the Community's financial autonomy and the democratic nature of the decisions which may have to be taken must be respected. To this end, the adoption of a multi-annual approach for financial forecasting allows for deeper consideration, as long as it does not become a rigid framework, with no opportunity for change. Similarly, the introduction of mechanisms or proposals such as that for 1.4% of GNP is a necessary first step towards obtaining durable and stable resources, provided that it starts from a basis of rela tive prosperity. As for the insistence on budgetary dis cipline, I would repeat Parliament's view that budget ary discipline is an essential element in all budgetary management, and that it should be negotiated, not imposed \u2014 which would render the democratic con trol which Parliament should exercize meaningless. There are two final aspects relating to the Community dimension which need to be stressed: external rela tions and European policy, or responsibility, towards the Third World and, of equal importance, the inclu sion of one of the basic elements of the Single Act \u2014 the political and economic aspects of security. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, major decisions are being taken at a time of urgent need. It is becoming increasingly clear just how necessary Europe is: the consequences of its absence are ever clearer, too. What we must do is to honour the undertakings we entered into by adopting the Single Act, with the will-power, timetable and means required to ensure that it does not become just another disappointment. The course we should take has been mapped out, all that is now needed is for the Council to show itself able to accept the consequences of its own actions. Applause) VON WOGAU (EPP), rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Mr Presi dent, ladies and gentlemen, if we in this House were ",
        "No 2-352/98 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5. 87 Von Wogau to ask ourselves whether there is the will to make the Single Act a success, then there is no doubt that the broad majority of this House would agree. But I think a useful purpose would be served in this debate by investigating once more the content and purpose of this Single Act. There is one thing we must understand quite clearly: if we want to reach the reform targets of the European Community, then all the experience of the years gone by has taught us that that can only be done through sensible growth. But how can we achieve this growth in this present situation? We know that it is becoming extremely difficult to export to America and to the whole of the dollar area and that we cannot expect the growth impulses of the last few years to continue in the future. We also know that when our firms investi gate where their chances of growth lie, it is first and foremost to Europe that they must look; which is why it is so important for our future that we realise the common market. We must also realise that the absence of a common market in Europe today has cost us dearly and has ser iously restricted our capacity to compete. We have complained often enough in this Parliament that Euro pean firms spend 12 thousand million ECUs every year to cross internal Community borders and that changing money between our currencies alone costs 2,400 million ECUs. It has also been estimated that there is an annual loss of 40 tousand million ECUs in potential savings in Europe because we still have not managed to set common standards and pan-European invitations to tender in the field of high technology. These are the real reasons for our needing this com mon market. We must also appreciate that it can only be to our advantage to use opportunities for growth to realise the common market in the field of infrastructure, and I am thinking of telecommunication and transport infrastructures, which must constitute an essential component of the overall programme. And let us not forget either that opening up this common market, opening up the borders between our Member States is also part and parcel of our concept of a citizens' Europe, that it is only when the citizens of Europe realise that we have one common external border and no internal borders that they will appreciate that we really are living in a community, and that is yet one more reason why the Single Act must be a success. But we must also realise that this Single Act will not be presented to us on a plate and that difficult decisions lie ahead of us. That is why it is absolutely essential that these proposed changes to the decision-making process are implemented. This programme can only be implemented when the unanimity rule in the Council of Ministers is made more flexible on the one hand, and when the democratic control, as described in the Single Act, really improves the present situation, on the other hand. I shall only mention a few issues which are problematical: the necessary approximation of the rates of value added tax and of consumer taxes and opening up the market for high-quality foodstuffs are examples of difficult political decisions. Even opening up the market for capital and services will require a strong political determination. That is why we need majorities on prices in this House if we want to suc ceed in our objectives. In our report we also propose quite specifically that the European currency system should be developed into an autonomous European central banking system with facilities to react jointly on the external front \u2014 for example vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar and the yen \u2014 and secondly to ensure that the ECU develops in a stable way. It we pursue this objective, we must beware at the out set of falling into certain pitfalls. For example, opening up our frontiers will probably mean that, at least ini tially, there will be a concentration in areas where industrial capacity is already large. We have already seen this phenomenon in the United States, for exam ple when the market there was opening up, admittedly a few centuries ago, or in Germany when the German common market was created in the Customs Union, or in Italy when Italy became a unified country. There was first of all concentration in industrial centres and only after that did a counter movement emerge. But that serves the interests neither of the less developed regions nor of the industrial centres, and so we must eliminate that danger right from the very start. Our programmes \u2014 the Mediterranean programmes, the programmes for the less developed regions and the programmes for those areas undergoing industrial change, I would mention only steel and shipbuilding, \u2014 must contain the necessary elements to counterbal ance such a development, and money from the social fund, the regional fund, the agricultural structural fund and the European Investment Bank must be grouped together and used in such a way that real opportunities for growth are created. That is why it is also essential to double the structural funds. We also know that the development of social policy goes hand in hand with the development of the com mon market. I shall only mention a few points: social regulations for migrant workers, for that programme is closely linked with the creation of the common mar ket; security of employment, for that is a component of the Single Act; vocational, training programmes within the regional programmes, for proper vocational training is an important instrument for combating unemployment. We also believe that the dialogue between both sides of industry should be further inten sified. And now to agriculture, where new emphasis is laid in the Commission's proposals and in this report. We are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that interven tion in its present form is no longer meeting the aim of stabilizing agricultural incomes. We spend billions, for ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/99 Von Wogau example, on buying up and storing milk in order to stabilize prices, but we read in the papers that at the same time the consumer prices for milk and butter are falling, so that it is obvious that prices cannot be stabil ized in this way at the present time because of sur pluses. We also realise that the elimination of surpluses is a precondition for a sensible price development in the future. We know, and say so clearly in our report, that prices alone cannot be the instrument for stabilizing agricultural incomes, as laid down in the Treaty of Rome, and that to stabilize agricultural incomes there must also be payments which have no market value, for example payments for preserving the natural and social environment. That is why direct payments to family holdings in the European Community must play a more important role in the future than in the past. We must continue along the path laid down in the mountain farming programme, for example, or in the programme for disadvantaged regions or in certain agricultural-social areas in the past. We must draw the budgetary conclusions from the demands we lay down here; which means restructur ing the agricultural funds over the next five years, away from the guarantee fund and into the agricul tural structures and the agricultural-social services. We also support the Commission's proposal to add a new element in the future to the own resources of the European Community, an element to be based on the gross domestic product. The two rapporteurs have done their best to gain as broad a consensus as possible in this House for this report. I appreciate that this report contains some points which each of us has some hesitation in endors ing. But I appeal to you all to overcome these doubts and give this report as broad support as possible, for that is the necessary precondition for the Single Act being a real success. (Applause) TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I am pleased to take part in this debate and to be able to tell you of the Presidency's first impressions of the discussion currently going on in the Council on the set of proposals submitted by the Commission on ways and means of making a success of the Single Act. I note with satisfaction that Parliament has lost no time in addressing these proposals and will today be able to give its initial reactions to the overall package. This response will be most useful to the other institu tions. The Presidency fully appreciates the importance of the fundamental issue raised by the Commission's proposals. Recent financial years and the current state of the Community's finances demonstrate that its internal development is being hampered by the inade quate level of available resources. The Presidency nevertheless shares the Commission's conviction that this problem cannot be examined exclusively from the financial angle but must be set in the general economic context in which the Community has to exist. Our first discussions in the Council confirmed that the matter of resources cannot be viewed in isolation from the efforts aimed at adapting our agriculture to the new pattern of farming worldwide. Nor can it be dis sociated from the objective of completing the internal market, account being taken of enlargement of the Community and economic and social cohesion. Another factor to be taken into consideration is the fact that, currently, all the Member States are pursuing policies of economic stringency. The impression that the proposals submitted by the Commission make on the Council is that they take account of all these factors and their interrelationships. Having been presented with such an important dos sier, with such implications for the Community's development in the medium and long term, the Presi dency must see its main task as keeping the debate on the macroeconomic level on which the Commission has pitched it, and therefore maintaining an all-round view of the whole. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, with our organization of the activities of the Council we also wish to ensure inter nal cohesion between the different aspects: reforming agricultural policy, strengthening cohesiveness, financ ing the budget, budgetary discipline. This approach is also the one advocated by your specialist committee, which was chaired by Lord Plumb. I am aware that these proposals form a highly complex whole, and that they will require intense consideration and coopera tion on the part of all the institutions. But we shall have to act fast, for the problems we have to solve are extremely urgent. The Presidency thinks the time has come for more detailed discussion of the different solutions that might be considered. In the opinion of the Presidency, the European Council scheduled for the end of June should by then be in a position to clar ify a number of items. The Presidency has outlined a programme of activities to that end. Following a first informal exchange of views by Ministers in the Gen eral Affairs Council on 22 February, the Committee of Permanent Representatives devoted a number of meet ings to a general debate on the Delors 'triptych', as it is called. Subsequently, the Presidency submitted a report to the General Affairs Council of 26 April, thereby providing a basis for a comprehensive and highly productive general exchange of views. This ministerial debate gave everyone the opportunity to clarify their positions and to draw some preliminary, if cautious, conclusions that will be of value to the sub sequent work of the Committee of Permanent Repre sentatives. The task facing the Presidency will therefore be to concentrate the debate on the fundamental questions ",
        "No 2-352/100 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5. 87 Tindemans and to anticipate in as much detail as possible the probable impact of the different solutions that will be proposed. On the basis of such analysis and the con clusions drawn from it, the Council of Ministers, and subsequently the Heads of State and Government, will be able to draft the main points of a general agree ment. The Council of Economic Affairs and Finance Ministers also exchanged views, on 11 May, on this subject. It goes without saying that this discussion and the activities of the Council of Agriculture Ministers will have a major influence on the general debate. The Council of General Affairs Ministers of 25 May will be our next meeting. That Council will meet again, prob ably more than once, in June, to prepare for the Euro pean Council. The Presidency will do everything in its power to ensure that the talks by the Heads of State and Governments will bear fruit and will offer definite prospects for the development of the Community in the medium term. I sincerely hope that the elections that have been announced in three Member States will not stand in the way of realizing these objectives, in other words that the three major reforms, on the basis of the Commission's 'triptych' proposal, really will be implemented. That will also bring us a step nearer to European Union. I shall now listen with particular attention to the rest of the debate and shall take care ful note of the opinion delivered by this Assembly in conclusion. (Applause) ing to ensure that there are the necessary large majori ties to achieve progress for the peoples of Europe. (Applause) We are pleased that the political groups agreed to our suggestion to set up this special committee. I appre ciate that some committees, such as the Political Affairs Committee, are worried that this will erode their authority. But the results of this committee prove that it is possible to get a broad majority. My group has decided by a majority to endorse the recommendations of the two rapporteurs and to sup port this compromise in the committee. This willing ness will also hold good for the future. We are willing to form a major alliance with the Commission and the majority of this House on the substance of what is to be done under the Single Act so that real progress is made and so that during the 1989 direct elections we can say to the people we represent: This Europe is on the move! We invite the Council to join us! Although I am extremely sceptical on this point when I see what is said in fine speeches on Sunday and then what deci sions are taken by the national governments from Monday to Friday. We are not the only ones, Mr von Wogau, who must accept that a price has to be paid for the single market \u2014 the governments must accept that too! ARNDT (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, the Socialist Group is absolutely convinced that Europe needs a new stimulus. But we are equally convinced that the Council in all its wisdom is showing destinct signs of schizophrenia. So long as the representatives of the national governments sit here on these benches of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, they are all in favour of progress in Europe. But as soon as their term of office is over and they go back to the Council of Ministers as normal members, then they go back to thinking solely of their own national advantages: then they block negotiations, they barter over the last Ecu, or the last mark \u2014 to put it more clearly \u2014 or the last pound. (Applause) I did not say over the last Belgian franc, Mr Tinde- All of us here in this House must understand clearly that everything we want for Europe will only succeed if we try to put aside the issues which divide us and concentrate on what we have in common. The Single European Act, while being far from what this Parlia ment called for, nonetheless does offer a chance. The chance has been taken up by the Commission in its proposals, and the general tenor of its proposals is the right one. It is now up to this Parliament to grasp this chance. My group states unambiguously that it is will- (Applause) I am not merely chairman of my political group, I am also a German Member of Parliament. And that is why I quite deliberately make this point about my own country. My country, the Federal Republic of Ger many, has a tremendous amount to gain from this sin gle market. But one must also give in order to receive. Unfortunately the feeling in my country at the moment seems to be that we can enjoy the advantages without giving anything in return. They want to use the advantages of the internal market for their own industry without being prepared to pay more into the structural funds to help the regionally and socially weaker areas. We must realise that the regional differences in the Community after the enlargement to include the southern countries are much greater than the regional variations in the United States of America, for exam ple. Certain regions have an unemployment figure of more that 30%. But what is the Council doing about it? It continues its bickering, postpones decisions and ignores the prob lems. The last awful example of this is the report from the Finance Ministers meeting. The Council is not pre pared to do anything to offset the deficit of the 1987 budget for which the Council of Ministers, and parti cularly that of the Agriculture Ministers, is mainly res- ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/101 Arndt ponsible. This cannot go on. We must say unequivo cally that the governments are failing in their duty and are failing to grasp this opportunity offered by the new impulse and the new Single Act. This report gives a clear-cut answer to several basic questions: 'yes' to the realisation of the internal mar ket, but not at the cost of jobs and the poor regions. 'Yes' to the call for increased own resources, but not so that they can be used to finance the already over high spending on agricultural guarantees. My group gives top priority to the committee's call for greater social rights for employees. The Commission has submitted proposals on this. We in Europe want something more; we want a whole package of mea sures for a social space because we feel this is one of the most important components of a common market. In conclusion I issue an invitation to you to join in the major alliance for a new Europe, a citizens' Europe. (Applause) LAMBRIAS (PPE). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, col leagues, it has unfortunately taken thirty years for us to begin showing an interest in what the Treaty of Rome laid down as a fundamental requirement for European integration: I mean the acceptance of mea sures to secure economic and social cohesion. It took the progressive entry of the poor countries \u2014 first Ire land, then Greece and finally Spain and Portugal \u2014 into the Community to banish the narrow, economic view of what Europe should be, a view which has prevented Europe trom playing the leading role that it can and should play as a world power. Meanwhile, the division continues between those who think of the Community as a European economic cooperative, as a sort of joint fund, and those who argue that in order to provide it with a strong, creative regional policy, a continual situation of opposition and confrontation is required. This contrast continues to obstruct the creation of radical new policies to bring about a real convergence of the economies and the achievement of measures for social and economic cohesion. The gap between the developed and the backward regions \u2014 let's not be ashamed of admitting that there are backward regions in the Community \u2014 rather than narrowing is in fact widening, and is creat ing serious dangers. While we congratulate ourselves that Europe has 320 million inhabitants, providing the basis for our strength, few of us are concerned to find out how many of those millions live under quite unacceptable, miserable conditions. That fact that, for the first time, the Commission has set out the need for economic and social cohesion with such emphasis is indeed a major step in the right direc tion, marking a clear break with that narrow economic view according to which Community solidarity is something to be handed down by the rich countries to the poorer ones, a burden to be borne rather than an economic target in itself. On the contrary, the Com mission quite rightly underlines that this burden has a sound macroeconomic content, since otherwise no common European zone can exist. What I fear, however, is that despite the fact that the Community has mapped out the correct course, as indeed our report recognizes, the measures themselves will continue to be inadequate and so will eventually be shown up as ineffective. You may ask why this should be: it is because doubling, or even tripling, the resources of the structural funds would remain useless unless combined with a policy of prevention: in other words, rather than allocating money as a sort of pain killer afterwards, to try and cover up the unfortunate consequences, the existing imbalances should be removed. I would also like to point out that unfortunately the Commission report relegates social and environmental issues, which now constitute the necessary pre-condi tions for any sort of life within a European frame work, to a position of secondary importance. (Applause) IN THE CHAIR : MR MUSSO Vice-President PRICE (ED). \u2014 Mr President, the link is usually made between the European Parliament's pressure for European Union and the progress achieved by the Sin gle Act. However, the Single Act owes far more to a quite different parliamentary initiative, namely the Albert/Ball report and Parliament's follow-up to it. The Member States eventually seem to have got the message that attainment of the internal market will benefit the whole Community and lead to faster economic growth. The Single European Act laid the foundations for attaining greater wealth in the Community. It went on impliedly to distribute some of that extra wealth. Some of it was to go to the Community's budget, to ele ments which can enhance the growth strategy. These include common research and development and build ing up our communications infrastructure. Another important part of that extra wealth which we shall create will go to increasing the structural funds in order to achieve greater economic and social cohesion. I am troubled that a logical progression from the crea tion of extra resources to the spending of them is put in question by parts of this motion for a resolution. ",
        "No 2-352/102 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Price References to a series of programmes happening at the same time raise the possibility of Member States obstructing progress towards the single market. They may argue that if there are difficulties relating to this or that other matter, they will hold up agreement on the internal market measures. If that happened, we would be stopping the engine of growth. Without that growth we shall all suffer. We shall end up handing our markets to the Japanese and Americans and shar ing suffering instead of sharing growth. The attain ment of the internal market must be subject to no pre conditions. Parliament has said that before and it must hold to it. failed to cover the results of its own failure to take decisions to restrain the growth in agricultural sur pluses. Never failed! Within this growth of resources we need a mechanism which will prevent those resources going to yet more agricultural spending. As the resolution stands, it lacks that mechanism. I would like to see the mechanism inserted, and it is a very important element. . . PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Price, your speaking time is up. Another important concept in the achievement of the internal market is that the programme must be achieved as a whole. Very many Member States would like to pick and choose. They see advantages in this particular aspect of it for them, disadvantages in that. That is true of all Member States. The point is that the achievement of the whole will benefit everyone. It we try to pick and choose, we will achieve nothing. It is perhaps dangerous that in paragraph 7 of the motion for a resolution we talk about priorities in a fashion which omits certain important areas. For example, we omit reference to liberalization of trans port. Elsewhere in the motion for a resolution we talk about the importance of spending on transport infras tructure projects. We do so rightly, because if we are to have one market working effectively, it is important to have good communications. But, of course, another aspect of exactly the same thing is transport liberaliza tion, which also can help to reduce costs. Those two things should go hand in hand, but the motion for a resolution lacks the element of transport liberalization. It also lacks in that internal market area any reference to the market in services. That really is a vital area in which we have to make progress, and to leave it out is a major defect in that whole section dealing with the internal market. This year the Community will spend in reality some thing like 70% of its budget on agricultural guarantee support. Who would have dreamed a few years ago that the Community's expenditure on agricultural guarantee support would have grown to its present figure? Who would ever have planned for it? The answer to both these questions is, no one. Agricultural guarantee expenditure is the mirror image of the rest of the budget. Whereas for most other expenditure Parliament has the last word and nothing is spent without positive decisions being taken, the Council retains control of agricultural support and the lack of decisions is what leads to the growth of expenditure. Scientific advance combines with our intervention sys tem to produce a situation where cuts in production are required year by year. If you fail to take decisions, then the Community is committed to increased expenditure. What we see is the Council each year in the end stumping up that expenditure. It has never BARBARELLA (COM). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I should like to emphasise again a few observations and assessments made by the Italian Communists on the Single Act, because I consider that clarity is necessary on this point. From the very beginning we have con sidered \u2014 and I believe that a large part of this Parlia ment has been in agreement \u2014 that the Single Act showed serious limitations on two points that to us appear to be essential: on the one hand, the demo cratic gap \u2014 that is to say, the failure to restore the balance in present institutional relations; and on the other, the objective limitations of the policies that it proposes \u2014 the first small glimmerings of action, when in reality unemployment problems, environmen tal problems and the problems of technological inno vation would have implied a very different approach from a Single Act that really wanted to interpret the will to develop the process of unification of the Com munity (and, in more distant terms, to achieve Euro pean Union, which still remains \u2014 at least as far as we are concerned \u2014 a main objective). That is why, Mr President, we considered it was over-emphatic of the Commission in its communica tion to have considered the Single Act as the new frontier, when we considered indeed that this step was an extremely modest one. The Commission, in its stra tegy for applying the Single Act, remains for the most part in line with the Single Act itself and therefore with those of its terms that have a diminishing effect, so that the Commission's proposal does not adequately develop a democratic process that we consider to be important; indeed, I would like to emphasise most emphatically that on certain points that concern the competence of the European Parliament, we seem in reality to note a dangerous backward trend both as regards the new financial mechanisms that are pro posed and, in particular, the new budgetary proce dural mechanism. Moreover, the other deficiency that seems to us to be extremely important is the fact that these global proposals do not produce any adjustment of the imbalance between the areas in greatest diffi culty in the Community and the other areas: on the contrary it seems to us that, since it does not include any substantial provision in regard to the creation of the social area, and since it has restricted the terms of cohesion in fact to a simple strengthening of the funds, this adjustment of the imbalance is in effect stillborn. ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/103 Barbarella This is the reason why, in the special committee, the Italian Communists fought for the inclusion in the Parliamentary report of a number of corrections in regard to this line, which we considered to have a dim inishing effect; the corrections concern a number of specific points \u2014 a true interpretation of the meaning of the Single Act, the need to associate an adequate social area with the implementation of the single mar ket and also to bring about, in effective terms, the economic cohesion of the countries of the Com munity. This is a point that we hold very dear, cer tainly not for any questions of form, but because we are convinced that the implementation of a single mar ket will have adverse implications that I do not think anyone can deny: documents by experts that have been circulated officially, documents commissioned by the Commission itself, emphasise very strongly the dangers inherent in the single market, in terms of the greater divisiveness that may subsequently be created within the Community. That is why we consider that the single market must be achieved taking these reali ties into account through a process that will take account of overall development. In effect, Mr Presi dent, cohesion cannot be achieved simply by doubling the funds, but only if all the Community's policies are aimed at the achievement of this objective. These are the fundamental points, but there is one more that I would like to mention, regarding the financial system: the efforts of the special Committee have allowed some points, that seemed to us considerably distorted, to be corrected, but that has not been the case with all the points. We expect that certain corrections that were not adopted in the special committee may, instead, meet with success in the Assembly, especially those relating to cohesion. We are responsive to the appeal launched by the Chairman of the Socialist Group, calling on Parliament to create a great alliance, as big as possible; but we wish this to happen on the basis of a position that will clearly define Parliament's intentions. Coalition is in fact only possible on condi tion that account is taken of the general interest. (Applause) SCRIVENER (LDR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I should first like to stress that the task undertaken by the Tem porary Committee was not an easy one, in that they had to cope with a twofold difficulty. First, they had to try to find an acceptable solution on reform of the common agricultural policy, a problem on which Par liament is deeply divided, as is the Council for that matter; secondly, there was the problem of establish ing the internal market in such a way as to avoid a clash between the most developed countries and those that are not so advanced, while at the same time com plying with the Treaty of Rome. The proposals on agriculture in Parliament's report are fairly reasonable, bearing in mind the amendments that have been made. There is no gainsaying the fact that there is a real problem, the problem of surplus production, and in this area the distortions of the intervention policy must be eliminated. But it is also necessary to find a solution that lets agriculture live and fulfil its role. As far as the internal market is concerned, our view is that the process of establishing the internal market needs to be accompanied by significant progress towards cohesion. This being the case, it is bound to take some time to achieve anything worthwhile in this area, but an affirmation of cohesion is necessary as of now in order to create a state of mind, a new attitude, in short an acceptance of an obligation to make efforts which are going to be demanding but are essential in order to avoid disintegration of the Community. However, we are worried by what we see. Difficulties are already piling up on the path towards realization of the Single Act. The proposals that have been brought forward, on mutual recognition of diplomas, opening up frontiers or public contracts, People's Europe and a host of other things, are all more or less at a standstill or meeting with systematic obstruction from one country or another. Once again, political will is lacking, and in fact the impression received is very much that all parties want to use the Single Act in their own way and work it for what it is worth. On the financial aspects of new resources based on GNP, we find the proposals constructive and support them, but serious ambiguities subsist where budgetary discipline is concerned. It may as well be said straight \u00e1way that we see the potential here for serious disa greement between the Council and Parliament, which could ultimately obstruct attainment of the objectives of the Single Act. One of the rapporteurs has asked whether we have the will to make a success of the Single Act. That is a good question. I incline to the view that what was seen on your Committee was fear of not making a success of the Single Act, which has today brought Parliament together on a document that we shall support, one which is not ideal, but will nevertheless provide a basis for progress. In conclusion, we often do well to be guided by fear. Let us hope that this will be the case here and the Sin gle Act will be a success. (Applause) PASTY (RDE). \u2014 (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us is much too cluttered and often self-contradictory in the positions it adopts. The truth of the matter is that it does not represent any advance on our previous positions and fails to establish a sufficiently clear policy line, to identify the limited range of priorities that would enable the Com munity to find a way out of the serious deadlocks that are paralysing its development. ",
        "No 2-352/104 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Pasty There is a lack of realism in the budgetary approach. How can the States possibly be expected to agree to allocate the Community new own resources unless the European Parliament on its side agrees to accept budgetary discipline, in one form or another? Once again, the common agricultural policy is saddled with sole responsibility for the current financial difficulties, while its role in European integration is denied and direct income support is presented as the universal panacea. All of this stems from a midguided concep tion of things. The CAP, the set-off for opening up the industrial market, was the foundation of the ori ginal Community and is still one of the only two real common policies that we have, along with the fisheries policy. How can it be imagined for a moment that the internal market to be completed by 1992 could be built on a basis detrimental to the achievements of the farming sector, which have made the Community the leading agricultural power in the world? How can it be ima gined that this policy will soon be reduced to a mere policy on social transfers, turning the majority of farmers in the Community into lifelong benefit reci pients or mere wardens of the rural environment? When this is what is being proposed, a strong condem nation of any renationalization of the common agri cultural policy, such as is found in the motion for a resolution, is sheer hypocrisy. It might have been hoped that the European Parlia ment was going to take its lead from the pragmatism shown by the Commission and show the Heads of State or Government what needed to be done to break the deadlock in Europe. But Parliament has set its sights on an impossible unanimity, and has yet again simply given its old demons another airing. VON NOSTITZ (ARC). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, if someone were to compare Altiero Spinelli's plans for Europe with what has emerged after twenty year's contention as a makeshift solution in the form of the Single Act, then he would be forced to be highly criti cal of it, especially in view of the dishonest heading 'success'. This Single Act is anything but a success; it is a failure. It confirms a policy of European integration based on objectives which are wrong and which have been recognized as such. First of all, no one can deny that in the European Community policies are being carried out without democratic control and without sufficient democratic legitimation. I need not say anything about the lack of authority of this Parliament. What we all understand back home as constitutional democracy is undermined in the EEC to the disadvantage of the ordinary citizen. I think we can ask ourselves when finally will a national constitutional court challenge a legal act of the EEC simply because it has not been passed demo cratically. Our call for a roll-call vote and our motion for a reso lution are designed to ascertain which of you, ladies and gentlemen, will silently vote for this democratic disenfranchisement. Secondly, we owe it, we feel, to one of our Member States, namely Ireland, to point out that the Single Act is incompatible with its constitution. The enlargement of Community policies to cover military policy cer tainly did nothing to further the European idea. We have voted against this report, or rather shall do so in its present form, because it, like the Commission, views the internal market as an economic area where as much as possible should be produced as cheaply as possible, with total disregard as to whether the prod ucts are really needed by the people of the Com munity, or whether the production processes are in keeping with the environment and the increased economic and social structures or with everyone's right to a job. You will muster no new enthusiasm for Europe with quantities, with the continuation of your failed growth ideology. To gain new enthusiasm for Europe you would have had to take up the real desires of the peo ple of Europe \u2014 for genuine peace, for emancipation, for an intact environment! D'ORMESSON (DR). \u2014 (FR) The Single Act is being presented as marking progress along the course to a real European union, but will it be able to lend fresh momentum to the Community? It may be thought that setting 1992 as the deadline for complet ing the internal market will be beneficial to the Mem ber States' economies. But this process will entail attainment of the following objectives: sustained economic growth, progress over monetary union, reform of the common agricultural policy, in which a resolve to win external markets will have its part to play, and of course a balanced budget, commensurate with our requirements and objectives. To this end the Commission has drawn up a communi cation entitled 'Making a success of the Single Act \u2014 a new frontier for Europe'. Parliament felt it would be a useful exercise to examine this document in detail. The rapporteurs, appointed from among the number of the Temporary Committee, have tabled a motion for a resolution which on the whole makes an honest assessment of the prospects for Europe. The proposals made by Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo and Mr von Wogau admittedly fall far short of our expectations. Nevertheless, our group would have been able to go along with their motion for a resolution, but it has been denatured in committee and has acquired a socialist bias. The three sections \u2014 social, agricultural and budgetary \u2014 have been rewritten in such a way that it is impossible for us to give our approval to the motion for a resolution as it now stands. Of the four ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/105 D'Ormesson main themes discussed in the report, which we shall consider in turn, only the economic situation has received proper treatment. It is obvious that a major boost needs to be given to growth. Does this not condition the prospects for suc cess of the internal market? But such action implies an effort in the direction of greater convergence of the various Member States' economic and monetary poli cies. Assuming an outlook along these lines, it is also necessary to consolidate the European Monetary Sys tem, taking steps to bring all Member States' curren cies into the mechanism. The creation of a European central bank is also essential. We welcome the Tem porary Committee's acceptance of our amendment on this point. Is not the foundation of such an institution the only way to give our Community a real economic and monetary dimension? Finally, it is important to promote the ECU, by encouraging its wider use. Apart from these things, we are told that the creation of a European economic area needs to be preceded by the creation of a European social area. What is really being driven at here? A Europe for the trade unions, destabilization of businesses? It is an open secret nowadays that activity in the black economy is a signi ficant factor in the current economic recoveries in Italy and the United Kingdom. The survival instinct is always stronger than established rules. Has not the OECD just achnowledged that the growth rate in Italy and the United Kingdom this year will be 3%, while France will still be lagging behind at 2%. It would be more appropriate in this connection to talk in terms of social progress for the benefit of workers. If this is to be achieved, there must be adequate growth and the excessive burden of social charges and taxation on employers in certain Member States must be lightened. The Temporary Committee's motion for a resolution is particularly severe on the common agricultural policy. It seeks to reduce, prevent and where necessary eliminate surplus production, and to safeguard family farming by introducing an income support policy. On the latter point, such a short-term policy cannot solve the crucial problem of family farming. What is in fact required is still more encouragement for a policy of quality and prospecting for markets abroad. At a time of population growth in the developing countries, withdrawing into ourselves would be fatal. Conse quently, there can be no question of interfering with the intervention and market support machinery. Total expenditure under the EAGGF Guarantee Section cannot be brought down to 50% of the budget total. The basic principles of the EEC Treaty must remain price unity, Community preference and financial soli darity. Regarding the Community's capacity for budg etary autonomy, it is necessary to clarify a number of parameters, and a fuller definition is required of the basis of the fourth resource, the one geared to GNP. Be that as it may, budgatary discipline must be accepted so that the increase in Community expendi ture is kept within reasonable limits. But the main complaint that the Group of the European Right have against the motion for a resolution is that, in the after math of Reykjavik, it lacks the courage to address the issue of Europe's identity, which is inseparable from common defence. What is the good of doing away with our internal frontiers if we do not organize our security within a common frontier? ULBURGHS (NI). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, the United Europe that the Single Act has as its ultimate aim is beginning to exert a growing power of attraction on other parts of the world. The manner in which this unity is coming about is particularly noteworthy. It has grown out of the chaos of the two world wars that devastated Europe. This lends an added dimension to European reconstruction compared with that of the United States, Japan, or the Soviet Union. We thus enjoy a unique opportunity to build a thriving econ omy on the twin pillars of peace and justice. Insofar as peace is concerned, what we need is adv anced technologies operated by scientists who will not be tempted by weapons technologies but will prefer to work for a peace-time economy. A peace-time econ omy should be one based on social justice. In that sense there are four pillars necessary to support a European Single Act. Firstly, the social component: what is needed is not more cuts, but rather a reinvigorating of the social security of which Europe can be justly proud, with special consideration for immigrants \u2014 the thirteenth nation in the EEC; there will also have to be more worker participation in the construction of a social economy. Secondly, the environment: the Single Act must not mean a levelling down of environmental standards; we want an economy in harmony with the environment. Thirdly, the energy question: Europe needs its own secure energy supplies as a guarantee of its independence. In my area alone no less than nine thousand mineworkcrs have been laid off, partly as a result of the dubious benefits of nuclear energy and apartheid coal from South Africa. Fourthly, a doubling of the structural funds is now a minimum requirement. These must be oriented to disadvantaged regions and to industrial areas now in the grip of crisis. In imple menting these structural funds the effort must be made to ensure participation by people themselves in their own \u2014 predominantly small-scale \u2014 economic activi ties in response to authentic local needs. COT (S). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, with the pomp and circumstance of the commemorative ceremonies fad ing in our ears, we are brought back down to earth by the prosaic matter of the budgetary proposals in the Delors package. These proposals are simultaneously ambitious and minimal: ambitious, to judge from cer tain Member States' initial reactions of alarm at the prospect of raising own resources from 1.4% to the equivalent 2.1% of the VAT basis of assessment, and yet minimal if what is said in the Single Act about cohesion is to be taken seriously. I am not going to ",
        "No 2-352/106 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Cot enter into the details of your budgetary proposals, Mr President of the Commission, but simply wish to express a combination of doubt and determination. Doubt as to the ability of our Community to furnish itself with the means with which to implement the Sin gle Act, since the credibility of this ambition has to be established as of now, and I am unable to dissociate the budgetary projections proposed in COM from the reality of the supplementary budget for 1987 or from that of the original budget for 1988, which should be the first under the Single Act. There is a heavy burden of liabilities, and a considerable effort to put the budget back on a sound footing will be needed if the commitment given is to be honoured. During the weeks and months ahead we shall have the opportun ity to judge for ourselves how firm you are in your attitude, how sincere the European convictions of our governments. On its side, Parliament will not be shirk ing its responsibilities, but it will not be fobbed off with words either. It has already had the opportunity to make this clear when voting on Mrs Barbarella's motion for a resolution. And I must tell you now that we take a sceptical view of any interim solution, any budgetary stop-gap which, on the pretext of applying the Fontainebleau agreement by raising the VAT ceil ing from 1.4% to 1.6%, would be tantamount to put ting off the difficulties for two years and irrevocably compromising the 1992 objective. The Single Act can not be applied without first clearing the decks. As for budgetary discipline, a subject on which we are lec tured regularly by the Council and occasionally by the Commission, let it be repeated that we are as commit ted to it as anyone but we expect a little more respon sibility from the other branch of the budgetary auth ority in regard to agricultural spending, which is the main factor causing the budget to get out of control. We are still waiting for the Council to show a willing ness to join with the European Parliament in a discus sion of budgetary discipline as a whole, which is what the Dublin conclusions called for, and we are still meeting with a refusal which borders on the discour teous and, if I may remind Mr President Pflimlin, pro voked Parliament's delegation into leaving the room at our last meeting. The determination to which I refer, Mr President, is the Socialists' determination to support you in your venture. But in giving you this support, we have to make clear that we regard the three sections of your triptych as indissociable from one another, emphati cally reaffirming that, without economic and social cohesion, there will be no large internal market and, without reliable, recognized budgetary boundaries, the Community will lack the means with which to secure economic and social cohesion. You have understood the nature of this determination. There is nothing con ditional about it: while you remain firm, you com mand our support; should your resolve weaken, you would lose it. (Applause) BORGO (PPE). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, Mr President of the Commission, I consider that the report drawn up by the competent committee, on which this House has to vote, is particularly impor tant for the success of the Single Act. I consider it to be important from two points of view: the first con cerns the opportunity, which the European Parliament has seized, to give a driving impetus to the Single Act \u2014 originally brought into being for the implementa tion of European Union \u2014 laying down commitments and deadlines in relation to the principle problems of the Community. The second concerns the promptness with which the European Parliament proposes to send a clear political message to the European Council meeting of 29 and 30 June. It is a balanced document that outlines force fully a strategic plan of action to achieve the aims of Community integration in the context of European Union. These main objectives include the reform and moder nisation of the CAP. In fact, even though the CAP, with all its mechanisms, is undoubtedly an instrument for the stabilization of agricultural prices and incomes, farmers today no longer see it as the beneficial instru ment it was in the past, because of its distorted pat terns of expenditure that have caused imbalance in the Community budget, without fully achieving the aims of the Treaty of Rome. In the case of certain products budget expenditure in support of prices and markets has risen enormously, with the result that the produc tion of some products has rocketed, without any equi librium having been reached, as between one region of the Community and another, in the incomes of those employed in the respective sectors. Guaranteed institu tional prices have induced the farmers to produce without any prospect of marketing and so sell into intervention produce that is also of ver}' poor quality. In this way a type of intensive farming has developed that, by favouring single-crop farms, has made it pos sible to utilize to the maximum the CAP's benefits, leaving the smaller farming concerns behind, particu larly those operating under difficult conditions and the less-favoured regions of the Community. The reform of the CAP, which this report is intended to assist, must set out to give better protection to the family-run farming concern, providing better protec tion for incomes, so as to ensure continuation not only of agricultural production but also the defence of the land and the protection of the environment. The cen tral point remains the question of adapting the Com munity's agricultural policy to the effective needs of European and world markets, disincentivating the production of produce that has no economic outlet on the market and promoting the production of alterna tive produce in which the Community is not self-suffi cient. As far as the re-definition of the aims of the CAP for the future is concerned, the farmers certainly cannot ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/107 Borgo be asked to make further sacrifices, such as the adding together of production quotas, the reduction of quo tas, programmes for withdrawing land from produc tion, the imposition of levies and the continuation of a restrictive prices policy. This contradicts any active farming incomes policy, which we are supposed to be pursuing. We are against any reduction in farm prices, especially at a time when farming, in order to fulfil its proper, multi-functional role, needs greater resources in order to reorganize and orient its production to meet the real needs of the market. We call with insistence not only for an increase in own resources for a Community that has set itself to achieve ambitious objectives by 1992, but also for these resources to be better distributed, no longer using them to support products that have no market prospects but, instead, to increase very considerably the appropriation for the Guidance section of the EAGGF, so as to improve the conditions of produc tion of agricultural concerns, especially family-run concerns, to enable these to achieve further economies of scale, to increase their efficiency and competitive ness and, finally, to offer secure income prospects to their employees, particularly the young, who aim to take over the running of modern and economically profitable undertakings. Reforming the CAP means moving above all along these lines. Perpetuating the status quo, on the other hand, means allowing the CAP framework to deterior ate further and encouraging a policy of renationalisa tion that is already latent and would unquestionably destroy 30 years of integration in a sector which, as we all acknowledge, has produced farming income stabil ity, improved standards of living in the country and employment. . . PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Borgo, your speaking time is up; I have to interrupt you. ARIAS CA\u00d1ETE (ED). \u2014 (ES) Mr President, there are two points which should be thought about before making any judgment on the communication from the Commission concerning its proposals for the success of the Single Act. The first is that the Act should be seen as an instrument enabling us to move cautiously towards our final political objective \u2014 a real European union which, while preserving the historical personal ity of the Member States, would develop all those common elements which bind them together. That said, the second aspect is that any evaluation of it must come to the conclusion that it does represent a step on the Road to the European Union. If this is to be reached, however, there is a clear need for urgent reform of basic Community policies and structures. The substance of the proposals made by the Commis sion and the stance towards them adopted in this report must be analyzed from this point of view. The basic conclusion from such an analysis is that with the exception of certain minor reservations, the pro posed reforms are absolutely essential, but they must be implemented under conditions of strict coherence. This is a balanced package, and as such balance must be ensured at all times. Any move towards liberaliza tion or integration must be accompanied by corres ponding measures promoting cohesion, with the effect that the distinct level of development of each Member State is taken into account. Otherwise, the existing differences between countries and regions would com promise not only the objectives of the Single Act, but also the future of the Community itself. To be more specific, it should be repeated that the completion of a market without borders can only be fully and effectively achieved if, on a Community level, instruments are provided with which to correct regional imbalances affecting the viability of the pro ject. We have reason to be pleased, since both the Commission and the report we are examining emphas ize the principles of solidarity and cohesion. An inst ance of this is the aim of duplicating the Structural Funds five years further on, which can only be seen as a minimal obligation which has been fulfilled. The reform of budgetary policy and of the Common Agricultural Policy are of particular interest to us. The exhaustion of conventional budgetary resources and the rather questionable effectiveness of their current use is already, in 1987, leading us towards an esti mated deficit of more than 5000 million ECU. For this reason, we feel that budgetary reform should already be underway by 1988, it being understood, in any case, that prior rationalization of the CAP allowing costs in the Guarantee section to be contained drasti cally, without any process of renationalization, is an integral part of any such reform, so that the new Com munity own resources are not frittered away by financing obsolete and ineffective policies, and that agricultural expenditure is distributed rationally. It is our view that future budgets must contribute to the efficient financing of the new policies and to pro vide, for once and for all, structural policies with the strength they require, effectively helping to reduce dis parities within the Community in accordance with the relative prosperity of the Member States. Finally, we believe that the measures proposed by the Commission \u2014 if, of course, linked with increased convergence of the Member States' economic and monetary policies \u2014 represent basic elements in the completion of a European economic recovery and the reconstruction of employment, enabling Europe to reassume its world role on the basis of a more prosper ous and just economic and social situation. Once these immediate material problems have been solved, the citizens of Europe, who all share common values of liberty and justice, will be equipped with factors deriv ing from our cohesion and stability which will give them the strength to take part in a project of political ",

It is for these reasons that apart from a few minor reservations, we shall support the report and the Commission proposal. DE MARCH (COM). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the theme of 'Making a success of the Single Act' prompts us to ask two questions: what kind of success, and for whose benefit? As is apparent from a study of the bal ance-sheets of many large industrial enterprises, those that are showing profits today are the ones which have speculated on the financial markets, whereas their productive activities are in decline. And you will find no-one today who is prepared to deny the seriousness of this financial cancer. For instance, a report by inde pendent experts, the Padoa-Schioppa report, prepared at the request of the Commission itself, demonstrates that completely opening up markets in an enlarged Community will have more dramatic and more disrup tive distributive effects than those seen during the 1960s. And this expert report recommends a macro- economic policy designed to favour the emergence of a high growth rate of 4%, failing which, according to the authors, the success of the programme will be sev erely compromised. Speaking for the French Communists, let me add that what we need is genuine productive growth which can bring a genuine restoration of balance to our national economies. This is what it will take to set up the Euro pean industrial cooperation that we need, as everyone in this Chamber is aware. Yes, we are still calling for the reconstitution, in each country, of a modern industrial fabric, working to meet the needs of our nations and towards the development of a real social area. And yet, despite these warnings, the Commission and the report we are debating today still make liberaliza tion of capital movements the priority, the key objec tive at the centre of European strategy. It is a daunting misconception to believe that regional strucutral com pensation measures are going to restore balance. With unemployment at such a high level and rising, with deregulation, privatization and erosion of workers' rights in our countries, such as France, where the social security system is on the verge of collapse, with the restrictions that have now been placed on the right to strike in Spain, we should be working out a differ ent strategy, other priorities. I support the three amendments on this theme that we have tabled: stimu lation of growth . . . PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mrs De March. I am very sorry, but I interrupted Mr Borgo and I must interrupt you too. PEREIRA, Manuel (LDR). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, colleagues, although the principles underlying the report under discussion are sometimes lacking in coh erence \u2014 possibly a result of the innumberable com promises which had to be struck \u2014 it does, however display, with regard to economic and social cohesion, a line of thinking which commands respect and merits serious thought. It is essential that good intentions are turned into practical steps measuring up to the prob lems currently facing the Community. Only a compre hensive strategy covering each of the elements required to bring it to fruition can create a new, more coherent and more mutually caring Europe. Sectorial policies can only be effective if they are geared towards a general programme ranging from the reform of the CAP, the revision of the Community's financial structure and budgetary discipline to the strengthening of the structural funds and improved use of them. If this is our aim, then we must support the Commission's programme, insofar as it responds, in our opinion, to the challenge which the integration of Portugal and Spain is going to represent for the Euro pean Economic Community, for the good of both the Community and those two countries. LALOR (RDE). \u2014 As an Irishman I feel fully com mitted to making a success of the Single Act. The Baron Crespo and von Wogau report is to be fully supported, despite what I might describe as a bit of ambiguity in paragraph 32. Paragraph 6(c) of Article 30 of the Single European Act makes it quite clear that NATO and the Western European Union are outside the framework of the Act and cannot be embraced within it. May I say that I particularly welcome the strong support in the resolu tion for the Commission's proposals to correct regional imbalances. I draw particular attention to its pointing out that the doubling of the structural funds is an absolute minimum necessity. Back home in Ire land recently, the benefits of the provisions outlined by the Commission were described as 'pie in the sky' by anti-membership spokesmen. I am glad to note that Parliament is now describing these figures as a positive minimum. As a result of a recent supreme court ruling, we in Ire land have a very serious decision to make on 26 May. I have asked, and will continue to exhort, the Irish peo ple to vote 'yes' on Tuesday, 26 May. That commit ment of mine to the acceptance and support of the Single European Act is shared by all of my colleagues within this group. Not only that but all 14 of my Irish colleagues have a similar dedication and viewpoint in relation to the Single European Act. Let me say that we'the Irish' welcome all the assistance that we can possibly get at this stage. On the other hand, we do not like being imposed upon. I do not have to tell you here that the Irish are a proud race. The Irish people must make up their own minds regarding the Single European Act.

With Irish history being what it is down through the years since, this House must appreciate how much we in Ireland dislike solu tions to our problems which might appear to be imposed from outside. I hope I need say no more on that subject to convey the message. All of that background history is a major contributing factor to our dedicated national desire for, and com mitment to, our policy of military neutrality. Colleagues, we Irish are Europeans in the fullest sense but we see ourselves as peacemakers. And in that, as a small nation, we are justly proud of our record in this regard. Finally, we are in no doubt that we can fulfil our r\u00f4le in the Community more fruitfully from your, our part ners', viewpoint by appending Title 3 to the declara tion. KUIJPERS (ARC). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, honoura ble Members of the Assembly, federalists are people who have learned to be very patient. I am in a position to say so, because when our party \u2014 the Volksunie \u2014 wrote federalism into its manifesto thirty years ago we were labelled by all the others as wreckers of the Bel gian state. The very same people who hurled every variety of lawful and unlawful abuse at us then, and tried to make life impossible for us, are the very ones I can now hear professing their commitment to federal ism. 'It can always swing the other way', the writer Bredero kept saying, and he was right. And a good thing too, because in the meantime we have taken a step towards implementing the federal idea, and a fun damental democratic idea it is. Not only at interna tional level, where the Single Act, even although it does not go far enough, still, as the Commission says, represents a new frontier for Europe. At nation-state level too the realization has dawned that democracy is better served with the recognition of genuine commu nities of peoples. It was for that reason that a Belgian government party decided at its party congress that in a unified Europe there would no longer be any room for the Belgian state but only for the two peoples that have been forced together to live out a historical lie as a buffer state between the then imperialist powers of nineteenth century Europe. The Europe of today can fortunately give far more scope to the European peo ples, thanks not least to the developments in some . . . PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Kuijpers, I have to interrupt you. Your speaking time is up. CICCIOMESSERE (NI). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, the chairman of the Socialist Group, Mr Arndt, has pro posed that a large majority should be formed in this Assembly, on the subjects that we are discussing. A large majority on what, we ask ourselves: a large majority on the document that has been put forward to us? A large majority that would then ditch the large majority that was achieved in this Parliament on the draft proposal for a Treaty on Union? We are afraid that there is a desire to set up a com promise, not for more advanced objectives but for the ditching of positions that have been expressed on more than one occasion by this Parliament; an example of this is given by the first paragraph of this document which states, in contrast to what this Assembly had instead stated on a number of occasions, that the implementation of the Single Act represents a step for ward towards the achievement of European Union. Well, if this is the compromise that it is wished to reach, if this is the great alliance that it is wished to achieve, this invitation \u2014 although not addressed to us, because I imagine that Mr Arndt was addressing the Group of the EPP \u2014 is one that we certainly can not accept. To give an example, I should like to recall that, on more than one occasion we have talked about the problem of cohesion, and I should like now to endea vour to explain, in the few moments remaining to me, why the institutional problem is the fundamental one. We have all of us, in this Assembly, had a great deal to say about the need for the process of Community inte gration to respect the problem deriving from the economic discrepancies that exist within the Com munity, and therefore it has been cohesion, cohesion, cohesion, the North-South relationship, and so on. Well, ladies and gentlemen, how do you think it is possible to achieve this cohesion in this institutional framework, except by strengthening the powers of the Stales, the representatives of the States within the institutional bodies of this Community, and hence against the process of European Union and the streng thening of the powers of Parliament and the other institutions. CRESPO (S), Draftsman for an opinion of the Com mittee on Social Affairs and Employment. \u2014 (PT) Mr President, the Single Act represents only one very cau tious step towards the construction of the European Union \u2014 but it has its price. The bill presented by the Commission has, from Parliament's point of view, been underestimated. Will the Council be ready to honour the undertakings it has voluntarily entered into? This question can and must be asked in view of the latest developments concerning the debate on the supplementary budget essential to the survival of the Community \u2014 and this is before the Single Act has even come into force. Parliament, which did not pre pare the Single Act and which wished it to go further, is ready to shoulder its responsibilities and demand that the other Community institutions should do like- ",
        "No 2-352/110 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Crespo wise. The Commission's proposal considers the various aspects of the Single Act to constitute a whole. So do we, which is why we are obliged to register our sur prise at the absence of any reference to European social area in the 'Making a success of the Single Act' proposal presented by President Delors. A market without frontiers? Yes, of course, but we want citizens with equal rights and duties, too. It is true that borders hinder the free circulation of goods. But what about people? Must they continue to be separated by barriers of inequality? What we want to see is equality of con ditions, so that free circulation of citizens becomes possible, which is the only real justification for the free circulation of goods. Man comes before machines. But it is clear that neither one nor the other can flourish without econo mic and social cohesion, without balanced develop ment. In order to achieve this, it is essential that the structural funds be strengthened. The duplication of the budget allocated to them is the very minimum which should be done. However, as we believe that economic and social cohesion also work through other policies, we are reserving our position until the Com mission completes the proposals it is presenting to us today. Indeed, according to Commissioner Varfis, the Commission's proposal relating to the structural funds represents an increase of 10% in investment in priority regions. If it is remembered that the least favoured country of the Community, Portugal, would need to grow by 16% per annum in order to reach half the Community average by 1992, there is no need to quote further figures. The internal market can only produce the effect we desire if it operates in a balanced manner. Otherwise, we shall not be moving towards a rein forcement of political unity in the Community, but shall rather be creating internal tensions working in the opposite direction \u2014 unless what we want is to turn the Community into nothing more than a free trade zone. At that point, we might as well create a two- or even three-speed Community, which is not what we want. So, the bill must be paid \u2014 we will see the rewards laters. This is Parliament's message. I would like to congratulate our rapporteurs, Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo and Mr von Wogau. We could further improve the proposal being made to us, particularly by approv ing Amendment No 93 by our colleague Mr De Pas quale. However, the essential points have been made: Parliament's call is quite clear \u2014 let us give it our unqualified support today. (Applause from the left) McCARTIN (PPE). \u2014 Mr President, I know a sub stantial number of people in this Parliament would agree with me that, from a strictly legal point of view, the Single Act in itself will not be a major force in pro pelling this Community towards political and econo mic integration. The Single Act was a compromise which reflected the hesitations of a minority of States rather than the progressive will of the rest. What was most significant about the signing of this Act was that it was signed by all 12 Member States, thereby giving unanimous acknowledgement to the fact that the progress to date no longer satisfies the hopes and aspirations of a majority of the people of Europe. This Single Act is more a statement of politi cal will than a major change in the legal basis for our cooperation. That is why I regard this report as of major importance. In it we are setting out to define how that political process will be converted into posi tive action. With regard to the specific proposals in the report, I have time only for one comment. Political and econo mic union cannot be brought about by the adoption of common economic and political policies. It cannot because, if the gap between the richer and poorer regions of this Community continues to widen, the resulting tension will frustrate the best efforts at creat ing a complete union. That is why I am not excited at the thought of doubling the structural funds. Doubling the Social and Regional Funds is the very minimum that we could consider and the money provided for agricultural structures and rural development must be increased five-fold if the peripheral regions are to have any prospect of closing the economic gap. I have another concern, namely, the referendum which will take place in Ireland on 26 May. This referendum has forced us who believe in Europe to identify for our electorate the more positive aspects of membership. Those positive aspects, I am afraid, have been neg lected by too many of us in this Parliament and else where in our efforts to promote more rapid progress. Since Ireland joined this Community we have extended the common agricultural policy to accom modate the needs of additional sectors and to include our fishermen. At the same time we have given the European consumers an increased supply of better food at lower real costs. Through the Lom\u00e9 Conven tion and other agreements we have increased the vol ume and scope of our development aid. We have in real terms increased our budget and developed our social, regional and environmental policies. We have established the EMS and developed it. More than all that we have given our people a 16% rise in real stan dards of living at a time when there was no increase whatsoever in living standards in the United States of America. We have done, this without, like Japan, closing our markets to imports from other countries. Hence our gains will be easier to maintain. We have strengthened and enriched this Community by taking in Greece, Spain and Portugal and made an important point by allowing and facilitating the departure of Greenland from the Community. If we were not a successful Community would Spain and Portugal have wished to join? Would Norway and Turkey be showing a new interest in membership? The Comecon countries and Soviet Russia would not at last have recognized our existence and sought for dialogue and trade with us. ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/111 McCartin Too much self-criticism can create uncertainty for the citizens of Europe and in the case of Ireland, I am afraid, some uncertainty has been created. Still, I am confident that a majority will say 'Yes', not only because we know we have enjoyed immense benefits, but because we believe we ought to participate in the further progress of the Community and make our con tribution in the years ahead. One thing that is striking about the anti-EEC cam paign is the way in which they have tapped resources in the Community as a whole. They have brought in Greens from Germany and ex-army officers and ex-clerics from Britain, and political radicals from Denmark and they have joined in Ireland with Marx ists and 'knockers' of all sorts and with one or two religious fundamentalists \u2014 little Ayatollahs! Between them all they would not get 5% of the popular vote in Ireland and we are absolutely confident that we will win this referendum on 26 May. (Applause from the centre) MIRANDA DA SILVA (COM). \u2014 (PT) Mr Presi dent, we have already made our views quite clear in our position of opposition to the Single Act, so we do not intend to repeat our argument. The main point which should be clarified now is whether what is intended consists quite simply of creating a great, per missive internal market for the free circulation of capi tal and goods, as a result of which the economies of the poorer countries will be pushed aside by the stron ger countries, or whether a genuine intention exists to take advance precautions against these negative effects and to provide at least some minimal response to the profound regional inequalities and grave social prob lems which we are all aware of. To our way of think ing, the Commission's proposals, or rather the lack of certain indispensable proposals, show that the main aim is to create an internal market and institute the free movement of capital. Evidence for this conclusion is to be found in the absence of a fixed timetable of proposals to bring about real economic cohesion, by the absence of social-type measures, by the inadequate means to be allocated to the structural funds, by the ambiguity concerning own resources and by the lack of enthusiasm displayed towards thorough-going reform of the CAP, which is unavoidable. In other words, the balance is tipped heavily in favour of the internal market and against the means with which to counter regional imbalances and social problems, with the certain result that the construction of such an internal market will sharpen these unsolved problems, with particularly harmful effects in the less developed countries such as Portugal. The report under consider ation today fails to correct the basic flaws in the Com mission communication. Ambiguity continues and the report too fails principally in the area of economic and social cohesion, since it does not refer to the urgent and pressing need to implement effective, controlled measures to bring it about. The proposals we are pre senting aim to fill some of these gaps. We shall make our final decision on exactly how far Parliament should align itself with or distance itself from the Commission on the basis of the acceptance or rejec tion of these proposals, and the result of votes on simi lar proposals from others. BENCOMO MENDOZA (LDR). \u2014 (ES) Mr Presi dent, the first point which should be remembered is that although the Single Act is aimed towards the European Union, it does not contain all the elements required to achieve it. Does it really present us with institutional instruments enabling us to make a qualita tive leap forward, or shall we continue to depend on the rather fickle political will of the Member States? The basic and primary aim of the Single Act is to create a true common market, an economic zone within which goods, services, persons and capital can circulate freely. But if it is not equipped with compre hensive \u2014 and I repeat comprehensive \u2014 instruments for regional and social policy, and if the Structural Funds continue to be of little real significance, then this integrated market could actually come to consti tute a negative factor for peripheral regions, since it would bring about increased concentration of wealth at the centre, in regions of high industrial and com mercial concentration, to the detriment of the outlying regions. This dilemma presents itself even more starkly in the two new Member States, Spain and Portugal, as their integration will not be fully achieved until 1992, con- inciding with the completion of the internal market. Then again, the delay arising from the Irish referen dum, and the attitude displayed by the United King dom and Denmark regarding majority voting raise doubts as to how effectively it will enter into force. So, the Commission has presented us with its political pro gramme for the success of the Single Act. We certainly approve of it, but it does not fill us with wild enthu siasm. Let us not forget that the Single Act does con tain potential, but nothing more concrete than poten tial, because implementation is going to require politi cal will \u2014 and Parliament must provide that. MARQUES MENDES (RDE). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, I would like to provide a general outline of what Par liament's reply to the 'Making a success of the Single Act \u2014 a new frontier for Europe' proposal should be. Our reply should be a clear statement of support for a real European Union. That is the message we should be sending to June's meeting of the European Council. The content of the message should be made crystal clear. One: Without money, in other words, without increased own resources, this Europe cannot be con structed, the Single Act cannot be properly imple mented. ",
        "No 2-352/112 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5. 87 Marques Mendes Two: Economic and social cohesion must grow in step with the creation of the great internal market, which will require more than a simple doubling of the struc tural funds. It will also mean that any increase in resources must be genuine, and must be applied effi ciently, not thrown away on the weight of the past. Three: Greater economic and social cohesion needs more than just the structural funds. It needs a cooper ative growth strategy based on the development of trade within the Community and greater flexibility in the rules of competition in favour of the less developed Member States. Four: More money for the EEC must be accompanied by greater responsibility and tighter budgetary discip line. This means controlling the expense generated by uncontrolled agricultural surpluses. The Commission's proposals for the reform of the CAP are therefore an essential element in this sense. Last but not least, Mr President, we need a Europe which is actively engaged in the battle against unem ployment, a disease which threatens to become endemic in our continent. We must combat unemploy ment by increasing the resources available to the struc tural funds and concentrating them on the worst affected regions and social groups \u2014 meaning young people and the long-term unemployed. CHRISTENSEN (ARC). \u2014 (DA) Mr President, a fair comment on the Temporary Committee and its report would be 'much ado about nothing'. It repeats and sums up Parliament's ambitions on European union, not least for its own purposes. It wants a central bank system, it wants a strengthened ECU, the introd uction of a large number of common policies, includ ing the harmonization of fiscal policy, ie not just indi rect taxes. It is disquieting to hear emphasized that Parliament wants a common labour market and social policy covering trade union affairs, vocational train ing, the working environment etc, plus what is called a socially integrated Europe. It wants the levelling out of differences between the north and south of the Com munity and the so-called reform and modernization of the agricultural policy, including production controls and quotas, withdrawal programmes and progressive production levies. And that is called a liberal common market! The only realistic thing in this programme is the recognition that the Community is on the edge of bankruptcy, and the answer to this is to increase revenue and give Parliament control over it. Mr Presi dent, I want you to know that of course we vote against this manifesto. VAN DER WAAL (NI). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, it seems to us that the Bar\u00f3n Crespo and von Wogau report is not really much of an advance on the Com mission documents. The report sets out a great many ambitious objectives, but these seem to be geared more to the achievement of European Union than to giving any practical effect to the Single Act. Consequently, there is too little concrete analysis of the situation in which the EEC is now placed, and there is too little contact with present-day financial and political reality. This general impression is justified by the treatment given to certain specific points. Firstly, where the report calls for a European Central Bank, insufficient acknowledgement is made of the fact that existing practice already offers a number of options for strengthening the EMS. In the recently published annual report of the Nederlandse Bank a number of appropriate mechanisms for achieving this are described. The desired strengthening of the EMS can be achieved with Member States maintaining their autonomy on monetary matters and without having to envisage the as yet unworkable option of a European Bank. The report also has a distinct tone of 'the more cen tralization the better' to it. More centralization at European level would definitely have distinct disad vantages, however. More rules and regulations would be likely to lead to evasion and avoidance, while the responsibility for enforcing the law will have to be shouldered by the Member States. The recently debated Guermeur report on fraud in the EEC high lighted only too clearly the problems faced in trying to enforce the rules in agriculture. It is all the more regrettable therefore that no mention is made in the report of the desirability of achieving more deregula tion at European level and decentralized implementa tion of rules and regulations. AVGERINOS (S). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the 1980's have found the Community at a crucial point of its his tory. After 30 years, certain basic questions have of necessity arisen, relating both to the shape of the Community itself and the part it has to play on the world scene. The dialogue which has developed between the institutions regarding its structure and workings have brought the multiple problems faced by the Community in its approach to the year 2 000 out into the open. Might we see the construction of a Europe of States? Will the divisions between north and south, rich and poor, perhaps be done away with by the Community? Could the Community have a decisive contribution to make in bringing peace to world conflicts? These questions show the Community to be at a politi cal crossroads. It has to choose between the old and well-worn path of a two-speed Europe, or unity, equality and mutual economic and technological development. Under pressure from this historical dilemma, the Twelve opted for the reform of the insti tutional framework for the Community's structure and workings as defined in the Single Act. We have never believed that the Community's major problem is one ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/113 Avgerinos of institutions, but rather that what is lacking in the European Community is the dynamism provided by major, bold political options. I stress this point because while we would all agree that the internal market can only really be achieved if social and economic cohe sion are simultaneously reinforced, in practice this is not happening. It should be noted that while quite a number of issues relating to the internal market are already under way, absolutely nothing has been done concerning econo mic and social cohesion. The Community, through the Commission's proposals, may now have the opportun ity of overcoming the crisis of recent years, but it is emerging, from various behind-the-scenes machina tions, that this opportunity will be missed. It will be missed because certain parties insist on relating the implementation of the Single Act exclusively to the achievement of the internal market, relegating the other aspects of the Single Act to some dim and distant future. It is not a matter of showing us this policy which will get rid of frontiers in 1992, following which all will be well. Those who dream of a Europe without frontiers from 1 January 1993 and who see this simply in terms of implementing the internal market would do well to wake up and come down to earth. This aim will be attained only if, at the same time, suitable measures to achieve economic and social cohesion are applied. In any other circumstances, the Community would run the risk of getting embroiled in ever fiercer disputes, with the result that none of the objectives defined in the Single Act would be achieved. Furthermore, the varying levels of economic and social development should not be forgotten. The Commis sion's communication gives voice to these concerns. Therefore, we shall vote for it. PARTRAT (PPE). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, our Tem porary Committee's motion for a resolution sets out all the essentials. It reflects the resolve clearly expressed by the European Parliament to take the course proposed by the Commission in order to make a success of the Single Act. Doubtless some of us will think, sometimes with good reason, that it fails in places to define the priorities adequately, that the Community craft has perhaps been overloaded some what to avoid the risk of unduly slowing down the pace of the Community convoy. But would any such reservations, important though they may be, justify us in going so far as to reject the motion for a resolution? Consider, ladies and gentlemen, the disastrous impact that such a vote would have on public opinion in Europe. For my own part, I shall confine myself to expressing just three reservations. The first concerns the affirmation that a recovery in growth, which is essential to attainment of our objectives, is likely to come mainly from the large internal market. My own view is that, in the current and foreseeable world economic situation, the productivity gains that the large market is expected to bring will be translated into stronger growth, rather than higher unemploy ment, only if more active economic policies are pur sued in order to put the extra potential to use. Through the cooperative strategy for growth, which the Commission has been proposing for years now, we are brought back here to the perennial problem of convergence of economic policies, which the Commis sion itself acknowledges in its report has become bogged down in routine and sterile procedures. I find this diagnosis all the more disturbing in that it is not accompanied by any suggestion of a solution, either in the Commission's report or in the motion for a resolution that we are debating today. My second comment is to do with the section on the common agricultural policy. For goodness' sake, ladies and gentlemen, we must be objective about this. Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the say ing goes. Let's not pillory a Community policy whose only crime is that it has become the victim of its own success and external circumstances created by condi tions on world markets and movements in the dollar. That rigorous adaptation is necessary, on pricing policy in particular, goes without saying, but it must be in keeping with the essential principles of this Com munity policy \u2014 price and market unity, financial soli darity, Community preference. As for the use of direct aid as a means of supporting farmers' incomes, this should be confined to serving essentially social objec tives and, it seems to me, should be organized on no more than a marginal scale. Finally in this area, I note that paragraphs 22 and 23 of the motion for a resolution refer to the Commis sion's proposal for bringing guarantee expenditure down to half the amount of the total budget. This is perhaps a desirable objective, particularly from the viewpoint of implementing new policies, but let us not turn it into a hard and fast budgetary constraint. That would impose unacceptable inflexibility on the future conduct of one \u00f3f the main Community policies. My third comment \u2014 a brief one \u2014 refers to econo mic and social cohesion: the motion for a resolution expresses the view that doubling the structural funds is an absolute minimum and goes on immediately to call for a demonstration from the Commission that this will be sufficient; the two parts of this proposition are to say the least mutually contradictory. These, then are my three reservations. Let me repeat, Mr President, that they are not such as to prevent us backing this motion for a resolution, and we trust that particular political preferences will be set to one side and a large majority of the House will vote in favour, since the future of our Community is at issue here. (Applause) ",
        "No 2-352/114 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 DID\u00d2 (S). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I do not intend, in my brief speech, to go into the problems raised by the strategy put forward by the Commission and, as usual, clearly explained by its President, Jacques Delors. It is a strategy that, with appropriate additions \u2014 which have been amply illustrated both by the Baron Crespo and von Wogau report, and by the speeches that have preceded me, and which concern in essence the crea tion of a real social area, the implementation of a more effective policy for ensuring economic cohesion between the regions of the EEC, a better system of autonomous financing for the Community, and the achievement of a considerably better balance between the CAP and the other Community policies \u2014 repre sents the only possible road to take. I want, instead, to emphasise the serious danger that, yet again, the Twelve governments in chorus will sub stantially reject this strategy. The signs are extremely worrying. They range from the inability to approve the framework-programme for research, to the recent meetings of the Council that have shown both the hos tility of the governments of certain of the larger Mem ber States to the Commission's proposal and \u2014 as occurred a few days ago, at the financial Council, a refusal to set up a budget based on the expenditure necessary to finance the common policies \u2014 not to mention, of course, the failure of every attempt to coordinate national economic policies as part of an agreed plan for reviving growth. Such being the case, we Socialists believe that, in the first place, the maximum effort must be made by this Parliament to adopt a stance that will be a manifesta tion of the widest possible majority, so that both the governments and public opinion can fully understand our determination to go forward. We think, further more, that we have to show that there is a solid alli ance between Parliament and the Commission, and for that to happen the Commission must set its sights high, putting forward the best proposals it can devise, and defending them with every sinew. There is no point in undertaking \u2014 as has happened \u2014 to with draw certain proposals if the Council should reject or mangle them, and then accepting compromises at the lowest level that were previously declared unaccepta ble. This is why it is of decisive importance that there should be an alliance between the Commission and Parliament, on positions that are certainly realistic but that must effectively corespond to the problems that we have to solve. (Applause) million of those in the United Kingdom itself, was car ried extensively in the press. If one takes this in con junction with the 18 million jobless in the Community, with the fact that the Community is on the verge of bankruptcy, with the failure even now to reach agree ment on the modest reforms which the Commission is trying to get on the agricultural policy, it is little won der that the opening paragraph of this report actually calls for the European Council to take effective action on these matters. My quarrel with the report is not the call for action. It is that the kind of action called for in this report is the wrong kind of action and is likely to do more harm than good. It is quite interesting to see that there is a clear recognition in this report of the need for a social dimension to the internal market. I supported the amendments in this regard, but it seems to me that what Parliament is doing is putting the cart before the horse. We are beginning to recognize the very big dangers that can be caused by the development of the internal market. We must think very carefully about this rush towards an internal market before 1992, because there is no doubt that the kind of spending and the kind of action needed to offset that will not automatically be available. Something in excess of the present agricultural budget would be needed to remedy the social consequences of the development of the internal market. It should also be pointed out that the development of the internal market means the development of fiscal harmonization \u2014 and we are talking about direct as well as indirect taxation here. We are totally opposed in the United Kingdom, from the Labour point of view, to the imposition of harmonization on VAT. We know that Lord Cockfield is buried away in the depths of the Commission preparing plans to impose this. He has not done so because of the general election. But we know that he is going to produce these plans, and a British Tory Government would use them as a cloak for putting further massive increases on the ordinary people of this country. Therefore, I say that we must reject this report. As far as finance is concerned, what the Community has got to do is to show that it can spend its existing budget and that it can deal with its problems under the existing financial arrangements. When it has done that, we can look at separate and new systems of finance. IN THE CHAIR: LORD PLUMB President MEGAHY (S). \u2014 Mr President, it is highly significant that this week, when we are debating the problems facing the Community, a report about a study made in Australia, 'which shows that the common agricultural policy has cost a million jobs in the Community, half a WOLTJER (S). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I have been asked to say a few words in conclusion of this debate about the agricultural section of the motion for a reso lution. May I first congratulate the rapporteurs for ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/115 Woltjer having tabled this motion, and say that theirs has been a major contribution, not least with their important section on agriculture. We all know that recent developments in agriculture have got out of hand. We all know that the problems are serious. We know that it is not even farmers any more who are the beneficiaries of agricultural policy, but that the money is mainly being wasted on surplus production. I am glad to see it being clearly stated in this report that we want to put an end to this situation, and that this situation really must come to an end. If the EEC is to survive as a community, agricultural policy will have to be changed. As we have indicated in the report \u2014 and this is the point I now want to bring out \u2014 there cannot be one single solution to this prob lem. Too often in the past we have sat down to discuss this together and have ended up coming to the conclu sion that there has to be one, particular solution. One party would opt for one solution, the other for a dif ferent one. And there we were, set one against the other. But what yesterday's debate has taught us is that we must all pull together to seek multiple solutions, for there are different possibilities in each sector, and the more different ideas we look at the better until we find the solutions that the European Community needs. What it will be essential to bear in mind, as has been stated here repeatedly, is that the solutions will have to be found, not by supporting particular products, but by assisting regions, assisting smallholdings, promot ing regional development schemes, and so on. That aspect is covered in the report, and I welcome that. We must put a stop to the enormous amounts now being spent on the Guarantee side, and instead con centrate more resources on the side of Guidance. There is one other point where I find cause for con cern, one that does not, unfortunately, feature in the report. Only last week the Commission Member res ponsible for Agriculture stated at a speaking engage ment somewhere that the budgeting method, that is the manner in which agricultural expenditure is allo cated in the budget, was really a medieval method, and that the compulsory character of agricultural expendi ture actually made it possible for Agriculture Ministers to pursue an agricultural policy without having to take any financial responsibility for it: There's nothing to worry about, it will all be paid for come what may. If the Delors package is adopted I think that situation, the compulsory nature of agricultural expenditure, will have to be changed. The agriculture budget will have to be made more transparent, and the Agriculture Ministers will have to be bound by financial con straints, otherwise the assurances held out in the Delors package will have nothing to offer us. DELORS, President of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I should like to thank you, on the Com mission's behalf, for your initiative in having set up this special committee and given an initial opinion so quickly on the Commission's document, Making a success of the Single Act'. I should also like to thank the rapporteurs and all the speakers for their suggestions, and for their criticisms as well. Mrs Barbarella has pointed to a lack of aggression in the Commission's proposals, particularly those on the social and monetary issues. I should like to remind you why this is. Our scheme was to produce a document based on a simple principle \u2014 the Single Act, nothing but the Single Act, but the whole Single Act \u2014 so that the governments would not be able to get off the hook by complaining that the Commission had made propo sals on every conceivable thing. We are simply saying to the governments: 'You have agreed to the succes sive enlargements to ten and now twelve Member States, you have signed the Single Act, and we are ask ing you to draw the necessary inferences in terms of objectives and in terms of funding. The Commission has laid before you a proposal that you have all ack nowledged to be coherent. You can very well find another proposal, another response, but, please, act on your decisions'. This is why we did not want to give them the opportunity of retorting: 'You want to take a further step forward with the European Monetary System, and on top of that you have made fresh pro posals on the social area'. Yes, we realize our proposal does not cover the full range of your hopes, or our hopes, but this was a very important aspect from the viewpoint of technique. This is why I have spoken of this as Europe's important appointment with itself, because it simply comes down to a matter of whether or not the governments want to take the action to fol low up their solemn decisions embodied in amendment of the Treaty of Rome. That said, we do not underestimate the difficulties. The Single Act represented what was possible in Europe, not everything that was desirable, and even at this level there are many difficulties. To try to con vince you of this while at the same time offering some contributions to a solution, I propose to discuss five points. First of all, I should like to clear up the misunder standings over a prospect rightly spoken of with apprehension by Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo: that of the debate leading to tension between the countries of the North and those of the South, or more exactly between the countries of the North and those of the South together with Ireland. It is worth repeating that the structural policies proposed in the Commission's document are aimed at five objectives. Only one of these objectives \u2014 pursued under the support programmes for back ward regions \u2014 is concerned exclusively with the countries of the South and the poor countries. The other four apply to all territories of the Community. It would therefore be a travesty to treat the structural policies as policies of the South and, say, the common agricultural policy as a policy of the North; that would be a gross oversimplification which would create intol- ",
        "No 2-352/116 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Delors \u00e9rable tensions and would be no basis for ultimately working out the compromises that need to be found. Secondly \u2014 I refer here to many speeches, particularly the one by Mr von Wogau, one of the co-rapporteurs, among a lot of others \u2014 the large market and the prerequisites or preconditions for establishing it. Lad ies and gentlemen, I have not fallen in love with the large market without frontiers. I merely wanted to tell you that if all manner of prerequisites are set for estab lishing this large market, it will never become a reality, nor will economic and social cohesion, nor any pro gress in Europe. If I may be permitted an easy but nevertheless authentic joke, a French presidential can didate a few years ago addressed the electorate in these terms: 'If I become President of the Republic, I promise you there will no longer be a single region below the average'. As for me, I cannot promise you that; nor can the President of the Council. (Applause) So I would ask you not to curb the momentum, the dynamism, that could carry us forward to the large market, but instead to share the conviction that with out economic and social cohesion, without a streng thening of the European Monetary System, without a common research policy, without acceptance of the social dimension, without common measures to pro tect the environment, the enlarged market is not going to become a reality. It will not be completely estab lished, it will not bear all its fruit. These, in my view, are the terms in which the large market should be understood. There nevertheless remains one point on which I have to be more specific, since Mrs De March and others have referred to it. This is liberalization of capital movements. The Commission will not bring forward proposals for the final stage of this process unless it is accompanied by strengthening of the European Monetary System and cooperation on monetary policy... (Applause from the centre) and this is for the simple reason that Europe would not be able to organize liberalization of capital 'erga omnes' and, in the mad world in which we live, trying to do so would bring more disadvantages than advan tages. My third point concerns the social dimension. I have explained to you why we kept down the number of our proposals, but I nevertheless owe it to you to give some specific answers. The Commission is working along three lines, and will continue to do so. First, assisting the social dialogue in the Community between European employers and trade unions. This was an initiative launched by me in January 1985. It is continuing. The employers and unions have come together on three joint opinions, one in favour of sup porting the Commission's cooperative strategy for growth and the other two on reaching agreement on the conditions under which new technologies are introduced into firms, from the viewpoint of informa tion and training for employees. They are now going to tackle the problems of organization of the labour market, work organization and scheduling of working time. The President-in-Office, Mr Martens, attended the last meeting and will be telling the European Council of the importance of this social dialogue, which is also emphasized in the Single Act inciden tally. Secondly, applying Article 118A of the Single Act, where the Commission's role consists in bringing forward proposals for measures on the working envi ronment, by which I mean hygiene, health and safety conditions for workers, in the spirit of the Single Act, which calls for a process of levelling up. Thirdly and lastly, pursuing three social objectives: facilitating access to the labour market for young people, combat ing long-term unemployment, and promoting rural development. Over and above the social consequences of the direc tives on the internal market, therefore, I think it true to say that the Commission has no intention of neg lecting the social dimension of the Single Act. The fourth point, on which some clarification is war ranted, is the common agricultural policy. Ladies and gentlemen, there are some of you to whom I would say: 'Please, do not distort the Commission's proposals', and others whom I would ask: 'Please, keep things in proportion'. First, do not distort the Commission's proposals. They are based on two find ings that cannot be challenged by anyone, the first of which is that, worldwide, production has outstripped consumption, and the second that pricing policy as it has been operated for the past fifteen years is no lon ger enough on its own to keep all farmers' incomes at an adequate level, unless we are prepared to see the surpluses in store doubling or trebling in volume and agricultural expenditure absorbing all the money in the budget! (Applause) Bearing these facts in mind, let those who are commit ted to the common agricultural policy, among whom I count myself incidentally, refrain from distorting the Commission's proposals. At no stage have we said that we were going to apply a very stringent pricing policy and make welfare beneficiaries of the remaining farm ers. Why are we modulating the pricing policy in favour of small farmers? Why do we have the mea sures to help upland farmers? Or these new proposals for direct support to farmers? What is the purpose of the further measures that we are about to take to ensure a place for everyone in the common organ- ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/117 Delors ization of markets if it is not to ensure the continuity of the farmer's economic role? Apart from that, how can one ignore the importance of his role in conserva tion of the environment, maintenance of social bal ance, and rural development? Such is the balanced position taken by the Commission. To the opponents of the common agricultural policy, for there are those who want to destroy the common agricultural policy, I would say: 'Ladies and gentlemen, please keep a sense of proportion. Do you realize that the cost of guaran teed farm spending this year is going to be 26 000 mil lion ECU? Had it not been for the courageous mea sures taken since 1984, the amount of this expenditure would have been 31 000 million ECU'. The efforts made by the farmers have therefore already saved the Community budget 5 000 million ECU. I hope that figure is not going to be forgotten. Secondly, of this amount of 26 000 million ECU, 4 000 million is accounted for, all things being equal, by the dollar's fall against the European currencies. That is why we are proposing a new system which will enable us to adjust farm spending according to fluctuations in the dollar. I think it was necessary to clarify these two matters. The fifth and final point, the one which is giving you most concern, and I understand why, is budgetary dis cipline. I said when presenting the Commission's package to you that the strength, in both moral and political terms, of the Commission's proposals, of its call for increased resources, was linked to application of more effective budgetary discipline than we have had hith erto. Hence our proposal, to the Council and Parlia ment, for consideration to be given to this matter. We are not as yet proposing any amendment of the Treaty, but we do invite you to consider whether it would not be in the interests of both branches of the budget authority, the Council and Parliament, if at the outset of the budgetary procedure they were to agree on the main aggregates, within which Parliament would then be able to perform its role, using its mar gin for manoeuvre. That is the question put to you, and the Commission does not intend to supply an answer on your behalf \u2014 not under any circum stances. As for the comments made by Mrs Scrivener or Mrs Barbarella, or the concern expressed by Mr Cot, I would say this to these Honourable Mem bers: 'It is for you to think things out. These are the arrangements that the Commission is proposing for your consideration'. First of all, we are telling Europe's citizens that, from now to 1992/93, they will not be contributing more than 1.4% of gross national product to the Com munity. This is a sort of commitment given to the citi zens of Europe. It is also the ceiling above which it will be impossible to go. Secondly, the Commission will be offering pointers with its pluriannual forecasts, which will have no binding force. But we are propos ing to hold consultations and discussions with you on these pluriannual forecasts. After that, the budgetary procedure would start. The second innovation proposed to you is for the main aggregates in the budget to be fixed jointly by Parliament with the Council. Having reached agree ment on these main aggregates during the second phase, the one in which the budget is defined in detail, you would still be able to make your proposals on non-compulsory expenditure, within the framework provided by the main aggregates. It is our conviction in the Commission that if Parliament does not make this political gesture, our proposals on increasing own resources would carry that much less weight. But it is for this sovereign Parliament to conduct political deli berations in order to decide the best strategy, and the Commission has no intention of usurping this role. Our duty was to propose this to you. These were the five points on which I wanted to clar ify the position. This leaves another, which brings me to comments made by Mr Price, Mr d'Ormesson, Mrs De March and others which reflect an eternal truth, but one which has been underlined by prevailing conditions: Europe must rely on no-one but itself. This goes with out saying for real Europeans, but let us take a look at the situation for the benefit of those who are only half convinced. The United States economy is entering a very difficult period, not only because of its budget deficit and its trade deficit but because its productive apparatus has become out of tune with demand. The world's leading economic power cannot be depended upon to fuel international economic growth. Japan remains turned in on itself and has no intention of assuming the level of responsibility that would be fitting for a country of its prosperity. The poorest countries, the African countries, cannot even sell their products, mainly foodstuffs \u2014 because of the subsidization war in which we are engaged with the United States, inciden tally. The debtor countries cannot even make enough of a surplus to service their debts. And the East Euro pean countries are as yet still operating in a closed cir cuit. Currently, therefore, the only continent that can bring growth to the world economy is Europe. It is in a posi tion to do so. It has a population of 320 million consu mers. The potential is there. It has the highest average standard of living in the world. It has room for man oeuvre, now that it has seen off inflation. But are we or are we not going to do something about it? I repeat, the Finance Ministers agreed only half heartedly to the cooperative strategy for growth. At the forthcoming summit meeting in Venice, the Euro pean countries will be coming in for criticism from the United States, which will ask us what we are doing to expand world trade. Nor is Europe doing anything to ",
        "No 2-352/118 Debates of the European Parliament 13. 5. 87 Delors tackle the problems of the casino-style world economy in which money is made out of money but not out of creating new wealth and jobs! (Applause from the centre and the left) Ladies and gentlemen, unless Europe takes hold of its destiny with both hands and launches an initiative to this end, the historians will be saying ten years hence that we missed our opportunity and broke faith with our own traditions. What are our traditions? A sense of balance between economic and social considerations, and of solidarity towards the rest of the world. Any general policy statements that our governments might make are going to sound very hollow if the African countries, the debtor countries and the other developing coun tries come to the realization in the near future that Europe is doing nothing to stimulate the expansion of world trade. Our unemployed will have cause for complaint as well, bearing in mind the 1986 figures, which speak for themselves: the growth rate in the industrialized countries was 2.5%; internal demand rose by 3.5%, and demand from outside by nothing at all. This year will show more of the same. Are we at last going to get the message and realize that right now the main potential for growth is to be found on our doorstep and that it can be achieved without infla tion, without imbalance? That is what we need the internal market for: to stimulate our dynamism. Con certed economic policy measures to this end could be taken immediately, over the months ahead. As is made plain in the report by the working group that we set up, the Padoa Schioppa group, there will be no chance of deriving full benefit from the large internal market if economic growth in the Community remains at 2%. There will be no chance of making this project credi ble in the eyes of the man in the street. It is for these reasons that it is more necessary than ever for Europe to assume control of its own destiny. It cannot count on anyone else. The same holds true, incidentally, in other areas, and we shall come back to that on another occasion. without looking to the medium term. Why not? For the reasons that Mr Christophersen explained to them very clearly on Monday: the 1987 budget, as it stands, does not incorporate the objectives of the Single Act. It is simply the consequence of past commitments: enlargement, the integrated Mediterranean pro grammes. The 1988 budget, as proposed by us, does not incorporate the ambitions of the Single Act. It is simply the consequence of past commitments. And the 1987 budget is short of five \u2014 or six \u2014 thousand mil lion ECU in resources, while the 1988 budget corres ponds to a VAT take of about 1.7%! If we have no medium-term solution, if we do not look to the medium term, we cannot settle the short-term prob lems. For we have not, I repeat, taken the commit ments embodied in the Single Act into account in the 1987 and 1988 budgets. So true is this that we have formally told the governments, in a letter addressed to the Heads of Government and the Finance Ministers, that if no solution is found at the European Council meeting, the Commission will refuse to use any of the expedients of the past, in which event it will be obliged to reduce agricultural payments by 30% and structural fund expenditure by 50%. (Applause) That is what we have told the Finance Ministers, and it is what we will do from the start of July in the absence of a decision by the European Council. (Loud and sustained applause) PRESIDENT. \u2014 Thank you President Delors. I think that must be the longest applause I have heard for the Commission for a very long time. The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. Explanations of vote There are nevertheless some grounds for moderate optimism. First because I gather that the European Parliament, for all that it was looking for more, will be lending its support to what we are doing. And secondly because the Belgian Presidency has shown intelligence and pertinacity since the start of its term and is doing everything possible to keep attention focused on Europe's appointment with itself and to stop other items getting on the agenda. (Applause) Finally \u2014 and I should like to end on this, since it was raised by Mr Dido and Mr Cot \u2014 it is not possible, despite the assertions of certain governments and cer tain Finance Ministers, to find a short-term solution BEUMER (PPE). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, my group will today unanimously support the proposals by the rapporteurs, Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo and Mr von Wogau. Of course we also have our reservations, in particular where some agricultural paragraphs are concerned; but our final opinion will be swayed in favour by the proposed course of European developments, which is the same as that set out in the Commission's proposals. My group congratulates Lord Plumb and the rappor teur on the fact that Parliament has put them in a posi tion to react quickly, for in conveying this particular message speed is of the essence. We are aware that we are now placing a highly spe cific interpretation on the concept of European Union by seeing it as a genuinely common economic area and ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/119 Beumer rejecting a loosely defined free trade area with some financial transfers. In accordance with our tradition, and following in the footsteps of the rapporteurs and the Commission, we also see this as an opportunity to discuss economic and social cohesiveness. For achieve ment of the internal market, vital as it will be to main taining our capacity for growth, must also result in a balanced spread of achievements that are compatible with social cohesiveness. We realize that operation 'Internal Market', with its environmental and technological impact, will be one of the more far-reaching changes under the Single Act. As one example let me remind the House of the inescapable fact that if there is to be freedom of move ment of capital there will have to be some restrictions on national monetary autonomy, and developments set in motion leading ultimately to a kind of federal bank structure based on the national central banks. Mr Arndt has said that a grand coalition will be neces sary if optimum use is to be made of the Single Act. By voting unanimously, even though critical of certain features, for the approach set out, my group can be seen to be reacting favourably to this. That will enable us to respond to an excess of national protectionism by giving a new impetus to the Community ideal from this Parliament, and thus from a variety of political convictions and nationalities, North and South. (The speaker continued in English) Speaking on behalf of the second largest group in the Parliament, let me say firmly to our friends in Ireland, where voting on the Single European Act takes place on 26 May, that renegotiation of the Act is not an option open to any of us. You cannot have the Single European Act \u00e0 la carte. Rejection of the Act will not stop the other 11 Member States from going ahead with it but will make Ireland ineligible for the increased benefits which will result from it. Ireland has played a constructive role in European history in the past and we hope that Ireland will not now vote to isolate itself from its Community friends. We want them to be with us. CERVETTI (COM). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, the report that we are about to vote on must of necessity take into account the context in which Europe finds itself \u2014 the crisis regarding its construction, and the action and behaviour of Parliament, the Commission and, above all, the Council. We do not at all deny that with this report there has at last been a reduction in the initial exaggerated claims \u2014 no, the Single Act is not a new frontier! \u2014 and that it introduces ideas, suggestions and hopes for imple menting the single market and, at the same time, start ing to solve the questions of the social area, the mone tary system and technology. We have worked assi duously to these ends, especially my colleague Mrs Barbarella in the Temporary Committee for the Success of the Single Act. However, there are some problems in the report that are left in the fog of ambiguity, and others that lie stagnating in the bog of totally unsatisfactory defini tions; and this is the case with matters regarding the budget \u2014 having seen the outcome of the vote on Amendment No 93 on the question of cohesion. Taken overall there are not sufficient guarantees and determinations to achieve the objectives which the Commission itself proclaims. For these reasons we cannot support all of the conclu sions reached by the Temporary Committee. How ever, what worries us most is the context in which the report is placed, and which the report itself neither cri ticises nor condemns. Let us not mince matters! What is going on is, at best a sort of acceptance of the best that can be hoped for, floating on the crisis of the con struction of the Community. The Council puts on the brakes and obstructs. The Commission, despite some show of goodwill and determination, does not succeed in breaking free from the considerable constraints upon it. Parliament, after the irritations resulting from the adoption of the albeit unheeded Draft Treaty, ought to undergo a sort of normalization. Look at the incredible delay that has built up in approving directives for the implementation of the single market, and draw your own conclusions! No! We cannot accept all of that and an apparently ineluctable fate. The vote of abstention that we shall shortly be casting reflects this criticism. It also, more over, reflects the doubts, the concern, the need to aim higher, that have been expressed in various quarters during the debate \u2014 for example, by Messrs Cot and Dido. Nor do we propose to withdraw into splendid isolation. On the contrary, we shall continue stub bornly to seek, both here and outside this Chamber, appropriate agreements and alliances. We have moreover shown this determination in regard to Amendment No 93. At the same time, at a difficult moment full of weariness and disappointment, we take on the arduous but necessary task of representing a hope and a source of encouragement for all of those who have committed themselves or want to commit themselves to the fight for a democratic, united, really closely-knit, fair, progressive Europe. That is the significance of our vote, our action, our clearly declared intent. PRICE (ED). \u2014 Mr President, my group are deeply committed to the development of the Community. In this Parliament we want with other groups to achieve the implementation of the Single European Act and we feel that there is a wide measure of agreement on our common objectives. However, I have some important ",
        "No 2-352/120 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Price reservations about the text on which we are about to vote. It has been improved by amendments adopted today, but problems remain. The first is that Parliament has offered hostages to those Member States who might hold up decisions on the internal market. We believe that the internal mar ket programme must be accepted as a whole and with out preconditions. If we cast any doubt on that com mitment then we shall prejudice the achievement of the internal market and hence the economic growth upon which all else depends. The text talks rather loosely about doing a lot of things in parallel. It also has astonishing omissions, for example, not mention ing transport liberalization or the marketing services. Parliament should not raise doubts where there should be none. Mr President, the motion contains worthy aspirations about the future of our common agricultural policy. But we need to go further. Agricultural guarantee expenditure has grown remorselessly through lack of decisions by the Council of Ministers. We must have a mechanism which will impel them to take those deci sions. If the new resources which we want to devote to the structural funds, research and development and the other growing policies are diverted to agriculture, it will be a tragedy. But it is an avoidable one. We must avoid it. In view of these reservations I can only abstain today though my Spanish and my Danish colleagues feel that on balance it will be possible for them to vote in favour. I very much hope when we return to this sub ject, as we will in future months, that we can resolve the doubts which I have expressed and that we can go forward as a united Parliament. obligations it assumed through the decisions of its var ious organs. The 1987 budgetary situation, which the Commission recently criticized with a quite proper degree of severity, together with the outlook for the 1988 budget, speaks eloquently of the urgent need for a courageous attitude to be adopted. Against this back-drop, June's European Council is of vital import ance regarding the effective willingness to tackle the implementation of the Single Act properly. Any absence, even partial, of a clear display of deter mination in June would simply confirm the existence of a crisis which could put the Community itself in danger. This is why my Group, while unsatisfied with the content of the Single Act, which is no more than an extremely modest step towards the European Union that we passionately want to see, deeply con cerned about the rate at which it has to date been real ized, and aware that the document we are about to vote on is an interesting synthesis, although imperfect from many points of view, is going to vote in favour of this report. We are doing so in the belief that the dis play of intent involved is a symbol of the political cohesion which has been lacking only too often, and in the belief that it is possible that the different peoples of Europe can reach a common understanding in building European unity; in achieving real economic and social cohesion which, beyond the structural funds, runs through all sectorial policies, in order to obtain a full internal market \u2014 something which can not exist without solidarity \u2014 in constructing a Euro pean social area and, lastly, in gaining a politically strong and independent, economically developed, regionally balanced and financially autonomous Europe, a Europe united politically, economically and also socially. AMARAL (LDR). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, the Euro pean Parliament is about to make its first contribution to the long-awaited full achievement of the aims of the Single Act, which it is hoped will finally come into force in the near future. This display of approval and of intent, expressed by the direct representatives of the peoples of the twelve Member States, is to be voted on in a remarkable and exemplary spirit of unity, indicat ing the unequivocal desire of all these peoples for the Single Act to be implemented. All the governments together \u2014 that is, the Council of Ministers \u2014 must therefore now take action, supported by the mandate they have been given, constantly seeking the consensus they require in order to achieve their aim within the time available. This needs to be said at a time when there is a feeling of deep concern regarding the approval by the Council of Ministers of the proposals which the Commission has been regularly presenting, something which is taking place at a frankly discour aging rate. Furthermore, the document is being approved at a time when there can be no doubt either that the available resources have completely run out or that the Community is patently unable to meet the PASTY (RDE). \u2014 (FR) The ERDA Group would have voted willingly for a text which had adopted the Commission's comprehensive approach and laid the emphasis on the three policy priorities which condition the Community's future, namely: first, providing our Community with adequate budget resources with which to fund the proper functioning of existing poli cies, including the CAP, and development of new poli cies, notably in the new technologies sector; secondly, reforming the CAP, in its mechanisms and procedures, not in order to destroy it but on the contrary to turn it into a more efficient means of pursuing the fundamen tal objectives of supporting farmers' incomes and developing the Community's underused agricultural potential; finally, bringing about greater economic and social cohesion between the nations making up the Community, through a policy of growth, convergence of economic and social policies, a strengthening of monetary cooperation, and more efficient use of the structural funds. This was the thinking behind our amendments. They have not been adopted, and we cannot go along with the text that the House is being asked to vote on, the ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/121 Pasty main points of which are confused and mutually con tradictory. The majority of our group will abstain, to mark our unwillingness to endorse policies that we consider dangerous for the Community's future, parti cularly the position taken on the subject of reform of the CAP. We cannot go along with the CAP being presented \u2014 in the teeth of the evidence \u2014 as the sole culprit for the Community's financial difficulties. As the President of the Commission was reminding us just now, this disregards the impact of the dollar's fluctua tion and the trade concessions made by the Com munity in the agricultural sector. We denounce the sham of making out to farmers in the less-favoured regions of the Community that a direct income sup port policy can become a single and all-purpose substi tute for supporting farming activity. No figure has ever been put on the real cost of this income support policy, and the desertification of vast areas of the Community will not be averted by treating farmers as mere wardens of the rural environment or of ecologi cal museums. satisfaction. I believe that it has not been made suffi ciently clear what would happen if we reject it. It is important that both the Commission and the Council clarify whether renegotiation is an option or not. This can have a profound effect on the outcome of the referendum in Ireland. There are those who believe, in their ignorance, that renegotiation is still possible. My personal view is that it must be adopted as it stands or not at all, but it is important to clarify the situation. I would ask Mr Delors, with your permission, to make the matter clear one way or another. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Maher, I certainly support your request that we do try to minimize the number of amendments actually tabled. On your specific point, recognizing its tremendous importance, it would be helpful to all of us if Mr Delors were prepared to make a very short state ment. Our group's intention in abstaining is to mark its opposition to a conception of the CAP's future which, if, by any unfortunate chance, it were to be adopted, would sound the death knell of the Community, which would be reduced to a mere free-trade area devoid of all political ambition. D'ORMESSON (DR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the Group of the European Right regrets that it must abstain in the final vote. Its view is that the juxtaposi tion of disparate elements leads to confusion. Never theless, it wishes to congratulate the President of the Commission on his vigorous conclusion. MAHER (LDR). \u2014 Mr President, could I suggest to you that you appeal to those who introduced many amendments that have not a hope of getting through, not to introduce them, to save time and to save print ing and translation costs. This Chamber is about dia logue and there is not enough speaking time for some of us, therefore, that is why we want more time to speak. Having said that, I will support the report. I support the Single Act. I believe that we are making a very modest attempt to extend the Treaty of Rome in order to have more unity in the Community, which is some thing we need. But could I specifically put a question to Mr Delors? I would also like to put the same ques tion to the President. We are having a referendum in Ireland and I believe it is important for Ireland that the result of the referendum should be resounding support for the European Community and for the Single Act. But we never know what way a referendum will go, no more than we know what way an election will go. The argument is being advanced that if we in Ireland reject the Single Act we can renegotiate it to our own DELORS, President of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I would just say in reply to Mr Maher's question that there are no plans, whatever the circum stances, for renegotiating the Single Act or amending the Treaty of Rome. Under no circumstances, what ever the outcome of the referendum in Ireland. (Applause) PEGADO LIZ (RDE). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, I shall just take a few moments to say that despite everything, the Portuguese members of the Renewal group in the European Parliament will be voting for this report. I say despite everything because from many points of view \u2014 procedural obligations, the failure to have translations of texts available on the same day on which amendments were tabled, even the contents of the text of the report itself \u2014 the result was far from brilliant. This was a consequence of the unnecessary haste with which everything was done. Thanks to a number of amendments which have been introduced into the text in the meantime, and particularly to the fact that the text now repeats President Plumb's decla ration in full, which suppresses the initial, and com pletely unacceptable, solution of issuing a blank cheque on this matter, and represents an accurate summary of the stance to be adopted with regard to the Delors document, we intend to vote for this motion for a resolution. It ought, however, to be said that Parliament's opinion, while being unnecessarily long-winded, also failed to adopt a clear position on the need to achieve the various objectives \u2014 a streng thening of economic and social cohesion, the social aspects of the completion of the internal market, the consequences of the Single Act for the least developed countries and regions, the means available for the effective achievement of the European Union, the need for tax harmonization, etc, etc \u2014 at the same time.

NEWTON DUNN (ED). \u2014 Mr President, as you know, there is an election in the UK next month. At election time politicians behave inconsistently and sometimes abandon their true feelings. There is a dan ger in this House that British MEPs on all sides of the House are afraid to support this report because of what their national leaders back home would like them to do, namely, not to mention Europe at all for the next four or five weeks. National leaders in the UK do not want to mention Europe because they think they will lose votes, but 1 have news for London : Europe is popular as a subject among the British public. British public opinion is ahead of the House of Commons in its thinking about Europe. (Applause) National parties will not lose votes! I invite our national politicians to look at the results of Eurobaro meter recently. I invite our national politicians to talk to the public about Europe. They will find that the public want an end to the national bickering and they want Europe to work properly. We are in a different Parliament here to the House of Commons. We do not face an election. We need not be afraid. We should be consistent and we should vote in favour of this report. I urge all British colleagues here on both sides of the House to have the courage of their convictions and vote in favour. (Applause from the right) ADAMOU (COM). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the Single Act and the Commission's proposals for making a suc cess of it provide no opportunities for an improvement in the standard of living of working people or for development throughout the Community, since they offer no possibility for the less developed countries and regions to improve their position. This conclusion is based on simple realism. The 17 million official unemployed, and the 50 million underemployed will wait in vain for the creation of new jobs, from the measures being implemented. The policy of one-sided austerity for all the Member States, once again expressed in the Community budget in terms of financial discipline, and the revision of the CAP, to the detriment of farmers, do not provide mar gins for productive investment and economic develop ment. The system itself cuts the ground from under its own feet. The structural problems of the less devel oped countries and regions grow, and the gap between them and the developed nations continues to widen. Economic convergence is and is set to remain a pious hope, a sort of carrot held out for the simple-minded. As far as the system is concerned, inequality is the rule by which development works. Mr President, who can really believe that a united Europe is more than an unrealizable dream? How can the millions of working people unite and combine their interests with those of the minority who exploit them? Maybe the internal market will come to frui tion. But it will be a market in which the North/South question will dominate and in which the millions of workers will sink into poverty, losing what wealth they have along with their jobs, swelling the ranks of the unemployed. The Bar\u00f3n Crespo and von Wogau report opens no new paths and offers no hope for an improvement in the lives of working people or for the development of the less developed countries. For this reason we shall not be supporting it. FLANAGAN (RDE). \u2014 To me and to all of us mem bers of the Fianna Fail Group, the Single European Act represents a small step towards a better Europe. We will campaign for it within our country. I thank Mr Newton Dunn for his words a few minutes ago addressed to the electorate in Britain. I agree with him. I hope that by our actions over the next three weeks, we will convince a large majority of our electorate in Ireland that this indeed does represent a small but sig nificant step forward towards a better Europe and a better Ireland. DURY (S). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, 'the whole Single Act, nothing but the Single Act', that is what President Delors told us just now. But then, as a Socialist, I am prompted to ask who it is for. Why create an internal market unless it is for the people, for no-one but the people, but \u00ab//the people? What I mean by this is that if the purpose of creating it is not to improve econo mic conditions, to combat unemployment, to improve the lot of the less-favoured regions, and to provide employment for men and women who want to work, along with a measure of social justice, then I really am at a loss to know what we are doing here. We do not want a 'dual society', still less a 'dual Europe', a Europe divided between rich regions and poor regions, a Europe divided between the haves and the unemployed, between those who can afford pri vate insurance schemes and those living on the poverty line, between young people deprived of hope and others for whom no expense is spared. In this connection, I really am disappointed by the way some Honourable Members have voted. I wish they would take another look at Amendment No 93, for instance, which calls for greater regional coherence, or other amendments calling for greater social cohesion. ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/123 Dury Without this social and regional cohesion, there will perhaps be an internal market, but I'm afraid there will be no Europe, at least no Europe recognizable as such to its citizens! I trust you will agree, Mr President, that this was worth saying out loud. FILINIS (COM). \u2014 (GR) I shall abstain from the vote on the Bar\u00f3n Crespo and von Wogau report, as drawn up, because it does not take us any nearer to the sort of united Europe we would wish to work towards. BOSERUP (COM). \u2014 (DA) Mr President, until the Danish referendum on the Single European Act, it was being claimed in political and popular circles that the Single Act was intended as a step towards European union. Our Prime Minister answered that union was dead and gone. And here we sit debating a report whose first point states that the establishment of Euro pean union is the main aim! What are the voters to think? Is it any wonder that they are confused, and have they been lied to? The report is moreover a disappointment. The Commission's analysis of the social and economic situation in the Community is clear and well defined, and our party is in broad agreement with that analysis. But we might have expected a report with more in the way of ideas. Is it really the view that all this verbiage about union will work as a patent medicine able to heal all these ills? Ironically enough the members of the Socialist Peo ple's Party are in agreement both with the Danish Prime Minister and with 90% of the electorate in Denmark, when we vote against this concoction. PISONI, Nino (PPE). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I shall not be able to vote for this report, the agricultural sec tion of which in fact proposes to reduce the agricul tural population, punishing it thereby \u2014 I remind you again \u2014 for having worked, as also for having given employment to all the sectors that lie both upstream and downstream of the agricultural industry. A policy that sets out to implement imposed quotas for restricting production, to withdraw land from farming use, and to manage the farmers in a strait jacket that is tailor-made to reduce their incomes through the policy of coresponsibility taxes and levies is a short-sighted policy that will not fail to have its adverse effects also on other sectors of production. We shall not vote for this report, partly because, quite apart from what President Delors has said, it consti tutes the end and not the means of achieving Euro pean Unity, and this has the smell of political hoaxing about it! I am left with only one consolation \u2014 namely, that this report will have no legal value. BAILLOT (COM), in writing. \u2014 (FR) In her speech on behalf of the French Communists, my friend Dan ielle De March emphasized what we regard as essen tial for the future of the Community if it is to serve the interests of its peoples. There needs to be an all-out effort to achieve substantial growth, which is the only way to establish a real European social area and create desperately needed jobs. The priority policies pro posed by the Commission, centred on liberalization of capital movements, can serve only to exacerbate the effects of the financial cancer that is eating away at the economies of the Community countries, as is acknow ledged by the President of the Commission and many experts. We proposed various amendments, aimed inter alia at restoring a real common agricultural policy. All have been rejected. Under the circum stances, given the damaging policies commended in the report proposed to us and the rejection of amend ments that could have improved its content, the French Communists and Allies will vote against the motion for a resolution. BOCKLET (EPP), in writing. \u2014 (DE) Although I agree with many parts of the Baron/von Wogau report, I am unable to vote in favour of the report as a whole. The main reasons for this are to be found in three decisions concerning the agricultural policy. The European Parliament specifically called for a restric tive price policy to be implemented alongside a reduc tion in quotas, programmes for taking areas out of cultivation and the introduction of progressive prod uction levies in an attempt to reduce surpluses and reform the agricultural policy. The term 'restrictive price policy' has been adopted by the Commission as a political slogan and taken to mean solving the problem of surpluses by dropping agricultural prices. I cannot endorse such a price policy. The European Parliament has also rejected my amend ment to strengthen the link between agriculture and the environment by binding larger areas and by paying farmers for land improvement. And finally, the European Parliament has decided to limit the guarantee section of the EAGGF to 50% of the total budget. But despite these results I shall not allow myself to become despondent and shall continue to fight for a sensible agricultural policy. I am also making this statement on behalf of my colleagues Mr Sp\u00e4th and Mr Stauffenberg. CASSANMAGNAGO CERRETTI (PPE), in writ ing. \u2014 (IT) We have to consider very cautiously the way in which this mini-process of institutional reform, to which the highest levels of officialdom in the Com- ",
        "No 2-352/124 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Cassanmagnago Cerretti munity are now devoting their energies, is developing. To read the official documents circulated on the sub ject and the very meticulous report drawn up by Messrs Baron Crespo and von Wogau it would appear that, if correctly applied, the Single Act would in itself constitute a decisive step towards the European Union. But if you look at it carefully, on the other hand, only the complementary pursuit by Parliament of a strategy for setting up the European Union can satisfy the deep-rooted economic, political and social needs of this Community. The Single Act must be considered as an instrument, capable of perfection, for the implementation of the large internal market, which is a vast project for the Community economy, conceived with great breadth of vision. It remains however an instrument, not an end. The 'internal market' as an aim must instead be seen in its right perspective, clearly, and without yielding to easy optical illusions. In my view this large market must constitute an economic step forward, but in no way must it represent a social step backward. Just ima gine how certain 'delicate' situations could become explosive, if there were an uncontrolled removal of internal frontiers: the rich would become richer, the poor poorer; regional disparities would be accen tuated, and the North-South gap would take firmer root. I therefore agree very largely with the preventive act ion and proposed plans contained in the report of Messrs Baron Crespo and von Wogau, since they seem to me appropriate for restoring a fundamental balance between the laws of the market economy and urgent social requirements. In effect, the single market must be an essential transi tion on the way to more advanced forms of political cohesion. It is important for security provisions to be made, pro tecting all categories of society. I would point out in particular that the new provisions of Article '130R' relating to the environment could with advantage be matched also in the consumer and user's protection sector. In this connection an addition could with advantage be made to the report in ques tion, taking account of this need, which is an integral part of the People's Europe that it is intended to con struct. This expanded interpretation of the Single Act serves to utilize to the full the opportunities that it can offer, and to fill the legal vacuums that it contains. In conclusion, it seems to me to be of fundamental importance to point out that no action is envisaged in the Baron Crespo and von Wogau report on the implementation of the 'external market' \u2014 that is to say, there is no mention of any solid, responsible development policy, the unfillable gaps in which deprive even the very search for an 'internal market' of all significance. In the final analysis, and with some clarifications of a mainly strategic character, I think I can support the guidelines set out in this document, because if they are applied correctly they would undoubtedly make it pos sible to optimize the ambiguous institutional reforms contained in the Single Act. CHRISTIANSEN (S), in writing. \u2014 (DA) The Dan ish Social Democrats support the main ideas in the report and the implementation of the Single European Act. We agree that the structural funds should be reor ganized so as to make much more effective use of the Regional and Social Funds and concentrate the aid in the regions which need it most. We agree that the agricultural surpluses should be eliminated and that the agricultural policy should be reformed, for we can not continue to support a heavy increase in overprod uction to be paid for by the Community's consumers. We support the development of the internal market as a crucial element in a growth-promoting strategy. But, to begin with, we consider that this should be subordi nated to strict requirements with regard to the envi ronment and the working environment and should not be geared exclusively to profit for industry. Secondly we think that extensive consideration should be given to regional and social interests in the development of the internal market, so as to avoid further flights of capital from the poor regions to the highly industrial ized regions within the Community. In other words the development of the internal market should be geared to the interests of the workers and not to those of capital. The structuring of the internal market and the development of social and regional measures for the weaker regions must go hand in hand. On the other hand we do not favour the new budget ary mechanism proposed in the Delors package and supported by the present report. We think that the requirement for 1.4% of GNP will be a great help in 'topping up' the contributions of the individual coun tries to the budget. At the same time it will not benefit those countries which really need additional EEC sup port for regional and social adjustment. We think that the financing mechanism applied hitherto has been excellent, except that of course it needs to be adapted to the general trend in expenditure and to economic growth. We support an increase in the Community budget and an increased Danish contribution to it on condition that new policies are developed in the energy, environment and research sectors and on con dition that the existing policies are made more effec tive. As you know, we Danish Social Democrats are not in favour of the Community's development into a politi cal union, and we therefore oppose the parts of the present report which deal with that. ",

FR\u00dcH (EPP), EBEL (EPP), in writing. \u2014 (DE) Con vinced of the need of a 'new perspective for Europe' we have voted in favour of the report by Mr Baron Crespo and Mr von Wogau, despite our serious mis givings about various sections of the chapter on the reform and modernization of the CAP, particularly paragraphs 18 and 23. However, we shall continue to try to ensure that no harm comes to agriculture in Europe from these passages which unfortunately can no longer be changed by amendments. It was agricul ture after all that was the first economic and social area to blaze the difficult and practical trail towards European union. It thereby opened up the gateway for other areas which unfortunately are still bogged down in protracted theoretical discussions. The mistakes of the CAP which have been caused precisely by these regrettable delays should not be borne mainly by the farmers but should be corrected and offset with the aid of the Single Act, the success of which we earnestly desire to see. MARSHALL (ED), in writing. \u2014 Headline creating talk of 'bankruptcy by the autumn' underlines the urgent necessity to reform the CAP. Those who ask for governments to give their taxpayers' money to the Community ignore the basic problem. It is that the Community squanders money on the production and storing of food which it knows it may be unable to sell. Until the basic problem is solved, it would be the height of folly for governments to give the Com munity more money. The Community has demon strated that only financial stringency will force it to change the CAP. Once the immediate crisis created by the almost unsa lable appetite of the CAP has been solved we can talk of the longer term needs of the Community. As we look to the future, the basis of financing the Com munity has to change. However, I cannot accept the proposal for own resources of 1.4% of GNP until the Council of Ministers has demonstrated its determina tion to stop squandering money on the CAP. This determination can only be demonstrated over a period of years. Until it has been demonstrated the Com munity will have to live on 'short rations' because they have been shown to be the only effective way of con trolling the avaricious appetite of the CAP. O'MALLEY (PPE), in writing. \u2014 While we talk of making a success of the Single Act here this morning, it is only fair to warn this House that it should not be assumed that the result of the referendum in Ireland will be positive. You may ask, how can this be? You may ask, how could a whole nation behave like lemmings throwing themselves off a cliff? Strange as it may seem, there is every indication that it is possible. I would ask you to understand that Ireland is now experiencing a crisis in its public life such as it has not experienced for decades. For various reasons \u2014 especially the crisis in Irish public finances \u2014 there has been an extraordinary number of U-turns and political somersaults by many Irish politicians in recent years. The result is that the credibility of politicians as a group has been stretched very thin. Add to that the unprecedented number of elections and referenda over the past few years \u2014 and the consequent exhaustion of party organizations and you have a situation where democratic parties have been severely weakened in their capacity to influence public opinion. So right now we have an extremely dangerous vacuum which can be filled by all sorts of unrepresentative groups who can make the most outrageous claims and spread the most outrageous rumours, and be taken seriously. Members of this House will be surprised to hear that most people in Ireland are now under the impression that the Single European Act is chiefly a question of Ireland's military neutrality. They will even be more surprised to hear that a large number of people think it is a conspiracy to force abortion on Ire land, or to prevent us from protesting against nuclear pollution from our neighbours. I and my colleagues are doing everything we can to correct these distor tions, but our success is not guaranteed. In normal circumstances there would be no problem in winning such a referendum in Ireland, but circum stances now are not normal. It would be a tragedy for all of Europe if Ireland votes 'no', but I have to warn you that there is no guarantee it will not happen. To adapt a famous dictum slightly, 'All that is needed for insanity to prevail is for sane men to do nothing'. There are two weeks left for sane people to assert themselves. We have two weeks left to tell people that the Single Act offers hope to Ireland and indeed to all of Europe, and that it must be passed. WOLFF (LDR), in writing. \u2014 (FR) Making a success of the Single Act is an undertaking of the utmost importance. Europe must be built, and 1992 is a signi ficant date, one which serves a useful purpose as a reference point. But many difficulties are going to have to be ironed out before then. The Member States are going to have to be convinced of the need to put their protectionist or nationalistic tendencies behind them. Care is going to have to be taken to avoid end less calling into question of principles and unproduc tive, sterile horse-trading. The Commission cannot become the secretariat of the Member States' govern ments, but must be the driving force advancing the ",
        "No 2-352/126 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Wolff European idea. The twelve Member States' survival will depend on this. Should we be optimistic? Should we be pessimistic? Neither. We must be realistic. Everything will depend on the capacity of the Com\u00ad munity budget and the efforts made to achieve real balance. Today's obscurantism, while understandable in the light of the current difficulties, cannot be allowed to last. A big effort is going to be needed on coordination of the Member States' economic policies. The governments should be encouraged to envisage their future action from the European standpoint, in keeping with the directives. That would avoid the need for a lot of extra work on harmonization in the future. Maintaining and developing a dynamic agricultural policy are essential requirements for progress in the Community. The years to 1992 must be used to make an all-out effort to eliminate budget imbalances, to apply budgetary discipline and rigour to both non- compulsory and compulsory expenditure, and to cor\u00ad rect a number of anomalies, for instance in the accounting methods applied to stocks. I felt it most important to offer these comments and, while I will still be casting my vote in favour, there were certain apprehensions that I thought needed to be expressed. Firm words must be followed by firm\u00ad ness in practice. The time has come for action. We cannot afford to lose any time. 1992 is almost upon us.

A 2-30/87 by Mr Van der Lek, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on public access to environmental pollution informa\u00ad tion. MARTIN Simone (LDR), rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) I note, ladies and gentlemen, that the environment is an issue of concern to many Honourable Members. The fourth programme on the environment represents real progress in Community policy in this field. It has to be recognized that the development of problems in this area has been such that environmental policy now features in the Single Act and the Commission has changed its approach, shifting the emphasis to the preventive aspect and integration of environmental policy into the Community's other policies, something on which we can but congratulate it, even though we may at the same time regret that this was not done at an earlier stage. With the European Year of the Environment under way, we have the opportunity today to heighten awareness among the public, although public opinion already seems to be evolving, to judge from a recent survey which showed that 46% of people in Europe considered the environment to be a matter of major concern, whereas quite recently interest in it was con\u00ad fined to a few experts. It was therefore important for our committee to res\u00ad pond to the hopes of our fellow citizens in the context of a Community action programme. Consequently, with this in mind, the Environment Committee has opted for proposing priorities rather than going along with the list of 19 actions featuring in the Commis\u00ad sion's draft resolution. We can but find it wholly deplorable that the Council should have already adopted a resolution in March, when Parliament had not stated its position, particularly when he had indeed wanted to make changes to the Commission's initial text. There is nothing new in this kind of behaviour from the Council, but something that I consider even more serious, to which I should like to draw the House's attention, is the divergence that I found when comparing the wording of the Council's resolution, approved in principle on 19 March last, with that of Article 130R of the Single Act, where the Heads of State or Government have established that environ- ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/127 Martin mental policy is among those to which the principle of subsidiarity is applicable, in the following terms: 'The Community shall take action relating to the environ ment to the extent to which the objectives referred to in paragraph 1 can be attained better at Community level than at the level of individual Member States. Without prejudice to certain measures of a Com munity nature, the Member States shall finance and implement the other measures.' And yet the Council of Environment Ministers refers to this article in the con text of funding procedure only. As I see it, such an approach is restrictive, since it fails completely to take account of the principle of subsi diarity, a fundamental principle which, where the envi ronment is concerned, ought to be applied through the implementation of concrete measures at Community level. Only when a clear and unequivocal definition of this principle has been established will it be possible to consider the specific matter of funding. In other words, the bounds of the principle's applicability must first be delimited and then it becomes possible to examine its financial implications. I therefore call upon the Council and the Commission to review the text in this spirit, to eliminate all possibility of misunderstand ing. I turn now to the fourth programme and the priorities that we have adopted. First of all, education and infor mation, an aspect that I want to stress, since it is important for citizens to learn to treat nature with res pect from a very young age, just as it is important for them to have access to information. Our public auth orities and industrial concerns must learn new ways and take the message that the citizen is entitled, within reasonable limits of course, to be supplied with infor mation bearing on the environment. The second priority is a strategy on waste, which can damage not only the environment but our own health as well. I have to say that the Commission is somewhat at fault here. We had called for a Community action to be initiated on this matter, and we are still waiting. And yet the Seveso accident and the waste pollution in Wallonia have given reminders of the urgent need for overall regulatory action on chemicals. The Seveso and Bale disasters also show the urgent need for Com munity action, but again overall action, mark you, to lay down measures to be taken not only for the stor age and disposal of waste but also for the prevention of accidents and above all measures to be taken in the event of an accident. I consider it important to adopt such an approach, in the interests of conservation. It is necessary in the modern age to reconcile econo mic and ecological considerations. In an industrialized society such as ours, we have reached the point at which it has become necessary to rethink the whole matter of the balance of nature. In fact, what we have to do is work out a new relationship with our environ ment. Various forms of action could be taken, relying on the following means: country planning, land man agement planning, integrated agricultural research, and development of clean technologies. There has been much talk on this last subject, but the Commis sion has never given it the emphasis it deserves. There is a Community action in progress, but its scope is limited. As we have already stressed, this priority should be pursued by actions backed by more substan tial funding, so that enterprises could carry out research or gain access to these clean technologies. But none of these priorities will have any meaning unless Community legislation is applied. As we know, many directives have been ignored in a number of Member States. The Commission must draw up a list of them and enforce them. In conclusion, it must be appreciated that any environ mental policy, if it is to be effective, must maintain bal ance between economic risks and protection of the environment. It should also be borne in mind that this is the Year of the Environment. At the same time, we should not lose sight of the objective of completing the internal market by 1992, nor should we forget the need for our industries to be competitive. WEBER (S), rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject for debate today is the principles and guidelines of the European policy on the environment for the next five years. We are pleased to be able to say that since the first Com munity action programme considerable progress has been made in the basic attitude to an environment policy, from repairing damage to preventing damage of the environment. We are also pleased that we can now establish a link to the two most important legal instruments for environmental protection, namely the environmental impact assessment and the public's right to information. Because in order to be aware one must be informed. This is particularly true of environmental awareness. How can we as politicians expect our fellow citizens to take care of the environment when only very few of them actually know the effects of their behaviour in the past, and therefore in the future, the condition of air, water and the soil and how other people behave? There are so many unanswered questions. Thank goodness the Commission wrote into the action pro gramme that the European Year of the Environment offered the opportunity to improve on what had been done so far, for example by making relevant informa tion on environmental subjects and problems available to all. We are glad to have done specific preparatory work for such an important EEC directive as the right to information which incorporates the experience of such countries as the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden and others, which have been working for many years for the improvement of the environment and democracy. There can be no proper justification for withholding certain information from our fellow citizens, such as ",
        "No 2-352/128 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5. 87 Weber permits to release waste water into rivers, load values of ground water or foodstuffs, radiation values in air conditioning installations or foodstuffs, air pollutants and others. Information concerning the environment is important to us all. That is why the veil of secrecy sur rounding this information must be lifted. Generally the authorities consider the confidentiality requirements of firms to be more important than the public's interest in information on their environment. A person must be properly informed before he can participate responsibly and constructively, as we would wish him to do, in the environmental impact assess ment, for example. Here the 1982 directive, which should be transformed into national legislation next year in all Member States, unfortunately does not include all of Parliament's proposals. Both the unsatis factory rules on the public's participation and the removal of plans and programmes from the Environ ment Programme are proving even in this preparatory stage to be a grave mistake, as is shown clearly by the results of questionnaires and the increasing number of complaints and court cases against administrative deci sions. We also realise that the annexes are in dire need of revision, especially as it is well nigh impossible to com pare how they are implemented in the Member States. For example pollutant enterprises, such as intensive animal husbandry, are irresponsibly encouraged. We welcome the fact that the Commission is actively- encouraging the exchange of information between the Member States and we are also pleased to see the Commission supporting further training measures for the authorities of all Member States. We must point out once again that under Article 13 all Member States have been granted sufficient leeway to adopt more stringent controls when transforming the directive into national legislation. In adopting this report on the environmental impact assessment, on the rights of the public to have access to information and on the fourth action programme, Parliament is showing clearly that it will continue to ensure that the Community with its environment projects becomes a guarantee of quality for environmentally acceptable plans and projects and for consulting the public on environmental issues. We want environmental protection to be removed from its position as the poor relation and for it to be incorpor ated into all other areas of Community policy. The public is becoming increasingly drawn into plans and projects, and the later it is involved in the deci sion-making process, the more difficult and more ser ious the consequences and costs are. Public and private enterprises cannot be carried out without the accept ance of those concerned; it can only be done with them, not against them. The fact that this information and participation of the public should not be restricted by national frontiers ought really to be crystal clear to a European Community. The environmental impact assessment also has other failings in other ways. We feel that even now the EEC, for example via the European Investment Bank or the structural funds, should only help to finance those projects which have already undergone an environ mental impact assessment. We already put that view across strongly in our resolution on the European Year of the Environment. The pilot projects to be implemented in the Year of the Environment are already subject to this, due to pressure from the Euro pean Parliament. The current preparations to trans form the directive into national legislation clearly show that Parliament was justified in warning against exemptions and vague formulae. We see that the wording of Article 42 of the directive on exceptions, by which Member States may exempt projects from this environmental impact assessment, which was already criticized by the European Parlia ment, has been widened far too much. We must reiter ate yet once more that Member States may pass national regulations but that this does not release them from the basic obligation to implement the Environ ment Programme in all cases. The national authorities have very little margin for manoeuvre here. VAN DER LEK (ARC), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, as Mrs Weber has already so clearly stated, the right to information is essential in any gen uine democracy. Only if individual citizens, citizens' organizations and people's representatives in principle enjoy the same access to information as the holders of office can they effectively evaluate government policy and play their part in shaping it. That point is tellingly made in a 1979 Council of Europe resolution, which expresses the conviction that parliamentary democracy can only operate satisfactorily if the population as a whole and its elected representatives are kept fully informed. That applies with special force to the area of the natural environment. The environment remains indivi sible. We all have to live in it, and everything we do has some impact on it. Moreover, much of the infor mation relating to the environment is predominantly technical in character. Many of the threats to the envi ronment are of a kind that you cannot smell or see. The interpretation of all the facts and figures is a mat ter of assessment. Government departments regularly make such assessments, and rightly so, that is their job. But people's representatives, private citizens, indepen dent institutes and their experts want to be able to make their own assessments, and that is also indispens able for public discussion. But in that case the facts and figures must be available. The core of the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which I now move, is the guaranteeing of the right to information. The basic position should be that everyone should be entitled to facts and figures on demand, with as few exceptions as possible. Exceptions should apply only to matters of state security, the protection of individual privacy, and ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/129 Van der Lek the safeguarding of commercial secrets \u2014 in the latter case only when these really are essential to a firm's competitive position. There must be guarantees of pro tection for certain secrets, but they must also be open to challenge by anyone seeking information. For that reason a legal ruling will be necessary. The Commission is being asked to draw up a directive setting out the main components of such a legal ruling. Legislation governing access to government informa tion already exists in some Member States but not in others. It is vitally important, to individuals and firms alike, for equivalent legislation to apply to access to information in all Member States. In countries where such legislation has been in force for some time, for example the United States, where the Freedom of Information Act, in force since 1966, was last reviewed and strengthened in 1978, the indications are that it works well. Individuals, journalists, environmental organizations, can get hold of information, and that helps to promote public debate. The idea that firms would somehow be disadvantaged in any way by such a law has been shown to be without foundation. Nor are the costs of this provision at all excessive. This year we are celebrating the European Environ ment Year. As Mrs Weber has already pointed out, if we expect individual citizens to live more in harmony with the environment in their daily lives, then they will also have to be better informed. That means that we shall all have to pull together to make the choices that will be needed if the environment really is going to be improved. It really is too silly for words that in some Member States waste-disposal information is still kept secret, so that people sometimes do not know what is in their water supply, what is in the air they breathe, what sort of toxic substances are being deposited on their refuse dumps, or what their homes are built on. Things fortunately are moving in the right direction nearly everywhere. In the different Member States new legislation has recently come into force laying down a certain degree of right of access to informa tion. What is needed now is fast progress towards a general provision that is adapted to each country's legislation, and that will mean precise arrangements with firm deadlines, a precise stipulation of the exceptions, and a procedure that allows appeals to be heard if you think you have not been given the information you need. The Commission wants that too, as the fourth action programme makes clear, and that has also been accepted in that form by the Council. There is a para graph to that effect in the resolution adopted by the Council. I therefore have every confidence that appro priate, democratic, and clear-cut freedom of informa tion legislation will quickly be introduced. One of the problems that will certainly have to be set tled here is the evaluation of data. Different people can draw different conclusions from the same data. The Committee on the Environment therefore thinks that citizens and their organizations, not forgetting ourselves, as people's representatives, must be in a pos ition to consult their own independent experts and to have professional assessments made. That will all take money, and that is why it is also proposed that there should be equitable and viable arrangements for grant ing assistance in obtaining expert counter-opinions. Such arrangements have been shown to work satisfac torily in different countries. I hope Parliament will live up to its democratic mandate by adopting this provi sion for public access to information about the envi ronment. SMET, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, honourable Members, honourable Member of the Commission, it gives me great pleasure to have the privilege of addressing Parliament in plen ary sitting, and I should like to take this opportunity to comment on the three reports that are before you today, and then to consider the results of the March meeting of the Council of Environment Ministers and the programme for the May meeting of that Council. The first report, by Mrs Martin, concerns the fourth action programme on the environment. I have myself strongly urged the Council working party on the natural environment and the informal Council meeting held in Februar)' to direct their activities to persuading the Member States at the March Council meeting to consolidate those items that they acknowledge as priority areas under the fourth action programme in a policy-making resolution. I myself took the view that a major debate with the objective of securing full adop tion of literally every feature of the action programme might well keep us tied up for a good number of presi dencies hence, and still not lead to any agreement. I also thought it particularly important to get such a resolution adopted, because it would constitute a ges ture lending additional weight to the programme in conjunction with the start of the European Environ ment Year, which coincided with the Council meeting in March. An agreement in principle was reached in the Council, but it deferred formal adoption of the resolution to await the opinion of the European Par liament. I am therefore particularly pleased to see this item on your agenda for today. In this connection I would stress particularly the importance of getting at the source of the problem, a point other speakers have also made. The unfavour able experience of a policy of simply reacting to events has highlighted the need for preventive measures all too clearly. Another aspect that must have absolute priority in future is the integration of environmental provisions with other policy areas, which is also the leitmotiv of the European Environment Year. That also represents one of the most important messages of, for example, the Brundtland report. ",
        "No 2-352/130 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5. 87 Smet Finally, there is also a need for effective cooperation with countries and institutions outside the Com munity, and in shaping our policies we must contin uously renew consultations to ensure that we do not lose sight of the overriding objectives. The motion for a resolution provides for monitoring of this aspect. The second report, by Mrs Weber, concerns adjust ments to the existing directive on environmental impact studies. The motion proposes expanding and amending this directive, and that is certainly a useful proposal. But there will first have to be some experi ence of implementation of the existing directive in order to identify those features that are amenable to improvement. Article 11 of the directive in any event stipulates that the Commission shall bring out a report five years after the promulgation of the directive on the implementation of the directive and submit appro priate proposals. I think we must certainly aim to widen the scope of this directive, for environmental impact studies are more or less the keystone of preventive policy, and are one of the best means of responding to the desire for environmental considerations to be integrated into economic decision-making. As to the question of access to environment pollution information, the subject of the report by Mr Van der Lek, the Council did devote a short discussion to this at its sitting last November on the initiative of the United Kingdom delegation. That initiative met with a highly favourable reception in the Council, and the Commission agreed to study the whole question of access to information more closely in the context of the implementation of the fourth action programme. I should like now to turn to the progress being made in the Council of Environment Ministers. As I have already informed the House, I arranged for an infor mal Council meeting to be held on 13 February 1987 in Brussels in advance of the formal March sitting. On a number of questions, including atmospheric pollu tion by motor vehicles or atmospheric pollution by gas oil, Member States were induced to adopt more flexi ble positions on a number of matters, and I went so far as to form the view, and I said so at the time before the European Parliament's Committee on the Environ ment, that the opening of the European Environment Year on 19 March could rightly be associated with progress on a number of important questions still out standing. We could hardly appeal to the public at large, to different groups in society, to the business community, or to those in the so-called leading econo mic sectors to support the Environment Year in var ious ways without offering some signs of progress our selves as a Council of Ministers. The Council of 19 March met primarily to discuss matters relating to atmospheric pollution. In terms of press and public relations, I referred to it as the 'Acid Rain' Council. I think we all realize that the concept of 'acid rain' relates to a highly complex phenomenon, and that the term is not necessarily scientifically accurate. But since taking on responsibility for the environment portfolio I have always stressed the point that in an often highly technical subject like the environment, you have to learn to operate with simple concepts for the benefit of the public at large. We ourselves are sometimes res ponsible for the lack of clarity among the public as to what European policy on the environment now actu ally consists of. Consequently, we must learn to work with less abstract concepts, and I have already had occasion to raise that point with the Commission. First and foremost there was the proposal concerning large-scale combustion plant. The main objective here was to secure significant reductions of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions and dust from large-scale installations used for electricity generation or as indus trial plant. That proposal was the subject of wide- ranging and very difficult discussions in the Council on account of the far-reaching impact in terms of the economic policy and energy policy. In March the Council held a fruitful discussion on a new proposal, a package-deal by the Presidency, that we hope will lead to a fair allocation of the responsibilities to be assumed. Where the question of new plant and equip ment, as also the question of old plant and equipment, is concerned, the Council has acknowledged that the proposals by the Belgian Presidency are a first step in the right direction. Even more important, I think, than this statement by the Council, is the fact that it is now widely accepted that since 1 January genuine, detailed discussions have now been held for the first time on specific emission levels, with actual figures taking the place of an abstract debate on the criteria for the allo cation of responsibilities. Work is being continued on the basis of these new proposals, and we shall of course do our best, but I would only be raising false hopes were I to give you the impression that we were now on the threshold of a final decision. Not since the earliest stages of EEC environment policy has the Council ever addressed itself to a question that can deliver such important gains for the environment, namely a reduction of at least 30% in sulphur-dioxide emissions, but that will at the same time have such a direct impact on the econo mic and energy policies of the Member States. I note that at the Council meeting of 21 May, following the technical discussions that were held on preparations for this item, and that have still not resulted in any decision being taken, we shall be committed to calling on the Member States to secure some measure of pol itical consensus at this level. That is the only option still remaining, for the technical side of the debate is now exhausted. Secondly, as regards atmospheric pollution, the Coun cil has also adopted a directive amending the 1975 directive concerning the sulphur content of gas oil. Gas-oil emissions do not of course make up the lion's share of total S0 2 emissions, but they nevertheless play an important part, especially in urban areas. This ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/131 Smet directive is thus an important step forward by compar ison with the existing directive, and so is not without its importance. Thirdly, on the question of motor vehicles there has also been some progress in the Council. You know that because of its major economic impact, this item has also been the subject of very difficult negotiations in the different meetings of Environment Councils. What did we achieve on 20 March? Where exhaust emissions of petrol engines were concerned, it proved possible for one of the two outstanding reservations of Member States to be overcome. Eleven Member States have now thus declared themselves in agreement with the results of the Council of 27 June 1985. That leaves only one. As to emissions by private-car diesel engines, there have been fundamental discussions that will be resumed by the May Council, and preparation for this has just taken place in the Council working party. As to emissions by large diesel-engined vehicles the Council of 20 March was able to arrive at an overall solution that again met with the agreement of the eleven Member States, so that only one Member State is still holding out against it. Fourthly, the Council held introductory talks on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning Com munity imports and exports of certain dangerous chemicals. The purpose of the proposal is to monitor exports of dangerous substances, in particular pesti cides and herbicides, to third countries, above all developing countries. I regard this as a very important proposal. It is the first from the Council of Environ ment Ministers to appeal so specifically to our respon sibility for environmental matters in relation to the Third World. That is an aspect that will continue to grow in importance. One of the most important con clusions of the Brundtland report, for example, is pre cisely an appeal to the North to implement a conscious environment policy in relation to the South. As regards the proposal for a directive a number of prob lems remain unresolved, in particular the question as to the new principle introduced by the Commission of prior notification of approval by the importing third country. At present the Council regards this as prema ture. There have however been major demands in this connection, as is apparent from the declaration I arranged to be adopted by the Council and that will, it is to be hoped, result in agreement in the Council on 21 May. Fifthly, the Council has been able to secure the formal adoption of the directive on risks of serious accidents in certain industrial activities, a minor amendment that is being made to the basic directive, as well as of the directive on the prevention of pollution of the environ ment by asbestos. As regards the directive on industrial accidents, the Council is aware of Parliament's con cern here, in particular in relation to the Sandoz acci dent. And rightly so. That anxiety is fully shared by the Council as a whole. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation in relation to the substances covered by this directive, and may submit proposals for amendments in relation to those substances, where necessary exceeding the terms of the systematic gen eral review it has already announced. Sixthly, a debate was held in the Council on the man date to be given to the Commission on the absolutely crucial problem of worldwide protection of the ozone layer. What then can we expect from the 21 May meeting of the Council? As I have already stated, certain ques tions will again come up for discussion that could not be taken at the March Council. The Council will also further prepare the Community standpoint with a view to the final round of negotiations planned for Septem ber on the previously announced protocol on chloro- fluorocarbons, in relation to the treaty on the protec tion of the ozone layer. In addition, I should like to draw your attention spe cifically to the fact that I attach especially great importance to the problem of water pollution. It is clear to me, not least from contacts I recently had with, for example, the European Environment Office, that there is continuing anxiety about this aspect. In that connection I have urged the working party to speed up its discussions on the two proposals for direc tives now on the agenda. The first again concerns three substances on the black list of substances in the annex to the 1976 Directive on the dumping of dan gerous substances in the aquatic environment. These are aldrine, dildrine and endrine. I trust Parliament will be able to deliver its opinion speedily on this pro posal, since it is expected that significant progress will be achieved at the May 21 Council meeting, possibly even resulting in a consensus. The second proposal relates to chromium, a substance from list 2 of the 1976 directive. This is the first spe cific proposal relating to a list 2 substance. A start has only just been made in dealing with this. The Council nevertheless hopes to be in a position to hold an initial exchange of views on this next week. Finally, I can inform the House that the Belgian dele gation will submit a memorandum on the steps that other Member States intend to take \u2014 and this conse quently will be a question directed at the other Mem ber States \u2014 on putting a stop to the disposal of titan ium dioxide waste at sea. By royal decree, issued on my initiative, this form of dumping is to be prohibited in'Belgiumby 1989. The Council will also discuss the proposal for a regu lation concerning joint action on the environment. We are in general agreed that the regulation must be extended. The Presidency attaches especially great importance to this matter, which is moreover clearly urgent because the present regulation expires on 3 July 1987. So we must succeed in reaching a decision here. ",
        "No 2-352/132 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Smet May I also state that the Presidency will submit a writ ten communication to the Council to ensure follow-up to the conclusions of the all-important Brundtland report in the EEC. Giving specific content to the endeavour to integrate environmental impact into other policy considerations will have to feature promi nently in this process. In conclusion, let me say thank you to all of you for the cooperation that has been achieved between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. The debates we have had together have been important and fruitful for the work that has been done in the Council. We for our part in the Council look forward to receiving your opinions in order to make full use of them before reaching a definitive conclusion. (Applause) CLINTON DAVIS, Member of the Commission. \u2014 Mr President, I am indeed pleased to be able to follow immediately after the President-in-Office of the Council, Madame Smet, who has given the House a very comprehensive report on the activities of the Council. No report \u2014 and this is perhaps the point that is omitted from her speech \u2014 can convey the enthusiasm which she has personally brought to the activities of the Council and which she constantly deploys in seeking to offer guidance to a somewhat hesitant body, if I may put it in that way. I am told I may. I even tell them so, so that is alright. Mr President, there has been a great deal of debate inside the institutions of the Community about the creation of the European economic space. And we also hear a great deal about the creation of a European social space. That is as it should be. But what is under scrutiny in the debate that we are having now is the Commission's efforts to create a European living space, a Europe of clean air, a Europe of pure water, a Europe of uncontaminated earth, a Europe where the beauty and the bounty of nature are protected and preserved for the generations to come. We are simply trustees and we hold a precious trust in our hands. Surely we all agree now that no economic progress is worth having if it means further despoliation of the natural world or more wanton consumption of resources that simply will not last for ever. As the Brundtland report asserted so vividly, we are all ecolo- gists now because we have to be ecologists now. I should like to make a few remarks about the fourth environmental action programme which is reviewed in Mrs Martin's report. She makes a number of criticisms of the Commission, as she is perfectly entitled to do. I would like therefore to call attention to the fact that when the Commission launched the action programme last September we offered a six-year legislative pro gramme predicated on our belief 'that the role of envi ronmental policy must change in a fundamental way introducing an entirely new dimension to human development'. So that was quite clearly stated. It remains our conviction that environmental protection has got to be ever present from here on in in our social, economic, industrial and development policies. That conviction forms the core of the individual policy choices that we make. And I am very pleased that this evolution in our thinking is recognized in the report that we are considering. Now in her resolution, Mrs Martin says that she is, and I quote: '...aware of the efforts made by the Com mission to institute a new approach in environmental policy.' And in her explanatory statement she says: 'The Commission now shows greater understanding of these matters.' Now that, perhaps, is the closest that I can ever expect to get to a compliment from the Com mittee on the Environment, Public Health and Con sumer Protection. But before I respond to the specific criticisms which are made, perhaps I can remind the House of some of the key elements, and only some of them, in the fourth action programme. The pursuit of immediate and effective decisions to reduce air pollution; an intensifi cation of our efforts to correct pollution of water; the introduction of stricter controls on the use of chemi cals; the promotion of projects highlighting the job creating potential of environmental protection; the determination to ensure that European environmental legislation which is currently in force is actually imple mented; the development of new policies on waste and clean technologies. These emphases of policy appear to me to correlate rather well with those which have been identified by Mrs Martin in her motion and in her statement. So perhaps, in actual fact, Parliament and the Com mission agree on a great deal. But though she wel comes the fourth action programme, as I say, she has her criticisms. She will not be altogether surprised to hear that my purpose now is to attempt to rebut what I take to be the most important of those criticisms. As I do this it is not my objective, of course, to dispute individual points with honourable Members but to try to identify and widen the compatibility of our respec tive points of view. Because what I want Parliament and the Commission to do is to agree on as much as we can together, to politically reinforce one another, to be partners for progress, to act as a real stimulant to the debates that go on inside the Council. Let me take the allegation that the Commission has, and I quote: '...failed in its duty to ensure implementa tion of the Community's environmental legislation.' Now I regard that as an extremely serious charge, that we have failed in our duty. Let us just look at the facts. First, at the informal environment Council in February \u2014 and the Minister will remember this \u2014 I sent a let ter to individual ministers containing a list of breaches that had been committed by Member States. The letter said: Look, these are the breaches that you ministers ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/133 Clinton Davis individually are responsible for and you had better put your house in order. And if you do not then we the Commission have to say unhesitatingly that we are going to proceed against you. And I identified the list of actions that are already being taken. Mr President, I signed the letter as a sort of going- away present from the informal council: 'Wishing you all the best, Yours sincerely, Stanley'. But the clear threat was there. And what is more we have done something about it. It is having an effect. There is increased momentum in terms of implementation of the Bathing Water Directive. Take the situation in the United Kingdom. Before, there were twenty-seven beaches designated. But as a result not only of what we have been doing but of what individual citizens of the United Kingdom did by registering complaints, action is being taken to identify 300 or more beaches. Increased momentum in implementing the Birds Directive in a number of countries. Increased momen tum in implementing one of the most important direc tives \u2014 the Seveso directive \u2014 where, as I reported to the House, we took action before the incident at San doz. Today most of the countries have now carried out that obligation, or are in the process of so doing. Is that failing in our duty? I ask Mrs Martin: is that failing in our duty? Second, in the field of environment policy there are no less than 177 legal actions in progress against Member States. Is that failing in our duty? Third, the Commission has so changed its internal administrative procedures that because of their importance, environmental legal cases now receive top priority. Is that failing in our duty? So with respect, these allegations are simply not sup ported by evidence and they are plainly wrong. But having said that, the fact is that we do agree that the complete and immediate application of existing Com munity legislation is an absolute priority. There are many who proclaim the need for law and order. Many governments do that \u2014 and they are quite right. But let those Member States that are loud est in those proclamations recall that no one has a more sacred obligation to obey the law than those who make the law, and the nations in our Community have willingly made the law. The reality is that enforcement of the law is the key to success as far as our future pol icies are concerned. If we are not successful here, then we shall be simply deluding ourselves in believing that we. can make decisive progress by introducing new policies. Mrs Martin also calls on the Commission not to encourage compromises as regards environment policy measures but to introduce the most stringent measures possible, and she stresses that EEC measures must not affect more stringent regulations in force in individual countries. Those are wonderful words. But, if I may say so with the greatest respect in the world, it is very easy, and not particularly helpful, for Parliament to occupy this high moral ground and to remain superior to the world of compromise in every respect. It remains the Commission's objective always to get the best possible series of agreements at the Council of Ministers, agreements which are going to stick, agree ments which offer a serious prospect for real environ ment'progress. I can tell the House that many Minis ters do not like some of the compromises put forward by the Commission. They think we push too hard. They think we want to make too much progress too quickly. This House does itself no service at all by indulging in this unrealistic rhetoric. Let me just give an example of what I mean. And here I am not in the mood for compromise. The President- in-Office referred to a proposal that we put forward to the Council, which this House will be considering in due course, relating to the export of dangerous chemi cals which are banned or severely restricted within the Community. It is based on notification and prior informed consent. It is a question not only of morality but also of good, common, economic sense. Yet it has been described \u2014 I am sorry to say and I take up the words used by the Minister \u2014 as premature. Of course, she is quite right, she is reflecting the view of the Council. I hope it is not her own point of view. But the fact is that it makes sense because it adds to the dignity of the Community and to the respect which this Community would be able to ensure. Therefore, I believe that it is important that, in an area like this, compromise and the sort of compromises that are being made by the Commission should be persevered with \u2014 even if we are on our own. Parliament and Commission should, in my view, agree that our shared political objective, against the back ground of an environment under threat, is to pursue the best compromise, to get a deal and make it work. It would be tragic if those forces resisting environmen tal progress were to combine with those whose zealo try impels them to make impossible demands. One point I have to take up, which Mrs Martin made in her speech, is the choice of legal base. The idea that you proceed on the basis that she suggested is ingen ious. But how realistic is it? Is there any chance that the Council would agree that, once having adopted the fourth environmental action programme unani mously, all subsequent decisions relating to the imple mentation of the programme should be taken on the basis of qualified majority. It is ingenious. We in the Commission will always explore ingenious ideas, but let us pursue the idea with a degree of prudence and caution. Another central element in the fourth action pro gramme is the improvement of public access to envi ronmental information. The right to choose is a bul wark of democracy. But it must be an informed choice if it is to be a true choice. That is a point I have under- ",
        "No 2-352/134 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5. 87 Clinton Davis scored repeatedly in debates in this House. More than that, we have actually acted on that precept. For the first time the Commission has published our recom mendations made under Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty. For the first time we have disclosed to the public our reasons for departing from the experts' recommendations, which were made, if you remember last year, in this field as well. The Commission is actively promoting public debate on issues previously considered to be within the exclusive domain of the experts. I cite here the standing conference on nuclear safety. This leads me to Mr Van der Lek's report. Again there is a considerable harmony of view, I suggest, between Parliament and the Commission. I much welcome the philosophy underlying the report and I am pleased to note that he himself applauds in his motion the refer ences to free information and open government con tained in the fourth action programme. He asks the Commission to make new legislative proposals in this field. I can tell him that although great political sensi tivity attends this question, the Commission is studying what proposals might be developed at Community level to enhance access to information. The difficulties here should not be underestimated. Different provisions exist in different Member States. For example, the right of access of European citizens to data held by Community institutions, has not been clearly established. Now recognizing that this is an area where progress should be made, the Commission has instigated a research study of the legislative bases and current practice in all the Member States. The results of that study will be with me quite shortly. I hope, therefore, that Mr Van der Lek will understand if I do not go into this position any further at this stage. We remain very sympathetic to the thrust of what he said. Rules must become more transparent and people must not be denied information, no matter how sensitive or embar rassing that information is, wherever that is possible. A dynamic and successful environmental protection policy is fundamentally a preventive and not a reactive one. That is why we set so much store by our environ mental impact assessment directive, the subject of Mrs Weber's report. It is not just a policy. It is, realist ically, a whole philosophy because it builds environ mental sensitivity into decisions about infrastructural and other developments. In the report she seeks to extend the principle of the environmental impact assessment and holds up for scrutiny a number of provisions in the existing directive where she thinks that improvements must be made. Before I take up some of her specific suggestions, may I say that the principle of the environmental impact assessment is obviously only in its infancy. Our primar}' objective is to oversee a full implementation of the present direc tive which is due to come into force in 1988. But the Commission accepts that you cannot simply leave things there. On that basis alone, I must welcome the opportunity to hear the views of honourable Members as to how this policy can be further developed and nourished. As far as paragraph 3 in the motion is concerned, may I tell Mrs Weber and the House that the Commission will in due course propose an extension of the use of the environmental impact assessment. Our reflections, I am bound to say however, are not yet ripe. As for paragraph 4, relating to projects financed by the Com munity, I am appreciative of the points she makes. I am working now on an appropriate set of procedures to present to my Commission colleagues. As for para graph 6, I do not think that the relevant article should lead to the kind of exemption which would defeat the purposes of the directive. Exemptions are only allowed under certain conditions, and they are monitored by the Commission. Perhaps, finally, I can offer a blanket response to a number of other points she makes by saying that the Commission shortly will be calling a meeting of the relevant officials from Member States to review the present state of implementation and to exchange ideas on possible legislative and administrative improve ments. So in that setting the specific suggestions made in the report will obviously be borne in mind, and naturally Parliament will be informed of the results of that meeting. The last point I want to make is this. I turn to the oral question about the European Year of the Environment put down in the name of Mrs Squarcialupi and others. I hope she will agree that in the course of the speech I have made, I have covered many of the specific points she has alluded to in that question. Others, concerning the progress and the results of the year are perhaps, to coin a phrase from the Minister, a little premature. After all, the year was only launched on 21 March. I trust she will forgive me if I merely say that the year, as I know she believes, represents a unique opportun ity to take public awareness of the dangers faced by our ecosystem to a new level, to encourage the people of Europe to demand the policies that would bring about that European living space to which I referred earlier and through the nurturing of public opinion to isolate those forces which still, myopically, foolishly and selfishly, stand in the way of the progress that our people demand and need. (Applause) COLLINS (S). \u2014 MrPresident, I shall concentrate on the report by Mr Van der Lek on the freedom of envi ronmental information, largely because that report was based on a resolution which was tabled by myself and Mrs Weber some months ago. I should like to thank the rapporteur for the work that has been done and I should like also to thank the ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/135 Collins Commissioner for his assurance that this is an area which is being explored by the Commission at the present time. I think this is an important area of political discussion in the Community because it seems to me that the whole question of secrecy, the deliberate withholding of information by companies and sometimes by public authorities and even governments, not only encour ages inefficiencies and incompetence but it strikes at the very heart of our democratic tradition and our democratic aspirations, by denying citizens access to information about an important area of political dis cussion. I believe that we must sweep the secrecy away and replace it with a commitment to openness, a posi tive legal right to access to information about hazards to health or the environment except where it can be demonstrated that this of course would not be in the public interest. Now we are told by a great many people that this would be bad because it would alarm the public or it would be a charter for extremists or that it would jeo pardize trade secrets. Well of course it is true that much environmental information is technical and com plex. But as the United Kingdom Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution reminded us, there is growing professionalism in many voluntary organiza tions in the environmental field and an ability to eval uate and present technical and scientific reports which compare favourably with those of officially sponsored researchers. These are hardly the words of a bunch of incompetent, irresponsible people. And as for extre mists, is it not true that extremists are much more likely to be able to flourish where there are few facts and where opinion is formed and influenced by The trade secrets argument looks at first glance to be an attractive one. But only at first glance. I think two questions have to be asked: how often, MrPresident, is a so-called trade secret merely a ploy to prevent embarrassing and potentially dangerous revelations of what is really involved? And if information does indeed have commercial value, do we really believe that this should outweigh the need to protect the envi ronment or the health of the public? The fact is that greater disclosure need not produce harmful effects. Steps can be taken to ensure that competitors do not obtain unfair advantage and again, if I may quote the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, the occasions when valuable information about a competi tor has become available in Canada and the United States have been very few and far between. Mr President, greater freedom of information on envi ronmental matters and other matters as well would allow individuals to assess their own situation much more effectively. It would help pollution control auth orities to detect and deal with pollution more effec tively because they would have an informed public on their side. Greater freedom of information would inspire greater confidence in the control authorities themselves, some of which do not inspire great confi dence at the present time. It would also help to raise standards of pollution control and it would prevent irresponsible scare-mongering based on leaks and rumours. These leaks and rumours can only exist in situations where facts are denied and kept secret. It would introduce wider debate into decision-making and thereby stop the polarization of our society into those who control and those who are simply con trolled. It would encourage scientific research by allowing scientists better access to more data more freely provided. Finally, Mr President, freedom of information is the friend of democracy and those who want to see an open free society with an informed and interested population will support Mr Van der Lek's report. But those people in our midst, those people in the Com munity including, I am sad to say, the government that I have suffered in the United Kingdom for the last few years, who have incompetencies to hide, who have dark secrets to protect, who have unsavoury intentions to disguise, will be worried. But in the end, Mr Presi dent, it will be the ideas contained in the Van der Lek report that will triumph! Thank you. (Applause from the left) ALBER (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, may I first of all comment on the Martin report. I should first of all like to congratulate the rap porteur on her excellent and succinct report which we endorse, even in its criticisms which of course are not so strong as the Commissioner has taken them to be. Our criticism is mainly directed at the Council of Mi nisters which is the weakest link in the chain when it comes to environmental policy. (Applause) The trouble starts with the procedures: the Minister said, admittedly correctly, strictly speaking, that a decision has yet to be taken, but in practice the con tent of that decision has already been decided on, so that all we can do now is make some additional com ments on it. But I also blame Parliament for failing to complete its work and for producing a whole series of amendments and explanations of vote, which all tar nish Parliament's image. But what I object to even more is the behaviour of the Council of Ministers which is now saying \u2014 and that is the height of dishonesty \u2014 that although we want more majority decisions to be taken in the future, we still want decisions to be unanimous for everything with financial implications. It is no wonder then that an acceptable compromise is never reached. The programme itself is a welcome one. We particu larly welcome the fact that the Commission has been ",
        "No 2-352/136 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5. 87 Alber implementing an environmental policy since as long ago as 1972, when the word was practically unknown. And I am grateful for that. On the other hand we may well wonder whether a fourth programme was really necessary. It is relatively modest. I am not criticising that fact. It is always sensible to keep one's feet on the ground, but perhaps it would have been wiser simply to continue the third programme rather than heralding in a fourth programme which may well raise too many false hopes. I am thinking particularly of the creation of new jobs, which is certainly possible, but not in overgreat quantities. I endorse the priorities set by Mrs Martin, namely first and foremost education and information, but I think we must also indicate the responsibility of the public and industry for the preservation of the environment, because information alone is not sufficient; they must be forced to act. That it is only way to see results. (Applause) We also welcome the points made on the overall dis posal of waste, on recycling, on the new technologies and on environmental research. But we must start producing results, for some research programmes are spread over fifty years but urgent solutions are needed now; we cannot wait until the 21st century. It is very important to stress the policy of prevention. We must not only cure, but prevent environmental damage from ever happening. That is why it is also very important to incorporate the environmental dimension into other policies. In economics we always have this magic square \u2014 growth, price stability, full employment and external economic balance. I think a fifth should be added to that, namely the natural balance. That is really more important than external economic balance. It is true that life would be worthless without the singing of birds, but we cannot live from the singing of birds alone! If we are blind to everything but the material side of things, if we only see money, then we may well become like King Midas of Phrygia for whom every thing he touched turned to gold and he nearly died of starvation. He later grew donkey's ears, but that is another story. We unfortunately do not grow donkey's ears, we grow tumours and ulcers if we do not behave sensibly. That is why we also need the natural balance. Nature and economics, ecology and economy \u2014 we will only reach a balance if we give everything equal import ance. That is the kind of environmental policy we want to have. (Applause) SHERLOCK (ED). \u2014 I would like to deal first with the report by Mrs Martin, which is the only significant report before us today. I both congratulate and com miserate with our rapporteur. I congratulate her because the report she originally presented to the Environment Committee was both trenchant and pre cise. It did what the Commission had failed to do in its draft programme, namely present a clear set of priori ties for action and political guidance as to how they might best be achieved. I have to commiserate with her because in committee her excellent report underwent the kind of metamorphosis which all too often hap pens when our colleagues, who should be on the benches in front of me, start drafting amendments. As a result, the document now before the House is a long dreary list of ideas from those damned to a lifetime of opposition, few of which are attainable, few of which are desirable and most of which are unenforceable. I will only lend my group's support if we can wipe the lot off. I would incidentally point out to Commis sioner Clinton Davis that the two items he singled out for his principal objection were inserted by his ex-col leagues of what we now call the 'looney left'. The origin of too many of these additions is all too clear when this sort of stale and obsolete philosophy underlines them. Take, for example, the statement in recital D, which says: 'We can no longer pursue the current model of development.' Or paragraph 5, where we are told that 'ever-growing risks to man and the environment are inherent in technical progress.' There is no foundation for this whatsoever in scientific fact or anything else. Typical left-wing lies! There are lies, damned lies and irresponsible lies! You have got the lot! Recital F tells us that environmental policy is ineffec tive due to inadequate funding. What shortage of ideas and insight there must be on the part of those who tabled that amendment. Do they really believe that all environmental problems are solved by throwing tax payers' money at them? It is not the lack of EEC funds which is the cause of Italy's failure to implement the Seveso Directive, is it? It is not lack of funds which explains Belgian failure to implement directives on waste, or Greece's continued non-compliance with the Birds Directive. They are not short of the brass to do it! These failures are caused by the fact that these coun tries attach insufficient importance to the obligations they assume at Community level and by the Commis sion's inability to police them. Paragraph 7 calls for a ban on the production of chemicals for export only. I am glad to see Mrs Smet taking the view that the 157 importing countries in the world have the ability to say for themselves. 'Thank you, we are not buying your ruddy aspirin today'. The wet nursing fraternity, the legislative, the regulatory fraternity which, for some reason or other Commissioner Clinton Davis seems to have embraced, would take a different view. Congra tulations Mrs Smet for this attitude. ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/137 Sherlock But then, if there are no new ideas on development policy, they really do have to fall back upon the old junk, don't they? Strictest possible limits on vehicle emissions and combustion plant. Very easy to achieve, shut down your power stations, lock your car in the garage and go out and collect a handful of twigs to cook your boiled egg for breakfast. If they had at least achieved some sort of passing reference to cost, impact on jobs or industrial competitiveness, we might have a different view. Whose suspicions, the suspicious or the superstitious? Whose are we going to follow in this? These are a few of the more objectionable aspects. I was delighted to see that both Mr Clinton Davis and the Minister took up the Van der Lek idea and the utterly premature view of environmental impact assessment and dismissed both of them with faint praise. There is nothing worse, Mrs Weber \u2014 I don't know how it comes out in German \u2014 than being dis missed with faint praise. I would join in that myself. Environmental impact assessment is a wonderful tool which will enable us to act rather than to react. That view I endorse from my very heart. I endorse the gen eral introductory propositions with which Mr Clinton Davis began. He missed out, alas, motherly love and a second helping of apple pie, but otherwise I am with him the whole way! (Applause from the right) BLOCH VON BLOTTNITZ (ARC). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I feel the previous speaker was referring to me as I was the one who tabled the amendments, and so I should like to ask you to make it clear to the previous speaker that the left does not mean lies, even although they both start with an '1' in my language. That kind of thinking which Mr Sherlock apparently still indulges in is what has brought the environment to this pitiful state. (Applause from the left) DUARTE CENDAN (S). \u2014 (ES) Mr Sherlock comes here behaving like some sort of political 'nouveau riche', giving himself airs and graces because he has won a few more votes over recent years. May I remind Mr Sherlock that the left has been in power, with a popular vote, for decades on this continent, and it still has an absolute majority \u2014 and intends to continue in the same way \u2014 in my country, and still has a working majority in Greece? So, a little more respect for the left would be in order! SQUARCIALUPI (COM). \u2014 (IT) MrPresident, since I am speaking after Mr Sherlock, I think that he will appreciate a quotation from the greatest Italian poet who, in a case such as this, would say: 'Don't bother about him, just look and pass by'. Unfortunately I have not the time to comment on the positive parts of the fourth action programme, and will confine myself to a few criticisms, some of which are contained in my amendments, whilst others will be formulated in the case of specific directives. First of all, the action programme has nothing fresh to say on the nuclear question, that is to say, the question that predominates at this time in our society, whether we look at it from the environmental, energy or public health standpoint. There is a promise to study the problem of waste, when we know full well that it is a problem that cannot be controlled and is not easy to solve. There are other gaps in the approach to the transport problem, which should have tried to put greater emphasis on public transport. I will pass on quickly to biotechnology. Whilst the scientific part is praiseworthy and interesting, the economic part \u00a1eaves something to be desired. There is in fact no examination of the way in which the prod ucers of agro-chemicals and farming enterprises use the results of research. The scientists in fact select strains that are resistent to harmful agents and hence disease. Then, in practice, this resistence is exploited in order to use pesticides in greater quantities. Where agriculture in general is concerned, it is not possible to think we can solve the problem by monitor ing pollution, because that would only be possible through a general policy of prevention. My final point concerns the 'polluter pays' principle, a principle that has remained unchanged for over ten years \u2014 in other words, from when it was introduced for the purpose of remedying damage already done. The concept of prevention and the integration of the environment in all human activity must lead to that principle being superseded, substituting in its place the encouragement of prevention, through financial aid that will help to prevent all forms of pollution; other wise, the price that our society will have to pay will be too high. PEREIRA, Virg\u00edlio (LDR). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, we can allow ourselves some satisfaction at the fact that the European Communities Fourth Environmental Action Programme, 1987-1992, proposed by the Com mission, expressly refers to the need to inform the citi zens of Europe on environmental matters. The van der Lek report deals with this question in great detail, and the Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group agrees that every citizen's right to information should be recognized, and even that legislation should be passed in the Community to ensure that this right is res pected. However, the Liberal and Democratic Refor mist Group considers that some of the proposals put forward in the report are unacceptable and make exaggerated demands. Our group, along with others, wants the availability of information relating to the environment to be unequivocally recognized as a citi- ",
        "No 2-352/138 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Pereira zen's right, in the name of the defence of democracy. But we would also remind you that this same democ racy, which we want to defend, could be challenged or even endangered if all kinds of information, including information relating to the environment, was to be supplied under any circumstances whatever and become public knowledge without any prior assess ment of whether certain fundamental interests of the Community or of a Member States might be at stake. This 'crude' information would have the opposite effect to the one we intended. We cannot accept that the right to information should be extended not only to official documents, but also to internal working documents or reports by third parties, without being examined by the official authorities, as we feel that it may be advisable to keep such documents, or parts of them, confidential at that stage. Is it also really accept able that military installations and projects should, almost without distinction, be open to information gathering and the publication of such information to the general public? It is in everybodys interest to legislate with rather more care in this area. Of course, the Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group understands that there must be definite limits to the right to industrial secrecy relating to the environment, since industries often shelter behind this principle in order to justify doing nothing. This attitude is totally unacceptable. On the other hand, however, our group feels that companies cannot be deprived of the right to confidentiality and to the protection of certain data vital to their survival or competitiveness. It is agreed that such rights should be kept to a strict minimum, and this should not be done lightly. We agree that the disasters at Seveso, Bhopal and Basel all point to the need for greater tran- parency where information on the environment is con cerned. Industrial companies and public authorities should today share an increased awareness of the need to accept a legal system which protects information on the environment. It should be said that the rapporteur forgot that the right to information must be accompa nied by measures for the education of the citizen in environmental matters. The Commission correctly linked these two aspects in the Fourth Programme: the awareness of citizens of the problems involved in the environment is a necessary condition to their use of the right to information. In conclusion, when the Commission asks whether it is necessary or helpful to draw up Community legislation on this question, we should unhesitatingly answer 'yes'. It is also clear that the protection of the environment is an area of increasing importance in the lives of the citizens of Europe, for which reason the 'freedom of information' aspect must be taken into account where legislation is concerned. However, as I said initially, this is a ques tion which must be approached reasonably and realist ically, in order genuinely to serve the cause of the environment and the safeguarding of public health, but without ignoring other equally important aspects of the life of each of our citizens. It is to our regret that most of Mr Van der Lek's conclusions fail to take these concerns into account. BLOCH VON BLOTTNITZ (ARC). \u2014 (DE) First of all, Mr Clinton Davis, thank you very much for your statement that we are all ecologists now because we have to be ecologists! Nevertheless, the action pro gramme before us reminds me of a flower in a button hole. A flower in a buttonhole is very decorative but it does not form a meadow! The programme in front of us contains a very specific list of action to be undertaken. But unfortunately this programme is backed up by so little finance that it cannot form the basis of a proper environmental policy. That is certainly not the fault of the Commis sion \u2014 at least not of the Commission department headed by Mr Clinton Davis \u2014 but it is a fact we can not deny. Neither can we implement an environmental policy until we have a policy of prevention, of prevent ing damage to the environment, until we stop simply repairing the damage after it has been caused, which we do, if at all, on the basis of the lowest common denominator. The time has also long come for us to develop pro grammes with a strategy for waste. We must get away from the habit of using things once and then discard ing them. We must develop programmes for the economic use of chemical and nuclear waste. We have not even started to tackle that properly. I should like to ask the Commission seriously to be more radical and agressive \u2014 not towards us, the Par liament, because we support you and your demands, Mr Clinton Davis, but towards the Council. The Council is the absolute stumbling block for any envi ronmental policy in the Community! That is what is hampering progress! If the Council does not change its attitude, we shall never come to grips with the conti nually growing conflicts between the environment and industry and between man and the world. ANTONY (DR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to discuss the threats to which the environment is exposed, and I do not underesti mate the dangers associated with the methods used in nuclear power generation. I take leave to point out in this connection that, in France, the Front national was expressing concern on this subject from the moment it was first formed and it was as long ago as 1977 that Jean-Marie Le Pen anticipated the possibility of disas ters such as the one that occurred at Chernobyl. But there is another threat, at least as grave, to our nations: the destruction of our agriculture, which per forms a fundamental role, ladies and gentlemen, not only in maintaining a food supply to our peoples but also in the upkeep of our land. In a sound ecological programme, the first priority must be to defend, to ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/139 Antony save our agriculture. And yet it faces the threat of annihilation. For years now, its decline has been prac tically programmed by the European institutions. To begin with, our agriculture is suffering from the misguided decisions taken in the post-war period. Our farmers were urged to produce more and more, encouraged to aim for the highest possible productiv ity. The Third World, whose population was expand ing all the time, would absorb everything they could produce, they were told. Hence the unreasonable expansion of chemical farming, the result of which has been that increasing volumes of fertilizer have been needed year by year to replenish exhausted soil, much to the delight of the chemical multinationals but to the detriment of consumers, who are getting to the point of no longer being able to discern the real taste of things. Worst of all, though, the illusion of available outlets was sustained. The Third World was after all emerging, as the process of decolonization went for ward. Here we must have the courage to look the facts in the face. Decolonization was in many cases cata strophic; in some instances, the haste and lack of pre paration with which it was imposed were enough to put it in the category of crimes against humanity. Entire peoples were delivered up to anarchy, to civil and tribal warfare, to dictatorship by irresponsible nomenklaturas, to all-pervading nepotism, to infinite prevarication. So it was that although some countries were lucky enough, thanks to their leaders' wisdom, to remain on friendly terms with the former colonial powers, the others absorbed nothing from the West but the poisonous ideologies of its irresponsible 'intelligent sias' and consignments from its arms dealers. Consequently, because it is unable to attract solvent investment from Europe, Africa, which is itself prod ucing less and less as a result of the aberrations of its socialist agricultural policies, is far from being in any position to buy from us. Our stockpiles go on accumu lating, and we go on wondering how to dispose of them. Our agriculture is wasting away as a result of the countless violations of the principles of the Treaty of Rome and the common agricultural policy. These principles were Community preference, price-fixing at fair levels, and support for our farmers' incomes. We all know of the competition to which our farmers are being exposed, with the establishment by stealth of worldwide free trade which is putting them in a posi tion of disadvantage against producers with lower wage costs and overheads, and often in the face of outright dumping. Thirdly, our agriculture, along with small trade, is being squeezed by the economic dictatorship of the supermarkets. France is now the country with most supermarkets. And there are three large purchasing combines which are imposing their own buying prices so that they can \u2014 initially \u2014 bring down their selling prices. But the result is that, despite the apparent diversity of products and labels, everything is being brought down to the same level of mediocrity. In my own d\u00e9partement of the Tarn, once renowned for its excellent charcuterie, today's hams, made from hastily produced meat, rapidly and chemically pro cessed, are to those of yesteryear what a fish-farm carp is to a proper river trout. And why is this? Because the supermarkets impose their prices on the curers, and they in turn do likewise to the farmers. Exposed to the ruthless law of ill-regulated competi tion, the farmers are therefore becoming poorer and poorer, and their numbers are inevitably declining at ever-increasing speed year by year. And yet the con sumer never sees any fall in prices. Fourthly, our agriculture is being stifled by bureaucra tization, collectivism and socialism. Between 1947 and 1987 the number of farm holdings in France has fallen from nearly five million to below one million. During the same period the number of Ministry of Agriculture civil servants has risen from 15 000 to 135 000. And who could fail to realize that what is achieved by the whole edifice of aid to agriculture in France is not so much the organization of funding, progress and con tinued stability for farmers and their holdings as the perpetuation of its much-vaunted structures, which are nothing but parasites living off the energy of our farm ing community. The resources of the various national, regional and departmental funds are used to finance the cumbersome cooperatives, which are generally costly to operate and often run at a loss. The ecologi cal consequence of all this is that in my country, France, the number of farmers will be halved over the coming quarter of a century if the current trend con tinues. The problem of the upkeep of land, arable and graz ing, especially in the mountain areas and the Mediter ranean region, has become acute. Villages large and small are dying. And then it is that other people come along, people for whom a self-sufficient way of life, something akin to that of our peasant farmers of the early part of the century, is the ultimate dream. I see no progress there, unless it be the spread to the rural world of the difficulties that immigration by people who are not readily assimilable engenders. But here again the French right wing will be accused of raising problems without offering solutions. That is not true, because there are remedies for this illness which could otherwise prove fatal to our agriculture and our socie ties generally. Let me tell you what they are, one by one. First, a Eurafrican policy, based on support for our friends, not for our enemies, the establishment of sound trade relations with countries returning to peace and prosperity. That would boost our agricultural exports. ",
        "No 2-352/140 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Antony Secondly, strict application of the principles of the Treaty of Rome and a redefinition of the common agricultural policy based on a ban on imports into the Community of products in which we already have a surplus, promotion of produce of high quality, with a system of quality-labelling so that farmers who prod uce real food would not be put on the same footing as those who settle for turning out scarcely edible sub stances. Thirdly, a vigorous policy aimed at bringing down farmers' overheads, for instance by reducing the VAT rate on fuel and equipment. Fourthly, a policy of direct aid to free associations of producers rather than to cooperatives. Fifthly, the provision of loans to farmers at subsidized, non-usurious rates of interest. Sixthly, a policy of support and fair treatment for small traders, who have been put under too much of a handicap by the fiscal, banking and commercial facili ties enjoyed by supermarkets. There is one great economic power, ladies and gentle men, which has had the good sense to maintain such principles for the benefit of its farmers and small trad ers, and its whole population is better off as a result. Japan is prepared to pay its rice growers five times above the world price for their crops, and there are also, proportionally, five times more small traders and craftsmen in this country than there are in mine. Granted, the Japanese appreciate that the first duty of leaders is to look ahead and even to anticipate the worst, in the hope that it will not materialize. In the event of a crisis, or even a war, what would become of a Europe which had abandoned the land? Better not to think of that, comes the reply from the irresponsible people who have our future in their hands. IN THE CHAIR: MR CLINTON Vice-President WEBER (S), rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) I am glad that a col league who normally takes little part in our discussions has spoken in this debate on the environment. I was even very pleased to see him present here, but perhaps, Mr President, you would be good enough to explain to him that this is a debate on the environment. I already knew that the European Right is rather slow on the uptake, but that it is so slow as not to realise that the debate on agriculture is over is somewhat strange. (Applause) ULBURGHS (NI). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I support the tenor of the different reports from the Committee on the Environment. As is stressed in the Single Act, the internal market must not be allowed to lead into a downward spiral of environmental standards. On the contrary, environmental standards ought to be levelled out in an upward direction by being made even more stringent. For the ecological time-bombs that are lying in wait for us, buried in the soil, lurking in nuclear power plants, mean that it is essential for us to have a precise and urgent environment programme. What we never want to see again is the authorities always, or nearly always, reacting too late and requir ing some disaster or other before they recover their concern for the environment, and then only under pressure from public opinion. As the saying goes, prevention is always better than cure. For that reason it is important to make a choice of production goods that favours environment-con serving technologies. A new leading-edge technology should not be accepted just because it is new, or because of the scientific research that went into it, or because it creates new jobs, important though that undoubtedly is in itself, or because it brings high short-term profits. There are a good many questiona ble features to weapons technology and nuclear power, for example. Should we welcome the produc tion of poisonous chemicals, even allowing that they have had their part to play in the green revolution in India? I agree with Mrs Smet that we must not automatically export our poisonous and environmentally damaging products to the Third World. But that presupposes that we in the rich industrialized North will have the courage to enter into equitable trade relations with the Third World, relations that will give them some hope of rapid development and an end to hunger, instead of being tempted into maintaining environment-polluting industries that we no longer want at home but are content to export to them. The important thing for us will be to develop an ecological economy. Ecology and economy should go hand in hand. In the future they will have to survive together or sink together. The ecological economy must be expanded so that the pri mary products that are so important and so necessary to our survival do not go on being polluted any longer. What could be more important to us than water? Without water we could not survive for more than a day or two. Yet we see the very water that we know is so important and so precious being relentlessly con taminated all over the world. Where are the rivers, streams or lakes that are still clean? What is more important than the air? We could not survive for more than a few minutes without air. The air is being pol luted everywhere, and at an insane pace. What is more important than the soil? It is from the soil that we get our subsistence, and it is to the soil that we owe our survival. ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/141 Ulburghs The fact that environment policy is specifically included in the Single Act is to be welcomed, but that must also be put into practice in reality. We have had enough of fine-sounding resolutions. I therefore sup port most of the recommendations that are contained in the different reports. I call for particular considera tion to be given to stricter sanctions against uncooper ative Member States that will not implement the envi ronment directive, and I welcome the apt proposals that the President, Mrs Smet, set has out today. I agree with her that where Belgian environment policy in particular is concerned greater strictness at ecologi cal level is a vital necessity. I hope there will not be the same story as with her pre decessor, who, as we have already been reminded this morning, made fine-sounding declarations as Presi dent of the Council but did not or could not imple ment them, even as a matter of domestic policy. The ozone layer is getting thinner and thinner, and over Antarctica there is already a hole in it the size of the United States. It will be totally unacceptable for the EEC to go down in history as the worst perpetrator of the greenhouse effect \u2014 if there is anyone left to read the history, that is. Prevention is better than cure, so let us choose environment-conserving technologies. Public opinion must be kept informed, ecological awareness on the part of public and governments must be worked for, together with equitable and ecologi cally responsible trade with the Third World. The ecological problem is a social and moral problem that must be solved by Europe. ANTONY (DR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I am not pre pared to have my motives questioned in that way by Mrs Weber, and return her compliments. PRESIDENT. \u2014 You are totally out of order, Mr Antony. ANTONY (DR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I had to reply to an insult, and I do so in the appropriate manner, since Mrs Weber, for all her great wisdom, is not going to lay down the law to this House. . . VITTINGHOFF (S). \u2014 (DE) MrPresident, ladies and gentlement, on behalf of some of my colleagues I should like to make a preliminary remark. We are happy to welcome the President of the Council of Environment Ministers in our midst today. This is not an everyday occurrence, and I interpret this as a good omen for the Council's cooperation in the future with Parliament and also for the future of the environment policy. May I right at the outset state on behalf of the Social ist Group that we welcome both the Commission's fourth action programme on environmental protection and Mrs Martin's report, and we shall vote in favour of the report which was accepted unanimously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. This does not mean that we have no criticisms what soever to make of the action programme. The action programme is extremely important, coming as it does, at a time, when industrial risks are constantly on the increase and when the risks for the rest of the environ ment are taking on unimaginable proportions, as we see in many areas. This explains why public concern about the environment is also growing. Secondly, public attention is focusing on the Com munity's environmental protection activities particu larly in this European Year of the Environment. And finally, the realisation of the internal market planned for 1992, and this is an important point to my mind, will mean that more measures will be decided on to protect the environment. There has even been a change for the better in the basic concept of environmental protection in the Com munity since the third action programme, in that envi ronmental requirements are already being taken into consideration at the planning and implementation stage of projects. Unfortunately, actual successes have been few and far between. But nonetheless, it is a basic precondition for coming to grips with environmental problems and preventing their occurrence. We are therefore pleased to see top priority being given in this action programme by the Commission to preventive measures to protect the environment. We also welcome the fact that people realise that environ mental protection does not mean the loss of jobs, but quite on the contrary it has a positive effect on job creation. This is particularly important in view of the fact that we have more than 16 million people out of work in the Community. That is a very special prob lem. We therefore support the Commission's intention to have a Community programme for demonstration pro jects to create new jobs through environmental protec tion actions. We would criticise the Commission, however, for fail ing to produce an account of earlier action pro grammes and so for failing to present facts relevant to the implementation of the fourth action programme, for undoubtedly lessons could have been learned from the past. We have compiled a list of requirements for the imple mentation of this action programme. Firstly: we need detailed information.on environmen tal policies and the involvement of the general public at all levels. Secondly: we must work out the resultant costs of not taking environmental protection measures and com- ",
        "No 2-352/142 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5. 87 Vittinghoff pare them with the cost of doing so, to show clearly that preventive protection measures are considerably more cost effective. Thirdly: industrial firms should be obliged to train their staff continually on the environmental hazards of their products, production processes or their industrial waste, so that employees in these firms also develop a different understanding for environmental protection. Fourthly: it is essential to set up environmental advi sory centres for small and medium-sized firms. Fifthly: we call on the Council to promise to take its proposals and decisions on the environment in cooper ation with the European Parliament and to apply the rule of the qualified majority, instead of blocking issues by unanimous voting, as is threatened since the last Council decision. Sixthly: we want the principle of 'the polluter pays' to be applied consistently and stronger sanctions to be taken against those in breach, especially the Member States. Seventhly: we want this action programme to be implemented systematically with effective supervision of adherence to the relevant directives. Finally, I call on all concerned \u2014 Parliament, Com mission and Council \u2014 to give proper priority to the protection of the environment and to act in future in such a way that where there is any doubt, the benefit of the doubt should always be given to the environ ment! SCHLEICHER (EPP). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Year of the Environ ment presents us with an opportunity for action. But let there be no misunderstanding, please! The Group of the European People's Party sees the environmental impact assessment as an important development in environmental protection. But Mrs Weber, the period for incorporating the environmental impact assessment into national legislation has not yet expired, and you are already calling for changes. There is simply no point in getting Parliament worked up and intervening in a legislative process which is underway. The Com mission has no intention of fulfilling your demands, and quite rightly too. The Commission can only inter ven after the legal period has expired. We shall have to wait for that to happen, whether we like it or not. For that reason my group cannot support your report. This unusual procedure of an interim report suggests that the relevant parties here do not have honourable intentions, but no evidence has been produced to that effect. For me it is quite clear that if one wants to build up confidence, then one must break down distrust. And we urgently need trust for the protection of the environment. It is essential that we have maximum openness and information, but I wonder whether the kind of obligation to provide information at the Euro pean level, as laid down in the Van der Lek report, can be settled by legal regulations. Reference is constantly being made to American legis lation, to the Freedom of Information Act. The Ameri can legislation in no way says that all documents should be published. It permits a summary opinion on the basis of the documents made available by industry. If a manufacturer has classified available documents as confidential, then the authorities may not include them in the summary. But there is continual argument between the authorities and industry as to the classifi cation of confidentiality. This argument can even be taken to the courts. Any party, both the relevant industry and the interested citizen, can object to the authority's decision. The authority is obliged to answer the charges. But generally the argument about confidentiality is settled between the authority and the relevant industry. And that, to my mind, is the basis for the environmen tal impact assessment. It is erroneous to maintain, as is constantly being done here in the European Parlia ment and in the Committee on Environment, that it is usual on the basis of this Freedom of Information Act to make all documents without reservation available for anyone to inspect. I cannot help feeling that in our Parliament and in the political discussions outside two different yardsticks are being used. In the Committee on Environment, for example, my amendment was rejected with the argument that it did not correspond to the data protection in our national legislations. On the other hand, however, the call becomes stronger for more openness in industry and bureau cracy. In my country steps are being planned to boycott an existing law with reference to the census with the argument that it would regulate too many details of the obligation to provide information. But how can a law be implemented in the long run if there is no obli gation to provide information. That is why I think we must see things from two angles. There is not yet much joint political will in Europe to protect the envi ronment. Let us help by finding first of all what we have in common and then really making some pro gress in environmental protection. If we go into such detail as is being called for here in the obligation to provide information, then we shall not make any headway in environmental protection issues. SELIGMAN (ED). \u2014 Mr President, after 7 1/2 years in this Parliament I have been converted like St Paul on the road to Damascus to a belief that environmen tal considerations are just as important as economic ones, as the Commissioner has said. Nowadays people do not simply want to earn a living, they want a better quality of life. In trying to raise the standard of living of people all over the world, we must not destroy the ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/143 Seligman quality of life of future generations. That is why I am disappointed that Mrs Martin's draft resolution con tains not a single mention of conservation or preserva tion of endangered species, nor did the President-in- Office, Mrs Smet, mention endangered species or the Washington Conference. In a non-caring world many species are being snuffed out and will never be seen again, except as fossils. Yet Commissioner Clinton Davis, in his list of priorities, did not even mention preservation or conservation, of such species. Fortunately, Mrs Heinrich, in the opi nion of the Committee on Development and Coopera tion, strongly supported the conservation of flora and fauna. As examples of this, I should like to highlight the request for modest financial support for a project to establish a 200-mile whale sanctuary around the Portuguese Azores islands. Also, tomorrow the Ani mal Welfare Inter-Group will be discussing with the Hunting Inter-Group the whole question of the des truction of endangered species of birds within the Community. The European Parliament has led the world in caring for the environment and we succeeded in including a large sum of money in the 1986 budget for conserva tion of flora and fauna. I hope the Commissioner will be able to tell us today or soon how this money is being used \u2014 if indeed it is being used \u2014 and on what projects, and what staff he has to promote this vital area of environmental conservation. The Parliament will be pleased to note in the gallery today Mrs Joan Felthouse, Chairman of the Council of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. She will be attending tomorrow's Animal Welfare Inter-Group. Through her I think we should thank the RSPCA for being one of the first organiza tions to realize the importance of the European dimension by providing, before anyone else, the funds to get the animal welfare Euro-group off the ground. Parliament should be congratulated now in taking up the baton by voting adequate funds to maintain and develop Europe's activities in the conservation of endangered species. What an excellent Parliament we LE ROUX (COM). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, environ mental policy ought to be regarded as an essential aspect of economic and social activity, but as yet this has not been the case, mainly because the multination als and businessmen with, assistance from govern ments, have all too often acted strictly according to the profit criterion, showing little concern for people's health and their environment. But public opinion is now becoming more alive to these matters. Following the industrial disasters that have done such damage to the environment, in some cases causing loss of life, every opportunity to reduce risks and pollution offered by advanced science and technology must be exploited and developed. From this viewpoint, Mrs Martin's report rightly stresses that the Commis sion's programme is singularly lacking in ambition. What is needed is a policy of transparency of informa tion on all hazardous forms of production. Arrange ments must be made for democratic monitoring by workers, elected representatives and citizens living near high-risk plants. The veil of secrecy, which is sup posed to protect confidential production methods but is used to conceal the worst excesses, must be lifted. It is our view that the Community should foster the wid est international cooperation in order to help find solutions to the complex problems facing our countries today. Allow me to give a couple of examples to illus trate the relationship between economic development, employment and the environment. Studies have shown that recycling industrial waste could rapidly create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the Community; 80% of this waste could be recycled, and it would be cost-effective for 50% of it. This economic option entails replacing the current profit criteria with new criteria taking account of social cost-effectiveness. Similarly, instead of investing to exploit the scope offered by biotechnology for the development of non-toxic pesticides, firms like Sandoz are happy to export products banned in the Community to the Third World. The environment is also a matter of economic and political options, and I would add that the money spent on producing more and more nuclear weapons would be well invested in protecting our shared natural heritage. We will support Mrs Martin's report which criticizes the shortcomings in the Com mission's programme and proposes practical guidelines for the environment. GARCIA (LDR). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, colleagues, environmental questions are currently uppermost in our minds. This is no coincidence nor is it simply the result of political factor. These questions represent a clear response from society, particularly from young people to a type of progress and wealth which, just like the rose, has its fair share of thorns. This makes the reports which we are discussing today very impor tant. Of the three reports by Mrs Martin, Mrs Weber and Mr Van der Lek, the one most closely related to the Fourth Community Environmental Programme is of particular importance, since it sets the course for the action which over the next few years may or may not give some future to the ecological awareness of the people of Europe and, above all, protect the lives of those who are still to come. From a general point of view, the Martin report pre fers to concentrate priority guidelines on certain types of action. They are divided into seven groups (no sig nificance, I hope, in that number, which might remind us of the seven plagues of Egypt!) and, without deny ing the importance which some of them bear, it would perhaps have been preferable to concentrate the priori ties still further since the financial resources available are scarce, and ecological research or other action will be correspondingly reduced. We only have to look at ",
        "No 2-352/144 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Garcia what has happened \u2014 and is still happening \u2014 with the scientific and technological research projects under the Draft Scientific Research Programme. In our opi nion, the chief efforts should be directed towards edu cation and information, since solid preparation for the future always ensures maximum progress with regard to Community legislation and penalties for transgres sors. Whether we like it or not, Community Europe must, sooner or later, have a common policy in this sector: a strategy for waste, particularly radioactive waste, including reference to deposits at sea and the problems involved in dismantling nuclear power sta tions \u2014 a problem which certain circles are trying to cover up, but which is bound to become increasingly topical over the next few years \u2014 and lastly, the development of non-pollutant technology, a vast area ranging from alternative methods to replace the use of chemical pesticides in agriculture to wind and solar energy. I just want to say a few words about the Weber report on environmental impact studies and the Van der Lek report on access to information. The first draws atten tion to the importance of proper assessment of options and technological risks. Prevention is always better than cure. With regard to information, there is little to add except that there can never be a proper environ mental policy without free access to data, without democratic freedom, which must have responsible lim its placed on it in the common interest. PEGADO LIZ (RDE). \u2014 (PT) MrPresident, col leagues, when there is so little time to speak, and such an important subject as the environment to speak about, a choice has to be made between uttering bland generalities or concentrating on just two or three key points. I would prefer to follow the second course, in order to bring out those aspects which the programme from the Committee on the Environment left aside, in particular the need for a clear establishment of priorities for act ion by areas of social impact, as Mrs Martin's report quite rightly proposes. I also wish, however, to express my basic agreement with the broad lines of the pro gramme. One point which ought to be emphasized in this regard is the interdependent nature of the various Community policies and their effects on the environ ment, which requires a new attitude towards the ecol ogical balance, taking due account of rural planning, the protection of forests and the preservation of open spaces, the consequences of uncontrolled urbaniza tion, the siting of industrial zones, ways of reducing the effects of desertification and so on. Another basic element is that the right to information on the environment should be interpreted in its widest sense, really providing individuals and groups with the means to participate in the formulation and implemen tation of environmental policy, establishing a constant flow of information between the bodies competent for such policies and the citizens towards whom they are directed. I would cite the recent Portuguese legislation on the environment as an instance of this. It is to Mr Van der Lek's credit that he has stressed the need at Community level for the right to information in such a sensitive area as the environment. The aim is to prevent assaults on the environment, such as the one being planned on my country's northern border, where the Spanish authorities intend to build a storage facility for radioactive waste from taking place without the prior knowledge of the populations directly con cerned, and without them having a chance to react appropriately. Therefore, I give my full support to Mr Van der Lek's motion for a resolution, regarding the preparation of a Community directive on this question. Lastly, we should lose no opportunity to express how important it is that the principal by which those who damage the environment are held accountable for their actions should be strengthened, in order to make them assume the full responsibility for the consequences of their actions and omissions regarding natural resources. ROELANTS DU VIVIER (ARC). \u2014 (FR) The Euro pean Community action programme on the environ ment is an essential instrument, for use by the Com mission, by the Council, and by Parliament. That is why the Environment Committee of our Parliament adopted it by a substantial majority. Consequently, Madam President of the Council, it is all the more dif ficult to understand why the Council adopted a reso lution informally establishing, as it is modestly put, this action programme, but if I have understood you correctly, you said that you were prepared to hold fur ther discussions on this resolution on the basis of the opinion we adopt. Have I understood you correctly, and could you tell us what action you are thinking of taking on the basis of my proposal? A second point. I wish to ask the Commission whether it is prepared to draw up a review, as requested by the Environment Committee, of the previous programmes \u2014 the first, second and third programmes \u2014 by the end of this year. I should also like to say this to the Commissioner: you have not failed in your duty as guarantor of the Treaties, but the Environment Com mittee is asking you, Mr Commissioner, to find more effective ways of imposing sanctions on recalcitrant Member States. Could you please give us some details on this? AVGERINOS (S). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the Com munity's Fourth Environmental Action Programme ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/145 Avgerinos has been prepared by the Commission at a time when the Community is taking far-reaching decisions on its own future. 30 years had to pass before laws were laid down, in the Single Act, to protect the environment. We are all aware of the difficulties which its imple mentation presents, but they must be overcome if there is to be any hope of balanced development for all. In this spirit, we all understand which are the areas of interest, the chief one among them certainly being environmental protection, which is in turn directly linked to the question of health. This year has been declared the Year of the Environ ment, but our efforts are not limited to that alone. The fourth programme identifies and proposes a series of actions for the next six years to meet the environmen tal crisis which Europe is today facing. As a general principle, protection is of particular sig nificance to the environment, in both its social and economic dimensions. Any upset to the environmental balance entails considerable damage, particularly when the seas are concerned. Action for the protection of the sea is especially important. The sea which is one of the most sensitive living habitats, particularly when enclosed, is being deprived of the possibility of rene wal, and being destroyed by the ever larger discharges of waste products. For those of us living on the shores of the Mediterra nean, the sea environment is the dominant factor in the equilibrium between social and economic factors. As you all know, as a closed sea, unable to replenish itself, without major rivers flowing into it but over loaded with shipping and discharges of industrial waste, a zone in which tourism never ceases to expand, and suffering from criminally destructive fish ing methods, the Mediterranean is now at the limits of its endurance: alarm bells are already ringing. The increased level of pollution is the consequence of many years of exclusively economically orientated development. This indifference towards the marine environment has changed the visible aspects of the Mediterranean's biological character, with the disap pearance of many forms of marine life, and has of course brought about a corresponding deterioration in the quality of life in many coastal regions. The Medi terranean should be the first target for correction by swift action from the Commission, the Council, and the Member States of southern Europe. Another aspect of similar importance which I would like to mention is the tackling of cross-border pollu tion, wherever it may originate. We tend to think of our own country as occupying a special position, in that it has no common border with any other Com munity country. We therefore feel that the Com munity both should and can, through negotiation, resolve this question with third countries. In closing, Mr President, I should like to express our general satisfaction with the Fourth Action Pro gramme, and to stress that the solution of these prob lems must be included as one of the aims of the struc tures it mentions. PEUS (EPP). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, my group supports the main thrust of the Van der Lek report on making available greater informa tion to the public on environmental issues. We also support the Commission's aim of making, under the Corvet system, comparable systematic data on the environment available to firms, those active in the economy and politicians. My group also welcomes the fact that central to the European Year of the Environ ment should be better information to the public which will bring about a change in their behaviour, so that a well-informed public will participate fully in decisions concerning the environment. But we must also acknowledge what is already being done, and the Van der Lek report makes scant men tion of this. Let us take the example of my own coun try. The Federal Environment Office in Berlin regis ters annually about one hundred thousand applications from the public. The general public, politicians and economists can get detailed information via the BTX computer system. The information system Umplis, which links a series of data banks, is available not only to politicians but also the general public. Anyone with specialized questions can approach a specialized department. The Environment Office provides the public with information at consumer fairs, at exhibi tions, and it also has a speakers' service. The Federal States have already set up information services for the public in the ministries, and the 'green telephones' in towns have already proved their worth as a source to turn to as part of the 'Environment Conservation'. The public does not merely ask questions, but also makes suggestions for action. We really must acknow ledge publicly what is already being done. Further more, there are joint trade cooperative associations composed equally of employees and employers which also issue directives and instructions for the proper use of products. But the Van der Lek report calls for considerably more. I shall not repeat the points which have already been sufficiently rehearsed. Everyone wants access to all relevant information on the environment. Not even military secrets should be.excluded. It should cover not just published documents but all incomplete work ing documents and material passed on by third parties. This will not systematically improve the environment. It is much more important to improve safety installa tions. Dangerous chemicals should be withdrawn from circulation and replaced with better products. The regulation on dangerous substances should be pub lished, as is planned. There should be a systematic review of the legislation on the environment and envi ronmental responsibility. And the competent auth- ",
        "No 2-352/146 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5. 87 Peus orities in particular must be given the right to demand from firms that their analyses should be checked by independent third parties. This kind of check is undoubtedly much more effective than only a check by environment organizations; we are not in any way suggesting that these organizations are insignificant, but they are springing up all over the place like mush rooms, and with many of them it is impossible to say if they really have the ecological interests of the broad majority of the population at heart. A final point is that environmental protection cannot be carried out against industry but only with its coop eration. It is quite simple. Industry has acted. The chemical industry alone has in the last ten years entered into thirty voluntary commitments, such as the reduction of solvents, etc. We cannot do without this initiative of industry itself. It has considerably increased its expenditure on environmental protection. In 1971 they spent DM 9.200 million, in 1983 that had already increased to DM 20.000 million. I think that we should recognize all this, and no pur pose is served by questioning and criticizing self-regu lation and industry's voluntary cooperation with interest associations, trades unions, science and the public authorities, nor by criticizing them more than the checks carried out by environmental organizations. EVERSEN (COM). \u2014 (DA) Mr President, it is grati fying to note that policy on the environment has now been given its own place in the amended Treaty of Rome, and we agree that environmental protection should be geared to a high level of protection. We also welcome Lord Plumb's statement when, on his recent visit to Denmark as President of Parliament, he said that the amended Treaty of Rome did not of course prevent individual Member States from going further than Community legislation, regardless of the interests of the internal market. It is however disappointing that recognition of the enormous environmental problems faced by the EC countries and the world at large has not made more of a mark on the Commission's proposal for a pro gramme of action on the environment. There is the recurring argument that concern for the Community's competitive position depends on the producers' ability to meet high environmental standards, that there are jobs to be created etc. There is even talk of developing evaluation methods involving cost-benefit analyses as a basis for proposals in the environmental field. But, Commissioner, how can you carry out cost-benefit analyses on the extinction of animal and plant species? For us concern for the environment takes precedence over economic interests and over the concern for jobs. In that connection we support the harsh criticism lev elled by the Martin report against the Commission's plan of action for the environment, and Parliament must say to the Commission as plainly as possible that concern for the environment takes precedence over profit interests in all circumstances. ANDREWS (RDE). \u2014 Mr President, I would like to congratulate the three rapporteurs on their excellent reports and to pay tribute to Commissioner Clin ton Davis, who in my opinion is among the best of the Commissioners on all issues in his portfolio \u2014 particu larly environment. I want to thank him for the cour tesy he has always shown me and other Members. The reports highlight the need to increase public awareness of the fundamental right to a clean environ ment and of our duty to ensure that every reasonable effort is made to protect it. At present, many citizens of this Community are prepared to sit back and watch their surroundings being harmed or destroyed. This widespread indifference negates the effectiveness of much environmental legilsation. Positive action is required to inform the public of their rights and obli gations and also to convince them that the environ ment exists not only for them but also for future generations. The action required has been launched by the Com munity through its campaign to show that individual efforts can be significant as an essential part of the process. However, the present interest in the environ ment will not continue to grow unless it is fed the information necessary for the individual to assess the quality of his own environment and surroundings. At present, updated information on the environment is difficult to obtain. Much of it is either shrouded in a cloak of unnecessary secrecy or else hidden among mounds of unintelligible, technical data. The informa tion should, therefore, be easily accessible, current and easily understood. I wanted to say a lot more, but I shall conclude by referring to an issue of great concern to myself, the Irish people and, indeed, the British people. That is the issue of Sellafield. This installation still remains open today because British Nuclear Fuels, with the collusion of the British Tory Government, have successfully managed to fool the majority of the British people as to the horrific dangers to which they are exposed. If there were full access to information concerning the environmental impact of Sellafield, it would have been closed long ago. The Irish people are aware of these dangers and will not rest easy until this threat no lon ger exists. My colleagues and I will continue to impress on Parliament the dangers of Sellafield and the overwhelming need for its closure. Finally, I never had the opportunity of putting this on record, so I want to congratulate you on your election as Vice-President. CHRISTENSEN (ARC). \u2014 (DA) Mr President, this excellent report gives us a glimpse of the glaring con trast between words and deeds in the Community. The report is critical of the squandering of raw materials and energy, but the reality is that the countryside is being pillaged, a process which the Community's agri- ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/147 Christensen cultural policy favours through over-fertilization and the use of pesticides. The report calls for US standards to combat air pollution, while at the same time the eleven other Member States and the Commission are putting pressure on Denmark to accept much lower Community standards. The Community regulations must not be allowed to influence more stringent rules in certain countries, it says in the report. But the real ity is that Denmark is threatened with proceedings in the Court of Justice, if we seek to prohibit brain-dam aging solvents and to label carcinogenic sub stances. The report demands the institution of mea sures on mere suspicion, but the Commission evidently wants things to lie on the table before it acts. It is shameful that the reality in the Community is so dif ferent to the provisions called for in this splendid report. BOMBARD (S). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, Madam Min ister, I wish to sound a note of alarm. It is about a number of steel drums containing yperite, the mustard gas used in the 1914-1918 war but happily not in the Second World War, dumped in the North Sea and the Bay of Biscay. I have been charged by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection with reporting on the possible recovery of these steel drums, which are slowly rusting at the bot tom of the sea. To do this, it is necessary to know their location, their number and the feasibility of recovering them. So I turned first of all to my own country, France, to find out where this yperite, mustard gas waste had been dumped. I knew it was in the Bay of Biscay. I was told that this was a 'defence secret'. When I tried to get round this, I was told first of all that my facts were wrong, that there had been no such dumping, and then, when there was no getting away from the truth of the matter, the 'defence secret' argu ment was brought out again. I then approached other governments, notably the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. I was told that nothing was known about this matter. Later, I was regretfully told that it was a defence Mr Pereira was saying just now that defence secrets had to be protected. Mrs Peus has also spoken of de fence secrets. I therefore have some questions to ask. These drums are slowly rusting. One day they will break open. One day the mustard gas will be released into the sea. One day the sea will be polluted by this highly toxic chemi cal which has been lying there for many years. Have the armed forces no information to offer? Is Mr Van der Lek's report going to persuade the armed forces to break their secrecy? We hear a lot of talk about indus trial secrets, much less about defence secrets. Is it too much to ask the armed forces to align themselves with the laws that we all have to live by, and thereby enable us to avoid pollution which would be irremediable if these drums of mustard gas are not found and enable me to write this report, which I cannot do at present because I lack'the necessary information? BANOTTI (PPE). \u2014 Mr President, as a member of the Environment Committee I am going to make Mr Clinton Davis' day by praising him as well. His lyrical litany of our hopes for the future \u2014 clean air, pure water and uncontaminated earth \u2014 is a just and wonderful blueprint for the future. The negative side of this is, unfortunately, the environmental burden of the past and as we face this brave new world envisaged by Mr Clinton Davis, we still have to shoulder and redress this burden. He very rightly points the finger to where the real res ponsibility for this redress lies, namely in our own backyards. I would also like to take this opportunity to praise Mrs Smet. When she first came to the Environ ment Committee to speak to us, we all immediately recognized that we had a passionate and committed Minister on our side, and her achievements during the six months have amply proved this. I am very glad also that the Commissioner paid particular tribute to her term of office as chairman of the Environment Coun cil. It has been said already today that prevention is undoubtedly better than cure. This new environment programme emphasizes, above all, the importance of more stringent measures to protect our natural resources. I would like to reassure Mr Sherlock that we do not all believe that progress is necessarily a bad thing. However, there is no doubt that in the past ignorance and, often, wanton disregard for the envi ronmental consequences of industrial, agricultural or energy policies have all contributed to the alarming destruction of the natural resources of the Com munity. My own country, Ireland, has so far mercifully been saved from this destruction largely because the quality of the environment in Ireland is generally very high and not because of any particular virtue on our part. The country is not heavily industrialized or overpopu- lated and conflicting uses of the environment are kept reasonably apart. We do have some environmental problems, particularly water pollution in certain areas and air pollution in our cities where we continue to burn coal in our domestic fires. The commitment of the Commission to dealing with toxic waste in the future will have to be expressed, I am afraid, in more pungent terms. The destruction and disposal of toxic waste remains one of the most serious and intractable problems that we still face in many of our countries. Mr Andrews has referred to the concern in my country about the infamous Sellafield plant. I would like to see a stronger commitment to nuclear safety as part of the Commissioner's programme. Why, Mr Clinton Davis, is there no reference, even as ",
        "No 2-352/148 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Banotti a pious aspiration, to our famous European inspection force for nuclear plants? Finally, I would like to say a few words about our famous Irish bogs. In fact, for centuries these bogs were a symbol of our poverty and it is only in the very recent past that we have begun to realize and appre ciate the enormous richness we possess in our bogs and their priceless environmental advantage. Indeed, some of the great champions of our bogs are here in Parliament. Everyone in Europe wants to save our bogs and so do we. Ireland is unique in Europe in still possessing a variety of peatland biotopes. The cost of conserving peatland is quite substantial and it is unrealistic to expect Ireland alone within the Com munity to bear the full financial burden of conserving them when other Member States have already bene fited economically from exploiting their own peat- lands. For this reason, we welcome the Commission's constructive approach in widening their description of threatened habitats to include peatland and bogs for future financial assistance from the environment fund and for what we hope will be financial assistance to conserve our bogs, not just for ourselves, but for the whole Community in the same way that we as a com munity have recognized the priceless treasure we have in the Parthenon in Athens. GRAZIANI (COM). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, the envi ronmental challenge \u2014 the great challenge of our time \u2014 must be met above all, at the information level \u2014 the level of the right to be informed and the duty to inform in all situations, including the one to which Mr Bombard has referred. The Fourth Action Programme has rightly included this subject amongst the general political guidelines; and rightly, many of today's speeches have emphas ized the central character of this point. And I do not understand why some Members \u2014 perhaps only because they wanted to be funny \u2014 have underrated Mr Van der Lek's report, which we on the other hand consider to be very important, and which we support. Although everyone is now aware that in a complex society such as the one in which we live you cannot have democracy unless it is accompanied by adequate information, there is however not the same awareness of the fact that today, implementation of the right to information represents the fundamental instrument for achieving effective protection of the environment. One has only to think, on the one hand, of the many environmental disasters that occur for the very reason that there is no effective information policy, for the very reason that the people are not kept informed \u2014 Seveso docet \u2014 and on the other hand, the many prob lems \u2014 even though they are always too few in num ber \u2014 that have been able to be resolved for the very reason that information was provided. I do not think I am being too optimistic if I state that, in our countries, we have achieved an environmental awareness that potentially constitutes a bulwark \u2014 which may not be the best possible, but is however cer tainly sufficient, against action that is harmful to the environment: I say 'potential bulwark' for the very reason that too often people are not kept informed. I want to add that, by ensuring that people have access to environmental information, you at the same time increase this awareness. In the light of what has now been said, it seems that the general principle around which Mr Van der Lek's report revolves, the principle regarding publicity for environmental data, should meet with full approval. Now, Mr President, comes the more difficult part \u2014 implementing this principle. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection shows the way sufficiently clearly when it calls on the Commission to prepare a directive, and when it lays down the criteria that that directive must contain. If Parliament adopts this resolution, as I believe it will, I hope that first of all the Commission and then the Council will take prompt action on it. VAN DER LEK (ARC), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I should like to begin by once again thanking the Commissioner, Mr Clinton Davis, for his favourable reaction, and I too warmly welcome the words of the President-in-Office of the Council, which I understand to mean that our proposals on the question of information will find a willing ear in the Council. Le me clarify one particular point for the benefit of Mrs Schleicher, who evidently must have misheard me. She suggested that I had referred to the American Freedom of Information Act in an unfair way. I cannot understand how she arrives at that view. I have made a very full study of this legislation. I have gone so far as to include a careful account of it in the second part of my explanatory statement \u2014 one of the people who work on this piece of legislation was present here \u2014 and I ask for exactly the same consideration as is con tained in the Freedom of Information Act and not a whit more. As to Mrs Schleicher's assertion that you are allowed under this legislation to provide summaries, may I say that this is totally unfair, as I can, if necessary, demon strate on the basis of the text I have before me. Com plete files are stipulated. It is of course true that gen uinely confidential data can be omitted from them, but precisely that is one of the things I too am advocating. But this has to be testable in court, and that is precisely what is stipulated in this legislation. It can be contested by the inquirer. If the authorities refuse to allow some thing to be left out and treated as confidential, they have to give a reason for doing so. Of course that too ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/149 Van der Lek can be open to legal challenge. I absolutely do not exclude that. As to the point raised by Mrs Peus, I am glad she feels able to go along with the principle underlying these proposals. I find that very welcome. I think the ques tion of military secrets is a complete misunderstanding. I am not asking for military secrets to be revealed, but only for the same standards to be applied. MAIJ-WEGGEN (PPE). \u2014 (NL) MrPresident, in the short time available to me in this debate on the environment I should like to concentrate on the Van der Lek report on access to environment pollution information. I have a particularly high regard for this report because what Mr Van der Lek is advocating, namely openness of environmental information to the public, is one aspect of the openness of government generally, and such openness is one of the things I think is of fundamental importance in a democratic system. In the Netherlands we have now had legislation for a good six years or so providing for openness of govern ment to all its citizens, natives and immigrants alike, and which gives the right of access to all government information requested. Of course some restrictions are also laid down, such as the confidentiality of people's private lives, the withholding of information relating to punishable offences, the exclusion of information that would result in financial disadvantage to the indi vidual concerned, and commercial secrets also may not be revealed. But the Netherlands legislation works perfectly well within that sort of restriction. Citizens and interest-groups are satisfied, and the level of sus picion between the citizen and the authorities has been somewhat reduced. The table provided by the rapporteur shows that another three EEC countries, Denmark, France and Luxembourg, also have that sort of legislation. It also seems to work well in those countries, and that too is a good sign. And our biggest trading partner, the United States, has of course had its famous Freedom of Infor mation Act since the sixties. There was a major debate on this at the time, and in 1974 the law was streng thened considerably and now seems to function well \u2014 and not just to the advantage of American private citizens, who account for only 20% of the inquirers, for it is above all the American business community that derives most advantage from this law, in that 60% to 65% of all inquiries come from businesses, which is a highly significant point in itself. Information on environmental data is only one aspect of the freedom of information to which every citizen is entitled, but it is of course an essential aspect. It is just too silly that environmental organizations have to work until long into the night monitoring water, air and soil, when reports containing the same informa tion are available in the relevant government depart ments. These are after all the same water, the same air, and the same soil as people have to live in, and the government is there on behalf of the citizen. The government too, let it not be forgotten, is also part of the population. That government should be open of course goes without saying. I should therefore like to ask honourable members, on the British and German sides in particular, not to think that this is in any sense a dangerous or revolutionary proposal. It concerns a democratic achievement that has worked well for a good many years in the United States and in a number of our own Member States. It is disappointing that we in the EEC still do not enjoy this right. Provided that no disruptive amendments are adopted, the report has my sympathy and my support, and I hope the Commission will take up these propo sals, and I hope above all that it will not confine its efforts only to environmental information but will broaden them to cover all information held by the authorities. I believe that any self-respecting demo cracy must be able to manage with open government, and the EEC should be no exception. HEINRICH (ARC), draftsman for an opinion for the Committee on Development and Cooperation. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, Madam Minister. The Committee on Development and Cooperation has adopted an opi nion on the fourth environment action programme aimed at making the European Community the real vanguard of a world-wide sensible environment policy. But yet I must say that the committee is alarmed about numerous serious mistakes in various areas of the envi ronment. Firstly: the reduction of the ozone layer of the atmos phere, which disproportionately increases the risk of skin cancer and climatic variations, can quickly be stopped by limiting the production of fluorine, chlor ine, hydrocarbon and especially by banning the really superfluous spray liquified petroleum gas, also by speedily discovering alternative products and methods of recycling. Secondly: the tropical rain forests have been reduced by 40% in the last few years. If the felling of trees continues at this rate then these forests will soon have completely disappeared with the familiar consequences of soil erosion, drought, desert formation and climatic changes. Thirdly: agricultural poisons and pesticides which are banned in industrialized countries but are exported to developing countries annually cause 500 000 to 2 mil lion accidents and 10 000 to 40 000 deaths, according to WHO statistics. The Committee on Development and Cooperation has by a large majority condemned these conditions and called for the FAO Code of Con duct to be incorporated into Community law and for the export of the banned pesticides to be halted.

        "No 2-352/150 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Heinrich Fourthly: numerous development projects imple mented with financial aid from the EEC have nefar ious environmental consequences. Hence the Com mittee calls for an environment impact assessment for all these projects. Fifthly: the Committee is extremely concerned that there is no protection from the health hazards of nuclear tests and no safe solution for the transport and storage of uranium and nuclear waste. MARTIN, Simone (LDR), rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) First of all, I should like to pick up on a question to Mrs Smet, the one put by Mr Roelants du Vivier, since the Coun cil has told us that it intends to take account of Parlia ment's opinions. I too would like to know how this is going to be done, even if the answer cannot be given this evening. Secondly, I would turn to the Commis sioner and, without speaking in such categorical terms as Mr Sherlock, I would remind him that I was not speaking in this chamber in any personal capacity but on behalf of the Environment Committee; moreover, to judge from this afternoon's speeches, this report appears to command fairly wide support in the House. I would add that, while he dwelt on the criticisms we had made of the Commission, my own impression was that the balance was pretty even between congratula tions and criticisms \u2014 congratulations, I repeat, on the Commission's broadening of the approach to envi ronmental policy, and congratulations also because this has resulted in environmental policy being incor porated into the Single Act. On the other hand, I stand by my criticism of the fact that there has not been enough stocktaking of past actions and explanation of past setbacks. I also repeat our strong preference for a fourth programme based not on a catalogue of actions \u2014 although we do not criticize that \u2014 but on a list of priorities, so that the various stages of progress that we want to get through over the years ahead are clearly identified, because we want no repetition of such terrible events as the Seveso disaster and the others to which I referred in my report. SMET, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I wish to thank you and all those who have spoken on the three items on today's agenda. Let me now reply very briefly. Firstly, the report by Mrs Martin on to the fourth act ion programme and the question as to how this is being dealt with. This item will be on the agenda for 21 May together with the resolution on which political consensus has been reached in the Council. Both these items will again be placed on the agenda for 21 May, and Parliament's report will consequently be discussed in relation to the existing resolution. Secondly, exports of dangerous substances. We face the choice either of reaching an agreement in the short term in the Council, or of deferring this item and trying to secure an agreement in the longer term on prior informal consent, but in the knowledge that the discussions prior to reaching an agreement might well drag on for several years. That is the choice we now face, and the Council has opted to try and resolve at least part of the problem in the short term. Thirdly, a personal comment on openness of govern ment. The principle is an admirable one. I think it is one thing to state the case in principle, but the diffi culty is that there is so much data available which could be made public. There is one thing that is lack ing in very many cases, and that is the necessary funds for publishing as much data as possible on a regular basis. Moreover, I regret to say that in the case of very many things that could be done on behalf of the public, the channels and resources available are actu ally put to very little use. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The joint debate is closed. The vote will be taken tomorrow at 7. p.m. IN THE CHAIR: MR AMARAL Vice-President HABSBURG (EPP). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I wish to speak on a personal matter. I had invited a group from the 'Parents' Committee for Namibia' here today; these are black people whose children have been kid napped. On going through the building here they hap pened to meet Mr Sam Nujoma outside Room 4 who was there at the invitation of a political group of the Parliament, or of Commissioner Natali. Mr Nujoma is the secretary-general of SWAPO. He physically attacked a lady from the group, struck her in the face, injured her and shouted 'We will kill you!' Mr President, I ask you to investigate this incident. It is outrageous! This House must not allow bandits and the law of the jungle to create trouble here. That is unworthy of this House. PRESIDENT. \u2014 I shall immediately instruct Parlia ment's security service to inform us what happened. ANDREWS (RDE). \u2014 Mr Habsburg is making a very serious allegation and not producing any evi dence. I think it is a very dangerous thing to make such an allegation in this House. There are very ser ious things happening in southern Africa. I must say I have never heard Mr Habsburg call for social justice ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/151 Andrews and a settlement and peace in Mozambique and Angola. It was I who invited those people who were in Room 4 today and I am proud of it. PRESIDENT. \u2014 I will not allow a debate to begin on this topic. We shall, of course, try to check, through the security service, what actually took place. We shall then take whatever decisions are appropriate. NEWENS (S). \u2014 I do hope that Mr Habsburg will think again about the language he used on this occasion when he spoke of bandits and the law of the jungle because it is precisely that sort of language which gives great offence to people who are here arguing a legitimate case. I think, as one who attended that meeting, it is quite wrong to use that kind of language whatever the inci\u00ad dent was and I hope Mr Habsburg will, retract it since it certainly will not help anybody's cause for him to maintain that position. We are not talking about peo\u00ad ple who bring here the law of the jungle or anything of that sort. They are people who have been deeply oppressed and whose standards are in many cases bet\u00ad ter than our own. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The matter is closed. 4. Question Time PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the second part of Question Time (Doc. \u0392 2-296/87). We shall now take the questions to the Council and to the Foreign Ministers, beginning with those to the Council. Question No 57 by Mr Hutton H-748/86): Subject: Reports by Council on progress of legis\u00ad lation What answer will the Council give to the request made by Parliament in its resolution of 12 June 1986 on the use of the veto in the Council 1 that the Council should 'report to the European Par\u00ad liament every three months on the progress of draft legislation upon which the European Parlia\u00ad ment has delivered its opinion'? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) The Council has repeatedly stated that it is pre\u00ad pared to inform Parliament, each time the latter so requests it, whether in writing or orally, as to the rea\u00ad sons that have led the Council to depart from the opi- OJ, C 176, 14.7. 1986, p. 124. nion of the European Parliament. When the concilia\u00ad tion procedure is applicable, that too will afford Par\u00ad liament the opportunity to determine what action the Council has taken on its opinions. Regular, periodical consultation that made no allowances for the rate of progress of the activities of the Council would, on the other hand, very soon come to be seen as valueless. HUTTON (ED). \u2014 I thank the President-in-Office for his answer and ask him if he would agree with me that with the great pressure on time in our plenary ses\u00ad sions, the follow-up of resolutions and opinions should be developed in the framework of appearances of the Presidency in Parliament's committees, particu\u00ad larly in the context of the conciliation procedure? TINDEMANS (NL). \u2014 I can agree with the point of view expressed by the honourable Member and with what he has just proposed. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 58 by Mr Fitzsimons, which has been taken over by Mr Andrews (H-785/ 86): Subject: Alarm devices for the elderly Will the Council make a statement on the request by the European Parliament for the provision, free of charge for those over the age of 75, of an alarm device linked to a telephone so that, in an emer\u00ad gency, an old person may transmit an appeal for help? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) The Council has taken note of the European Parliament's resolution of 14 May 1986 concerning Community action to improve the situation of the eld\u00ad erly in the Member States of the Community, and in particular paragraph 28, in which the European Parlia\u00ad ment calls on the governments of the Member States to provide certain telephone services for the aged. In this resolution Parliament addresses itself specifically to the governments of the Member States. Conse\u00ad quently, it is not for the Council to say what action should be taken on Parliament's resolution. ANDREWS (RDE). \u2014 I thank the President-in-Off\u00ad ice for his reply, but it seems to me extraordinary that the importance of such a development is being ignored and that there is no follow-up to it from the Minister. I understand the terms in which the President-in-Off\u00ad ice has replied. But it is an urgent thing for many old people in the Community. It has worked in my consti\u00ad tuency. It has worked around Britain, I understand. I think the President-in-Office ought to reconsider Par\u00ad liament's resolution on it. I urge him to do all he can to bring about a positive resolution of the problem. ",
        "No 2-352/152 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) As I have just said, the Euro pean Parliament's resolution is addressed to the gov ernments of the Member States. It will consequently be for them to take any follow-up measures. May I also remind the House that no proposals have hitherto been received by us in this connection from the Com mission. McMILLAN-SCOTT (ED). \u2014 For some years I have had the honour of advising a company in this field which makes this sort of equipment and which has supplied it to a great number of local authorities in the United Kingdom and, indeed, elsewhere in the Euro pean Community. It is a fact that the increasing age of our population makes the provision of security and alarm systems more and more urgent and while I accept that this is not naturally a matter for the Com munity, it would be helpful nevertheless if the Council, and through it the Member States' governments, could in the same way that they emphasised the needs of the elderly in the winter distribution of food also give priority to providing security through alarm systems of this type. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I can undertake, at the first available opportunity, to bring it to the attention of my colleagues that Parliament has adopted a resolution to this effect. Let me repeat that, insofar as action by the Community is concerned, we have as yet received no Commission proposals in this connection. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 59 by Mr Megahy (H-967/86): Subject: EEC-Turkey Association Council What reasons are there to justify the EEC's deci sion to convene the EEC-Turkey Association Council, when Turkey still keeps its army of occu pation in Cyprus, a country associated with the EEC, in spite of the countless resolutions passed by the UN and the European Community? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) I should like to make it clear that at present there are no plans for any meeting of the EEC-Turkey Association Council. As to the meeting held last Sep tember, let me remind the House of the statement that the then President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Linda Chalker, made before the European Parlia ment on 10 December 1986 in reply to questions placed on the agenda consequent upon the convening of that body. I believe that the very detailed statement then made and the subsequent exhaustive debate prov ided every opportunity to highlight all the important aspects of this question, and I have nothing to add to that at the present time. MEGAHY (S). \u2014 I thank the President-in-Office for his answer, particularly in respect of the first part of his answer that there are no plans to convene the Association Council. I, of course, am not in possession of the rather detailed reply although I was here when Mrs Chalker made it, I wonder if he would agree that in the context of recent developments between the EEC and Turkey, the illegal occupation of Cyprus which has been condemned from every part of the world is a major obstacle and could he assure us that the Council is in fact trying to impress upon the Turk ish Government that a removal of this obstacle would greatly help association between the EEC and Turkey? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I think the question that has just been asked, certainly in the terms in which it has been stated, is a question concerning political coopera tion, and not a question of the type we are now consi dering. ARBELOA MURU (S). \u2014 (ES) With regard to the application for membership by the Turkish Govern ment, a number of respected personalities, including Members of the European Parliament, have ques tioned not only the democratic character of the Turk ish regime, but also the European nature of the coun try itself. Does the President not believe that the relevant organ of the European Economic Community should explain not only the political, but also the sociological, cultural and historical foundations on which the Treaty of Association and the possible Treaty of Accession of Turkey to the European Economic Community are based? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) In the matter of Turkey's application for accession, in all previous cases the pro cedures that are laid down in the Treaties were adhered to. The latest application for accession was placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the Coun cil following the receipt of the application, namely that of 26-27 April 1987. As on previous occasions, the Council decided to acknowledge receipt of the appli cation and to apply the relevant procedure as laid down in the Treaties. Article 8 of the European Single Act also stipulates that before the Council reaches a decision on any application for accession the agree ment of the European Parliament is required. The Council's decision, which conforms to the foregoing provisions on all points, is consequently an interim procedural decision that in no respect anticipates any substantive content. It will be on the basis of that deci sion that the Commission will now deliver its opinion. The Council has in no sense sought to deal with the Turkish application differently from any previous applications for accession, and has applied the provi sions of the Treaties to the Turkish application in the same manner as on previous occasions. The Com munity is a constitutional community. We have applied Article 237 of the Treaty. Since the Council is aware that as soon as the European Single Act enters into force the European Parliament will have a part to play in the accession procedure by giving its approval, it ",
        "13.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/153 Tindemans also considered it appropriate to include a reminder of that fact in its decision. GAZIS (S). \u2014 (GR) I think we might have expected a different answer today, although this matter has been discussed at length in the past. Time always has an important part to play. It is quite probable that what would have been considered to be a satisfactory reply just a few months ago would now be felt to be out dated. This is the only way to explain a situation being considered as acceptable at some point in the past, but certainly not being seen to be so today. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I am not aware of any new question arising in the connection, but let me repeat that the European Economic Community is a constitu tional community. We cannot react to an application for accession on the basis of the Outlook' of the appli cant. This matter is covered by Article 237, which sti pulates that an application for accession must be referred by the Council to the Commission, which subsequently must deliver an opinion. Pursuant to the European Single Act, the European Parliament must then also deliver a favourable opinion, and the Council must then rule unanimously. That is the procedure being followed, as laid down by the Treaties. MARSHALL (ED). \u2014 The President-in-Office of the Council did say that the Council would have to have a unanimous vote on this application. Would he there fore agree that, as Greece and the United Kingdom are co-guarantors of the 1960 Cypriot agreement, unless there is a solution to the Cypriot problem and unless the Turkish troops leave the island of Cyprus, there can be no successful application by Turkey to join the European Community, especially as political and human rights are still not respected in that country as they are in other Community countries? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) Let me remind the House that the Council must reach its decision after opinion of the Commission has been made known and after the European Parliament has delivered its opinion. That means in the final stages of the procedure and not at the beginning. Article 237 states that the Coun cil must refer the application for accession to the Commission. TAYLOR (DR). \u2014 Can the President-in-Office con firm that the Turkish troops in Northern Cyprus are welcomed by the Cypriots who live there, in the same way as the Greek troops in southern Cyprus are wel comed by the Cypriots who live there? Can he also confirm that the application by Turkey will be treated in the same way as all other applications for member ship of the Community and that questions of religion and sectarianism will not be taken into account? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) The original question con cerned the EEC-Turkey Association Council. I have the impression that this question bears no relation to that. PRESIDENT. (H-968/86): Question No 60 by Mr Newens Subject: EEC-Cyprus Association Agreement Following the most recent round of negotiations between the EEC and Cyprus and the work of the EEC-Cyprus Association Council held on 16 December 1986, what stage has been reached in these negotiations, whose purpose is to carry out the second stage of the Association Agreement with a view to a Customs Union between the Community and the Republic of Cyprus? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) The negotiations between the European Econo mic Community and Cyprus on the transition to the second stage of the Associciation Agreement were resumed on 28 April 1987. These are crucial, but highly complex, negotiations, since their purpose is \u2014 as the House is aware \u2014 to draw up the conditions under which a customs union between Cyprus and the Community can come into being. I am in a position to state that these negotiation are now entering their final phase, and I hope they can be concluded in the very near future. NEWENS (S). \u2014 In expressing thanks for that reply, may I underline the importance of these negotiations which will deeply affect the maintenance and develop ment of trade between Cyprus and the Community, particularly at a time when there are enormous prob lems created for the Cypriot people by the Turkish invasion and continued occupation of their territory. Can the President-in-Office go any further and indi cate when he anticipates that the discussions on the final stage will be finally concluded and when it is esti mated that the agreement will come into force? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) All I can add is this: After two sessions on 28 and 29 April 1987 the negotiations between the EEC and Cyprus were continued last week, and they will again be resumed in the near future. On Friday 8 May, following the last round of talks with the Commission, the Cypriot delegation returned to Cyprus for consultations with its govern ment. Let me point out, incidentally, that the negotia tions on behalf of the Community are conducted by the Commission. MARSHALL (ED). \u2014 The President-in-Office stated that it is the Commission which negotiates on behalf of the Community, but can he encourage the Commis sion to bring these negotiations to a very early conclu- ",
        "No 2-352/154 Debates of the European Parliament 13. 5.87 Marshall sion. These negotiations have gone on for a very long time. The people of Cyprus want a very early conclu sion. Can we show a similar will as they are showing? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) Let me remind the House that the Commission negotiates on the basis of a man date that is given to it. I am aware of no mechanism in Community procedures that could be used to persuade the Commission to conclude the negotiations quickly. But I shall be prepared to raise this point in talks with the Commission Member responsible. TAYLOR (DR). \u2014 Is the President-in-Office aware that the present negotiations, far from being welcome, have encountered considerable opposition from the Cypriots in Northern Cyprus? Is he aware that the association agreement requires the Community to treat both Turkish and Greek Cypriots fairly without favour to either side? Therefore, will the present nego tiations only be with one side and are we not really taking nonsense about a customs union between Cyprus and the Community when, in fact, there is not even a customs union within that island? Until the bar riers within that island are removed, we cannot move forward one inch towards a customs union with Cyprus and is that not the reason for the delay in these negotiations? information concerning the matter raised by the hon ourable Member, and that the Council has not adopted, and cannot in any event adopt, a position either way on this matter. VAN HEMELDONCK (S). \u2014 (NL) May I ask if the Council has taken note of the recommendations of the Vetter report concerning the right of asylum, and if arrangements have been made in the TREVI group concerning the possibility of expelling asylum-seekers, or those seeking employment from Community terri tory? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) Insofar as I am aware, TREVI is not a Council institution, it is a special inter-governmental meeting that operates on the mar gins of the Council. I can assure Mrs Van Hemel- donck, in my capacity as a Belgian Minister, and not as President-in-Office of the Council, that the incident to which she refers concerned foreign nationals who were not in possession of the requisite immigration documents required by Belgium. For that reason embarkation at Geneva was refused by the Swiss auth orities. But this does not mean that either the Immi gration Department or the Belgian authorities exceeded the bounds of their ordinar}' duties in rela tion to this incident. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) In my first answer I said that these were crucial, but highly complex negotiations. That was putting it mildly, for the fact is that these are extremely tough negotiations. I think that basically says it all. Where the internal situation is concerned, you know that the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Perez de Cuellar is seeking to bring about a solu tion to the problems arising from the internal situation in Cyprus. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 61 by Mrs Van Hemeldonck(H-1006/86): Subject: Action taken by the Belgian Aliens' Ser vice outside Belgium Is the Council aware that on 6 January 1987, some twenty Turkish citizens holding valid board ing passes and passports were prevented from boarding a scheduled flight from Geneva to Brus sels at Geneva Airport, Switzerland? Can it confirm that the Swiss border police were acting at the request of the Belgian Aliens' Ser vice? Can the Council state the international legal instrument which justified this action and whether all non-EEC travellers are treated in this way? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) I am sorry to have to say that the Council has no PRESIDENT. \u2014 As the author is not present, Ques tion No 62 will be answered in writing. 1 Question No 63 by Mr Ca\u00f1o Pinto (H-65/87) Subject: Interinstitutional budget agreement It is necessary to put an end to the interinstitu tional strife between the Council, Parliament and the Commission over the perennial problems of budget management and budget discipline. What is the Council's position concerning the interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council proposed by the Commission in its programme for 1987 and which would establish in advance a ceiling for the major areas of budget spending for each financial year? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office in the Council. \u2014 (NL) In its. communication 'Making a success of the Single Act \u2014 a new frontier for Europe' the Commis sion proposes that an inter-institutional agreement should be concluded for the express purpose of improving decision-making on budgetary matters. This communication is now under consideration in our appropriate departments. It would be premature for me to give any answer that would anticipate the terms of the solution to budgetary problems that we are all endeavouring to secure. See Annex 'Question Time'. ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/155 CA\u00d1O PINTO (S). \u2014 (ES) Every year, this Parlia ment goes through a period of mass hysteria, while adopting and finalizing the budget. This process has already come to be known, in parliamentary jargon as 'interinstitutional warfare'. Being fought between brothers \u2014 the Council, the Commission and Parlia ment \u2014 it has something of the nature of a civil war. I would like to point out to the President-in-Office just how serious the consequences of this warfare are obstructing the basic purposes of the European institu tions and blocking movement towards European unity. From this point of view, I believe that the Council bears a heavy responsibility, and I would like to ask if it is ready to change its attitude in the future. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I have at all times been will ing to aim for inter-institutional solutions. On the last day of the Belgian Presidency in 1982 we reached agreement on a three-cornered approach, and I am still proud of that. And in his answer only this morning Mr Delors was also talking in terms of an inter-institu tional agreement. I cannot of course go any further at this stage than what he said this morning. DURY (S). \u2014 (FR) Do you think that such an agree ment and the reinforcement of Parliament's rights in regard to budgetary matters could avoid situations such as the one we are going through now, with the governments refusing ot honour their budgetary com mitments? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I am not able to venture into interpretation or assessment. This is also a matter of the European Parliament's existing prerogatives. Clearly, the budgetary problem is currently seen by Parliament as the most important problem. It is per haps this that accounts for the tensions that we witness here in Parliament each year. In my view, however, this tension is justified, because on one side Parliament wants to exercise its preroga tives to the full and on the other side the Council and the ministers making up the Council are concerned to safeguard budgetary orthodoxy as they understand it. PRESIDENT. (H-75/87): Question No 64 by Mr Vemimmen Subject: The minting of ECU coins by Belgium In connection with its presidency, Belgium has taken the initiative of putting into circulation gold and silver coins to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome. What precisely are the implications of the state ment made on Belgian radio and television by the President-in-Office of the Council of Finance Ministers, Mr Eyskens, who, on the one hand, recommended that the ECU coins should be made legal tender and, on the other, that the purchase price of the gold coins should be fixed on the basis of the daily gold rate? Should not the Belgian presidency instead be con centrating its efforts on a European initiative to strengthen the EMS? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) The Belgian Presidency can only repeat that it is doing everything in its power to strengthen the Euro pean Monetary System. In the meantime use of the ECU in trade and in the international financial world, as well as by travellers, continues to increase. The ECU is the fourth-largest currency for the issue of Eurobonds, and traveller's cheques are already avail able in ECU. Having regard to the fluctuations between the different currencies, the ECU is coming into greater and greater use as a more stable form of currency for making payments in international trade. VERNIMMEN (S). \u2014 (NL) I can accept the answer given by the President-in-Office of the Council; but should I regard the statement made by the Belgian Minister of Finance on television to the effect that this was easiest means of payment for the ordinary citizen as some kind of stunt, or was it an attempt to mislead the people of Belgium? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I think the ECU as repre sented to the people of Belgium by my counterpart the Finance Minister should be seen rather as a symbol of what Europe might one day come to represent. Let me assure the House that Mr Eyskens is an excellent teacher and an accomplished scholar, and it may have been for that reason that he saw this as an opportunity to make his point. PATTERSON (ED). \u2014 Could I assure the Presi dent-in-Office that I very much welcome the minting of the ECU coins as a symbol of European unity. But if the intention is that they should be legal tender, could the President-in-Office do his utmost to ensure that VAT is not charged by certain Member States on these coins. That is clearly not the case with any other kind of coinage. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I am unable to answer that question. In Belgium at all events VAT is not at pres ent charged on these collector's items. DURY (S). \u2014 (FR) The question from Mr Boutos on the European Monetary System and the legal basis in the Single European Act for consolidation of the EMS is linked to Mr Vernimmen's question. It would per haps be useful if the President-in-Office gave a reply, ",
        "No 2-352/156 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Dury as a follow-up to his comments on the statement by Mr Eyskens. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mrs Dury, Question No 62 was not answered orally because Mr Boutos was not present. Under the Rules of Procedure it will be answered in writing, which should satisfy your request. addition to any other inflation that may have occurred. I wonder if the Minister is aware that a report has just been published to the effect that, in addition to this harmful effect on our people, the com mon agricultural policy is now costing Britain just under half a million jobs and that the figures for other European countries are similar. Does he have any comment on that? DURY (S). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, let us take it, then, that I am putting the same question. Had I known, I would not have quoted my source and Mr Tindemans would have answered. I would therefore ask him to take my supplementary into consideration. PRESIDENT. \u2014 No, Mrs Dury. Under the Rules, when the Member who tabled the question is absent it is answered in writing and not orally. Question No 65 by Mr Lomas (H-79/87): Subject: Cost of the common agricultural policy According to Mr Goldman, director of the Con sumer Association in Britain, food prices are being kept artificially high by the European Com munity's common agricultural policy. He states that the cost of the CAP to a family of four in Britain is estimated at \u00a311.50 per week. What action is the Council taking to remedy this appalling situation? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) The Council would remind the honourable Member that it has been pursuing a restrictive policy on agricultural prices for many years for a number of reasons. That policy resulted in 1985 in a fall in agri cultural production prices of 1.7% in the United Kingdom, whereas consumer prices in that country increased in the same year by 3.1%. This shows that the level of prices fixed under the Common Agricul tural Policy is only one of the factors determining the level of consumer prices. Where future policy on agri cultural prices is concerned, the Council has exchanged views in the last few months on the Com mission's price proposals for the 1987-1988 marketing year. These proposals are also a reflection of the con viction that the restrictive policy previously pursued must be continued. The Council has the firm inten tion, on receiving the European Parliament's opinion, of reaching a final decision on this matter as speedily as possible. LOMAS (S). \u2014 I am grateful to the Minister for that reply, but perhaps I could just clarify one point that I think he may have misunderstood. It is not just a ques tion of a general increase in inflation. The \u00a311.50 a week in costs to every average British family is a direct result of the common agricultural policy and is in TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I hardly think it can be appropriate for the President-in-Office of the Council to give a running commentary on particular reports here in Parliament. I want only to point out that the basic philosophy underlying the Common Agricultural Policy has been to provide reasonable incomes for farmers by way of the prices policy. But to extrapolate from that to the assertion that agricultural policy, as conducted in recent years, is the cause of an unjustifia ble increase, is a conclusion that as things now stand I would not be prepared to draw. MARSHALL (ED). \u2014 Would the President-in-Office like to comment on the fact that Mr Lomas yet again is out of step with public opinion? Does he realize that Mr Kinnock, Mr Lomas' leader, has dropped the com mitment of the Labour Party to take the United King dom out of Europe? Does that not suggest that mem bership of the Community is not having the consequ ences for the United Kingdom that Mr Lomas claims? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) To borrow a phrase from English: No comment. PRESIDENT. \u2014 As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 66 and 67 will be answered in writing. 1 Question No 68 by Mr Ulburghs (H-97/87) : Subject: Discrimination by Belgium in granting minimum subsistence wage There is a danger that the Belgian Law of 7 August 1974 guaranteeing a minimum subsis tence wage will not be applied to members of the family and spouses of migrant workers who are themselves not nationals of a Community Member State. This case is currently the subject of appeal proceedings between the Belgian State and the Commission, which sees here an infringement of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68. 2 Why should the Belgian State await a ruling and not itself take action to eliminate any possibility of discrimination, so making a genuine European gesture? 1 See Annex 'Question Time'. 2 OJ, L 257, 19. 10. 1968, p. 2. ",
        "13. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/157 TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) The Council cannot comment on the position that a Member State against which the Commission has brought proceedings before the Court of Justice should adopt. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 69 by Mr Arbeloa Muru (H-103/87): Subject: Election of the President of the Commis sion Would the Council be in favour of the President of the Commission being elected by the national parliaments and by the European Parliament? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) It is stipulated in the Merger Treaty that 'The Members of the Commission shall be appointed by common accord of the Governments of the Member States.' Article 14 also stipulates that, 'The President and the five Vice-Presidents of the Commission shall be appointed from among its members for a term of two years in accordance with the same procedure as that laid down for the appointment of members of the Commission. Their appointments may be renewed.' The Council has received no proposal for any amend ment to this provision. ARBELOA MURU (S). \u2014 (ES) If it is not possible to tell us that, could we perhaps be informed of the per sonal opinion of the President-in-Office, MrTinde- mans, who has even been known to quote Charles the Bold in some of his European historical speeches? PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Arbeloa Muru, the President- in-Office of the Council is free to answer or not answer this question as he sees fit. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I find it enormously gratify ing to learn that people have read my writings and even my speeches. All I should like to say is that in what is known as the Tindemans report it is proposed that the position of the President of the Commission should be strengthened, and I suggest ways and means whereby we could strengthen that position. I think however that I had better refrain from answering the question that has been put to me just now in this con nection. VAT as part of the Community's programme for creating the internal market, and whether the European Commission introduced any specific proposals to increase the rate of VAT on items presently zero-rated or exempt in certain Member States? In particular, did the Commission intro duce specific proposals in relation to books, news papers, children's clothes or food, or was any decision made which would affect any of these areas? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) The Commission's proposals concerning VAT rates and structure, in which the approach advocated in part three of the White Paper is developed in more detail, have not yet been submitted to the Council. As soon as these proposals have been considered the Council will be in a position to reply to the honourable Member's question. McMAHON (S). \u2014 Although the Council has not yet discussed this matter, would the President-in-Office care to enlighten the House as to whether he agrees with the view stated publicly by the Belgian Finance Minister that the aim was to increase the base rate of value added tax so that they could reduce general tax ation? What advice would he give to those of us in those Member States where at present books, newspa pers and children's clothes are zero rated when we are asked about this at the forthcoming election campaign in the United Kingdom? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I can only repeat that no pro posals have as yet been received by the Council. I am not therefore in a position to comment. Moreover, a suggestion that might have been made by Finance Ministers at national level in Member States is obviously not something on which it would be appro priate for me to comment now before this House. PATTERSON (ED). \u2014 Perhaps the President-in- Office would bring to the attention of the British Labour Members of this House the statement by the Commission at the beginning of this sitting, that not only are no proposals before the Council, but no pro posals have been adopted by the Commission. There fore, would they please stop flogging this obviously dead horse? PRESIDENT. (H-110/87): Question No 70 by Mr McMahon Subject: The extension of the rate of VAT as part of the creation of the internal market Can the Council inform the House as to the out come of the meeting of the Finance Ministers on 11 May to discuss the widening of the base of McMAHON (S). \u2014 On a point of order, Mr Presi dent. I was referring to a press release by a Belgian Minister in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council after the last-but-one Finance Committee meeting. It was reported in the Belgian newspaper, Le Soir. Does the President-in-Office read press reports of Council of Finance Ministers' meetings and will he comment on the question which I asked? ",
        "No 2-352/158 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I can only speak here as President-in-Office of the Council, and that is what I have done. As Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister it would be extremely dangerous for me to venture onto the path of fiscal controversy. Perhaps Parliament will shortly have the opportunity to put a question to my Finance counterpart in the Belgian government. He will be present at the next part-session. MARTIN, David (S). \u2014 I am sorry the President-in- Office has decided to give such evasive replies to the questions being put to him. Can I ask him what pres sure the British Government put on the President-in- Office to keep the issue of VAT off the agenda until after the general election in the United Kingdom? MARSHALL (ED). \u2014 It was confirmed in this House last night by Commissioner Christophersen that the Commission has agreed no proposals in respect of VAT. Is it not quite impossible, therefore, for any pressure to be brought on the President-in-Office of the Council to consider? of the Sea and the rules of international law. The Community and most of its partners are signatories to the United Nation Convention, and this is mentioned in a recital in the agreements. Moreover, the wording appearing as Article 3 in the agreements with both the Seychelles and Mozambique is repeated in Article 10 of the draft agreement between the European Econo mic Community and Morocco, and leaves no doubt as to the Community's attitude on this point. It states that the Community undertakes to take all appropriate steps to ensure that its vessels comply with the provi sions of this agreement and with the laws and regula tions governing fishing activities in Morocco's fishing zone, compatible with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the other rules of interna tional law. According to the terms of the Treaty of Rome, matters of territorial delimitation fall outside the scope of Community competence. Thus, from an internal view point, extension and delimitation of Member States' territorial waters and exclusive economic zones fall within their sovereign powers. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I should very much prefer, with your agreement, not to become involved in an internal British controversy. PRESIDENT. \u2014 As the author is not present, Ques tion No 72 will be answered in writing. 1 We now come to the questions addressed to the Foreign Ministers. PRESIDENT. (H-130/87): Question No 71 by Mrs Lizin Question No 73 by Mr Arbeloa Muru (H-880/86): Subject: Fisheries agreement with Morocco Can the Council say according to what timetable and what principles it intends to conduct the negotiations for the renewal of the fisheries agree ment, with particular reference to fishing rights off the coast of the Western Sahara? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) On the question concerning the negotiations on conclusion of a fisheries agreement with Morocco, I refer the honourable Member to the answer I gave during the European Parliament's last part-session to Question No H-996/86 tabled by Mr Ulburghs, to which I would add that there have been no further developments since. Subject: Human rights activists imprisoned in Cuba Five human rights activists are being held in cus tody in Cuba by the State Security Department. Their names are: Jos\u00e9 Luis Alvarado Delgado, Dr Domingo Jorge Delgado, Elizardo S\u00e1nchez Santa Cruz, Dr Adolfo Rivero Caro and Enrique Ladislao Hern\u00e1ndez M\u00e9ndez. They are all mem bers of the Cuban Committee for Human Rights and they have all previously served sentences for political offences. According to Amnesty Interna tional they have been detained for attempting to publicize violations of human rights in their country. Are the Ministers meeting in political cooperation aware of these facts and can they take any steps to secure the release of these prisoners? LIZIN (S). \u2014 (FR) Could we perhaps take that most concise answer as the starting point for going into a little more detail on the positions on either side and ask to what extent it is the hope of the Council to keep to a vague interpretation of the limits of Moroccan territorial waters? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) The fisheries agreements concluded by the Community contain explicit refer ences to compliance with the Convention on the Law TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Foreign Min isters. \u2014 (NL) In their declaration of 21 July 1986 on human rights, the Foreign Ministers of the Com munity affirmed the commitment of the Twelve to work for universal respect for human rights. They will continue their efforts in the context of European cooperation against violations, wherever in the world they may occur. See Annex 'Question Time'. ",
        "13. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/159 Tindemans The declaration of 21 July 1986 pays tribute to the individuals and non-governmental organizations from all over the world that have made invaluable and cou rageous contributions to the protection and promotion of human rights. The Twelve stressed in this declara tion that their concern for human rights cannot be regarded as an interference in the internal affairs of a State. They are convinced, moreover, that neither the lack of economic and social development nor any con viction or ideology can justify the refusal to recognize civil and political rights. The Twelve lose no oppor tunity to bring home these points to other countries. They do not hesitate, in appropriate cases, to mention the names of specific victims in cases of violation of human rights. With regard to the particular cases raised by the hon ourable Member, our information, confirmed by Amnesty International, is that Adolfo Rivero Caro and Enrique Ladislao Hern\u00e1ndez M\u00e9ndez were released on 6 February last. The other three are still in prison, without charge. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 74 by Mr Boesmans (H-947/86): Subject: The Conference held in Guatemala in February 1987 between the countries of the European Community, Central America and the Contadora Group Is it true that the United States' special envoy, Philip Habib, had secret talks in Brussels and other European Community capital cities with a view to preventing the European Community from taking action in Guatemala which did not suit the United States, and did the European Community bow to this pressure? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Foreign Affairs Ministers. \u2014 (NL) The visits by Mr Philip Habib, the United States special envoy, to various European capital cities in January 1987, were of an informatory character. Insofar as the policy of the Twelve at the Guatemala Conference is concerned, this was based on an analysis of the situation in that area and on the conviction that we must make further progress in supporting the peace process initiated by the Contadora Group. The Twelve are supported in this by a part of Latin America that has also signed the Final Declaration of the Guatemala Conference. BOESMANS (S). \u2014 (NL) I would have thought that in the wake of recent events that have come to light in the United States by way of the Contragate hearings, it would be by now apparent that the lip-service that is all the United States has ever paid to the Contadora process has led absolutely nowhere. I should like therefore to ask if the time has not now come, at the conclusion of the Belgian Presidency and now that President Arigas of Costa Rica is on a visit to Europe, to ensure that a clear signal is sent to the United States to the effect that paying lip-service to Contadora is not good enough, and that concrete measures must also be taken. In that connection I would ask if the President-in-Office will take this action next week on the occasion of the visit by President Arigas. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I think the honourable Mem ber takes a too pessimistic view. Let me try to stress once again the point that the February meeting between the EEC Twelve, the Contadora Group and the countries of Central America ended on a positive note, and that a document with an economic content and a document with a political content were signed, which, in the given circumstances, was undoubtedly a constructive and positive development. Whenever we hold talks here with leaders from any of the countries of Central America it goes without saying that the situation in the region as a whole is discussed. McMAHON (S). \u2014 Would the President-in-Office comment on the poor attendance by other Member States at the Guatemala City Conference? I under stand that only four Member States were present. Would he also comment on the interview he gave, which was reported in the Belgian newspaper Le Soir? Would he further comment on the article that appears this week in the Financial Times pointing out that the Nicaraguan economy is being ruined because of American aggression and the cost of the Nicaraguans defending themselves against Reagan's 'cowboys'? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I have not understood to whom that interview in the Financial Times is attri buted. I wish only to say that the Twelve were repre sented at ministerial level, save for one exception, and that by reason of very special circumstances, at the Guatemala City meeting, the third in the series between the Twelve, the Central American Five, and the Contadora Group. I can again only repeat that we endeavoured to arrive at improved economic relations. The document was adopted as part of the effort to secure peace in Central America. Those who have not read the document I would advise to do so, because what we adopted at this meeting was, in the prevailing circumstances, highly significant. PRESIDENT. \u2014 As the author is not present, Ques tion No 75 will be answered in writing. 1 As they deal with the same subject, the following ques tions will be taken together: Question No 76 by Mrs Dury (H-969/86): See Annex 'Question Time'. ",
        "No 2-352/160 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 President Subject: The presence of the Turkish army of occupation in Cyprus What specific steps do the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve propose to take to bring to an end the illegal occupation by Turkey of 40% of the terri tory of the Republic of Cyprus, a burden whose full weight the island and the people of Cyprus have borne since July-August 1974? Question No 78 by Mr Mavros (H-971/86): Subject: The distortion of the national identity of the territories of the Cyprus Republic under Turkish military occupation What practical steps do the twelve Foreign Minis ters of the EEC propose to take to deal with the Turkish army of occupation's systematic distor tion of the national identity of the occupied terri tories belonging to the Cyprus Republic, by means of settlement and the elimination of historical evi dence, with the ultimate aim of making them Turkish, in spite of the resolutions by the UN Security Council and General Assembly and by the EEC? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Foreign Min isters. \u2014 (NL) The Twelve have stated on numerous occasions, both in the European Parliament and else where, that they support the independence, sover eignty, territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus. They continue to lay stress on the need, for all parties con cerned, to avoid any action that could increase the dif ficulty of making progress towards a just and viable solution to the problem. They take the view that it is important for the Secretary-General of the United Nations to be supported in the mission to offer his good offices on the basis of the relevant UN resolu tions which has been entrusted to him by the United Nations Security Council. This mission has repre sented the best method so far of making progress towards a fair and lasting solution to the Cyprus prob lem. DURY (S). \u2014 (FR) I would point out for all that, in connection with the proposals made by the UN Secre tary-General, that it is Turkey which is ultimately refusing to take part in dialogue, but I should like to ask Mr Tindemans the following question. In view of his almost personal commitment, one might say, to entertaining Turkey's application to accede to the European Community, does he not also have it in mind to take initiatives on Cyprus, since this is among other things one of the obstacles to any accession by Turkey to the European Community? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) Let me take Mrs Duty's last suggestion first. I have drafted plans for initiatives, I have been to see the United Nations Secretary-Gen eral and I have had discussions on the Cyprus issue, on the proposals already made by Mr Perez de Cuellar, on the future of these proposals or the possibility of bringing forward others. I also venture to point out that the first Community capital that I visited as President of the Council was Athens. The situation in Cyprus naturally came up on that occasion. I therefore cannot agree with Mrs Dury, according to whom the Cyprus question is being ignored and the Presidency has not been follow ing developments in the situation or has taken no ini tiatives. MAVROS (S). \u2014 (GR) I want to express my astonish ment and my regret that the President-in-Office of the Foreign Ministers has completely failed to answer the question which I asked. Why did he not answer? Do the Foreign Ministers perhaps not consider the distor tion of the national identity and the systematic des truction of cultural evidence in the Turkish-occupied territories of Cyprus to be of importance? How has this situation come about? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) The reply I have just given was addressed to both Mrs Dury and Mr Mavros. Once again, I can say that I have discussed the Cyprus question at length with the United Nations Secretary- General. I found that he too was somewhat disap pointed. Regarding Mr Mavros' last complaint, I can say that during its stay in Cyprus, in June 1986, the Council of Europe committee on migration 'found no evidence of pillage or destruction of monuments and works of art'. That is what I find on the file. I felt it worthwhile to quote from this text, at the request of Mr Mavros. PAPAKYRIAZIS (S). \u2014 (GR) I will simply say that I feel both saddened and hurt by the kind of answers we have been hearing here from the Council. This is a Council which evades and confuses \u2014 somewhat clumsily, I might add \u2014 the issues it is asked about. I know this is a complicated matter, but we want an answer \u2014 and a little while ago, in this chamber, the President-in-Office of the Council, saying that he was not speaking within the framework of political cooper ation, did not wish to adopt a political position on a similar question. It is, however, a political reply that we are seeking. Does it not matter, in the opinion of the President, that there is an army of occupation in Cyprus? We want a clear answer from him on this, avoiding unfor tunate political formulae of the 'two-sides-to-the- question' type, equating the victim with the aggressor. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Papakyriazis, that is not a new question. However I shall give the floor to the Presi dent-in-Office of the Council if he wishes to add any- ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/161 President thing to his previous answer, provided that you are simply requesting a more detailed answer. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) Yes, I should like to do so, because I do not wish to give the impression that this Presidency is unaware of these problems or refuses to answer questions on them. As I said in my answer to Mrs Dury, the Twelve are continuing to stress the need, for all parties concerned, to avoid any action which could increase the difficulty of making progress towards a just and viable solution to the problem. I have taken a variety of steps with a view to such a solution. I have spoken about them, and have nothing to add at this stage. DURY (S). \u2014 (FR) MrPresident, it is not to the President-in-Office but to your good self that I address myself. I should simply like to ask you to show solidarity with our political action vis-\u00e0-vis the Presi dent, not solidarity towards the President-in-Office of the Council. We are politicians; even if you find that our questions are not new, you should let us ask them; the answers too are far from new. ters, whether, regarding Turkey's application for entry into the Community, he and the other Ministers of Foreign Affairs would agree that the Community can not, until such times as the Cyprus problem is solved, accept into its midst a country which is flouting the rule of international law as blatantly as Turkey is in Cyprus. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I have already stated the pos ition adopted by the Twelve on the General Affairs Council when they examined Turkey's application to accede to the European Economic Community, which is a de jure Community, based on a Treaty. We have applied the Treaty as it stands; we have no right to size up the customer, so to speak, before deciding how we apply it. The procedure to be followed is laid down in Article 237. The Council receives the application and forwards it to the Commission, which now has to examine it. Next, if the Single Act is approved by the Twelve Member States, it will come to the European Parliament for it to give its assent. The final stage requires the Council of Ministers to give its decision, unanimously, on the application. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mrs Dury, I accept your point of order, but I would like to state that I can neither show nor fail to show solidarity. I am chairing the sitting impartially. The President-in-Office of the Council is of course free to answer a second time a question he has already answered. It is not a matter of adopting a position vis-\u00e0-vis the question and clearly it is still less a question of adopting a position in favour of the Council of Ministers and against the Members of this House. TAYLOR (DR). \u2014 Since the Turkish troops are wel comed in Northern Cyprus by the Cypriots who live there, it is difficult to understand how anyone could consider these troops to be troops of occupation. I welcome the President-in-Office's statement that the Council supports the initiative by the United Nations' Secretary-General and can he confirm that that initia tive contains no condition for the withdrawal of Turk ish troops? PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 77 by Mr Pannella, which is taken over by Mr Cicciomessere (H-970/86): Subject: EEC action in relation to the 1619 miss ing Cypriots Following the European Parliament's resolution on the 1 619 Cypriots reported missing during the invasion of Cyprus by the Turkish Army in July- August 1974 (OJ, C 42, 14.2. 1983), what steps has the Community taken or does it propose to take to ensure that it is put into effect? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Foreign Ministers. \u2014 (NL)The Twelve continue to support the efforts made by the UN to resolve the problem of per sons reported missing in Cyprus. In particular, they have confidence in the work of the commission of inquiry on missing persons set up under United Nations auspices with the agreement of both Cypriot communities. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I would say to Parliament that it would be counterproductive to attempt to mount any action which was not coordinated or con certed with the United Nations Secretary-General, who is engaged on a special mission. It is for this reason that I went to see Mr Perez de Cuellar. I made suggestions, and all I can say in reply to the questions that I have been asked is that we shall strive, alongside Mr Perez de Cuellar, to find a solution to this difficult and complex Cyprus problem. TZOUNIS (PPE). \u2014 (GR) I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council of Foreign Minis- This commission is investigating what became of everyone, without distinction as to origin or religion, reported missing in Cyprus between the years 1964 and 1974. True to their humanitarian traditions, the Twelve will not fail to provide any support asked of them as a con tribution towards resolving this painful problem. CICCIOMESSERE (NI). \u2014 (IT) I thank the Presi dent-in-Office for the information he has provided regarding the action taken by the Twelve in New York. I should now like to ask a question that, instead, ",
        "No 2-352/162 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Cicciomessere concerns Brussels. It is a question that admits of only two answers : yes or no. I should like to know whether the ministers, or Mr Tindemans, consider that it should be made clear to Turkey that an attitude of non-collaboration with regard to the missing two thousand in Cyprus is preju dicial to relations between Turkey and the European Community, not only as regards the question of Tur key's membership of the Community, but also as regards financial agreements and, in general, relations between Turkey and the Member States of Com munity. I do not want you to reply again in a manner that evades this question. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) These are the sorts of ques tion that we would very much like to be able to answer, but this is a very complex issue. In my papers here, I find the following note: 'The figures for per sons reported missing in Cyprus are 1 619 Greek Cypriots and 830 Turkish Cypriots'. Of course, if a way could be found to solve this tragic problem, relations between the two communities and relations generally would undoubtedly improve greatly, but I find that, on both sides, this is a painful problem. If I could help to solve this painful problem, I would not hesitate for a moment. PLASKOVITIS (S). \u2014 (GR) I would like the Minister to answer the following question: is he aware that this UN committee which he mentioned has been largely inactive for more than five years now, due to the refusal by the Turkish forces \u2014 and it is specifically the Turkish forces involved \u2014 even to allow it entry to carry out its enquiries within the northern part of Cyprus? And how does he think this committee can find any solution to a problem regarding which the European Parliament has made repeated declarations, when I do not believe that any effort has been made either by the present minister or the others so that this committee could effectively complete its work? Could the Minister please respond to this concern? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) As I have just said, the figures for persons reported missing in Cyprus are 1 619 Cypriots and 830 Turkish Cypriots. Following the death of Mr Claude Pillou, Mr Paul Wurth, a Swiss, was appointed on 28 April 1985 by the UN Secretary-General as the third member of the commis sion of inquiry on persons reported missing in Cyprus. The choice of Mr Wurth was made with the agree ment of both Cypriot parties. From June to December 1985, the commission held two sessions; in 1986 there were eight sessions, and this year there have already been four. The next meeting, the twentieth, is sched uled for early June this year. During its most recent meetings, the commission has concentrated on the cases of 169 individuals, 109 of them Greek Cypriots and 60 Turkish Cypriots. As matters now stand, the investigations on a quarter of these cases are already well advanced. In November 1986, two senior United Nations officials, Mr Guiding and Mr Feschel, visited Cyprus at the Secretary-Gen eral's request and held discussions with both Cypriot parties on the best means of advancing the commis sion's work. The UN Secretary-General's most recent report on the commission's activities was delivered on 2 March 1987 to the Commission on Human Rights. Finally, two members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Swiss parliamentarians Mr Rixen and Mr Miiller, recently submitted a report on the problems of refugees and persons reported missing in Cyprus. They called for an amnesty to be declared on all acts connected with these disappear ances. The two rapporteurs' recommendations received the support of the Parliamentary Assembly of the 21 countries of the Council of Europe in a resolu tion passed on 5 May. I am glad to have had the opportunity to provide this information enabling the House to form a clearer view of developments on this tragic matter. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Question No 79 by Mr Cicciomes sere (H-45/87): Subject: Extraordinary meeting of the European Council on the Soviet and US proposals for the reduction of nuclear arms sys tems in Europe Does not the Council consider that the European Council should be convened as a matter of urgency to discuss the proposals made by the Soviet Union and the United States for reducing the nuclear arms systems deployed in Europe and to define a single Community position on this sub ject? TINDEMANS, President-in-Office of the Foreign Min isters. \u2014 (NL) The question raised by the honourable Member has not been discussed at ministerial level in the context of European political cooperation. The general view is that conditions are not right for the European Council to have a fruitful discussion on this subject. CICCIOMESSERE (NI). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, once again I am asking you a question that requires a pre cise answer, the more so since I know that you person ally are in favour of this proposal. I should like to know which governments opposed the proposal which you, too, were in favour of. ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/163 TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I have to reply in this House on behalf of the Twelve, and in that capacity I cannot answer the question just asked. MARTIN, David (ED). \u2014 I should like to ask the President-in-Office a simple question: does he not agree that the Soviet and US proposals represent a his toric and perhaps unique opportunity to reduce ten sion in the European continent between East and West? In the remaining time he has in office what will he do to encourage Member States who are also mem bers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to seize this historic opportunity to reduce the number of short and medium-range weapons on this continent? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) Speaking on behalf of the Twelve, I am not in a position to answer the honoura ble Member's question. I could perhaps give my per sonal views, but in the Council, as matters stand at present, military matters are not discussed. These matters are examined in the Western European Union or NATO. I am not here to speak for those organizations. LIZIN (S). \u2014 (FR) I fully appreciate that the Presi dent-in-Office might be reluctant to give anything other than personal replies to these questions, but it is nevertheless clear that security as such is one of the areas of competence falling within the province of pol itical cooperation. Could he perhaps, without entering into the military details of the matter, tell us of his thinking on how it will eventually become possible to hold practical dis cussions on security in the context of political cooper ation at a time when the options in Europe are more open than they have ever been. Approaching the subject from this security angle, could he perhaps give us some views? Even with these amendments, therefore, the military aspects do not come within the range of European political cooperation. It would not only be unjustified but even most impru dent of me to say any more at this stage. I should not like any statement made by me to be used in a Mem ber State as an argument against approving the Single European Act. CHRISTENSEN (ARC). \u2014 (DA) I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the answer he gave to Mrs Lizin. I assume that it is firmly established that military questions, in the event that the Single European Act is ratified and that the Treaty on European Political Cooperation comes into force, lie outside EPC under the wording of the Treaty and that a question such as that raised here, namely nuclear weapons systems, also falls outside EPC. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I think my answer was clear. I would add that the Twelve have agreed on three conclusions as far as analysis of the situation is con cerned. First, what is going on at present in Moscow is more than just a matter of tactics or propaganda. Secondly, we must be doubly vigilant: we cannot ignore what is happening in Moscow, but must watch developments closely so that we can seize all oppor tunities of improving our relations; at the same time, we must not allow ourselves to fall victim to our own naivety or misinterpretation of the situation. Finally, these proposals from Moscow must be trans lated into something concrete in the forums where arms control and disarmament are discussed, namely in Vienna and Geneva: then we could organize a real debate from which positive results could flow. That, in a few words, is the position as it has been understood by the Twelve in the context of political cooperation. TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) Members of this Parliament know that there has been a twofold development in Europe since 1957: on the one side, European econo mic integration, on the basis of the Treaties of Paris and Rome, and, on the other, since the early 1970s, political cooperation. As yet, however, there is no basis for political cooperation in a treaty. If the Single European Act is approved by the Twelve Member States' parliaments, we shall have a legal basis for pol itical cooperation for the first time. There is no such basis as yet, but the Single European Act, which creates a legal basis for political cooperation, mentions security. However, it stipulates that the scope is con fined to the political and economic aspects of security, excluding the military aspects. ULBURGHS (NI). \u2014 (NL) Is the President-in-Office not in a certain sense at variance with the President of the Commission, who, if I am not mistaken, certainly wishes to see Community initiatives being developed? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (NL) I am speaking here on behalf of the Twelve, but I can assure the honourable Mem ber that I am not at variance with Mr Delors \u2014 as he has repeatedly assured me \u2014 and that the Council is unanimous on the positions I have defended.

Earlier today during the vote on the von Wogau and Baron Crespo report on the Single European Act, I put a question to the Commission and to the President-in-Office of the Council. The Presi\u00ad dent-in-Office was not present at the time. The Presi\u00ad dent of the Commission answered my question. If Mr Tindemans would now answer my question, it would be considerable assistance to us in Ireland who will shortly be involved in a referendum on the Single Act. People there who are against the Single Act are put\u00ad ting forward the case that if Ireland rejects that Act, it can be renegotiated. I should like to ask Mr Tinde- mans for his comments on that idea? TINDEMANS. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, if you and the honourable Member agree, \u03a4 should like to answer in Dutch, since I have a carefully prepared answer, hav\u00ad ing been asked the same question this afternoon by journalists. Those who have already been won over to the Euro\u00ad pean ideal cannot accept a new round of negotiations on the European Single Act. To them the Single Act means a step in the right direction on the road to European unification. A new round of negotiations on this subject would constitute a retrograde step. It would be totally unacceptable.

Questions to the Commission Question No 3, by Mr M\u00e4her (H-507/86) Subject: Harnessing wind power Will the Commission say whether it will consider setting up a pilot project to test the via bility of using wind power to pump water from a lake to a suitable adjacent mountain top from where the water can be used to generate electricity? Answer As a general rule, the Commission supports wind power projects as part of its overall research and development activities and as part of its demonstration programme. As the honourable Member suggests, wind power can be used to pump water from a lake or river towards a mountain top. The water thus stored at altitude can then be used to generate electricity as required. The Commission is currently supporting two such pilot projects, one in Scotland and one in Italy. It is naturally ready to consider, in accordance with normal procedures, any simi lar projects which might be submitted when calls for tender are made as part of the demonstration programme. However, it should be borne in mind that relatively few sites in the Community possess all the characteristics (sufficient wind, presence of a lake or river, mountains) needed if such an installation is to be set up. Question No 5, by Mr MacSharry (H-631/86) Subject: Food and consumer health Given the excessive amounts of misinformation about the health aspects of food, and the difficulty in finding objective information on the subject, would the Commission consider that it might be a useful step to commission an objective expert report on the role of ani mal fats in nutrition? Answer I can sympathize with the honourable Member's concern that clear and scientifically based information on the relationship between diet and health should be readily available. There are several scientific studies which have been published and are now in the public domain. For example, the report of the Committee of Medical Aspects of Food Policy in the UK. I understand also that a report on the relationship between diet and health has been prepared by the World Health Organization and is due to be published in the near future. I do not think therefore it would be a sensible use of resources for the Commission to fund a further study. What is clear is that the public need full information to enable them to choose a balanced and healthy diet. The Commission is therefore drawing up a proposal for a directive on nutritional labelling and will send it to the Council and the Parliament later this year. The ",

Question No 8, by Mr Garcia Arias (H-874/86) Subject: EEC-Brazil Cooperation Agreement \u2014 new cooperation projects with Brazil How does the Commission view the application of the EEC-Brazil Cooperation Agree ment? What new cooperation projects have been started as a result of the Commission's recent visit to Brazil? What are likely to be the practical results of the meeting held with representatives of the economic and social sectors? Answer The EEC-Brazil Cooperation Agreement is being steadily implemented and the Commis sion is constantly striving to develop this cooperation. Accordingly, during a visit in December 1986 Mr Cheysson made a proposal to the Bra zilian authorities to investigate with the Commission the best means of helping small and medium-sized Brazilian and European undertakings to cooperate with each other for their mutual benefit. He also proposed a conference between the telecommunications auth orities of the Community and those of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay (who decided in July 1986 to commence a process of gradual and sectoral integration) to consider possible areas of cooperation between the two regions in this field. At the practical level, a consultant is already working on the project concerning small and medium-sized undertakings, and with regard to telecommunications a preparatory meet ing for the planned conference is now being organized. Question No 10, by Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso (H-895/86) Subject: Subsidies for consumer education in schools Consumer information and training for children are becoming a necessity and should become part of school curricula. What projects relating to consumer education at school has the Commission subsidized in the last five years? Answer The honourable Member is referred to the answer which the Commission gave to his question (No H-894/86) at the April part-session of the European Parliament. Question No 11, by Mr Arbeloa Muru (H-906/86) Subject: Problem of African debt Has the Commission taken any steps to ensure that the international financial community gives urgent consideration to the indebtedness of the poorest African countries? ",
        "13. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/167 Answer The Commission is well aware of the seriousness of the problems which the present debt situation creates for certain African nations with low incomes. Acting in the context of its institutional powers, the Commission endeavours to contribute towards finding a solution by operating along two lines: \u2014 effective use of Community cooperation instruments, especially the Lom\u00e9 Conven tion; \u2014 coordination of the policies pursued by the Member States at bilateral level and within international financial bodies such as the World Bank, the IMF and the Club of Paris. In the former case, the Commission pursues its aim by supporting ACP countries' sectoral policies, by concentrating resources on areas of priority and by making use of flexible and rapidly administered instruments (sectoral import programmes, Stabex, etc). In the latter case, the Commission has drawn up and submitted to the Member States a number of major ideas, 1 also presented at the UN General Assembly's extraordinary meeting on Africa: increase in aid to developing countries, boosting of IDA resources, improved terms for the rescheduling of debts to the Club of Paris, cancellation of certain debts, etc. The Commission will also give every encouragement to the initiatives of certain Member States at the recent IBRD-IMF meetings in Washington, since certain of these initiatives echo to a very great extent the ideas outlined by the Commission in its com munication on Africa. Question No 12, by Mr Pegado Liz (H-929/86) Subject: Community research policy Can the Commission state the exact position with respect to the Community budget for the R&D programme? In particular, which states are blocking the Commission's proposal, which is fully supported by Parliament, what will be the effect of this delay on pro grammes such as Esprit and RACE? Answer The Commission is sorry to note that the situation with regard to the decision on the framework research programme for 1987-1992 has not changed since Parliament's debate on this matter last month. Eleven countries have accepted the compromise put forward by the Belgian Presidency. One Member State has unfortunately not yet indicated its posi tion. Although the Commission has serious misgivings, it feels with the Parliament that this compromise offers the last opportunity to find a solution for the continuation of the Community's research and technology policy, as the disadvantages of a withdrawal of the Commission proposal for a framework programme would be substantially greater than those of implementing the Community R&D programme at a reduced level. The implications of the delays which are building up are becoming more and more appar ent. This is particularly true in the case of specific programmes which have had no fol low-up programmes since the end of last year (RACE, medical research, science and technology for development). It is also true for the programmes which will shortly be coming up for renewal (Esprit, Fusion, Community reference bureau). Any interruption in the continuity of the programmes is bound to result in a loss of credi bility with our partners in the economy, whose long-term cooperation as partners is essen- 1 Communication to the Council and Parliament on development problems in Africa, COM(86) 179 final.

Another result will be the gradual dispersal of European research teams which have been created for the purpose of the Community projects. From June onwards the contracts of 65 researchers on the Esprit programme will have to be terminated each month. The prospects of responding successfully to the challenge of technology will also diminish, and the attainment of the internal market for high technology products will be delayed. Question No 18, by Mr Wijsenbeek (H-21/87) Subject: Grants for European conservation organizations I am gratified to note that the Commission has provided the National Union of Italian Hunting Associations (NAVI) with financial support for a publicity campaign on the pro tection of birds of prey, in particular the honey buzzard. With reference also to Written Question No 2244/86, by Mrs Squarcialupi, would the Commission state whether it is prepared to take more such initiatives? Is the Commission also prepared to award a grant to the Federation of Hunting Associa tions of the EEC (FACE), under Item 6617 of the budget, for similar campaigns on con servation and on the protection of wild fauna? Answer The organization to which the honourable Member refers is not understood to have pre sented a funding application. All such applications will, of course, be considered on their merits according to the prevailing criteria. Question No 23, by Mr Pearce (H-53/87) Subject: Restrictive airline practices What steps is the Commission taking to prohibit mergers and cooperative agreements between State airlines (which are often monopolies and often inefficient), such as that between Sabena and SAS, such mergers having the effect of reducing competition, keep ing prices high, protecting inefficiency and harming the interests of passengers? Answer The EEC Treaty does not contain any explicit merger control provision such as is to be found in Article 66 of the ECSC Treaty. However, a merger can run counter to Article 86 of the EEC Treaty if it involves the strengthening of an already existing dominant posi tion. The Commission is not aware that any airline which already enjoys a dominant posi tion in a substantial part of the Community has strengthened that position by purchasing a controlling interest in another airline. As regards other forms of cooperative agreement the Commission formally requested ten of the major national airlines of the Community in July 1986 to bring an end to certain restrictive practices which the Commission considered to be in contravention of the com petition rules of the Treaty. All airlines have now responded positively to this request. The national flag carrying airlines are also facing increased competition from new entrants, particularly on routes to and from the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland. ",
        "13. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/169 This is a trend which will increase with the expected adoption by the Council in June this year of measures to reduce restrictions on market access, tariffs and capacity. This will create and environment in which increased competition will be possible. Question No 24, by Mr Ca\u00f1o Pinto (H-64/87) Subject: Budget deficit in 1987 According to the Commission's estimates, the anticipated budget deficit for 1987 will be in the region of 400 million ECU, a figure so large as to make any effective adjustment impossible. Furthermore, other factors arising from previous policies will generate un avoidable additional expenditure not provided for in the budget. In view of this situation, what measures is the Commission taking, or will it take, to ensure that this anticipated deficit does not provoke a real financial crisis which would make it impossible to honour the commitments provided for in the budget? Answer In his letter of 10 April to the Heads of State or Government, President Delors announced that the Commission intends to deal with the 1987 budget situation by: (i) submitting a Supplementary and Amending Budget for 1987 to cover the 1986 budget deficit and the 1987 net revenue shortfall; (ii) proposing a change in the system for financing the Common Agricultural Policy to replace advances by reimbursements to Member States. The content of these proposals were outlined in an aide-memoire from the Commission to the budgetary authority of 10 April. This aide-memoire also analyses the very serious financial situation of the Community for 1987. Vice-President Christophersen will make a statement to the European Parliament on 14 May giving more details of these proposals. Question No 25, by Mr Hughes (H-77/87) Subject: ERDF moneys Will the Commission comment on the position concerning a local authority which has an agreed ERDF offer yet finds itself unable to proceed because of national government rul ings, etc.? Would the Commission outline the position the local authority would find itself in were this to happen and can it outline the procedure for terminating the offer should a local authority find itself unable to act because of such central government rules? Answer ERDF assistance is payable on the basis of public expenditure on eligible investments. A request from a local authority for ERDF assistance for a specific measure is in the first instance submitted to the competent authority in the Member State. ",
        "No 2-352/170 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 The Member State may subsequently decide to forward an application to the Commission for the granting of such aid, for example, as part of a programme. If following a Commission decision approving the Member State's application for ERDF assistance for the specific measure submitted by the local authority, it was not possible to implement the action in question for whatever reason, the Commission automatically decommits the funding involved and allocates it to an appropriate alternative action in the same Member State under the conditions laid down in the ERDF Regulation (EEC) No 1787/84 of 19 June 1984. Where an operation has not been the object of any payment for four years and where no explanation for the delay has been received from the Member State concerned within a period fixed by the Commission, that operation shall be considered not to have been exe cuted and that part of the ERDF assistance shall be reallocated. The Commission normally carries out the decommitment/reallocation procedure follow ing discussions with the national and local authorities involved with the object of finding a mutually acceptable solution. Question No 26, by Mr Christiansen (H-82/87) Subject: Danish legislation relating to asbestos The Danish Folketing has adopted an action plan for an asbestos-free Denmark. In con nection with the implementation of this plan, a promulgation order prohibits the use of asbestos in the brakes of new cars as from 1 April 1988. The Commission has informed Denmark that it cannot endorse this move and will, if necessary, bring the matter before the Court of Justice. Would the Commission have taken this stance if Article 100A of the Single Act had entered into force? Answer The Commission has issued a detailed opinion on the notification by Denmark relating to the use of asbestos in brake linings in Denmark. As in a similar previous case involving another Member State, the Commission has taken the view that the proposed measures would constitute an infringement of Article 30. As to the future applicability of Article 100A to these measures, the Commission has not yet completed its assessment of the implications of the Single European Act for the com pletion of the Internal Market, Parliament will be informed about the Commission's views in due course. It is clear, however, that the provisions of Article 100A, paragraph 4, of the EEC Treaty, as amended, open a possibility for Member States to apply national provisions under cer tain conditions and under the control of the Commission and the Court of Justice. It should be recalled that, according to paragraph 3 of Article 100A, the Commission will base its proposals for measures concerning environmental protection on a high level of protection. Question No 27, by Mr Clinton (H-83/87) Subject: Competition in the air transport industry What does the Commission propose to do to increase competition in the air transport industry by bringing to an end exclusion of small carriers (such as Aer Lingus) who are ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/171 situated on the periphery of the Community, from the main air transport markets in Europe, which would involve the immediate provision of worthwhile opportunities for fifth freedom operations (whereby airlines could carry traffic between two Member States other than their home State)? Answer The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that it would be useful to expand the possibilities of fifth freedom operations in the EEC. This would be of particular importance in the context of the completion of the internal market where fifth freedom for air transport represents the principle of the free movement of services. Already in its proposal 1 of 1980 on interregional air services the Commission proposed the introduction of fifth freedom rights. Unfortunately the Council did not accept this part of the proposal. Nevertheless the Commission has included fifth freedom rights again in its proposal 2 of 1986 to modify the existing directive 3 on interregional air services. Furthermore the principle of fifth freedom has now been included in the present negotia tions in the Council on legislation concerning market access for air transport as a whole. The Commission supports this development strongly and would expect the package of measures to be adopted by the Council in June to include genuine progress of the fifth freedom services. Question No 28, by Mr McCartin (H-84/87) Subject: Cooperative possibilities for smaller airlines Does the Commission appreciate the extent to which small airlines (such as Aer Lingus), situated on the periphery of the Community and with limited resources, depend on certain cooperative activities with other carriers in order to hold their own competitive position against much larger carriers based in the populous central Member States; and will the Commission undertake to ensure that these cooperative possibilities remain open to those small carriers? Answer The Commission has proposed a balanced package of liberalizing measures to the Council including draft instruments on fares, market access and capacity. The Commission has also proposed to exempt from the application of the competition rules certain agreements and practices between airlines with a view to enabling the air transport industry to adapt to a more competitive environment. These agreements and practices include the major forms of cooperation between airlines such as, for example, arrangements relating to capa city planning, revenue sharing, tariff consultations, computer reservation systems, slot allocation at airports and handling services. Moreover, a more liberal capacity, tariff and in particular route access r\u00e9gime is of special interest to peripheral carriers such as Aer Lingus. There is no reason to believe that Aer Lingus is not sufficiently competitive to take advantage of the opportunities that this new r\u00e9gime will offer. COM(80) 624 def.

Answer The Commission fully shares the view that in the unified Community market to be achieved by 1992, an industrial structure policy must include powers for assessment of mergers between firms in different Member States which are becoming more and more common. The most rational solution economically would be prior and speedy vetting based on compulsory notification of proposed mergers of Community significance. If, despite its commitment to remove the remaining internal barriers in the Community, the Council should remain unwilling to enter into a constructive discussion of the Commis sion's proposals, the Commission ought to consider alternatives. It is worth noting in this connection that the Parliament, in its resolution on last year's report, advised the Com mission to withdraw its proposal now before the Council. Without a regulation the Com mission would have to fall back on its powers of ex post vetting of certain types of mergers. Question No 30, by Mr Barros Moura (H-91/87) Subject: Specific Programme for the Development of Portuguese Industry (PEDIP) In its communication on the PEDIP, the Commission proposed that a National Pro gramme of Community interest for Portugal be drawn up instead. The communication was accompanied by an announcement indicating that a technical group would be sent to Portugal to collect further information and sound out the political and social forces. This visit took place but strangely, after almost three months, there is no trace of the findings. Can the Commission state who is responsible for presenting a report based on the above- mentioned visit so that the objectives of the declaration by the EEC on the adaption and modernization of the Portuguese economy and the aims of Protocol 21 annexed to the Portuguese Treaty of Accession can be implemented, and why this report has not yet been drawn up? Answer The Commission spoke about the PEDIP on the basis of its communication of 17 October 1986 (COM(86) 552 final) at the meeting of the Council of Industry Ministers on 20 October 1986. In its communication the Commission noted 'that most of the measures envisaged in the PEDIP programme would be eligible for support from the existing struc tural funds. In particular, the efforts already made or planned in the fields of technology, innovation and regional adjustments would be likely to qualify for assistance from various structural instruments (Social Fund, ERDF, assistance under the transnational plan for the development of innovation infrastructure, ECSC budget).' After the Council meeting of 20 October 1986 the Council statement was acted upon in the form of closer cooperation between the Portuguese Government and the Commission departments. In January of this year a delegation of Commission officials travelled to Por- ",

This cooperation has meant that in concrete terms Portugal received considerable resources from the Community structural funds in 1986 and that there will be a significant increase in these funds for 1987. The European Social Fund, for example, will increase its contribution to Portugal by 60% this year. The European Regional Development Fund, which has hitherto financed primarily infrastructure projects, will also continue its activ ity; under consideration at the moment are two integrated development schemes which will in part benefit Portuguese industry (Alto Alentejo and Set\u00fabal). An increase in ECSC aid for the restructuring of the iron and steel sector is also planned. Last but not least, it must be pointed out that considerable financial resources have been directed at Portuguese industry by the European Investment Bank. In 1986 these resources amounted to 190 million ECU and were used mainly for improvements to infrastructure, telecommunications, industrial and tourist industry projects and the energy sector. All this provides a solid basis for future development. The Commission is moreover of the opinion that a significant contribution towards the development and modernization of Portuguese industry may be expected from the plans which are outlined in the proposals to improve economic union. The emphasis placed on the development of regions beset by structural weaknesses will benefit the Portuguese economy. It is particularly important in this respect that the whole of Portugal be consi dered eligible for aid. The Commission would point out that these efforts are affected by the particular budget problems of the Community. There is therefore a special significance to all endeavours to make the Community's financial instruments more effective in the form of integrated pro grammes which ensure that all these instruments are directed to one end. This will also be a particular element in the aid measures for the benefit of the Portuguese economy. Question No 31, by Mr Welsh (H-92/87) Subject: Joint opinion of the social partners on the information and consultation of employees adopted by the working party on the introduction of new tech nologies Would the Commission state its position on the conclusions of the social partners on information and consultation adopted on 6 March 1987 and indicate what proposals it intends to make in the light thereof? Answer The Commission expresses its satisfaction at the joint opinion on the information and consultation of employees in connection with the introduction of new technologies adopted by the social partners on 6 March 1987. It wishes to stress the determination shown by both sides to come to terms with the changes taking place in our industrial societies on the basis of consensus. The Commission is convinced, as set out in paragraph 9 of the above opinion, that if both sides foster the development of such information and consultation procedures it will help them to spread and become standard practice in the Community. In this connection, the Commission intends to include a progress report on discussions between the social partners on this issue at national level in the interim report it is due to submit to the Council of Ministers for Economic Affairs and Finance in July 1987 on the implementation of the Community cooperation strategy for growth and employment.

In the light of developments in the Member States, which it intends to follow with the help of European trade unions and employers' organizations, the Commission will be able to judge whether further specific action on this issue is desirable. Finally, the Commission takes a favourable view of the determination shown by both sides to continue dialogue on the issues of adaptability and flexibility (paragraph 10, second indent of the joint opinion). Question No 32, by Ms Tongue (H-95-87) Subject: EC trade in irradiated foods in order to conceal bacterial contamination In view of the number of cases of trade in foodstuffs between EC Member States which have been irradiated to conceal bacterial contamination at levels that have made these foodstuffs unsaleable, what investigations does the Commission intend to initiate, in colla boration with the Dutch and Belgian Governments, into the activities of the Gammaster plant at Ede in the Netherlands and the Mediris plant at Fleurus in Belgium with a view to eradicating the illegal practice of exporting irradiated food to EC Member States that do not permit irradiation, a practice which undoubtedly poses a public health hazard given that it is undetectable? Answer If the practices referred to are indeed occurring, the Commission shares the concern expressed by the honourable Member. In particular, the sale of irradiated foodstuffs in a Member State where the process in prohibited would be illegal. This, however, is a matter for the enforcement authorities of the Member States in the first instance. The Commission included the irradiation of foodstuffs in the programme attached to the White Paper for the Completion of the Internal Market. The Commission is still consider ing what initiatives to take in this sector, having regard to the Parliament's resolution on the subject voted in the March part-session. The problems referred to by the honourable Member emphasize the complexity and sensitivity of the issue. Question No 33, by Mr Jackson (H-105/8 7) Subject: Plasticized PVC cling film for meat wrapping Is the Commission aware that the German Government intends to withdraw permission for the use of PVC film for meat wrapping from 1 January 1988, and does the Commis sion consider that a de facto ban of this nature, without any proof of danger to public health, is compatible with EEC law? Answer The Commission is aware that the German authorities have withdrawn, with effect from 1 January 1988, a recommendation on flexible PVC film for meat wrapping. Although this recommendation is not a legally binding instrument, its withdrawal has an important ",
        "13. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/175 effect on imports into Germany, as the German authorities have recognized. The Com mission considers that the barrier to intra-Community trade thus created is not justified by reasons relating to the protection of public health; it has therefore started a procedure against Germany on the basis of Article 169 of the EEC Treaty for infringement of Com munity law, and in particular Council Directive 76/893/EEC relating to materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. Question No 34, by Mr Simmonds (H-108/87) Subject: 'Flying Dutchman' \u2014 evasion of regulations by Dutch flower growers Will the Commission please investigate Dutch flower growers who sell their flowers in the UK without either paying VAT on the flowers, or going throught the 'green corner' health regulations? It would appear that flower growers who are not members of the Dutch registered Co-op export and sell their flowers (95% of which are not inspected), thereby undercutting the price of other European Community, including British, growers. Will the Commission also assess in terms of volume and cash how much produce is exported from Holland to the UK in this way? Answer The matter raised by the honourable Member linked to the implementation of the final regulations in force in the United Kingdom as well as the Community law regulating the trade of the products concerned within the EEC. As of yet, no Community law harmonizes the VAT rates applicable to goods and services in the Member States. Consequently, and in order to avoid double taxations, Directive 77/388/EEC specifies that no VAT (0% rate) is levied by the authorities of the exporting country, the operator concerned having to pay the VAT in the importing country at the rate fixed by the law in force in that country. In the case raised by the honourable Mem ber, the VAT rate levied by the British authorities is 15%. Besides, any Member State's grower is free to export his products to and sell them in any other Member State, as far as he complies with the various rules in force. Up to the pres ent time, the Commission has not received any complaint from the British Government or from British operators accusing the Dutch flower growers of breaching Community law in any way. The Commission will however request the observations of the Netherlands and United Kingdom authorities on the matter. As far as phytosanitary controls are concerned, Directive 77/93/EEC provides the United Kingdom authorities with all means necessary for checking effectively the sanitary state of the flowers presented to them for importation into the UK: systematic checks of the phy tosanitary certificates accompanying the products concerned and completed by the auth orities of the exporting Member States which have checked the flowers before shipping according to the directive; phytosanitary spot checks on the products themselves under the condition that these checks are not multiplied in a way constituting a disguised restric tion in trade between the Member States; safeguard measures in case of emergency. With regard to chrysanthemums coming from the Netherlands, the UK authorities are responsible for checking by the means provided as a safeguard measure ('green corner health regulation') by Decision 84/58/EEC that these products meet some additional requirements especially designed to protect the UK's territory against the danger of intro ducing the Puccinia horiana (chrysanthemum white rust).

        "No 2\u00ad352/176 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 The honourable Member will appreciate that as the Commission has no knowledge of the irregularities alleged by him, it is impossible for it to answer the last part of this question. Question No 37, by Mr Did\u00f2 (H\u00ad114/87) Subject: Public invitation to tender on the action programme for SMUs: setting up of Centres for European Business Information Can the Commission say whether, in applying the criteria laid down for selecting candi\u00ad dates, it intends to give special consideration to applicants which, by virtue of their public nature and institutional objectives, offer objective guarantees of providing the best assist\u00ad ance to small and medium\u00adsized undertakings in all branches of economic activity (e.g. Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Agriculture and Crafts, or equivalent bodies in other sectors) and whether, in selecting the pilot centres, it will try to cover the varying regional situations in the Member States, so as to obtain more useful experimental data? Answer The pilot phase of the scheme for Centres of European Business Information recently commenced with an invitation to apply directed at all interested bodies. More than 200 applications have been received so far and are now being considered. It must be remem\u00ad bered that this pilot operation is an integral part of the action programme for small and medium\u00adsized enterprises which was adopted by the Council on 3 November 1986 and that it is included among the new priorities of the general information policy in the Community. The purpose of the Centres for European Business Information is to respond to the demand of firms for information on Community activities and programmes and also to help and advise firms in their dealings with the Community. In addition to supplying information on the activities of the Community, the Centres will provide a special link between the Community and firms and will enable the latter to take more rapid and effec\u00ad tive advantage of the European dimension offered by the internal market and will also enable the Community to have a better understanding of the requirements of the firms which will determine the future of European production. In this context, it will be vital for the Centres to be fully integrated in the activities of a. body which already has a solid place in the local or regional industrial fabric. This body must make available specific resources of manpower, equipment and premises, and at the same time must assume responsibility for the operation of the Centres. For its part, the Community \u2014 acting through the working party on SMEs \u2014 will provide documentation and access to certain data banks and will be responsible for the training of staff and for the \u25a0technical operation of the scheme. It is therefore clear that the fundamental criteria for selecting the 28 Centres involved in the pilot phase will be their commitment to SMEs and their ability to carry out a general compaign of information and encouragement for the benefit of firms, whatever the legal status \u2014 public, parastatal or private \u2014 which governs the present operation of the host body. In order to ensure the experimental nature of the pilot phase, various types of bodies which satisfy these criteria will be selected. Their location will depend on the desire to spread them in a balanced fashion throughout the Community. The general details of the pilot scheme for these Centres were outlined in the communication by Mr Matutes to the Commission on 1 April 1987. The working party on SMEs can provide the honourable Member with a copy. ",

Would the Commission say whether it envisages including the cultivation of aromatic plants, which is widespread in the Community countries, within the remit of the common agricultural policy? Answer A number of aromatic plants are already covered by the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables and by the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72.' A more vigorous Community policy on aromatic plants could be envisaged in the future as part of the greater diversification of farm production. This is in line with the Commis sion's guidelines on the reform of the common agricultural policy which it presented in a document entitled 'A Future for European Agriculture'. 2 Aromatic plants for human consumption can already take advantage of measures to improve the efficiency of agricultural structures 3 and provisions to improve the conditions under which agricultural products are processed and marketed. 4 Furthermore, producer groups formed for the cultivation of aromatic plants \u2014 other than those covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain \u2014 come under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/78 of 19 June 1978. 5 Finally, as part of its joint research programmes and programmes for coordinating agri cultural research, 6 the Community may finance laboratory research and demonstration projects in the field, especially for aromatic plants.

Yugoslavia's accession to the European Cultural Convention \u2014 which is possible under the terms of Article 9.4 of the convention for countries which are not mem bers of the Council of Europe \u2014 could only strengthen the exercise of these rights. With regard to the specific problem raised by Mr Pinifarina, the Commission is unaware of the alleged facts and cannot therefore comment on any discrimination which might be suffered by Yugoslav citizens of Italian descent. As for the EEC-Yugoslavia Cooperation Agreement \u2014 which has to be renegotiated in certain aspects \u2014 the Commission will repeat what it stated in an earlier reply, to the effect that the aim of the agreement is to promote economic, technical and financial coop eration and to develop the status of national or linguistic minorities. Question No 40, by Mr Comelissen (H-121/87) Subject: Problems in connection with land fertilization in the Belgian-Dutch border area Farmers in the Belgo-Dutch border area currently face serious problems with regard to fertilizing their land in Belgium because of measures adopted by the Flemish Regional Government banning imports of fertilizer on to Belgian territory. Does the Commission share the view that farmers in the border area should be allowed to fertilize, from both countries, land on the other side of the border which they have owned for a considerable period of time or of which they have the long-term use, provided of course that the fertilizer and the method of fertilizing comply with the standards obtain ing in the area concerned; and is the Commission prepared to make approaches on this matter, if necessary, to the Belgian authorities? Answer The Commission has already initiated an infringement procedure, under Article 169 of the EEC Treaty, against Belgium, as it considers that the ban imposed by the Flemish regional government on imports of liquid manure originating in other Member States in breach of Articles 30 to 36 of the EEC Treaty. The Commission will see to it that the specific prob lem raised by the honourable Member finds a solution in the broader context of that infr ingement procedure. Question No 41, by Mrs Lehideux (H-l23/87) Subject: Cultivation of date palms In view of the extent of desertification in Africa, but also in Spain, does the Commission propose to do anything to encourage the growing of date palms in areas of the Com munity which are turning into desert, and what is its policy on this matter when it comes to aid for African countries affected by the process in question? It should be pointed out that the date palm stands up to almost anything and, by creating a microcosm, makes it possible for fruit trees, vines and other food crops to be grown underneath it. As a foodstuff, moreover, dates are easy to preserve and have a high energy value owing to their high sugar content. ",
        "13. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/179 Answer 1. In the Community The Commission is aware of the problems of spreading desertification, the consequence of which is erosion in the arid and semi-arid areas of Spain and other southern regions of the Community. In an effort to cambat this phenomenon, the Commission has for a long time been helping several of these areas by means of regulations and other measures which include forestry in integrated regional programmes. Mention may be made of Regulations No 269/79 1 for the south of France and much of Italy, No 1975/82 2 and No 619/84 3 for Greece, No 3828/85\"' for Portugal and No 2088/86 5 on Integrated Mediterranean Pro grammes. Forestry measures in these regulations include afforestation and the replanting of damaged forests, as well as other measures such as protection against forest fires. The Commission does not play any part, however, in selecting the trees to be planted in the afforestation schemes covered by these regulations. The Member States concerned with the preparation and implementation of these schemes are responsible for this aspect. In its role as coordinator, the Commission encourages the Member States to exchange information on the merits of various types of tree, including date palms. Furthermore, as part of its subprogramme of agricultural research (AGRI-MED), the Commission acts as coordinator for the Member States affected by the problem of desertification. 2. In Africa The forestry sector has a priority place in the action plan for the conservation of natural resources and for the campaign against desertification which was launched by the Com munity in 1986. Programmes for reafforestation and for the conservation of existing forests are under way. A considerable amount of research and experimental work on date palms has been planned by the Member States and certain African countries. Im January 1988 the Commission is to organize a seminar to assess and exchange the results of this work. Question No 42, by Mr Stewart (H-l25/87) Subject: Free movement of professional footballers In view of Commissioner Marin's statement to introduce a free market for professional footballers, does the Commission not think this is taking the free market philosophy too far? Do they not recognize that this will mean the cessation of professional football as a sport, that it will take away incentives from youngsters in amateur teams to reach the major clubs of their choice; that it will create a monopoly of choice for rich clubs such that, for example, major teams could comprise eleven foreign players, which would be unrepresen tative of the area within which the club resides; and is this not in breach of the competi tion rules of the Treaty? Answer The Commission refers the honourable Member to the answer it gave to the recent oral question by Mr Ephremidis (H-954/86) on the same subject. OJL 38 of 14 February 1970. OJL 214 of 22 July 1982. OJL 68 of 10 March 1984. OJ L 372 of 31 December 1985. OJL 197 of 27 July 1985. ",
        "No 2-352/180 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 More particularly, the Commission, as guardian of the treaties and in accordance with Article 155 of the Treaty, must ensure the correct application of the principle of the free movement of persons as recognized in favour of professional footballers by the Court of Justice in Case 13/76 (Dona Mantero). It should be added that Community law, as stated explicitly by the Court of Justice in its ruling on the above case, does not preclude the application of rules or procedures prevent ing foreign players taking part in certain matches for non-economic reasons based on the nature of these matches and the specific context in which they take place, and thus con cerned solely with sport as such, as in the case of matches between national teams from different countries. Question No 43, by Mr Eyraud (H-81/87) Subject: Common organization of the market (COM) in sheepmeat Council Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 1 on the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat allowed the Member States to choose between two methods of obtaining compensation for loss of income. The fourth amended version of this regulation has restricted this option, which was previously open to all Member States, to the United Kingdom alone. This means that there are now two different systems for compensation within one and the same common organization of the market. Is this not contrary to Article 40(3) of the Treaty of Rome, which states that the common organization of agri cultural markets 'shall exclude any discrimination between producers or consumers within the Community'? Answer The basic regulation (EEC No 1837/80) in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector allows for the payment of a premium, expressed as a ewe premium, which takes account of the dif ference between the market price in each region and the Community basic price. How ever, in making this regulation, the Council, recognizing the peculiarities particular to the markets in the different regions permitted, within the premium system common to all, the operation of support measures on a weekly basis would take account of these peculiarities. Thus in the basic Regulation, as originally constructed, Member States were given the choice between a variable premium system which would bring the weekly market price up to the weekly intervention level or a public intervention system which would be available should certain conditions be fulfilled. At the time the United Kingdom chose the variable premium system while all other Member States chose the intervention system. Subse quently in order to overcome specific problems related to Northern Ireland the variable premium system was replaced there by the intervention system 2 leaving the variable pre mium system operational only in Great Britain which, for sheepmeat and goatmeat pur poses, then became a separate region of the Community. The limitation of the different weekly support systems to those actually operating in the different regions of the Community by the Council 3 at the start of the 1984/85 marketing year, after a four year period in which the various marketing structures within the regions had been gradually adjusted, cannot be construed as being contrary to Article 40-3 of the Treaty. This is due to the fact that it did not in any way interfere with the common sup port measure in the sector, namely the annual ewe premium, which, as in 1980 at the start of the common organization of the market, continues to fulfil that role for all regions. I would point out to the honourable Member that the Commission has undertaken to bring forward its report to the Council on the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector from prior 1 OJL 183 of 16 July 1980, p. 1. 2 Council Regulation (EEC) No 1195/82. 3 Council Regulation (EEC) No 871/84.

Question No 44, by Mr Marshall (H-l 2 7/8 7) Subject: Transport of animals Would the Commission consider introducing a limit of, say, 12 hours on the length of journey animals may make when being transported to the slaughterhouse? Answer An extensive examination of the question of limiting the final journey to the abattoir of animals for immediate slaughter has been made by the Standing Committee for Agricul tural Research. The results of this enquiry indicated that more information is needed, not only on the time of such journeys but also on many other factors affecting the welfare of animals during transportation. The Commission has, therefore, devoted resources to research projects and field studies with a view to obtaining a sound basis for any proposals which may be necessary to this sector. As this work is currently in progress, it would be premature for the Commission to make any specific proposals at this time. Question No 45, by Mrs Lizin (H-l29/87) Subject: International conference on nuclear safety Would the Commission be willing to take part in organizing an international conference on nuclear safety in association with the Soviet authorities? Answer The Commission is presently engaged in fulfilling its commitments put forward in the framework communication on the consequences of Chernobyl and in the communication on the application of Chapter Three 'Health and Safety' of the Euratom Treaty that were submitted last year. In the session of April, my colleague Mr Mosar and myself informed the Parliament on the progress we are making and on the difficulties we are facing in this field. The Commission is convinced that international cooperation in particular in the field of radiological protection, nuclear safety and environment must be intensified between all countries. The prevention of severe accidents and the management and mitigation of their consequences comport a dimension that goes beyond the traditional political and adminis trative boundaries. The aspect of information to the public will be dealt with by the first meeting of the standing conference on health and safety in the nuclear age, which will be held in autumn. Further, the Community is currently engaged in the very important process of elaborating and reaching agreement on permanent upper limits for radioactive contamination of food stuffs. ",
        "No 2-352/182 Debates of the European Parliament 13.5.87 Taking this into account, the Commission considers that the organization \u2014 at an appro priate time \u2014 of an international conference on nuclear safety with the participation of the Soviet Union, as proposed by the honourable Member, Mrs Lizin, could be a positive further step on the way of cooperation in a wider European context. The institutional framework in which a conference of this type should be organized and the nature of the participation of the Commission in its organization need to be carefully evaluated, taking into account in particular the activities of the IAEA which has an essen tial role in worldwide cooperation in the field of nuclear safety. Question No 46, by Mr Megahy (H-l 32/87) Subject: Unemployed persons who are EC nationals seeking work in parts of the Community outside their place of nationality European Community nationals who travel to the United Kingdom to seek employment, and who are involuntarily unemployed whilst genuinely seeking work, are informed in writing by the Home Office that: EC nationals who are unable to support themselves and fall a charge on public funds may be required to leave the United Kingdom and that they have no leave to remain in this country and . . . should make immediate arrangements to leave. Is this in keeping with the UK's Treaty obligations as a member of the European Com munity and do EC nationals travelling to other Member States in search of employment have any right to claim benefits under non-contributory welfare schemes? In view of its commitment to freedom of movement for workers in the EC does the Commission have any plans to increase the ability of the unemployed to seek work throughout the Com munity without fear of destitution? Answer In general terms the principle of freedom of movement for workers within the Com munity enshrined in Articles 48 to 51 of the EEC Treaty implies the right of a worker to take any job available and thus to reside in any Member State. A worker seeking employment cannot enjoy full right of residence because he has no job. In order to demonstrate briefly how the Community legislation apprehends this situation, a distinction should be drawn between the hypothesis of the unemployed person receiving benefit in a Member State who moves to another Member State in order to seek employ ment, and that of the unemployed person who does not fulfil the conditions for the pay ment of unemployment benefit under the legislation of the State in which he lost his job. 1. The first hypothesis is covered by Article 69 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, under the terms of which an unemployed worker receiving unemployment benefit under the legislation of a Member State retains the right to such benefit for a maximum period of three months if he moves to another Member State to seek employment. The benefit is then paid by the institution of the latter State and defrayed by the for mer State. If the worker returns to the State responsible before the three-month period expires, he retains the right to benefit in accordance with the law of that State. He loses all such rights if he returns after this period has expired. ",

In the case of the unemployed worker not in receipt of unemployment benefit under the legislation of his State of origin or who does not fulfil the conditions for the appli\u00ad cation of Article 69 of Regulation 1408/71, he can be refused residence in another Member State if he does not find a job within three months of entering its territory, 1 or even before this period has expired if, having failed to find a job, he becomes a burden on public funds. This situation is covered by the declaration made by the Member States at the time of the adoption of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 on free\u00ad dom of movement for workers within the Community. However, the application of this declaration is limited by the fact that the only compulsory formality on entry into a Member State is the presentation of national identity papers. Question No 47, by Mrs Bonino (H-l36/87) Subject: Action taken on the resolution (Doc. \u0392 2-210/87) on Jews in Syria What specific steps have been taken to persuade the Syrian Government to allow members of the Jewish community is Syria who wish to emigrate to do so freely, as urged in the resolution (Doc. \u0392 2-210/87) adopted by the European Parliament on 9 April 1987? What response has the Syrian Government made to the Commission's approaches? Answer The Commission has always paid careful attention to problems of human rights and has on numerous occasions stated its strong opposition to any violation of these rights. The Commission understands the honourable Member's concern and is monitoring the situation. However, the problem referred to is not directly covered by the cooperation agreement between the Community and Syria. As a result, it is not easy to undertake any direct action, which might in any case achieve results which would be contrary to those sought. The Commission nevertheless intends to pursue its efforts to improve the human rights situation in every country with which the Community has cooperation links and it will take every opportunity to make the Syrian authorities aware of the importance attached to a fair settlement of the problem to which the honourable Member refers.

It has also been reported that this company qualifies for Community aid to set up in the United Kingdom. Can the Commission confirm that Proms Kemiske Fabrikker qualifies for Community aid in res pect of its transfer of operations, and what is the Commission's attitude to the granting of aid, in European Environment Year, to companies which are major polluters and only transfer operations to other Member States because environmental requirements are less stringent there? Answer The Commission wishes to inform the honourable Member that the firm whose behaviour he criticizes has received no Community financing to invest in the United Kingdom and has not submitted any application for this purpose. In the event of the firm's being eligible for any Community financing, the Commission would carefully consider the environmen tal aspects of the application before reaching any decision on the granting of aid. Question No 50, by Mr Roelants du Vivier (H-145/8 7) Subject: Plans for monitoring hormones What plans for monitoring hormones has the Commission already received in implemen tation of Directive 86/469/EEC' concerning the examination of animals and fresh meat for the presence of residues? Answer The Directive 86/469/EEC referred to by Mr Roelants du Vivier concerning the exami nation of animals and fresh meat for the presence of residues requires each Member State to submit a plan to the Commission setting out the national measures to be taken to achieve the stated objective of the directive. OJ L 275 of 26 September 1986, p. 36. ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/185 The Member States have until 31 May 1987 to submit their plans in respect of control of hormones and until 31 May 1988 to submit plans relating to the examination of residues of other substances. The Commission has not yet received these plans. Question No 51, by Mr O'Donnell (H-146/87) Subject: Buying-in of beef Is the Commission aware that the delay of 120 days in paying for beef bought into inter vention means that the effective intervention price is at least 4% below market price and that this practice is causing a downward spiral in prices? In view of this can the Commission reduce the delay in paying for intervention stocks so that the intervention mechanism itself does not cause reductions in farm prices? Answer The current delay of 120 days in paying for products bought into public intervention was introduced horizontally a few years ago in all sectors of the common organization of mar kets in which buying-in takes place. These procedures for payment were designed, mainly for budgetary reasons, to reduce the cost and the attractiveness of intervention measures and to encourage a return to a free market system. Given the reduction in the buying-in prices which has just been implemented in the beef sector and the differences in interest rates among the Member States, the Commission will examine, at the appropriate time and in the light of the market situation, whether a reduction in the current delays for pay ment could have a beneficial effect on prices; it would, however, be inappropriate to do so while the negotiations on the farm prices are still in progress in the Council. As regards the risk of a downward spiral in prices, the Commission is following any changes in the market prices closely; this issue was discussed on 24 April at a high-level group meeting involving the Commission and professional organizations in the beef sector, and a number of measures which could be taken, if necessary, to forestall such a collapse in prices were considered. Question No 52, by MrAdamou (H-149/87) Subject: 'Community solidarity' and Turkey's application for membership of the EEC In the dispute between Argentina and the UK over the Falklands, the Community took economic and political measures against Argentina in the name of 'Community solidarity'. Does not the Commission believe that there is an even clearer case for 'Community soli darity' with Greece's reservations regarding Turkey's application for membership of the EEC, viz. the differences between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean and the occupation by Turkish troops of 40% of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus? Question No 53, byMrAlavanos (H-l50/87) Subject: Commission's position on Turkey's application for membership of the EEC In a number of resolutions and, in particular, in the Balfe report of 23 October 1985, which drew attention to the Turkish authorities' continued violation of fundamental ",

To what extent will the Commission respect the European Parliament's position and refrain from delivering an opinion favourable to Turkish membership of the EEC before democratic rights are fully restored in that country? Question No 54, by Mr Ephremidis (H-l 51/87) Subject: Democratic rights and Turkey's application for membership of the EEC The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. The preamble to the Treaty, in the Joint Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 5 April 1977, refers to 'the prime importance they attach to the protection of fundamental rights, as derived . . . from the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . . .'.' In view of the fact that the Turkish regime violates fundamental rights and freedoms with its ban on political activity, persecution of minorities, outlawing of trade unions, political prisoners, etc., to what extent will the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, refrain from delivering an opinion on Turkish application for membership of the Community before democratic rights are fully restored in that country? Joint answer The Commission has been requested by the Council, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 237 of the EEC Treaty, to prepare an opinion on the application by Turkey to become a member of the European Communities. It is the Commission's view that the provisions of the EEC, ECSC and Euratom Treaties require it to carry out this task. Question No 55, by Mrs Boserup (H-l 52/87) Subject: New sources of revenue for the European Community Presenting the Commission's programme for 1987 before the European Parliament on 18 February 1987, the President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, stated that the Com munity's revenue in future should comprise customs duties, agricultural levies, 1% of VAT and a levy on the difference between each Member State's gross national product and its actual VAT base; he also mentioned a fifth source of revenue for the future: the introduction of a stamp duty on financial transactions. Is the Commission's report, according to which (on p. 25 of the English version) '. . . the Commission is proposing that provision be made for the possibility of other resources being introduced, if necessary, between now and 1992 . . .', alluding to the statement by the President of the Commission or is consideration being given to other sources of revenue? If so, which? Answer On page 27 of Document COM(87) 101 the Commission refers to the possibility of intro ducing by 1992 a fifth source of revenue for the Community. In presenting the Commis sion's proposals for the future financing of the Community, Mr Delors mentioned the possibility of introducing a stamp duty on financial transactions. This was an example by OJC 103 of 27 April 1977, p. 1. ",

At the present time, however, there is no con crete proposal with regard to the type or form of any possible fifth source of revenue. Question No 56, by Mr Hackel (H-l 53/87) Subject: Community programme to aid victims of South Africa's policy of apartheid Have draft projects relating to the Community's programme to aid victims of South Africa's policy of apartheid, and formulated in accordance with the Commission's guide lines, been rejected by a Commission-appointed body and, if so, on what grounds? Answer The special Community programme to aid victims of apartheid is implemented through four channels in South Africa: the Council of South African Churches, the Catholic Con ference of Southern African Bishops, the Kasigo Trust and trade union bodies. The cri teria for assessing projects which are submitted have been drawn up jointly by the Com mission and its South African partners. Every project which is submitted to these partners in South Africa is assessed with regard to its compliance with the criteria which have been established and with regard to its technical aspects. According to the information received by the Commission, no project which has satisfied the criteria has been rejected. II. Questions to the Council Question No 62, by Mr Boutos (H-41/87) Subject: Consolidation of the EMS In connection with the completion of the internal market, it is planned to strengthen the EMS. According to Mr Delors, this is to be achieved through more effective coordination of national interest-rate policies, adjustment of the EMS divergence indicator and consoli dation of the role of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund through wider use of the ECU. Could the Council give details of (a) the legal bases for the consolidation of the EMS (having regard to the provisions of the Single European Act), (b) any decisions it has taken in connection with the initiative by the French Minister of Finance, Mr Balladur, to strengthen the EMS and (c) its views on extending the use of the ECU in international transactions so that European currencies are less subject to disruption through the conti nual wide fluctuations in the US dollar? Answer The memorandum submitted by Mr Balladur is currently being examined by the Mone tary Committee and by the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks. The wider use of the ECU will form part of this examination. The Council will decide on the legal basis for the consolidation of the European Mone tary System when the rules providing for such consolidation are laid down. ",

Answer On 15 and 16 December 1986 the Council, noting the regular process of consultation between the Commission and the representatives of the ports authorities, adopted conclu sions on the financial relations between the ports sector and public authorities. In those conclusions, the Council approved the Commission's intention to continue its work in this area with a view to making the relations more transparent and accounts more comparable. It invited the Commission to make a report on the question to the Council not later than 31 December 1987. Question No 67, by Mr Welsh (H-93/87) Subject: Conclusion of the Social Partner's working party on the introduction of new technologies \u2014 Information and consultation adopted on 6 March 1987 Can the Council state whether it has discussed the text on information and consultation adopted by the Social Partners on 6 March and what conclusions it has reached? Answer 1. The Council has noted with interest the joint opinion of the Social Partners' Working Party 'Social Dialogue and New Technology' concerning training and motivation, and information and consultation, adopted in Brussels on 6 March 1987. It welcomes the agreement reached by the social partners. 2. As for informing and consulting the employers of undertakings with complex struc tures, I would remind the honourable Member that the Council has agreed to resume examination of the 'Vredeling' proposal for a directive at the beginning of 1989. It notes that in their joint opinion the participants did not reach agreement on the advisability of a Community legal instrument. 3. The Council will in addition examine any other proposal which the Commission sub mits to it in this matter, including proposals connected with the introduction of new tech nologies, in the light of the outcome of the social dialogue.

Answer The Council acknowledges the importance of this question for the honourable Member. However, it is not for the Council to intervene in a national controversy of this nature. III. Questions to the Foreign Ministers Question No 75, by Mr Ephremidis (H-95 5/86) Subject: Four working parties and the meeting of the leaders of the special task units of the Member States of the Community According to the TREVI Group's 1987 programme, 4 working parties are to be set up within the group and a meeting of the leaders of the special task units held. Can the Council state what the nature of the work of each of the four working parties will be, whether these will be permanent working parties, whether they will have decision making powers, and what the object of the meeting of the leaders of the special task units will be? Answer The Trevi Group, consisting of the Ministers of Justice and of the Interior of the Twelve, is assisted by three working parties which are responsible for exchange of information on international terrorism, cooperation among the police forces of the Twelve and interna tional organized crime respectively. In addition, the ministers have set up an ad hoc group on immigration which operates with Commission involvement alongside the Trevi struc ture. The activities and working methods of these groups are confidential. Question No 80, by Mr Marshall (H-85/8 7) Subject: Non-delivery of registered letters by the Russians I have received evidence from a constituent that the Russian Post Office cynically informs the Post Office in the United Kingdom that registered letters to refuseniks have been delivered, despite irrefutable evidence to the contrary. Would the Foreign Ministers please tell me what steps are being taken to register the total unacceptability of this situtation which completely ignores the basic human rights as laid out in the Helsinki Accord and as signed by the Russians? Answer The Twelve are aware of the fact that mail is frequently monitored in the USSR. This problem was discussed as part of the CSCE at the Meeting of Experts on Human Con- ",
        "No 2-352/190 Debates of the European Parliament 13. 5. 87 tacts held in Bern from 15 April to 26 May 1986. A number of Western delegations sub mitted a proposal on this subject which was supported by all twelve Member States. During the negotiations on this proposal the Soviet delegation stated its readiness to accept the following text: 'Guarantee, in accordance with the World Postal Convention and the International Con vention on Telecommunications, unhindered transit for postal communications, ensure the rapid delivery of mail, including personal mail, create and maintain the conditions needed for rapid communication by telephone including the more widespread use of auto matic telephone systems wherever this is possible, and respect the private nature of such communications.' As no agreement was reached in Bern on a final document, the Twelve are pursuing this issue at the meeting on the follow-up to the CSCE currently in progress in Vienna. In conjunction with other Western countries, the Twelve have submitted a detailed proposal which aims to guarantee the freedom of postal communications and respect for the private nature and inviolability of postal and telephonic communications. Question No 81, by Mr Ulburghs (H-l 18/87) Subject: Murder of the Flemish development aid worker, Serge Bertens, in Guatemala Recent information appears to show that the Flemish development aid worker, Serge Ber tens, three months after he was kidnapped or arrested on 19 January 1982, was shot dead in Poptun barracks, Guatemala. It has not yet, however, been possible to obtain official confirmation. Everything is still shrouded in diplomatic fog, even though relations between the Community and Central America, particularly since the conference in Guate mala City, have undoubtedly become a great deal closer. When do the Foreign Ministers propose, by exercising appropriate pressure, to ensure that this matter is finally cleared up? Answer The specific case to which the honourable Member refers has not been discussed by the Foreign Ministers meeting in political cooperation. The matter has been discussed in the parliament of Belgium, the country directly concerned. All the available information was given on that occasion. Belgium has made diplomatic approaches to all the r\u00e9gimes which have controlled Guatemala in recent years. During a recent visit to that country in Febru ary 1987, the very serious Belgian concern at the fate of Mr Bertens was conveyed in a personal message to the new president. It is to be feared that Mr Bertens is among the 30 000 people who disappeared without trace during the years of dictatorship. Question No 82, by Mrs Lizin (H-l31/87) Subject: Progress made toward the creation of a European legal area Can the President of the Council say what progress has been made so far during his presi dency towards the creation of a European legal area and what the prospects are for the remaining months? ",
        "13.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/191 Answer Efforts to create a European legal area are being made by various bodies which operate together with the political cooperation of the Twelve; the Trevi group may be cited as an example. In the context of European political cooperation the Twelve have studied oppor tunities for easier cooperation on criminal, administrative and civil law. Several conven tions are currently being drafted: 1 \u2014 Criminal and administrative law (a) \u2014 a draft agreement on the implementation by the Member States of the European Community of the Council of Europe's convention on the transfer of convicted pri soners This agreement is designed to complement the Council of Europe convention which became available for signature on 21 March 1983, as well as extending its scope and improving its operation. In particular, the agreement makes provision for each Member State in certain cases to threat nationals of any other Member State with regular and habi tual residence in the same way as citizens of the country. (b) a draft convention on the application of the ne bis in idem rule whereby a person con victed in one Member State cannot be tried for the same crime in another Member State (c) a draft convention on the abolition of legalization of documents, with the aim of abolishing the legalization of official documents among the Member States Progress in drafting these three documents suggests that an early signature may be expected. In this context, work is also under way to: (a) simplify extradition procedures, especially through the use of modern telecommunica tions systems; (b) extend the Dublin agreement on the repression of terrorism to include the States which were not members of the Community at the time of signing (i.e. Greece, Portu gal and Spain). 2 \u2014 Civil law Special attention is being given to the problems which arise from the abduction of chil dren. Pending the entry into force among the Twelve of the Luxembourg and Hague con ventions, provision has been made for each Member State to appoint national representa tives for the purpose of assisting those who are victims of child abductions. Efforts are still being made to overcome the reservations which have been expressed in the case of the Luxembourg convention and, if possible, to streamline the procedures for the repatriation of abducted children. The implementation of maintenance decisions is another matter which is receiving atten tion, with the aim of simplifying the procedures of exequatur. To sum up, the aim of the Belgian Presidency in the sphere of legal cooperation has been to achieve closer relations among the Member States and to develop the benefits which the Community can offer to those who reside in it.

        "No 2-352/192 Debates of the European Parliament 13. 5. 87 Question No 83, by Mrs Crawley (H-l34/87) Subject: Halil Berktay Would the Foreign Ministers meeting in political cooperation investigate with all urgency the case of Halil Berktay, presently registered as a student studying for his PhD at Bir\u00ad mingham University who is being detained in a Turkish gaol for no other reason than trying to establish a Socialist Party, and call for his immediate release? Answer The specific issue raised by the honourable Member has not been discussed by the Foreign Ministers meeting in EPC. However, the Twelve have always followed developments concerning human rights in Turkey very closely, including matters relating to the freedom to set up political organiza\u00ad tions, without which democracy cannot exist. In their declaration on human rights of 21 July 1986 they stated that respect for these rights formed an important factor in their relations with third countries. The Turkish authorities are aware of the feelings of the Twelve on this matter. It is noted that he was released on bail on 13 February 1987. Attention has been drawn to the following points: \u2014 Mr Berktay did not attempt to set up a socialist party; \u2014 although no longer in prison, he does face charges under Article 142/1 of the Turkish Penal Code and thus cannot obtain a passport in order to travel abroad. Question No 84, by Mrs Bonino (H-l 37/8 7) Subject: Action taken on the resolution (Doc. \u0392 2-210/87) on Jews in Syria What specific steps have been taken to persuade the Syrian Government to allow members of the Jewish community in Syria who wish to emigrate to do so freely, as urged in the resolution (Doc. \u0392 2-210/87) adopted by the European Parliament on 9 April 1987? What response has the Syrian Government made to the Council's approaches? Answer The question raised by the honourable Member has not been discussed by the Foreign Ministers meeting in political cooperation. ",

Next week the Committee on Women's Rights is meeting in Berlin. On the agenda is a report entitled 'Discrimination against women in immigration law'. Yesterday an agenda was circulated throughout this House in which the title was given as 'Report on discrimination against women in the British Government's immigration rules and amendments thereto'. That has never been the title of the report. I have seen the French agenda this morning and the Bri\u00ad tish Government is not mentioned there. I would not raise this matter except that it is the third time that something has happened between Parlia\u00ad ment's Secretariat and British members of the Com\u00ad mittee on Women's Rights. I would really like the Bureau to look into how a member of the Secretariat could possibly put in the title 'The British Govern\u00ad ment's immigration rules' when that has never been the subject of the report. I know that it is not Mrs Heinrich's idea of the subject of the report, because she has accepted in committee that it is not the British Government she is looking into but the whole question of the European Community's immigration rules. I raise the matter because other amendments which this group has tabled disappeared last month and have still not come to light. Furthermore, another change has been made to the agenda without consultation of members of this group, even though it affected a report that emanated from us. We regard it very ser\u00ad iously indeed that the Secretariat could allow such an agenda to go out. I must ask the Bureau to look into it. (Applause from the right) PRESIDENT. \u2014 We take note of the points you have made. We will look into the facts and take appropriate action if any action is needed. 1 1. Welcome PRESIDENT. \u2014 I now have very great pleasure, on behalf of the House, in welcoming to the official gal\u00ad lery Mr Jo Benkow, President of the Norwegian Par\u00ad liament.

Indeed, I look forward to a further discussion with you myself. Obviously, all of us take more than a pass\u00ad ing interest in the situation in Norway at the moment.

We voted just now in favour of a tax on vegetable oils, then we voted against taxation of oils of marine or animal origin, and now we have voted for a recital which requires that there should be no discrimination between oils and fats of different origins. I think this amendment should have fallen. (Applause) MARCK (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, we deleted the word marine, not the recital. We must conclude therefore that this word is to be deleted throughout. We are simply wasting time. (Applause) ARNDT (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, we narrowed the first recital down, so that it now relates to vegetable oils and fats. We then voted to insert a new recital, which says that there should be no discrimination against other oils and fats, and that is possible. These are two totally different things. On the one hand we have said that this applies only to vegetable oils and fats, and then we have said in the new recital: so that there is no discrimination against the others. That is perfectly logical and entirely possible and will also be possible as far as the other votes are concerned. LATAILLADE (RDE). \u2014 (FR) MrPresident, our Assembly is becoming ridiculous because of these con tradictory votes only a few minutes apart. As we have clearly spoken in favour of adopting measures to tax oils of vegetable origin and fats of vegetable origin, and no others, I cannot see why you should put to the vote amendments which have fallen by virtue of the fact that we rejected them at the ver}' beginning of the vote. May I point out, Mr President, that, as the arguments have shown, it is possible to have contradictor}' votes, even though guidelines have been established from the outset. I should be very grateful therefore if, as the rapporteur said, you would reject all the amendments, in accordance with the parliamentary principles which guide us all. Any other vote could be open to dispute. (Applause) Proposal for a regulation 19 \u2014 5th recital \u2014 Amend ment No 130 MARCK (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) I would like to ask Mr Jackson to withdraw his amendment, as it is contrary to the previous one. JACKSON, Christopher (ED). \u2014 Mr President, what happened in the first place was that we said we should take account of market trends in vegetable oils. Now we are talking about \u2014 and my amendment says this \u2014 the system which should regulate prices in relation to all oils and fats. That is not contradictory. It is per fectly possible to do that, I therefore insist on main taining this amendment. MARCK (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Since the pro poser will not withdraw the amendment we shall have to vote, but it is quite contradictory. FANTON (RDE). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, if you will excuse my saying so, the problem is not being handled as it should be. The question is not whether Mr Jack son will or will not maintain the amendment. It is con tradictory, and therefore falls automatically, and there can be no debate! It disappears, it lapses. That is what we are trying to make you understand, Mr President. VON DER VRING (S). \u2014 (DE) MrPresident, I agree with your asking the rapporteur for his opinion. But to examine every paragraph in order to establish whether an amendment is admissible in terms of con tent will make any decision today impossible. May I ask you not to accept any more interventions of this kind, but to allow the House to decide how to vote. (After approval of proposal for a regulation 61) ",
        "No 2-352/196 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 MARCK (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) I said at the end of the debate that I shall not ask the Commission to give its reaction to the amendments which have been adopted by Parliament, as we are now at a stage in the prices debate where it is in fact impossible for the Commission to put forward any proposals other than those which it made originally. The Commissioner has told us that he will take into account a number of Par liament's amendments. He indicated this at the end of the debate, and for that reason I shall not ask for it to be referred back to the Committee of Agriculture. At this stage we want the price debate to continue and to be concluded as quickly as possible. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Thank you very much indeed, Mr Marck. Many thanks to you for the tremendous amount of work you have done as rapporteur. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Ladies and gentlemen, there will be 21 explanations of vote, which will take about 30 min utes. I would propose therefore that we continue with the vote on the Marck report until 1.15 p.m. As for the Mouchel and Colino Salamanca reports, we could take these at 7 p.m. this evening, which is the next vot ing time. Does the House think that we can do this? SUTRA DE GERMA (S). \u2014 (FR) Madam President, I think that we have a precedent in this matter. When votes on the budget or farm prices are not finished before lunch, they are resumed at 3 p.m. I think the Mouchel and Colino Salamanca reports are suffi ciently important to be dealt with in the same way. (Applause) IN THE CHAIR: MRS PERY Vice-President PRESIDENT. \u2014 I am prepared to put Mr Sutra de Germa's proposal to the vote. (Parliament agreed to this proposal) Motion for a resolution Paragraph 1 \u2014 Amendment No 259 PRESIDENT. \u2014 The adoption for the previous amendment means that Amendment No 259 falls. BOCKLET (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Madam Presi dent, may I point out that Amendment No 259 is a supplementary and that if it is added now it has the same meaning as it would have had if it had been added to the original paragraph before. That is why it has to be put to the vote. MARCK (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) When we took the Committee on Agriculture's original proposals it was in accordance with what we had voted in the regulations. I cannot now say that this is so, since we have in fact approved price reductions for a number of products. I leave it to Parliament. WOLTJER (S). \u2014 (NL) The rapporteur is right, it is an absolute contradiction of what we have just said in the regulations, and I cannot understand therefore why it should be included. PRESIDENT. \u2014 I stand by my original ruling there fore that this amendment is to be regarded as having fallen. (After the adoption of paragraph 45) Explanations of vote MUSSO (RDE). \u2014 (FR) We shall vote for the Marck report. But if we vote for it, it is as a form of recom pense for the work done by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate, and cannot under any circumstances be regarded as an acceptance of the general policy, or lack of it, which is being proposed for future years. It is with sadness and regret that I watch the Commis sion, pinned down by budgetary constraints, by preoc cupations with the United States and by the attitude of the Council, which is not always a consistent one, pro pose a simultaneous freeze, or restriction, of prices, production cutbacks and a freeze on agricultural land. Ultimately there is very little concern for what will become of the farmers. Or rather, we are told at the same time that income subsidies are to be proposed and that Parliament will consider them after it has voted on farm prices. I thank the Commissioner for listening to me, but I think he knows by heart what I am going to say, because he knows by heart that this income subsidy which he is going to lay before us, and which we are to consider in a month or two, has been thought up because the policy which is being laid before us is bad. If it had been good, there would have been no need to propose an income subsidy for payment by the Mem ber States if we do not want to see the disappearance of the poorest farmers. ELLES, James (ED). \u2014 Madam President, I shall be voting against this report. While Parliament has made ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/197 Elles considerable progress in the past two years towards a realistic approach to CAP surpluses, shown yesterday in the vote on the Baron Crespo and von Wogau report, and indeed today in the decisions to cut prices and phase out MCAs, the vote so far has shown we have a long way to go to clarify the future financing of the CAP. My main concern, however, relates to the Commission's proposals for the oils and fats sector. In the debates in committee and on the floor of this House it has become crystal clear that with the stabili zation mechanism proposed by the Commission it is not the Commission's desire to add another distorted mechanism to the CAP nor is it its wish to antagonize the United States. It aims rather to raise urgently- needed revenue to cover current deficits. Parliament has voted for the short term, sweeping longterm considerations under the carpet. Even those who might have been expected to oppose this mechan ism, principally many members of the Committee on Budgets, have voted in favour under the misguided impression that this mechanism can provide finance for us in the current year. Well I have news for them! Even if the mechanism is decided by the Council in June it cannot possibly be implemented quickly enough to give more than 300 million ECU in this financial year. The 1987 deficit is over 6 billion ECU, not 5 billion ECL as we have been told. I challenge the Commission to confirm these figures, given that in the document COM 187 they are erroneous and should be updated. I conclude, Madam President, with two appeals. First I ask the Commission to withdraw its ill-conceived and damaging oils and fats proposals on the grounds that it should not maintain any proposal which will lead to over 10% of the CAP's financing being generated by negative resources. Secondly, I strongly urge the German Government to stay within its cabinet guidelines, to oppose this pro posal and ignore the siren songs that have led on, not ably, the EPP and its German Christian Democrats this morning. It will thus ensure a blocking minority in Council when it comes to discuss the proposal. MARQUES MENDES (RDE). \u2014 (PT) Madam President, the Portuguese members of the Renewal Group will vote in favour of the Marck report for var ious reasons but also because the regulation on oils and fats has been approved. We must stress that we do not accept the reasons of the Portuguese Government for adopting a position contrary to that of the other Southern European countries which produce vegetable oils. The government deliberately deceived the public on financial costs; it has estimates prepared but does not assume responsibility for them. It fails, however, to take account of the fact that if there is no contribution for agricultural expenditure there will be no more money available for the structural funds. Moreover there is no guarantee of continued support for thou sands of small-scale Portuguese olive growers whose survival depends on the olive oil sector. Even more serious, it removes the possibility of promoting the production of oil seeds in Portugal, in particular of safflowers and sunflowers for which our country has great potential. Madam President, although we now support the sta bilization mechanism for oils and fats we cannot understand the very restrictive measures proposed by the Commission for the oils and fats sector, which is why Parliament rejected them. We cannot understand either why measures are not taken to remedy the unfair situation of Portuguese olive oil producers who are receiving lower levels of aid than their Spanish counterparts. But above all we do not accept that sun flowers produced in Portugal should not qualify for the full aid which exists in the rest of the European Community. PRANCHERE (COM). \u2014 (DE) In the course of the debate I criticized the Commission's price package, which will result in a deterioration of living and work ing conditions for family farmers, and also in a reduc tion of the Community's agricultural potential, and France's in particular. With a few minor exceptions the majority of this Assembly has adopted the Commission's proposals by refusing to alleviate the effects of certain price cuts and production limits. It has also rejected our propo sals for a redistribution of agricultural expenditure to penalize those who are really responsible for the huge increase in stocks. By adopting the Socialist Group's Amendment No 257 it has even opened the way for a freeze on agricultural land. Twenty years on the Mansholt plan is being dusted down. The Commission will not hesitate to rush through this gap which you of the majority have so obligingly opened up for it. The adoption of the tax on oils and fats and the appli cation of compensatory measures in favour of devel oping exporter countries is certainly a positive feature, we acknowledge that. But it is not enough to make us swallow the bitter medicine which the final resolution is offering us. Because at heart we want to protect the incomes of family farmers and to help agriculture to face its problems, the French Communist and Allied Members will vote against the final resolution which unreservedly supports the Commission's less-than- zero option. We shall support the farmer's demonstra tions which are to take place in Brussels and the other countries from Monday onwards. ELLIOTT (S). \u2014 Madam President, I cannot support this report and will be voting against it. It does contain some reasonable proposals admittedly, but there is no way that I can support the proposal for a levy on ",
        "No 2-352/198 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Elliott vegetable oils and fats as recommended in paragraph 37. This kind of proposal, despite the pious hopes expressed in some of the amendments that industry might absorb it, will inevitably fall as a burden upon consumers and particularly harshly upon those on low incomes who are the largest consumers of such prod ucts as margarine and cooking oils. In addition to that, it will have a serious effect upon many aspects of world trade. It will have an adverse effect upon the economies of a number of seriously disadvantaged Third World countries. And, finally, a point which I think has not received adequate consideration, this is an unhealthy proposal. In a number of our countries serious efforts are being made to try and discourage people from consuming animals fats which, it is quite clearly demonstrated, can be injurious to health, leading to an increase in coronary disease and other problems of that nature. The effect of this kind of levy will be to encourage people to consume more animal fats. Indeed that is the very idea \u2014 to help cut the butter mountain. Quite the reverse of what health experts are recommending! I think that in all respects this is a totally unacceptable proposal and I must vote against it. STEWART (S). \u2014 Madam President, I will be voting against this tax in view of the fact that the imposition of such a tax on oils and fats would have a major impact on the prices of margarines, cooking oils and various other foods. The tax would affect all consu mers since the product it is to be levied on would, in fact, be part of the basic items of any shopping basket. It will hit hardest at the most vulnerable groups in our society, namely those with low incomes, the elderly, the unemployed and single-parent families. The level of the proposed tax would result in price increases of between 40 and 50% on margarines and certain types of biscuits. It would definitely affect jobs in the area I represent in Merseyside. It would be better described as a tax on the poor, instead of an oil and fats tax. VANNECK, Sir Peter (ED). \u2014 Madam President, the explanation of my vote and how I have voted over the last three hours is in my hand; sixteen foolscap pages to deal with 300 amendments. Our Rules are rotten. The situation we find ourselves in is horrendous. Three hours out of what is normally an 8-hour work ing day spent putting up one's hand, pressing the but ton, listening to the rapporteur and voting, voting, voting. Surely the Bureau can instruct the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Cre dentials and Immunities to find a way out of this dilemma. When we have the Rainbow Group losing three successive votes 20 to 200 and demanding a roll call each time, and able to get away with it, then our procedures must be changed. I shall be voting accord ing to my whip, because that is my duty, but I am appalled that I have to sit for three hours through these amendments before it takes place. DALY (ED). \u2014 Madam President, I too shall vote against this report. I am not happy about the oils and fats mechanism and I am also extremely concerned about paragraph 6 of the resolution and other refer ences in the report of those farmers producing less than 60 000 litres per annum. I would hate to think that that was going to be accepted by Commissioner Andriessen or the Council as a definition of a small farmer. Small farmers in the United Kingdom \u2014 and I am deeply committeed, as is my group, to helping them \u2014 are those with perhaps 40 cows producing 200 000 litres. There is no way I can support any report that implies or suggest that 60 DOO litres defines a small farmer. GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (ARC). \u2014 (DE) Madam President, we shall vote against this report. This report does not reduce surpluses, it reduces the number of farms. 75% of farms find that the present prices are insufficient and then Parliament decides in favour of further price reductions! The agro-industry is being provided with cheap raw materials to drive the agricultural growth and indus trial concerns towards ever more chemical forms of production. It is not enough to include in some para graphs a few kind words in favour of environmentally acceptable production. We want it to be possible for farmers to live on the money which they obtain for their produce. That is why it was important to introduce price increases for certain agricultural products. But that idea was rejected! For this reason we shall vote against the report, even if we think that the introduction of a tax on oils and fats is a step in the right direction, because in terms of income it extends a helping hand to the olive farmers, in southern Europe particularly. But not enough is being done here either. Measures must be taken to help the small producers, but there is still no provision for this. The socio-structural measures in the form in which they are to be adopted by the Commis sion and in which they are proposed in this report are designed only to help the small farmers to get out, and are not what we are calling for \u2014 measures to safe guard livelihoods. We are therefore unable to vote for this report. TELK\u00c4MPER (ARC). \u2014 (DE) Sir Peter, I have to ask what your attitude is towards the protection of minorities. We are representatives of the people and we take our role seriously. We requested a roll-call vote so as to show our electors that we voted. I think it is self-evident that in a democratic parliament we have a right to do that and, if you impede that right, to demand a roll-call vote every time if necessary. MARCK (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Madam Presi dent, I should like to thank everyone who has helped ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/199 Marck to get the resolution and the report to this stage, and more especially I should like to thank the members of the secretariat and of my own group, as well as \u2014 and I wish to emphasize this particularly \u2014 the coordina\u00ad tors in the other groups who have also helped to prod\u00ad uce a balanced document. ANDRE (LDR), in writing. \u2014 (FR) I shall vote in favour of the Marck report, because I am convinced that this resolution represents a fair balance between necessary adaptations and the protection of farmers' legitimate interests. The people who tabled amendments in order to increase prices or to extend the intervention systems were neither realistic nor serious. With agricultural stocks to the value of more then 10 billion ECU pro\u00ad posals of that kind put the credibility of our institution at risk. The people who proposed cutting prices in a Draconian manner or abolishing all the security prov\u00ad ided by the intervention systems are guilty of bad faith. It is not for the Community to swell the number of unemployed by eliminating farmers! I am afraid that in the case of the socio-structural measures, which were absolutely necessary, as well as being the logical complement to price fixing, the Com\u00ad mission and the Council have done too little too late. To us it is unacceptable for the CAP to be altered without any prospects or alternatives for young farm\u00ad ers. I hope that the Belgian Presidency will succeed in obtaining a decision as soon as possible on the farm prices question. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens are waiting for the results of our work. BEAZLEY, Christopher (ED), in writing. \u2014 I shall be voting against this report because of the position adopted on the oils and fats sector. However, I should particularly like to draw attention to my position on the section relating to the co-responsibility levy on milk and milk products. While I accept that quota reductions were necessary in regard to the continuing surpluses in the dairy sector, the co-responsibility levy no longer fulfils the purpose for which in 1978 it was designed, namely to identify and promote new con\u00ad sumer outlets. Considering the difficulties faced by dairy farmers, who cannot diversify into other sectors, this levy constitutes a further burden and should be abolished. I cannot, however, agree with the proposal to exempt from further quota reductions dairy farmers who produce less than 60 000 litres of milk per year. This would discriminate unfairly against producers who are considered small farmers in their own country and impose further difficulties upen them in the future. BOCKLET (PPE), in writing. \u2014 (DE) The decisions of the Plenary have produced a considerable deterior\u00ad ation in the Marck resolution relative to the form in which it left the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. This applies for example to the farm prices, which are now tending to follow the downward trend advocated by the Commission. Furthermore, the fragile compromise which had been reached on the question of currency equalization, which to me was acceptable inasfar as it included com\u00ad pensation for German farmers, has been jeopardized by an amendment which expressly calls on the Com\u00ad mission to continue to pursue its currency equalization proposals. Finally, the line which the European Parlia\u00ad ment has taken over the years on the protection of agro-products against imitations has been negligently cast aside, as the parliamentary majority now wants to pay more attention to consumer interests. On the other hand we have succeeded in retaining the paragraphs on the importance of market and price pol\u00ad icies and of paying farmers for the environmental ser\u00ad vices which they provide, and the coresponsibility levy has been extended to imported cereals. For these rea\u00ad sons I shall abstain until the actual decisions on the individual regulations have become apparent in the course of the vote. BROK (PPE), in writing. \u2014 (DE) For various rea\u00ad sons, but mainly because of the majority's lack of understanding for agriculture in the countries with firm currencies where currency equalization is con\u00ad cerned, I vote for the Marck report with a certain amount of reservation. DEVEZE (DR), in writing. \u2014 (FR) The day before yesterday I had the privilege of explaining to you the main outlines of our programme for agricultural prices in 1987/1988. \u03a4 summarize them here as an explana\u00ad tion of our vote. We are opposed to a reduction or freeze on the prices of all products, which is what the Commission pro\u00ad poses, for three reasons: firstly, the Community would be moving towards a two-speed agriculture with a dis\u00ad tinction made between agricultural income from prices and markets and agricultural income derived from other sources, such as, for example, income supple\u00ad ments rather than production aid; should this happen, it would be dangerous and unhealthy. Secondly, the policy of markets and prices, which at the present time no longer guarantees farmers' incomes, must be combined with corrective mechan\u00ad isms so as to become once again a major element of all agricultural policy. How is one to explain the gap between the price paid to the producer and that paid by the consumer? A fair price should be paid for agri\u00ad cultural products and they should not suffer dispro\u00ad portionately from the burden of intermediaries, taxa\u00ad tion and assorted charges. In the end the reduction in ",
        "No 2-352/200 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 Deveze prices would lead to renationalization of the CAP and multiplication of national aid (because the Community budget would be in a state of deficit and unable to support the burden of Community aid for any length of time), in order to offset certain drastic decisions on the part of the Commission. The disparity between the rich and the poor regions of the Community would only increase, which would also influence our vote. Another idea which we cherish is that of abolishing quotas for the areas where reconversion is not possible and adjusting them in terms of production for the areas where conversion is possible or the production is native to that area; for the sake of equity quotas should be progressive, instead of linear. On the one hand, the Commission wants to reduce surplus production by various means, without attack ing the real causes of the surpluses: the agro-chemical industries, biotechnologies and the misuse of interme diate consumption. On the other, failure to respect Community prefer ences encourages the development of imitation and substitute products, milk in particular, and the import of cereals substitutes free of customs duties is unfair competition where the Community cereals used in ani mal feedstuffs are concerned, because the latter are subject to a co-responsibility levy. A large-scale export policy is, of course, one of the defences of our traditional markets, but it is also a large-scale long-term European policy, which is partly financed by the European Investment Bank and the exporters themselves. It does not seem to us that any measures have been taken as a matter of priority to encourage the estab lishment of young farmers by means of social and fis cal benefits, by subsidized loans for setting up busi nesses, by increasing the area under cultivation in order to reduce fixed costs, or, finally by raising the price of agricultural products. It must not be forgotten that the farmers are increas ingly the protectors of the environment and of rural structures; for that reason they deserve to be helped financially in their tasks of maintaining and conserving the natural environment. Despite these reservations we shall vote for the bal anced report which Mr Marck has presented, in the knowledge that nothing in this world is perfect. The work itself was not improved by the desire, however legitimate, of some people to pretend to improve it by amending it. HUTTON (ED), in writing. \u2014 I shall be opposing the Marck report because of the dreadful message which it sends to the Council and the public about the future of the policy on agriculture. The oils and fats tax will have a very serious effect on many businesses large and small. It is likely to cost jobs, many in rural areas, and I am not going to put my name to that. I am also deeply upset by the easy way in which Mem bers have ignored the difficulties likely to be faced by sheep producers in Scotland from the proposal to impose a limit on the number of sheep eligible for the ewe premium. This will strike directly at producers in the South of Scotland and may well have the effect of costing jobs in some of the most difficult rural areas where there is no alternative employment. Scottish Socialist Members happily supported this proposal which set in context the concern they are expressing for farmers now that an election is here. This is a report which is likely to fuel the case of those who want to renationalize the common agricultural policy, with all the consequences that would have for our Community, and I am not going to encourage anything which would put the future of this Com munity in jeopardy. KOLOKOTRONIS (S), in writing. \u2014 (GR) The aim of the Commission's farm price proposals is to keep prices at their current levels, with small upward or downward adjustments for certain items. However, in recent years, especially in the less-devel oped countries, the situation in the agriculture sector has altered radically. The Community's agricultural policy must be put on a new footing. There needs to be a long-term restructur ing. With what it is doing at present, announcing mea sures for the protection and support of farm products, that is, the Community is still simply distributing resources rather than working towards the concept of a new European agricultural policy. I believe that we ought to be adopting measures designed to pave the way for a new strategy of bring ing development to the backward countries, converg ence of the economies and a reduction of the great disparities that exist, and which, unfortunately, in many areas in the member countries of the South are getting ever wider. Furthermore, I believe that the measures must cater for the needs of the small producers and make an effective contribution to the restructuring of crops in Greece and other member countries where there are severe and threatening problems with regard to the production and disposal of agricultural products. The damage caused to agriculture by the recent bad weather and the aftermath of Chernobyl are making the difficult situation facing farmers in my country even worse. When implementing decisions it is abso lutely imperative that the Commission should take ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/201 Kolokotronis account of these things. Having made these remarks, I vote for the proposals in Mr Marck's report as they now stand following the amendments. McCARTIN (PPE), in writing. \u2014 It is with some reservations that that I have decided to vote in favour of the Marck report. The continuing decline in net farm income in Ireland is a source of grave concern and particularly when it is accompanied by a decline in the agricultural labour force, as is also the case in all eleven other countries of the Community. While I recognize the need for restraint in price fixing, particularly in the sectors wich have serious surpluses, I believe that this should be accompanied by the strengthening of structural measures and income aids to safeguard the position of the family farm, particu larly in the disadvantaged regions. I had hoped that before final decisions on this year's prices were concluded, we would have in place new measures on direct income aids, a worthwhile retire ment scheme and an improved system of farm improvement grants. There are two main problems about such aids as they apply in the disadvantaged areas: firstly, farmers, particularly small farmers, are put off by the necessity to carry out excessive paper work and because the guidelines are generally very complicated, they are rarely understood by the aver age small holder; the second major problem is that structural and direct income aids as they are under stood at the moment require a national contribution. In countries with severe budgetary problems and lower GDP this requirement prevents the maximum utiliza tion of these measures, and the countries most con strained are the countries which have the greatest problems regarding rural development. In 96% of agricultural spending on the Guarantee side can be fully financed by the Community, then the other 4% should be treated in the same way. By mov ing in this direction we could put into effect the policy which has always been promoted by this Parliament, that is, that a better balance in favour of the disadvan taged areas should be achieved. On the agri-monetary side, I welcome the renewed support of the Agriculture Committee for the abolition of MCAs. This complex system disrupts the free movement of agricultural produce and to the ordinary citizen of Europe is in direct conflict with the objective of creating a single market. I accept that in strong currency countries there will be a need for compensatory measures by the national governments. These can be agreed within the frame work of the common agricultural policy and anyway, national aids already exist in many forms. I believe that such a solution is in every way preferable to a sys tem of confusing border taxes, which along with the other disadvantages create opportunities for fraud and incentives to illegal trade. MAFFRE-BAUGE (COM), in writing. \u2014 (FR) Farm ers and farmers' organizations are now mobilizing against the European Commission's price proposals, which, if implemented, would produce further deter ioration in agricultural incomes. All the demonstra tions which are going to take place, of which I approve and which I support, are an accusation of the Commission; and of the majority of our Assembly, which is now aligned with Brussels. Flouting the basic principles of the Treaty of Rome is a strange way of celebrating its 30th anniversary. This ointment of feeble socio-structural measures and direct aid will not be able to ease the wounds which have been inflicted on family farms by the steamroller ing Commission. Mr Delors has assured us that this policy will be pursued with a view to the wider market of 1992, which is going to bring still more free trade to the Community, which is increasingly becoming a community of interests and less and less a community of people and nations. The French Government is increasingly \u2014 unfortunately , but it is not surprising \u2014 at the forefront of this progressive dismantling of family farms which is programmed by Brussels. Against Unilever, which led the offensive against taxa tion of oils and fats but has nevertheless announced an increase in profits of 20% per share in 1986, I choose the interest of the family farmers of my own region, who ask only one thing: to be able to live properly and with dignity by their work and to pursue their trade, a trade which they have chosen and which they love. They refuse to be reduced to the role of caretakers in the Disneylands which the Guichard report is propos ing for us. By voting against the final resolution, which falls in with the Commission's price package, I am conscious of continuing my fight to defend our Mediterranean regions and their peoples. ROMEOS (S), in writing. \u2014 (GR) Today's marathon vote has significantly improved most of the Commis sion's proposals and made it possible for us to vote for Mr Marck's motion for a resolution. What is particularly encouraging is the recognition by Parliament that the Commission's treatment of the products of the countries of the South is inequitable and unjust. Of course, we do have to acknowledge that the Commission must take credit for the regula tion on oils and fats. If this regulation gets final approval, it may offset the adverse repercussions which the other Commission proposals on olive oil will have on the incomes of olive oil producers. The positive initiatives on cereals, fruit and vegetables, tobacco and sheepmeat oblige us to vote for the regu lations in question so as to ensure that the amending proposals of the European Parliament also arrive with ",
        "No 2-352/202 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Romeos the Council of Ministers. Certainly, there are still many negative points in the Commission's proposals, concerning both specific products and the intervention mechanism. For example, the reduction by 5 units of the Greek negative MCAs is insufficient and unaccept able. Parliament's amendments and Mr Marck's resolution have not managed to reverse the general move by the Commission towards liberalization of the market and re-nationalization. The restrictive prices policy is now here to stay. The worst thing, though, is that the Com mission and the Council are pursuing this policy not as a means towards reorganizing the market and sup porting farm incomes but as a basis for political and economic balance. We have voted for the regulations in order to save some of the improvements, but we are not optimistic about the future of European agriculture and that of small farmers in particular.

Anyone who examines this report now will see that it is incompatible with the Marck report in certain details, particularly in the range of products agreed by this House for the oils and fats tax in the farmprice vote. In addition, it does not cover certain other mat ters voted on by the House in relation to safeguards on VAT, development countries and consumers. In the light of those factors it clearly needs reconsideration in committee. Mr President, you would agree that the House has made its opinion clear on the oils and fats tax in the votes this morning. It would be better for the com mittee responsible to have the opportunity to make sure that the Mouchel report reflects the up-to-date position that it has agreed. In addition, of course, we spent rather longer voting this morning than we had planned, and there are many other pressing matters before the House. In view of all this, it would be advis able for the House to refer this report back to com mittee so that it can be made entirely consistent with our votes this morning. SIMMONDS (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I am entirely in favour of Mr Jackson's proposal. In view of the long vote that we have had, which has really changed the background to the Mouchel report, I hope that this report will be referred back to committee. CASTLE (S). \u2014 Mr President, I want to oppose this. These three reports were put to the Agriculture Com mittee and now to the House as a unity. I think we should carry on with our votes and it is for the House itself to adjust those votes in the light of any decisions taken earlier. It would be wrong to refer it back and might only make matters much much worse. I suggest therefore that we go ahead and that those of us who are so bitterly opposed to the oils and fats tax should have another opportunity of voting against it. MOUCHEL (RDE), rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) MrPresi dent, I find this proposal somewhat surprising, as the report has been ready for almost a year; we discussed it several times in the Agriculture Committee a long time ago, and the report was held up because it was said to be absolutely essential that it be discussed in the Plenary at the same time as the report on agricultural prices. We waited several months for that reason. The session on agricultural prices was to have been held in March. It was deferred until April and then till May. And now there is another attempt to delay things fur ther and to prevent this report from getting as far as a plenary session. I cannot see that referring it back to committee can change anything at all. The Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has given its opi nion on this problem and I do not think there are any grounds for referring back the report. For my part I would like this matter to be concluded today and sug gest that we go on to the vote. That, Mr President, is what I as rapporteur would say. (Applause) (Parliament rejected the request for referral back to com mittee) NAVARRO VELASCO (ED). \u2014 (ES) I did not wish to speak until after the vote on referral back, but now that it is over, and bearing in mind that the Mouchel report will be included with the Marck and Colino reports, I do think that the amendments mentioning the tax on oils and fats cannot subsequently be put to the vote again, since they have already been voted on in connection with the approval of Regulation 19. This Assembly, in one single judgement embracing the Marck report, the Mouchel report and the Colino report, has already declared its view on everything concerning taxes on oils and fats. ",
        "14. 5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/203 MOUCHEL (RDE), rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) MrPresi\u00ad dent, may I point out that this morning we voted the regulations, or amendments to regulations, which had been submitted to us by the Commission. We could also have concluded then that the Marck report lapsed because we had already taken a decision on the Com\u00ad mission proposals. However, I know that in fact we voted the Marck report with all the amendments which were proposed to us. I do not see why we should adopt a different procedure this afternoon on the question of oils and fats. WOLTJER (S). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, we have voted to discuss this report now. I would hope that Mr Mouchel as rapporteur will take good care to ensure that we do not have any contrary proposals, and that we shall vote according to what we decided this morning. That is perfectly normal. Paragraph 16 \u2014 Amendment No 20 PRESIDENT. \u00ad tion. I put to \u25a0 The rapporteur stands by his posi\u00ad the vote Amendment No 20 by PRESIDENT. amendment. \u2014 The rapporteur is against this WOLTJER (S). \u2014 (NL) The rapporteur is now saying that he is against it. Decisions were taken this morning which were entirely in accord with this amendment; what basis can the rapporteur have for saying that he is against it? We cannot work like this. It was agreed that the rapporteur would ensure that the text coincided with what was decided this morning. PROUT (ED). \u2014 Mr President, there must be a duty on the Presidency to make sure that the House does not vote in a contradictory amendment. Otherwise the Presidency leaves the House open to ridicule, does it not? It must be inherent in the office of President that the House should not be made to look foolish. I think there is a duty on you to exercise proper control of amendments and I urge you to exercise it. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Prout, thank you for reminding me of my duty, though I do not feel that I needed any such reminder. As for making this Assembly look ridi\u00ad culous, from what I have seen this morning by way of contradictory amendments being adopted, you are in no position to lecture me about that. As to the point that has been raised by Mr Woltjer, it is true that the rapporteur's opinion was given before this morning's vote. Nevertheless I am now asking the rapporteur again for his opinion, and I think that has to be our starting point. Mr Mouchel you have the floor. MOUCHEL (RDE), rapporteur\u2014 (FR) Mr President, I myself do not think that my rejecting this amend\u00ad ment is a contradiction of this morning's vote, which would not be the case with a number of other amend\u00ad Mr Woltjer. (Parliament adopted the amendment) NAVARRO VELASCO (ED). \u2014 (ES) Mr President, I rise simply so that it may be recorded that I have just voted in favour of this admendment, but this morning in the roll\u00adcall vote I voted against. The contradiction is not mine and I do not want to see the Assembly con\u00ad tradicting what it decided this morning. Explanations of vote BARRETT (RDE). \u2014 MrPresident, when I was speaking yesterday during the debate I proposed that the fish oil industry should be exempt from this form of taxation on the grounds that most of these plants are situated in the less well\u00adoff peripheral regions. This applies particularly to my own country but also to other members of the Community. I note with great satisfaction that the House here today decided in favour of that proposal, exempting fish oil or marine oil. I trust and hope that the Commission and the Council will take note of that and act accordingly. CASTLE (S). \u2014 Mr President, it is right that we should discuss this matter again. It is right that those of us who are bitterly opposed to the oils and fats tax should have had another opportunity of voting against it and of pressing arguments in favour of the amend\u00ad ments which we have supported. We shall not give up this fight because this is a regressive step in every sense of the word; it is regressive taxation, it is regressive protectionism, it is disruptive of world trade. And so we in the British Labour Group have supported all Mr Jackson's amendments outlining the principle with which we agree. He is right when he says it is wrong to put a tax on food which hits the poorest consumers most. But I was immensely interested in his Amendment No. 15 in which he says the Community should not seek to raise revenue by imposing regressive levies on consumers. That is a lovely Socialist philosophy and I welcome it coming from that source. But what I want to say to Mr Jackson is this: what on earth does he think VAT on food is, if it is not an attempt to raise revenue by imposing regressive levies on consumers? And this oils and fats tax will put, we are told, 30 pence a week on the average food bill. (Mixed reactions) That is bad enough for low\u00adpaid workers and pension\u00ad ers, but the cost of value\u00adadded tax on the average weekly food bill will be far in excess of that. And yet ",
        "No 2-352/204 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 Castle we know that the Conservative appointee, Lord Cock field, is planning to force the British Government to put VAT on food and he has only held up those pro posals until after our general election is over. So I accuse Mr Jackson of being a hypocrite. (Mixed reactions) matter of fact I was very anxious to vote against para graph 24 because I am certainly against the extension and increase of export subsidies, but suddenly I found that we were voting on paragraph 28. Is it not the cor rect practice to put each paragraph to the vote unless the House specifically agrees to take a number of par agraphs together? JACKSON, Christopher (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I just wish to say that I forgive Mrs Castle for her personal attack on me. I quite understand how upset she is that the Labour Party is lying third in the opinion polls in Britain today. (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (Doc. A 2-15/87) by Mr Colino Salamanca, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, on the olive oil sector PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mrs Castle, you have been a mem ber of this Parliament for longer than I. You are accustomed therefore to the voting procedure, which was carried out in the normal manner. If you were not in agreement when I announced that I was putting those paragraphs to the vote all together, all you had to do was to say that you did not agree with that and ask that they be voted on separately. I would then have met your wishes on that. Now that we have sorted out that, I put to the vote the motion for a resolution as a whole. (Applause) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Explanations of vote MARQUES MENDES (RDE). \u2014 (PT) I simply wish to stress the importance of this report and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Colino Salamanca, and to say that the vegetable oil sector is of fundamental importance for the Community. I shall, however, avoid the argu ments widely accepted in this Assembly on the advan tages for ecology and land conservation associated with the cultivation of the olive tree and shall stress the importance of bringing about radical changes in oil consumption of our Community. I have figures show ing that the average per capita consumption in the Community is currently 100 grams per inhabitant, but equally in some countries of the Community it is of the order of 20 kilograms per inhabitant. This differ ence in consumption cannot be explained by differ ences in consumer tastes resulting from eating habits. It simply must be due to differences in price for olive oil and alternative products. It was therefore of funda mental importance that this morning we approved a tax on oils and fats, and I hope that, following this report, new measures will be taken to promote the consumption of olive oil on equal terms throughout the European Economic Community, since this is also a way of implementing the single European market. CASTLE (S). \u2014 Mr President, you suddenly, without notice, jumped a number of paragraphs on which there were no amendments. You did not even ask the House whether it would take them as a whole. For example, you jumped suddenly from paragraph 23 to para graph 28 and just called paragraph 28, you did not even put the intervening paragraphs to the vote. As a 3. Commission statement PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the statement by the Commission on the draft supplementary budget for 1987 and the preliminary draft general budget for 1988, which will be followed by a debate. CHRISTOPHERSEN, Vice-President of the Commis sion. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, thank you for providing the Commission with an opportunity here this after noon to present to Parliament two important Commis sion decisions relating to the budget. They are a draft supplementary and amending budget for 1987 and a presentation of the Commission's preliminary draft budget for 1988. I do not think there is anyone in this Chamber who is in any doubt as to the seriousness of the budgetary situation facing the Community already this year. There are three distinct elements in our difficulties. I will briefly remind you of them. We need to make good this year the shortfall we had in 1986; we are obliged to do so. We are faced this year with an unex pected drop in our own resources, mainly because of the heavy fall in the American dollar, and we find that the Member States are collecting much less in customs duties than they estimated hardly a year ago. Thus we are short of very considerable amounts on the revenue side, for which a replacement must be found. Finally, we have the well-known problems in the agriculture sector where, solely and exlusively because of exchange rates changes, we now realize \u2014 or more exactly the Council of Ministers and Parliament were ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/205 Christopherson aware of it some months ago, but now we have final proof of it \u2014 that there is significant underbudgeting for actual agricultural expenditure in 1987. If we were to finance the agricultural policy for the whole of 1987 under the present system for the defrayment of agri cultural expenditure, we should need an extra 3-3.5 billion ECL' in agricultural appropriations, per haps even more. This is the background to the supplementary and amending budget which the Commission adopted here this morning and which I now present to one of the two arms of the budgetary authority, namely Parlia ment. Our proposals on how the 1987 problems are to be solved can be summed up as follows: the Commis sion proposes that by far the bulk of our shortfall in 1986 should be covered by using the margin we still have left on the revenue side of the 1987 budget. That is a little over 600 million ECU, an amount which will cover about three-quarters of our 1986 deficit. Secondly, we propose that we introduce with imme diate effect the changes in the system for financing Member States' agricultural expenditure which the Commission, for entirely different reasons of policy and control, already proposed in Communication No 100. This was debated yesterday along with other matters here in Parliament, and the Commission understands that there was general support for it. We propose that this changeover in the agricultural expenditure from payment in advance to payment in arrears be undertaken already with effect from 1987 and, if the changeover is adopted, it will mean in effect that we shall not need extra agricultural appropriations in the budget for 1987. The third element in our supplementary and amending budget for 1987 is our proposal that the Member States pay an amount which will compensate \u2014 and I stress the word: it is a compensation we are seeking, not an extra amount \u2014 for the missing amounts in our traditional own resources. The Member States have overestimated by about 1.5 billion ECU what they were to receive in customs duties, and they budgeted for 1987 on the basis that those amounts would be col lected. Now they realize that they have overestimated the volume of traditional own resources. In the logic of the Commission therefore it must also be the Mem ber States which should provide compensation for this loss of revenue, a loss which moreover has benefited the consumers and business communities of the Mem ber States. They have quite simply had this lower level of expenditure. That was the third element. We pro pose an intergovernmental agreement which will com pensate for the loss of 1.5 billion ECU. But it would be a different type of agreement to that applied in 1984 and 1985. At that time the money was required to finance additional expenditure; this time it will be to finance a shortfall in anticipated revenue. I now come to the situation in 1988. I also believe that the seriousness of the 1988 situation is generally recognized. If I may be permitted to start with the decision taken by the Ecofin Council on Monday regarding the budgetary discipline for 1988, it is now apparent, even to the Member States' Finance Minis ters, that the moment of truth is nigh. What did they decide? They took a budgetary discip line decision on the basis that the maximum rate of increase should be applied to non-compulsory expend iture and to compulsory expenditure not covered by the agriculture chapter and that the agricultural guide line, i.e. the ceiling on agricultural expenditure in 1988, should be pegged at a figure which is 200 mil lion lower than what we have in the 1987 budget and 4 billion ECLI less than what will really be needed in 1988, in other words the most restrictive version of the agriculture guideline which it is possible to imagine. Nevertheless, if we add up the figures which the Council of Finance Ministers decided should form the basis for the 1988 draft budget, we realize that that basis will require a VAT percentage of at least 1.47. Thus the Finance Ministers have themselves, by their completely unrealistic use of the budgetary discipline decision, indirectly confirmed that the 1988 budget will require a significant increase in the provision for own resources. I think that should be noted. It was in fact not properly noted after the decision of the Ecofin Council meeting, but it will in any case be noted here in Parliament. The Finance Ministers of the Member States themselves now recognize that the own resources ceiling is no longer realistic. What does the Commission propose? It bases its pro posal on three principles, three fundamental guide lines. To begin with, we base our proposal on the financial perspectives, which were published in COM 101, and hence indirectly on COM 100, i.e. the Commission's foundation document concerning the grand rendez-vous. Secondly, we base our proposal on the principle that the budget should be capable of implementation. It is important that a budget should be realistic in the sense that it reflects something that can be implemented. Thus there is no question of win dow-dressing or lack of balance between appropria tions and payments. It is a consistent budget which can be implemented. Thirdly, it is based on the demand that it should be a proper budget which reflects the Community's real commitments, the true needs. What are those needs? Well, payment has to be made on commitments entered into. There are payments which are the consequence of the legal basis for the Com munity's policies, whatever they may relate to \u2014 agri culture, fisheries or research. There are appropriations which are needed to honour contractual agreements, obligations, salaries, pensions, financial protocols with Mediterranean countries, and all kinds of other things we might mention. There is the requirement that there should be an amount in the budget to finance the bur dens of the past, i.e. the pledges, the legal obligations which the Community took upon itself some years back. Finally, there are appropriations by which the agricultural stocks can be written down to their true ",
        "No 2-352/206 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Christopherson value. That can be seen in the draft budget. We now present the cost of a four-year depreciation of the agricultural stocks on their true market value. At the same time I must say here in conclusion that of course the Commission is aware of the budgetary and financial difficulties. We did not want to present a draft budget which showed a lack of realism. We therefore face up to the financial problems to the extent that we include in the budget what we are con vinced is necessary of the agricultural policy. At the same time we have formulated a draft budget which, as far as the non-compulsory expenditure is con cerned, is in line with the maximum rate of increase but is nevertheless in balance and can pay for our com mitments. A draft budget which also allows for a real, albeit modest increase in some of the most important items of expenditure for the funds and which at the same time makes it possible to implement common research programmes. All this has fortunately been possible \u2014 I want to stress that here \u2014 not least because in 1985, 1986 and 1987 we restored the bal ance between payments and appropriations for com mitment in the funds, and because in 1986 and 1987 we obtained decisions which secured the financing of enlargement with the accession of Spain and Portugal. Set against these things, of course, we have the revenue side, where we have three problems. It is as simple and as complicated as that. The revenue side is overshadowed by a steep rise in the British repayment. It will increase from 1600 million ECU this year to 2500 million ECU in 1988. The revenue side is also overshadowed by the fact that we have to offset reduced customs duty revenue. In other words we have to secure compensation for both the British repayment and the drop in our traditional own resources through an increase in VAT revenue. Fin ally, the third element: payment for commitments entered into and, as I have said, a realistic assessment of agricultural spending and non-compulsory expendi ture. These three elements in the Community mean that the 1988 budget presented by the Commission represents both a minimum and perhaps a maximum for the possibilities open to us. But it means a consi derable increase over the 1.6% of VAT mentioned at Fontainebleau. The Commission therefore, as a conse quence of COM 100 and 101, has framed the revenue side in conformity with the proposals it has presented to the Member States, to the Council of Ministers and, not least, to Parliament. Consequently the 1988 budget is consistent and reflects the policy the Presi dent of the Commission explained yesterday in the course of the debate here in Parliament. PRESIDENT. debate. We shall now move on to the Before we do so, however, I should like to propose that the deadline for tabling any motions for resolu tions arising from this debate be fixed for 7 p.m. this evening. CHRISTODOULOU (PPE). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I want to point out that we had agreed that Mrs Bar barella should start the debate with Mr Colom i Naval following. I would like to request, therefore, that, if you have no objection, Mrs Barbarella, as the rapporteur for 1988 and as draftsman of the resolution on combating the Community's financial problem, should speak first and be followed by the political groups. BARBARELLA (COM), general rapporteur. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I should like to remind you that it was decided in this Chamber that, before allocating a speaking time of five minutes for each Group, there would be a short period of time for asking questions. It was therefore my intention, as budget rapporteur, to ask a few questions. The debate will therefore take place in two stages \u2014 the questions section and the positions section. COT (S), chairman of the Committee on Budgets. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the Assembly did in fact decide on Monday, I think it was on a motion from Mr Arndt, that there would be 30 minutes of questions and then the groups would have five minutes each for political discussion. In view of the seriousness of the budgetary situation and the conciseness with which the Commission has presented the matter, I think a few questions would be very welcome as lights to the lantern of this Assembly. (Laughter) PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Cot, I see no problem there either for you or for Mrs Barbarella. There is only one remark I should like to make. Before announcing the debate I called the only Member who had put down his name to put a question. That Member was Mr van der Waal. No one else had put down his or her name to ask a question. If other names had been put down, I would have called those other Members. As I under stand it, you wish to put a question even though your name is not down to do so. However, I see no prob lem there. COT (S), chairman of the Committee on Budgets. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, if you will excuse me, there has been a mistake in the distribution arrangements. I did in fact ask the secretariat of the Committee on Budg ets to put down all the coordinators for questions, because we have a set of precise questions to ask before the political groups finish off quickly. I think it is really only a matter of form and that it would be desirable for the Commission to be able to ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/207 Cot make specific replies to specific questions and then for the groups to be able to give their views very quickly. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Cot, I agree entirely with what you say. However, I am only here to see that the debates run smoothly. I can only repeat that no requests for names to be put down reached me. I only had one such request, that by Mr van der Waal, and you will have noted that I called him before announc ing the debate. If I had had other names, I would have called them, as had been decided. At this point, how ever, since I feel that it is important to do so, I shall give the floor to all who request it. Therefore, Mrs Barbarella, if you wish to speak, I shall give you the floor. BARBARELLA (COM), general rapporteur. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I should like to ask some very briefly questions as rapporteur for the 1988 budget. As every one in this Chamber knows, and as the Commissioner himself knows, the relationship between the 1987 budget and the 1988 budget is a very close one. I shall therefore begin with questions regarding the first part of the Commissioner's statement on the 1987 budget. I think it would be useful if the Commissioner were to explain what might happen if the Council did not accept the preliminary draft supplementary budget and, more precisely, I should like to ask him what the Community's liquidity position would be in this unfor tunate case and, above all, which countries, or prod ucts, or, at all events \u2014 in short, who would be sev erely hit by this situation of liquidity shortage. As the Commissioner well knows, the development of the 1987 supplementary budget is very closely linked to the '88 budget. Therefore, everything that cannot be resolved in 1987 will be passed on to the 1988 budget. This Parliament has laid it down as a funda mental requirement that a process of clarification should be completed before starting the 1988 budget procedure. And it is for this reason that I should like to ask the Commissioners three specific questions on this part, on the 1988 budget. I should like us to be provided with a few clearer details as to the precise total of the agricultural deficit that will fall on the '88 budget, and to be told more over what is the deficit relating to structural expenses that was carried forward from previous financial years. The second question concerns \u2014 let us say \u2014 the first application of the Single Act, since the 1988 budget coincides with the first year that the Single Act will be in force. This point does not seem to me to emerge clearly from the documents \u2014\u00b7 which are obviously still not very detailed \u2014 which have been presented to us, nor from the words of the Commissioner himself! On the contrary, I detect a certain element of contra diction between the Commissioner's statements and what President Delors said to us on Wednesday. I thought I understood, from what President Delors said, that the commitments for the Single Act had not been entered in '88, whereas from Commissioner Christophersen's statements I think I understood that, in part, the application of the Act was included ther ein. I therefore ask for clarification of this point. For my last question, Mr Commissioner, I would remind you first or all that, in your introduction, you took for granted the five-year budget figures which you yourself presented to us in the relevant document. Now, we discussed this question at length in the Com mittee on Budgets. We did not question the principle, since we are entirely in agreement with the program ming of expenditure, but we do not agree on the figures that you yourself presented, for the very reason that it is not clear how much the agricultural and structural 'burdens of the past' will amount to. We have already asked for the part that concerns the past to be shown separately in the financial forecast from the part that concerns the future. It is on these specific points that I should like to have preliminary answers, and I propose, obviously, in my capacity as repporteur, to set out the position of the Committee on Budgets subsequently. TOMLINSON (S). \u2014 Mr President, I want to protest in the strongest possible terms at your statement that you had called Mr van der Waal because he was the only one who had notified you of his intention to ask a question. I happen to favour the quaint old practice of waiting to hear what a Commissioner says before I decide whether or not I have a question to ask him. It is a nonsensical idea that, in order to ask a relevant question, we must give you notice of our intention to ask it before we hear what the Commissioner is going to say. It makes a mockery of parliamentary process. I, therefore, did not notify you in advance because I was quite clearly confident that we were going to have the half-hour agreed on on Monday. But now, irrespective of whether I have given notice to you or not, having heard what Commissioner Christophersen has said. I have questions to ask and I hope that, firstly, you will carry on letting people ask their questions and, secondly, never again resurrect from the Chair the nonsensical concept that we have to notify in advance whether we are going to ask a question before we have heard the statement on which we are going to put questions. PRESIDENT. \u2014 I think, Mr Tomlinson, that you did not hear me correctly, because as soon as Mr Cot made his request, I said that it was in order and that those who wished to put questions could do so for 30 minutes. ",
        "No 2-352/208 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 President The best thing for you to have done therefore was to ask for the floor and I would have put down your name, which is in fact what I am going to do right now. However, your remarks have already squandered 5 minutes of the famous half-hour that you have been going on about. COT (S), chairman of the Committee on Budgets. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I would simply like to ask the Vice-President of the Commission to comment on the speech made by Mr Delors, or more exactly, to clarify it. Mr Delors said in fact that although we had solemnly told the governments, in a letter of the Heads of Government and the Finance Ministers, that if the European Council did not find a solution, the Commission would reject all past expedients and would be obliged to cut agricultural payments by 30% and structural fund expenditure by 50%. I would like to know precisely on what date these provisions will take effect, what lines will be involved, what procedure will be invoked and whether there will be requests for transfers, if necessary, in order to implement this policy? ELLES, James (ED). \u2014 I have two questions to ask the Commissioner. Firstly, would he inform the House whether it is correct that the revenue available under present systems for the Community will be less in 1988 than in 1987? Secondly, I would be grateful if the Commissioner could provide the information I requested this morning on the estimated revenue from the oils and fats tax, should it be passed by the Coun cil. This will enable the House to have a correct esti mate of the deficit. We have been informed it will be 5 billion ECU on the assumption of an oils and fats tax being part and parcel of Community policy. At the same time, if he could also tell us what the revenue from such a stabilization mechanism would be in 1988, it would help us a great deal. PASTY (RDE). \u2014 (FR) MrPresident, would it be possible for Mr Christophersen to tell us how the figure of 27 billion 45 million ECUs, which is the esti mate for EAGGF \u2014 Guarantee Section requirements in the preliminary draft budget for 1988, was calcu lated? In other words, what was the dollar-ECU parity taken as the basis for this figure? A supplementary question: should this parity not be correct, is there provision for this in the budget? And finally, I should also like to know whether this figure includes depre ciation and stocks and the amounts needed for dis posal of existing stocks? PRICE (ED). \u2014 Mr President, most of my questions relate to 1987. Firstly, in respect of guarantee expendi ture the Commission indicates that it expects it to exceed the budget by about 3.9 billion ECU. Does that figure include the amount which it expects to be saved by the adoption of its proposals relating to agricultural prices and associated measures? Secondly, as regards the savings which might be achieved by the adoption of the Commission proposals on agricultural prices and related measures, in what month does the Commission assume that those propo sals will be adopted? I understand that it is thinking in terms of savings of around 1.1 billion ECU if the entire package is accepted. That is in respect of the current year and, of course, will depend on which month any such decision is taken. What is the month on which the assumption is based? In respect of the move from agricultural advances to reimbursement in the Guarantee Section, which will give a one-off benefit, can the Commissioner put a figure on that one-off benefit? Lastly, on 1987, I understand that he is proposing that the Member States make advances on the own- resources payments before they fall due in order to make good the deficit, i.e. that that is the way in which the Commission is asking the Member States to pay. Do these advances mean that the Member States will be paying part of their 1988 contribution in advance, thereby reducing the amount of revenue in 1988 or is 'advance' a euphemism for a single one-off payment under an intergovernmental agreement? Finally, I turn to 1988. In respect of the 1988 budget, does the amount of EAGGF guarantee expenditure proposed by the Commission accord with the projec tions which it published in Document COM 101 and specifically the evolution of EAGGF payments shown in table 6 of that document? If it does not, by how much does it exceed those projections in respect of 1988? TOMLINSON (S). \u2014 May I ask the Vice-President whether he has sufficient confidence m the reliability of the figures he has produced in his 1987 draft sup plementary budget and the impact they will have on the situation for 1988? Does he see no threat what soever in paragraph 9 of Mrs Barbarella's motion for a resolution on the guidelines for 1988? Is he satisfied that there is no threat whatsoever to him and to the prospects of a satisfactory conclusion of the budget in that paragraph 9 which spells out our collective res ponsibilities under Article 119? May I also invite him in future perhaps to use a some what different word when he is talking about the impact of the repayments to the United Kingdom? I find the word 'overshadowed' a rather pejorative word for what was a Community decision at Fontainebleau which this House, against my view and judgements at the time, was invited to consider as being a great triumph for the Presidency of Mr Mitterrand. The fact that the repayments to the United Kingdom have per haps not worked out to the satisfaction of everybody ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/209 Tomlinson might well be a reflection of how inadequately we have tackled the budgetary problems of agriculture and therefore not managed to get an adjustment within the budget on more sensible expenditure poli cies. Finally, may I ask him to explain a little bit more clearly what this 1.74% VAT rate which emerged after the deliberations of the Finance Ministers actually represents. As I understand it, there is no agreement. Are you saying that were they to agree to that which is proposed to them, the effect, were it to be calculated on a VAT basis, would equal 1.74%? If that is the case, I should love to hear what Mrs Thatcher says about that on the days between now and 11 June. VAN DER WAAL (NI). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I have three short questions. Can the Commissioner confirm that for payments in the context of the EAGGF, Guar antee Section, the Council has decided to change from the system of advance payments to one of reimburse ment? If so, can the Commissioner tell us how far this will solve the problem of agricultural finance this year? Secondly, a Council decision on the Commission's financing proposals, documents 100 and 101, can probably not be expected in the short term. In view of this, does the Commission intend to seek an interim solution for 1988 on the basis of a VAT percentage of 1.6%? Thirdly, the Commission has said that as from 1 July it will probably be forced to slow down or even stop payments from the structural fund. Can the Commis sion tell us what the consequences of this will be for the undertaking that Spain and Portugal will not become net contributors during the transitional period? VON DER VRING (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr Vice-President, my first observation concerns a figure which was pos sibly relayed incorrectly. If I understood properly, you said the Ecofin decision means that the percentage rate of value-added tax will be 1.47%. Is that correct, or is it 1.74%. That is what the German version said and I almost fainted. 1988 budget is to be interpreted in relation to the medium-term financial plan and forecasts contained in document No 101. I have to admit that when I saw the figures \u2014 probably everyone felt the same \u2014 tears came to my eyes and I thought, we shall never get the money! And if we ever got that amount of money we could be very happy! But if the Commission is already going back on these figures two months later and is now producing a supplementary budget which sud denly decides to add 2 billion ECU, i.e. to advance from 36 to 38 billion ECU \u2014 that means that this medium-term financial planning is no longer of any significance. I should very much like you to explain how I am to interpret this? COLOM I NAVAL (S). \u2014 (ES) MrPresident, I should like to put a few brief question to the Commis sion. First, does the Commission think it can guaran tee that all the Community's financial and budgetary risks for the 1987 financial year will now be covered by the current draft supplementary budget \u2014 includ ing the problem of the 'British cheque'? Secondly, in connection with the first question, in view of the rate at which resources are being exhausted, could the Commission specify which coun tries would be affected and how? For example, given the schedule for EAGGF Guarantee payments and bearing in mind that the crops are now growing \u2014 at different rates for geographical reasons \u2014 which countries may be most affected? Are the political agreements with Spain and Portugal on budgetary neutrality safeguarded? Is the financial situation in Ire land taken into account? Thirdly I cannot help noticing the similarity between the figures we have been given for the 1988 budget and the theories about the maximum growth rate envisaged in Document COM (101). I should be grateful for rather more precision than in your pre vious speech on the matter. Finally, I should like clarification, so far as possible, of the brief information in the note handed out to us at mid-day today on the reasons for the reduction of aid for cooperation and development in the 1988 budget. I would like to ask you this: the Commission's medium-term financial plan covering the budgets for 1987 to 1992 was laid before us two months ago in document No 100. In practice this provides the frame work for a supplementary budget \u2014 as I understand it \u2014 namely, an increase in the volume of ECU expendi ture to 42 billion in 1987. That would have meant a corresponding sum for 1988, one which is considera bly higher than what is being mentioned now \u2014 I did not catch any figures. I should like to know how the Commission's proposals for a supplementary budget and the guideline for the IN THE CHAIR: MR ALBER Vice-President CHRISTODOULOU (PPE). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner to remember that during the procedure for the 1987 preliminary draft budget the rapporteur proposed that the appro priations which had been earmarked for the EAGGF agricultural subsidies should, after a fashion, be set ",
        "No 2-352/210 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Christodoulou aside and that the procedure should be changed from advances to reimbursements. This proposal, both direct from the rapporteur and in its amendment form, was rejected by Parliament and the Committee on Budgets. I just want to remind the Commissioner of this so that he can bear it in mind. I also want to question the Commissioner about the revenues from the special tax on oils and fats. The ini tial estimate was that this would bring in about 2 bil lion ECU. However, it now appears that this amount will be raised only in 1988, and that in 1987 it will be no more than 300 billion ECU. If this is going to be the case, it is imperative that we talk about the reper cussions here and now. I would also like to know if he has anything to report, from the various contacts he has had so far, regarding the willingness of the governments to respond to the Commission's proposal for balancing the 1987 budget through a system of intergovernmental payments. Are the governments of the Member States willing to com ply with this request or are the present indications negative, because if they are, the problem will have to be tackled another way? Finally, on the 1988 budget, could the Commissioner tell us what section of the appropriations provided for in this is specifically designated for the realization of the Single Act, for the proposals and plans connected, presumably, with the implementation of it? Various statements from time to time by the President of the Commission and its other members regarding the implementation of this Act have intimated that this will be the basis, that there will, that is, be a series of appropriations specifically designated for this purpose. So which is the expenditure section in the 1988 budget which deals with this aspect? CHRISTOPHERSEN, Vice-President of the Commis sion. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, there have been a great many questions. I do not think I shall manage to answer them all in one go, if time is to be left for the rest of Parliament's business. But I would point out here, by way of introduction to my answers, that tomorrow we shall be presenting to Parliament a sum mary of our proposals, both for 1987 and for 1988, and a number of the questions will be answered in that text. We took decisions here this morning in the Com mission, so we shall only have a document ready first thing tomorrow morning. There were a few minor errors in some of the figures I mentioned. I will permit myself briefly to correct them. On the Ecofin Council I will say, in answer to the question put by Mr von der Vring, and I think that Mr Tomlinson also voiced a certain amount of doubt, that, if we look at the guidelines the Ecofin Council attaches to the Council's reading of the 1988 budget and the figures set out in the decision, according to our calculations we need a marginal VAT rate for 1988 of 1.47%. The present own resources ceiling is thus exceeded, and that is only a demonstration of the fact that the Council of Ministers now also recognizes that we have gone beyond the point at which we can stay within the 1.4% limit. But I would say that, other wise, the Council of Ministers has entered an unreal- istically low figure for agricultural expenditure. I shall return to that. I would say to Mrs Barbarella that there is absolutely no contradiction between what I said today and what the President of the Commission said. On the con trary! We are in close agreement with one another. The draft budget for 1988 which the Commission adopted here this morning is entirely consistent with the information, figures and views contained in COM 100 and 101 respectively. There is no inconsis tency whatsoever. They are exactly the same figures. You may then ask: what about the implementation of the Single European Act? Well, we have already pointed out in COM 100 and 101 that adjustments, improvements and changes in the existing rules would be required in some areas. Let me just take the Social Fund. At the present level of appropriations, the Commission receives 10 000 applications per year to the Social Fund. The reality is that our present administration has immense problems in examining them all seriously. Our financial control services are faced with immense problems with regard to scrutiny. Doubling the resources of the Social Fund would require a change in the entire system and in the principles applied. It would require the national auth orities to improve their administration. We simply need a little time. The Community needs time, for none of us are interested in window-dressing or in seeing money wasted. The Commission merely appeals for an understanding of that. Let us get the necessary changes implemented in a responsible manner. That is in all our interests. If we really want to convince the budgetary authority, but also the Member States, which are perhaps reluctant to increase the Com munity's own resources, our best plan is to show that we are able to use the resources in a responsible and profitable manner. But there is no contradiction. There is perfectly clear agreement between what is stated in COM 100 and 101 and in the two draft budgets. That is the last thing we needed! There must of course be consistency. Mrs Barbarella put a question on liquidity problems. I am glad of that question, because it is something few people seem to be interested in. It will be a huge prob lem in the coming months. Already in June we shall have a liquidity shortfall of over 2.5 billion ECU. The figure will increase steadily over the months to come. We shall be obliged to overdraw heavily on the national finance ministries, and there will be Member States which cannot give us this credit. The worst-off Member States, with severe economic problems, may simply not be able to cope with this. There will thus be ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/211 Christophersen Member States with economic difficulties which will be indirectly affected by a liquidity crisis and will therefore not be able to make payments on time to their own citizens, producer organizations or whoever else may have claims on them. This is therefore a very important and serious aspect. Mrs Barbarella, Mr Cot and others also asked what would happen if we did nothing. Now the Commis sion does not have two sets of proposals for the Coun cil or Parliament to choose from. The Commission has one proposal. It is the one contained in the supplemen tary budget, but the Commission wishes to draw atten tion to the consequence of not approving that propo sal. Let us take the advance payments under the arrangements for agricultural expenditure. We have two possibilities. One is simply to wait until October. We shall then have used up all the appropriations. But, as Mrs Barbarella and Mr Colom pointed out, that can give rise to difficulties for certain Member States, because some of them have such late harvests that they do not receive the biggest share of the advances they should get until late in the year, perhaps in Novem ber-December. And, if we do not have any appropria tions in November and December, we cannot make payments to them. What may happen, for example, is that during the summer we use wine and olive oil cre dits reserved for certain countries to finance the underfunding of expenditure on butter stocks, on grain, meat and other Northern European products. In order to avoid such a distortion therefore we must consider whether we should undertake a pro rata reduction in payments from the EAGGF Guidance Section at an early stage. But that is not a Commission proposal, since the Commission does not want us to get into that situation. But it is a description of what may be the consequence if the Council does not take up its responsibility. The same applies to the non-compulsory expenditure. If we cannot finance it, clearly we may be forced into a situation where we say to the budgetary authority, to the Council and Parliament, that they must now dis charge the responsibility which is incumbent on them. They must now decide what they want to economize on. There are, for example, payments from the Regional Fund, research funds and the like. The Member States and Parliament must decide for them selves whether that is a consequence they wish to con template. That is not what the Commission wants. But we have to point out that, if they will not take up their responsibility and adopt a supplementary budget, they will put the Community and themselves as the budget ary authority into an uncomfortable situation. We think that, for the sake of good order, we should put you in the picture now so that you are fully aware of what the consequences will be of not following the Commission's proposals. Questions were put on many other matters. What about the agricultural expenditure, how is it calcu lated? It is calculated on the basis of something known as the agriculture guideline formula, but the Commis sion has said that it is now realistic to base the calcula tion on what the true budget of the Community will be in 1987, including the agriculture budget. There is no longer any point in trying to persuade one another that the agricultural expenditure amounts to 5 billion or 4 billion ECU less than it actually is. That would be a piece of deception. It would only lead to the destruc tion of the common agricultural policy. It is a calcula tion based on the general agriculture guideline for mula. We must therefore keep agricultural spending within that framework. We also think that we can do that. The price package and the oils and fats tax, if they are adopted in the next few weeks, will produce a saving of about 1.1 billion ECU in 1987 and the oils and fats tax, together with the other proposals, will give a saving of 2.2 billion ECU in 1988. That is an answer to Mr Elles, Mr Pasty and also to Mr Price. But a precondition is of course that the price package be adopted speedily. If it is delayed and negotiated over for months on end, the situation will look differ ent. It must be adopted just as quickly as possible. That prompts me to say to Mr Van der Waal that the Coun cil has not taken any decision on a changeover from advances to arrears in agricultural payments. We hope that the Council will do so, but no decision has yet been taken. I should like to say to Mr von der Vring and others \u2014 perhaps there is some confusion or uncertainty here because I have not explained myself clearly enough \u2014 that the supplementary and amending budget for 1987 has nothing to do with the expenditure side: it is purely a revenue-amending budget. Its purpose is to solve three problems concerned exclusively with the revenue side. One is to cover the 1986 deficit \u2014 we seek to do that by using what remains of the margin on VAT revenue in 1987. The second consists in removing the underbudgeting for agriculture. We do that by changing from advances to arrears in agricul tural payments. That does not apply to the expenditure side either. Finally, there is the loss of customs duty revenue. We propose that that be solved by national contributions. We are not proposing an increase on the expenditure side for 1987; we are proposing changes on the revenue side and other changes which will solve our revenue problems. Both Mr Colom and Mr Christodoulou ask what the Member States have to say about this. Have agree ments been reached with them? Is the Commission involved in negotiations? No, we have not reached agreements with any Member States, for we are not negotiating with the Member States. We are negotiat ing with the Council of Ministers and Parliament. We will not depart from that course. There is to be a meet ing of the Budget Council on 2 June, at which the Council of Ministers will have to state its position and, we hope, take a decision. But the Commission cannot enter into agreements with individual Member States; nor do we wish to do that. Of course we do realize that some Member States may have problems. I think I ",
        "No 2-352/212 Debates of the European Parliament 14. 5. 87 Christophersen have already mentioned the liquidity problem, which may affect certain Member States, and the problem with agricultural advances which other Member States may have. But we have not entered into any prior agreements. We have the impression that the Council of Ministers recognizes the seriousness of the problem, that the will is there in the Council of Ministers and that there is a clear understanding in the Belgian Presi dency of the need for a speedy decision. An extraordi nary Budget Council meeting has therefore been called for 2 June, because the Commission has asked for it, because the Belgian Presidency realizes the urgency of the matter and because there is a wish to dispose of it before the meeting of the European Council. Mr Tomlinson has two questions. One voiced concern over my description of how the British repayment operates. I cannot present it in any way other than I have done. I did not say it to offend anyone; those are the facts. The British repayment is calculated on the basis of what we know of the budgetary trend in the preceding year and, until the system is changed, we enter on the revenue side of the budget the amount by which the United Kingdom will be reducing its con tributions. In 1987 it was 1600 million ECU. Next year, according to our calculations, it will be 2500 mil lion ECU and, if the United Kingdom is to reduce its payments by that amount, others will have to pay it instead. Their payments will have to be increased, and that is one of the reasons why we shall exceed the 1.4% limit. We cannot change it; that is how the sys tem works. There are other countries as well as the United Kingdom which get reduction or compensa tion arrangements. The Federal Republic of Germany only contributes partly to compensate for the missing payments from the United Kingdom. Spain and Portu gal also only make partial contributions. That leaves an exclusive little circle of eight Member States which have to increase their VAT rates accordingly. If the Ecofin Council's figures are taken as a basis \u2014 I do not know whether they will be, that will be its own decision \u2014 these eight Member States will have to come up with 1.47% of their VAT. There will more over be 4 billion ECU missing for agricultural expend iture, but that is a different matter. Mr Elles that the combined mass of revenue in 1988 will be greater than in 1987. We expect it to rise by about 2.5%, but that will not solve a great many prob lems. The real level of expenditure will be considerably higher because of the agricultural expenditure and because of the demands the British repayment scheme imposes on the marginal VAT rate for the eight Mem ber States I spoke of earlier. I think that by these answers I have dealt with most of the problems. A final word to Mr Tomlinson, who asked whether I had confidence in the figures produced by the Commis sion. Indeed I have the highest confidence in them and, as Mr Tomlinson is not here, I dare say he knows that very well; otherwise he would have waited for my answer. The Commission is of course not a body of naive optimists, but we have a reasonable degree of self-confidence \u2014 we must have it, otherwise we would not be able to deal with these matters at all. At all events, we believe that the estimates we make are realistic. So it is up to the ladies and gentlemen here in Parliament, together with the Council of Ministers, to take up their responsibilities. It is you and the Council of Ministers who can turn us into pessimists. We hope you will not do that, and I hope that my small contri bution here, Mr President, has helped to encourage you to put the pressure on the Council which is neces sary if we are to get through this business. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Thank you very much, Commis sioner, particularly for the very full answers you have given to the questions put. We had decided to follow on now with a debate. However, as very many of the questions have already been answered in great detail, I \u2014 and I am sure the House also \u2014 would be very grateful if the speakers in the debate would refrain from using up all their speaking time. COLOM I NAVAL (S). \u2014 (ES) Mr President, I think we could well give up our speaking time so that all the groups can digest the figures supplied by the Commis sion, and perhaps next week in the Committee on Budgets we could give a much more valid reply to any points the Commission might wish to make in res ponse to our reply. The figures Mrs Barbarella inquires about concerning the rise in agricultural liabilities will be shown in the documentation we shall be handing out tomorrow. But I can say that what we are now proposing should be done in the farm sector is that the agricultural stock values be depreciated by 6.8 billion ECU over a four- year period. That is simply the amount by which the agricultural stocks are overvalued. If they are depre ciated over four years \u2014 that can be seen in the 1988 budget \u2014 the operation will cost 1.6 billion ECU in 1988. That forms part of what we call a sound agricul ture budget. I think that, although it has taken a little time, I have got through most of the questions. I would just say to PRESIDENT. \u2014 Thank you very much, Mr Colom. That is how I see it too. However, I shall formally ask the individual speakers whether they also will waive their right to speak or whether perhaps they would speak much more briefly than they had planned to. I find that all the speakers are prepared to waive their right to speak. This item is therefore closed. 4. Estimates of Parliament for 1988 PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. A 2-43/87) by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the Committee ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/213 President on Budgets, on the draft estimates of revenue and expenditure of the European Parliament for the finan cial year 1988. PASTY (RDE), rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, for the second consecutive year the conciliation procedure between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau was invoked and resulted in agreement on the main elements of the draft budget which is being laid before you today. Both sides demonstrated their desire to provide our Assembly with the resources which are essential to it and to take account of the special nature of the constraints imposed on it by the multilingual nature of its work and the dispersion created by its working places, but were nevertheless concerned that these resources should be managed more efficiently in the interests of the budgetary restraint which is required of all the institutions of the Community. On two occasions the rapporteur also held meetings with representatives of the Staff Committee. The report which is being submitted to you distinguishes between the problems associated with the establish ment plan and those which affect all the appropria tions. Firstly, the establishment plan. The Committee on Budgets accepted the Bureau's proposals, which are part of the three-year plan for creation of posts adopted in 1985 to cater for the consequences of Spain and Portugal's accession to the Community, which finishes at the end of 1988. The Committee also agreed to the creation of seven temporary posts requested by the political groups. The Committee on Budgets was nevertheless disturbed to find that the return to 1985 staff levels, which, at the time when the three-year plan was drawn up, was envisaged for 1989, appears to be in jeopardy, partly because of the recent increase in the institution's work and the lack of suc cess encountered by the voluntary redundancy and retirement measures, which are the arguments put for ward by the administration and staff representatives, and partly because of inadequate reorganization of services, which is the opinion of some members of the Committee on Budgets. The Committee on Budgets therefore voted an amendment asking the Secretary- General to submit to the Bureau and the committee a full and detailed report on the organization of each division, showing the extent of the duties attached to each post, the resources allocated to them and the results obtained. The results of this survey should pro vide a basis for reorganization of all the services. Nevertheless the Committee on Budgets has insisted that certain services which no longer meet a priority need, such as the Press Cuttings Service or the Termi nology Division, should be the target of the first reor ganization measures envisaged. The staff representatives insist that they should be consulted in connection with the reorganization, which I think is entirely legitimate, and request that the primary objective should not be to cut the estab lishment plan, but that there should also be concern for the increased efficiency of the institution. Your rapporteur for his part feels that this considera tion of the establishment plan is inseparable from con sideration of our institution's working procedures. From this point of view it is not yet possible to assess what effect implementation of the new procedures provided for by the Single Act will have on the work of the European Parliament. Appropriate proposals will have to be made in due course, but we have to prepare for them now by providing the necessary means of coordination between the administration and the political groups. Finally the stabilization of the establishment plan may present some problems of staff career structure. The Committee on Budgets accepted the Secretary-Gen eral's proposals for upgradings, reallocations of grade and ad personam promotions, but insisted that rigorous criteria should be applied in all cases, particularly with regard to merit. The staff representatives pointed out that these various promotions should not be made on an individual basis according to the opportunities available within any one service, but should form part of a proper career structure. With regard to appropriations, the main increase is in item 3708 for the political groups' information cam paign in preparation for the 1989 election, where there is an additional appropriation of 16.7 million ECU. The Bureau and Committee on Budgets have not therefore adopted the appropriation of 7 million ECU which had been requested by the Directorate-General for Information for a general information campaign. The Committee on Budgets did not adopt either the proposal put to it for creation of a monetary reserve of 7 million ECU to offset the consequences of fluctua tions in the Belgian franc exchange rate, that being the currency in which 85% of expenditure is effected, relative to the ECU, in view of the request which the Secretary-General has made to the Commission seek ing an inter-institutional solution, in particular by means of forward exchange purchases. Various economy measures which were not presented by the rapporteur initially have been introduced fol lowing the votes on different amendments in the Com mittee on Budgets. The principal ones are the provi sions concerning the shop in Luxembourg, the operat ing expenses of the EEC/ACP Joint Assembly, meet ings of the political groups and committees outside the customary working places, reimbursement of Mem bers' travelling expenses and, finally, the question of procurement policy. After the various adjustments which were made in the Committee on Budgets the draft budget balances out at slightly less than 400 million ECU, a gross increase ",
        "No 2-352/214 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Pasty of 14%, which is in reality a net increase of only 6% over 1987, after setting aside the consequences of enlargement and the appropriations for item 3708. This increase is below the maximum provided for 1988, but very much higher than the expected rate of inflation. The Committee on Budgets nevertheless recommends you to adopt this draft budget so that, in view of the problems posed by implementation of the Single Act, the Assembly will have the resources which are essen tial for the proper operation of its services next year. PAPOUTSIS (S). \u2014 (GR) MrPresident, today's debate effectively marks the commencement of the budgetary procedure for Parliament for 1988. The European Parliament is the only institution of the Community which gives the peoples of Europe the opportunity of free expression and representation. Because of this the drafting of the estimates of revenue and expenditure is especially important in that it lays the foundation for ensuring that the institution can function effectively. The Community is going through a serious financial crisis which is directly affecting all levels of its activity, given that the inadequacy of resources is hampering the implementation and development of policies. The need to make savings is essential in the case of Parliament's budget as well, even though, when set against the importance of the institution, this repre sents just a tiny fraction of the Community's total budget. Thus on the one hand it is necessary to make savings, in order to show that Parliament is attuned to the spirit of austerity and economy imposed by the economic and social crisis in the Community, while on the other ensuring that Parliament has the resources it needs to carry out its mission effectively. The discussion procedure \u2014 repeated from last year \u2014 contributed significantly, we believe, to the shaping of the final draft, and has shown itself to be a worth while exercise. The Committee on Budgets then had to choose between varying solutions. We would like to believe that the final outcome will help towards resolv ing a number of problems. The drafting of the estimates had to take account of the following: \u2014 first, the need to ensure that all Members have the necessary resources to carry out their work effec tively; \u2014 second, the need to retain equality between the languages, given that this ensures equality of represen tation for all the peoples and cultures of the European Community and allows their representatives to func tion effectively and with parity; \u2014 third, the need to ensure that staff are allocated correctly and that the services function properly. The need for an integrated policy on staffing which will ensure that the career development of Parliament's employees is based on objective criteria; \u2014 fourth, the need to adapt the services of Parlia ment in readiness for the Single Act, and \u2014 fifth, the need to extend the use of the new tech nologies. Mr President, the Socialist Group considers that the Pasty report does comply with this framework and will be a real contribution to combating some of the opera tional problems facing the institution. Beyond this, though, we want to emphasize our real belief that there is a need for the Secretary-General to submit a report on the establishment plan to Parliament, setting out the present situation in the services and outlining the possibilities of improving their functioning, together with a report with proposals for the reorgani zation of the services. In both regards we believe it essential to have cooperation with the elected staff representatives, given that the employees have declared their close interest in tackling the operational problems of the services. Moreover, this analysis of the present situation will clearly demonstrate the heavy workload which the staff have to shoulder and permit more rational alloca tion of staff between the services and the restructuring of the services themselves. As the Pasty report rightly points out, it is essential, with a view to the implemen tation of the Single Act, to adapt the services of the institution to the new requirements, and for a study to be made of this. The Committee on Budgets has also expressed con cern about the high cost of (i) the meetings of the ACP-EC Joint Assembly and (ii) the meetings of the parliamentary committees and political groups outside the three working places. Of course, these meetings away from the home bases are very important if one considers that in the first case they are aimed at form ing acquaintance and cementing relations with the ACP countries, and in the second at spreading an awareness among the European peoples of the work done by the European Parliament and at getting nearer to the problems and cultures of the various countries. Nevertheless, these activities must be kept within a reasonable financial framework and must not put too great a strain on the budget. The Bureau must look at the matter in this light, taking account of the operation of the Joint Assembly as defined in the Lom\u00e9 Convention. Within the framework of the overall requirement for multiannual financial projections we have agreed that there is a need for a corresponding multiannual frame work for the budget of Parliament, so as to permit ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/215 Papoutsis long-term development of staffing policy and the establishment plan. The Pasty report ends with the extremely ambitious proposal that as a general guideline Parliament's budg ets \u2014 after allowing for expenditure on the European information campaign and for the effects of the fluc tuating ECU/BF exchange rate \u2014 should not exceed the maximum rate. This position may cause problems in the future. However, it does undoubtedly demon strate the seriousness of Parliament's approach to the financial problem, with prudent management in res pect of its own budget first of all. Mr President, the Socialist Group believes that the 1988 estimates submitted for the House's approval do genuinely contribute to ensuring that the institution functions effectively. HACKEL (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion which is before us says that the rate of increase in the European Parliament's draft budget is 6%. This is a very high rate of increase \u2014 the rapporteur pointed that out \u2014 and although the relevant calculations were mentioned, we nevertheless \u2014 because it is a net increase \u2014 have to justify this very high rise. One of the main causes is the increase in the establish ment plan. For very good reasons the Committee on Budgets accepted the relevant paragraphs relating to the establishment plan, but my group considers it very important for paragraphs 3 and 4 to be given a little more attention. As regards the Plenary's decisions from 1985 and 1986, namely, that Parliament's establishment plan should be reduced to the position of 31 December 1985, and in view of the associated problems with par agraphs 3 and 4, we think it very important for us to do the job properly and for the Secretary-General to present reports which are acceptable to the whole Plenary, so that we have a good basis on which to evaluate the establishment plan of the European Par liament over the next few years. I would also like to ask the Secretariat therefore to carry out the work within the prescribed period. A further point was the question of resources. Differ ent items have been moved around; the conciliation procedure was invoked and there were several debates within the Committee on Budgets itself. I do not wish to comment on that in detail, but simply to point out that my group is unable to vote for three paragraphs contained in the motion for a resolution. The first one is paragraph 11. There has been consi derable discussion of the resources allocated for meet ings of the ACP/EEC Joint Assembly. The Committee on Budgets should not ignore what the Bureau and the Members of Parliament delegated to it decide. In our opinion savings should be made, but not in this way. Secondly, we also take a critical attitude towards para graph 13. We do not want to have to take a decision of this kind on the part of the Committee on Budgets as the basis for asking ourselves where our group should hold its meetings and where not. Particularly in groups consisting of members from several Member States, like my own for example, which has members from eleven Member States, consideration is being given to whether it might not in the short term be pos sible to meet outside the three prescribed meeting places. For this reason we are unable to vote for para graph 13 as it stands. Thirdly, the majority of my group reject paragraph 20. In other respects we are able to vote for the motion and shall vote accordingly on the individual para graphs. Before the budget proceedings in the autumn of this year we should, however, definitely consider ways in which we can make the entire budget procedure first more transparent, second, more effective and third, more comprehensible for the public. I believe that par ticularly for 1989 and subsequent years Parliament owes the public a more transparent, more effective and more comprehensible budget, and that in the years to come our discussion of the possibilities of the budget and the third of it available to us must demonstrate a better and more efficient method of procedure. PRICE (ED). \u2014 Mr President, in the last seven years our secretariat has grown and developed enormously as a result of Parliament becoming directly elected, the two phases of enlargement and also the expanded role of Parliament. I think the time has come to conduct a complete and detailed review of the entire establish ment plan to ensure that we are deploying our staff in such a way as to meet the needs of 1988 rather than the needs as they were some years ago. I am glad that the Committee in Budgets accepted my proposal for this review, now contained in paragraph 4 of the motion. What is intended is a two-stage review. In the first place there needs to be a survey objectively indicating precisely what functions are being carried out, what the justification for those functions is, and of course whether or not they could be performed more effi ciently. That is essentially factual in nature. Then one needs to proceed from that to recommendations from the Secretary-General as to what conclusions he reaches on the basis of that factual survey. May I say in passing that the amendment which was adopted in the Committee on Budgets appears only to include the second part implicitly and I think there is a slight cleri cal error in the text which can no doubt be put right. The important thing is that we should be leading to an improvement in staff motivation and morale, and I make that remark particularly \u00e0 propos the amend- ",
        "No 2-352/216 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 Price ments by Mr Chambeiron. Quite clearly the staff will need to be involved in decisions ultimately taken about redeployment, but I believe the amendment may be mistaken in the way that it suggests their involvement in the factual analysis phase. I think that at least the main part of the involvement of the Staff Committee should be at the later phase. As regards paragraph 11, which raises the question of whether further savings can be made relating to the ACP/EEC Joint Assembly, my group relies on the review which the enlarged Bureau is about to conduct in this area. It is clearly going to be important for them to consult with the Bureau of the Joint Assembly. We believe there is scope for savings, but those savings will have to be worked out in some detail between the two organizations. In looking at Parliament's budget, one important fac tor which has to be borne in mind is the extra expense and loss of efficiency which is caused by the fact that we work in several places. That is something which can never be ignored when looking at Parliament's budget. Finally, a series of suggestions made by members of my group have been incorporated in this text. We think it is a positive one and we intend to support it. LOUWES (LDR). \u2014 (NL) MrPresident, I should first of all like to compliment the rapporteur on behalf of my group, not only for working steadily and con scientiously, but quickly too. We are particularly pleased that it is possible for us to deal with this budget in the May part-session as scheduled. A few years ago when I was rapporteur it was not possible. We are mainly in agreement with the Pasty report as adopted by the Committee on Budgets and we are especially pleased with the general drift of the whole report, namely, that we must continue to be careful of costs and to keep expenditure under control. As regards the amendments, we shall vote against Mr Van der Waal's amendment which would close down the library in Luxembourg, although we shall return to the question of the library in Luxembourg. As long as the library \u2014 which is a very good one \u2014 is located in Luxembourg, it is less accessible, if not totally inaccessible, to members of Parliament, who seldom meet in Luxembourg any more. But to propose to close down the library is going too far. In the case of paragraph 11, cutting the costs of the delegation to the ACP countries, it is not surprising that the Committee on Budgets voted in favour of this, but there have been objections in my group to the effect that this is institutionally incorrect. The ACP- EEC delegation is governed by a separate agreement. It is going a little far for our Committee on Budgets on its own initiative to propose that we interfere in the way the agreement operates. We shall support Mrs Duty's amendment on this point. I understand that Mr Price, who is partly responsible for today's text of paragraph 11, is to vote for it. We have cor rectly stipulated that the agreement of the ACP coun tries concerning the establishment of a delegation expressly states that there are to be only three working languages. This is something which we may reconsi der. If the economies cannot be found on the one side, they will probably be on the other. The three lan guages are specifically mentioned in the agreement. Finally, with regard to the penultimate paragraph, concerning reimbursement of travelling expenses, my group has come to the conclusion that this is certainly reasonable, but that it should be considered in the Bureau before a decision is taken here. We have tabled an amendment which I am sure will probably be adopted, but that does not alter the fact that we hope the Bureau will look into the matter. TELK\u00c4MPER (ARC). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I should once again like to point out with reference to budget line 3708 that we are against any arrangement which gives preference to those who obtain a seat in the European Parliament, to the detriment of those who either have been candidates or wish to be candidates, but are not represented here. You are familiar with the differences in the voting sys tems of the individual member countries, and there is therefore no need for me to go into the injustices which exist here. Nor do I need to deal further with the legal action taken by the French Greens, who have referred to the discrimination against them, because you are familiar with the outcome. For reasons of equality we are against the proposed arrangements, as I have already pointed out many times, most recently in the enlarged Bureau. We also consider it to be an evasion of the judgment of the European Court of Justice. We have never voted for the proposed arrangements, whether in the enlarged Bureau or in the debates so far. VAN DER WAAL (NI). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, for our part we think that the present motion for a resolu tion is to be welcomed. Furthermore, it is arguable that a net rise of 6% for 1987 is perhaps too high with an inflation rate of 3%, but the Pasty report contains a number of very worthwhile initiatives for controlling costs, and therefore our comments are mainly con cerned with this point. Firstly, it is extremely regrettable that the aim of reducing staff numbers to the 1985 level in 1989 is a long way from attainment and that unfortunately no new target has been presented. The staff savings which were expected as a result of the introduction of com- ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/217 Van der Waal puterized systems and the increased use of outside contractors have apparently either been too optimistic in the past, or the savings have been offset by the expansion in other functions. In the meantime person nel costs constitute approximately 50% of the Secre tariat's costs and are therefore a matter of priority. That is why it is vitally important that paragraph 4 of the draft resolution should actually be implemented. In this way it will be possible to acquire a good overall picture of the nature and extent of the Secretariat's work, so that the aim of an efficient Parliament can be encouraged as far as possible. This is the purpose of the amendments which we have tabled. Another criterion which has to be satisfied with res pect to Parliament's functions is whether all the work is really necessary, and whether there are any cheaper alternatives. It is certainly illogical for Parliament to criticise the increase in staff numbers in the Secretariat without at the same time making its own contribution towards converting this trend into a downwards one. Let me give two examples by way of illustration. First of all, leaving aside the matter of interpretation, the question of whether Members consider that meeting outside the official working places really is preferable to any other method of working. Any restrictions on this should certainly not add to Members' workload. Secondly, Parliament should limit its activities to the tasks which are really essential. In this respect a little self-discipline in tabling amendments under Rule 47 would not come amiss. Finally we wish to say that the Pasty report provides a good basis for balanced evolution of parliamentary expenditure. been published since the day after the Chernobyl dis aster. It has, I believe, been extremely useful for the Members who asked for it. I have no doubt that if Mr Pasty and my colleagues did receive documents like this \u2014 and I am prepared to lend Mr Pasty the 153 page Press review which I received this morning \u2014 I have no doubt, ladies and gentlemen, that you would revise your opinion of a service which saves us a considerable amount of time by selecting the Press information which we may need. May I add that it will never be possible for a Member of Parliament or a small, or even medium-sized, group to produce a Press review containing articles which have appeared in daily newspapers in the twelve coun tries. I therefore ask that there be an evaluation of the press division, but do not condemn in advance the use ful work which is being done by a service which will be re-established with more difficulty than it will be abolished. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting time. 5. Small and medium-sized undertakings PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. A 2-27/87) by Mrs Tove Nielsen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on small and medium-sized under takings and craft industries. ROELANTS DU VPvTER (ARC). \u2014 (FR) Mr Presi dent, colleagues, like any parliamentarian who is wor thy of the name, I think, I read the reports which are tabled in the Plenary, even if they do not concern the parliamentary committees of which I am a member. I skimmed through the report of my colleague, Mr Pasty, and was greatly surprised to find that it called in question certain services of the Parliament, which appear to me to operate to the general satisfac tion. I am thinking particularly of the press division, which has been rather curiously reduced to the press cuttings service, according to Mr Pasty of the Com mittee on Budgets. I am a member of a small group and as such I have had to teach myself to swim in the bureaucratic sea with which we are surrounded. The advantage of this is that one discovers useful services and, in this Parliament, charming people who are ready to help you. For example, few Members know that, provided they ask, it is possible in this building to have a daily press review and specialized reviews for committees and subjects of current interest. A specialist monthly on the theme of the environment and nuclear matters has NIELSEN, Tove (LDR), rapporteur. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, as I catch my breath and get my docu ments together, I cannot help feeling that I really am in the same situation as the large numbers of people who work in small and medium-sized businesses. We have an enormous number of tasks to accomplish. We rush from one thing to the other, like me now, hurry ing breathlessly from a meeting so that I can speak on the report we are to deal with here. As I said, I believe that sums up the situation of people who work in small and medium-sized firms. They have an enormous number of tasks to get through. They do not always have the necessary training, they do not always have the necessary qualifications, but they have fantastic will \u2014 and that is already half the battle \u2014 to dispose of the many tasks which have to be got through in the age we live in. I therefore think it important that we here in Parliament have for so many years been mak ing strenuous efforts to ease the lives, the way forward and the future of small and medium-sized businesses and craft industries. We have lumped them together under one heading and I also think that it is still important not to make a distinction between small and medium-sized undertakings on the one hand and craft industries on the other. ",
        "No 2-352/218 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Nielsen As you know, we have preoccupied ourselves in Par liament for a number of years with this large group in the Community as such, because we feel that it is espe cially necessary to help them to achieve better working conditions, faced as they are with so many obstacles. And when we think that the Community is in a situa tion of over 17 million unemployed, there is a least one thing that can unite us here in Parliament: we are agreed that we must do what we can to secure the creation of more long-term jobs. The structure and flexibility which typify small and medium-sized busi nesses and craft enterprises in particular are such that they are able to adjust more rapidly to the challenges they face. I am very happy with the amendments which have been tabled. I know that there has been a technical error \u2014 there should have been an opinion from the Committee on Energy, Research and Technology \u2014 but I am very glad of the amendments which are avail able, for they show that, in a world faced with great technological challenges, it is absolutely essential for us to adapt and take up these new tasks, so that we can offer new products. What we need above all is to become competitive. It is to be able to produce new products, which the individual firm is not necessarily always able to produce alone, which is why we urge that an effort be made, in cooperation with the Com mission and, we hope, with the Council, across the national frontiers, which are after all destined to dis appear. In this way we shall develop the strength to stand up to the great challenges facing us from both the United States and Japan, which are well ahead of us. But the level of skill and know-how in the Com munity is surely not so bad and I am certain that, if we jointly do our bit to support and assist small and medium-sized businesses, we shall also be able to take up the challenges and shall have better conditions under which to produce new products, create new jobs and face the competition from the giants on the world market. I note with pleasure that the Commission is very posi tively disposed to this. The committee welcomes the fact that the Commission attaches great importance to the plan to set up a task force whose function will be to examine all proposals put forward and assess what consequences they may have for small and medium- sized firms. It is very important that we secure the removal of the many obstacles which, day in and day out, prevent them from developing their potential and achieving the aims I have outlined. My final remark, Mr President, will be that the objec tive we have set ourselves in the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament of removing all obstacles and achieving a real internal market by the end of 1992 will be of very special help to small and medium-sized businesses. Indeed if anyone suffers from the problems which beset us today and have done for many years, it is the small and medium-sized undertakings, for they simply do not have the neces sary facilities to deal with the problems. It is not only to the detriment of the individual firm and to small and medium-sized businesses in general, it is to the detriment of Europe. We will therefore continue to pursue this matter, together with the Commission and, we hope, the Council of Ministers. I am grateful for the valuable support we are getting and I hope that, when this debate is concluded, we can continue to work jointly on the matter, for it will be to the benefit of us all in Europe. We must have this economic recovery, which is so vital to us. We must secure the creation of those many jobs. I feel that we have made a significant contribution to that aim here. GIANNAKOU-KOUTSIKOU (PPE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the need for an integrated policy for the support and further develop ment of small and medium-sized undertakings is more pressing today than ever before. Imminent developments in the European Community following the Single Act, and the burgeoning invasion of Europe by American and Japanese technology, make it imperative to have new arrangements favour ing SMUs and their employees with a view to enabling them to become more competitive. The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, for which I am speak ing as draftsman of its opinion, recognizes that so far the European Community and Parliament have shown a keen interest in this vital section of the economy, which frequently accounts for up to 90% of undertak ings and employs around 60% of the active popula tion. Quite recently the Council approved the Com mission's Action Programme for the SMUs, which is based on two principal objectives. The first of these is the development of appropriate conditions for the creation of a favourable environ ment for SMUs and the second is the development of the capacity for flexibility in the SMUs and of the potential for funding them. Guided by these criteria, our committee has proposed in its opinion that the important role of the SMUs in the creation of new jobs be recognized in all Com munity legislation and rules. Regarding job creation, it is a fact that in the remote areas, most of which are agricultural, and with the impending reform of the common agricultural policy, the creation of SMUs or the development of those which already exist can play a major part in maintaining local populations. Addi tionally, the structure of the SMUs is conducive to good personal relations in the workforce and can thus be an engine for social innovations. But over and above their contribution to job creation the SMUs are notable for their ability to respond to the challenge of modern technology and to market demand. These fac tors can undoubtedly make a positive contribution to the rounded economic development of the Com munity. ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/219 Giannakou-Koutsikou As regards specific measures which can assist towards the development and creation of SMUs, the greatest attention must be paid to the training given to young people at all levels of education, because the inculca tion here of the entrepreneurial spirit will lead to new job creation. As far as specific measures to help the development of SMUs are concerned, the easing of Community legislation, rules and administrative pro cedures is also something which will contribute to a favourable climate. Here the European Social Fund has a key role to play. It must support the SMUs and help them to acquire new specializations for their staffs in the areas of new technology, production and management. At this point let me highlight the role of the Integrated Mediterranean Programmes, which provide for many forms of support for SMUs and craft industries and will thus contribute to combating the unemployment which is blighting certain Mediterranean areas and to keeping productive activity going in the agricultural and less-favoured areas. Lastly, looking foward to the completion of the inter nal market, with the simplification of procedures, the abolition of frontiers, the free movement of people, workers and goods, I believe that the SMUs will ben efit substantially from this, given that in addition to the opportunities for cooperation, including transna tional links within the Community, they will also have easier access to public contracts in the Member States. The valuable experience they gain along the way will equip them to go for the big markets, even those of the USA and Japan. But for this to happen there must at the same time be measures such as the adaptation of company law and the institution of an appropriate tax system which will establish incentives while not, how ever, distorting competition. In closing, Mr President, allow me, as the spokesper son for the Social Affairs Committee, to say that in general terms I support the Nielsen report and to stress that the formulation and implementation of the conditions I have mentioned must not be carried out in such a way as to put social protection factors, the health and safety of employees, at risk, or to jeopar dize the policy on the environment. To sum up, the two principal elements for the development of SMUs are the flexibility they must acquire and social mea sures, in combination. TURNER (ED), draftsman of the opinion of the Com mittee on Energy, Research and Technology. \u2014 Mr President, I speak for the Energy, Research and Technology Committee on Mrs Nielsen's report. The committee made six amendments to the report which were discussed by her committee but by an accident were not incorporated in the report. However, I am very glad to say that Mrs Nielsen fully supports them. We completely support her report, but there are cer tain aspects of small companies which are substantially different where high technology based companies are concerned. By that I mean companies which manufac ture high technology materials using high technology processes or are involved in research and development. It includes information technology, soft and hardware, microelectronics, Optronics, biotechnology, robotics, metrology and so on. Almost by definition the people who start up these small companies, and it is normally only two people who start one up, are ingenious and enterprising. They start very small with perhaps two or three experts with possibly not even much business experience and, if they do well, within four years they will probably have 80 employees. The second thing about them, apart from their fast growth, is that they tend to split up and reform quite quickly. That is one reason why we must make sure that the development of small companies in the form of amalgamations and splits and so on will not be confined within national boundaries but can take place across frontiers. The problems of start-up are, first of all, the finding of premises. That is quite a problem in very many cases. There are nurseries and small industrial zones and sci ence parks, and a lot of expertise in local authorities has gone into this. I feel we ought to get those experts together so that they can discuss how best to help small companies to get going. But the main problem is financing. First of all, they need seed capital and then venture capital after about a year, and then, after about two or three years, they need development capi tal. At that stage they have got a product on the mar ket and are looking ahead to business. It is at that stage that they suffer compared with American com panies because they have a very small home base. They have France. Germany, Britain or Holland, whereas an American small company will have the whole of the United States as its home base. It is at the stage, there fore, after three or four years when they are into development capital, that they need to be able to cross frontiers with links in marketing, manufacturing or research and development. Esprit, Brite and RACE and such projects are very helpful in this respect, but we must do much more to help them cross the fron tiers. Venture capital finance in Europe is far too central ized and linked to the large companies in the financial centre of the EEC. We must decentralize it, we must bring financiers and small companies together where the small companies are. So much has to be done for small companies in high technology. They must have a data bank, which the Commission is trying to set up, which will give infor mation on fiscal problems in the next-door country and on raising capital and on markets and so on, because you go to any small high technology company and nobody there has the time to look across the fron- ",

All I can now say is that in paragraph 23 of the opinion of the Energy Committee, which is in this report, you will find 13 proposals specifically tailored for small high technology companies which I hope that the whole of this House will support. FRIEDRICH, Ingo (PPE). \u2014 (DE) MrPresident, Mr Matutes, Mrs Nielsen, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for the report, which I naturally support in the We, the representatives of the SMUs, do not want subsidies, we want a general environment, conditions, which make it possible for SMUs to develop in the first place. Unfortunately the figures have not been so good in recent years. In my own country we have unfortunately found that in the food sector five large concerns control 40% of turnover and that in the last 20 years 44% \u2014 almost half! \u2014 of bakers have gone out of business. That is bad! That is why we have to improve the general environment. Let met mention a few factors. Firstly, for most small undertakings the so-called second wage which is paid indirectly in addi tion to actual wages, not to employees but in the form of ancillary costs, is too high. This 'second wage' can not be financed any longer and must be reduced; because this could be a way of creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs, if they were no longer too expensive for the SMUs. Second factor: we all know that in small firms capital is the greatest problem. That is why we need relief in respect of those taxes which are not profit-related. If a firm makes a profit it ought to pay taxes, but the taxes which are levied independently of profit are bad. They must be reduced. Third suggestion: we should make it possible to reduce apprehension and to make it possible for our SMUs to make effective use of the new wider market. That is why I think the idea of the so-called Eurogui- chet is an excellent one, and the Commission should provide it with full support so as to provide assistance with cooperation across frontiers. Large concerns have an office in every country and do not need a facility like this; but small firms need help in order to be in a better position to overcome the barriers which still exist. We must also ease the fears of our craftsmen, like those in my own country, who are becoming afraid that new, unfair competition will develop. We have freedom to provide services, but that is not the same thing as the freedom to pursue a trade. Before a crafts man can take over a business he must continue to sit the examinations which are necessary for him to be allowed to follow that trade, even in decades to come. Fourth suggestion, Commissioner \u2014 I am in fact sub stantially in agreement with you \u2014 we must exploit the unique nature of Europe more than we have done hitherto. I see it for example in northern Italy, in Lom- bardy, where 300 SMUs, proud of being north Itali ans, followed the traditional trades of Lombardy but looked beyond northern Italy, beyond the frontiers. That is what I mean: the combination of individuality \u2014 Alsatian wine, north Italian shoes, Bavarian beer, if you will forgive me \u2014 plus a wider vision extending beyond traditional frontiers. That is characteristic of Europe and a special opportunity which no one else can offer, except we in Europe with our SMUs. We should make more use of this opportunity and give it additional impetus. The number of small firms in the RACE, Brite and Esprit programmes is still too low. We have to push harder here so that it is easier for the small firms to join in. The documentation is somewhat complicated: we must provide additional help for the small firms with this too. Commissioner, congratulations on the energy with which you have tackled this area of the SMUs. Thank you very much, Mrs Nielsen! I shall vote for almost everything you have proposed. I myself have tabled two amendments, which I should of course like to be supported. If we can make it possible for small firms to develop better, we shall have found a capital way of eliminating unemployment, because this is the area in which the most new jobs are created. (Applause) METTEN (S). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, the key to the importance of the SMUs lies in the direction which Mr Friedrich also mentioned, the creation of new jobs. I can also say that there is considerable consensus as to the importance of the SMUs in the Community. New enterprises are being created all the time, and they are by definition small firms which, as Mr Friedrich also pointed out, are an important source of employment. 70% to 95% of employment in the private sector in the Member States is in SMUs. In some Member States the business sector is composed almost entirely of small firms. The economic policy of the Community is directed towards realization of an internal market without frontier controls in 1992. We have to ask ourselves what consequences this has for SMUs. For the SMUs this means that they will be exposed to increasing competition in their home markets, namely, from lar ger enterprises which operate on an international scale. The increase in scale which is made possible by the internal market does not automatically militate in their favour. The SMUs are not only very important in social terms \u2014 by social I mean employment \u2014 but they also play a crucial part in regional problems. In most of the less-developed regions of the Community the only ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/221 Metten form of employment in the commercial sector is the SMUs. Finally the SMUs play a crucial economic role, not only as local suppliers of goods and services, but increasingly as suppliers to large undertakings. These large undertakings are following the Japanese exam ple, and contracting out component production. The phenomenon of co-makership, whereby the supplier plays a more active and more equal role, is spreading rapidly in Europe. Owing to the threat which realization of the internal market will probably pose for the SMUs, and because of the social, regional and economic importance of them, special incentives for SMUs are justifiable. These involve relieving the administrative burden and the creation of fiscal incentives for small firms. My group supports this aspect of the Nielsen report, but subject to three conditions, all of which are part of the Nielsen report. Firstly, in giving preferential treatment to the SMUs it is extremely important to have a clear definition of what does or does not constitute a SMU. May I also mention here that so far the Commission has been rather remiss in not providing us with a precise defini tion. Things are really chaotic in this area. The stan dards in the Member States vary from a maximum of 50 employees to a maximum of 500, to name but one example, while the Community itself also applies var ious standards and definitions. A proper legal formula is also needed, to prevent tax evasion on the part of larger undertakings. A second condition is that the means of providing tax incentives for the SMUs must be found within the existing arrangements for the commercial sector. In concrete terms this means a displacement of fiscal resources to the benefit of SMUs. This is justified by the disproportionate profit which large undertakings already derive from the tax regulations. The last condition is that care must be taken to ensure that the improvement in the competitive position which is the objective of the incentives also helps to improve working conditions for employees. SMUs are not only characterized by more personal working con ditions and flexible working, they also involve lower wages and working conditions which are not as good as those offered by the civil service and the larger undertakings. Mr President, these are the conditions on which my group will vote for the Nielsen report. OPPENHEIM (ED). \u2014 (DA) MrPresident, Com missioner Matutes, colleagues, those of us who have taken an interest in and been preoccupied by this sub ject for a number of years have reason to be well satis fied today. All things considered, we have good reason for satisfaction with the development which has occurred over the past 8-9 months. We received the Commission's outline for a programme of action last summer. The Council of Ministers gave a positive reaction in October 1986, and today I am convinced that the European Parliament will adopt Mrs Nielsen's report on small businesses by a large majority. A great deal happened up to 1983, which was the year of the small and medium-sized undertaking. Since then, nothing much has happened, but now we have taken a serious grip on the problems again. Now we must be vigilant and do everything to ensure that the initiatives on which the three institutions are now more or less agreed are followed up in practice. The task force, for which the Commission has taken the initiative and which is now being set to work in the individual Member States, will shortly be revealing some of the wishes and needs expressed by small busi nesses in the individual Member States. I call on the Commission, when a certain amount of time has elapsed, to analyse the results received and to investi gate whether there might perhaps be other areas which need closer examination. Indeed small firms do not face the same problems in all countries. The problems vary, and I do not think it would be right to establish an excessively rigid common denominator. There is a need for flexibility, for dispensations to be given and exceptions made, so that all small businesses can be accommodated in the scheme, no matter where they might be in the Community. I would like to make one small point, although I take a positive view, and my group of course supports Mrs Nielsen's report. I have had an opportunity to look more closely at the loan and support facilities which the Community is seeking to publicize in the individual Member States. I fear that the various mea sures are not aimed at the very small businesses. I do not think it is practical to formulate a narrow defini tion such as that called for by the last speaker. I would urge that consideration also be given to the really small firms, which do not fall within the present cri teria for loan or support facilities. Here too there is a need for flexibility. We must do further work on these matters, and I will conclude by congratulating Mrs Nielsen. We support the report, and we hope that all who take part in this debate will continue to be involved in following up the various initiatives. BONACCINI (COM). \u2014 (IT) When dealing with the subject of small and medium-sized enterprises one runs the risk of tackling the question of enterprises in general, thereby diluting the special nature of the sub ject that we have to deal with. It is to the credit of Commissioner Matutes \u2014 thanks to the precision of his programme \u2014 that we have to some extent been spared this risk, regarding a subject that, on the other hand, we are not dealing with for the first time, and with regard do which, in the past, our Parliament has played quite a positive part both at a European level and in stimulating the initiative of the different coun tries. What seems to me to be the essential factor is ",
        "No 2\u00ad352/222 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Bonaccini that it is not enough to say that small and medium\u00ad sized enterprises guarantee more employment; we must ask ourselves why this happens. Small and medium\u00adsized enterprises are able to enrich the market with innovative products, either by updating a product that already exists or by promoting new products and, hence, automatically broadening the scope for employment. This is their characteristic feature. I share, therefore, the opinion of those who maintain that small and medium\u00adsized enterprises do not need subsidies \u2014 even though in some cases I should not scorn this solution \u2014 but they need above all to live in a general climate that completely accepts their signific\u00ad ance, thus making the part they play obvious to public opinion. Now, from this point of view, I do not share the views of those who believe that craft industries and small and medium\u00adsized enterprises can be mixed with impunity, because developments in recent years have seen the appearance on the market of new dimensions, autonomous working even, carried out probably by a single person who is however able to pursue that spe\u00ad cific line that I have just illustrated. That is why, sup\u00ad porting this resolution, we should also commit our\u00ad selves to going deeper into this aspect, which is highly significant for the future economic life of our Com\u00ad munity and our countries in general. I should like to emphasize one aspect in particular: what is necessary above all is that small and medium\u00ad sized enterprises, that have to compete with bigger concerns with far greater resources, should automati\u00ad cally be helped with information, world contacts, the transfer of technology and arrangements for mutual co\u00adoperation, which are moreover emphasized by the SPRINT programme that we talked about no more than a month ago in this Assembly. There is one point on which the Community has already taken a decision, and that our Parliament has examined \u2014 the question of loans. I can only regret that on that occasion someone showed more reserva\u00ad tion and 'tightfistedness' than was necessary in the dis\u00ad tribution of funds to small and medium\u00adsized enter\u00ad prises for the innovation programme that the Com\u00ad munity proposes. It was not a good political decision, it was a short\u00adsighted political decision on the part of whoever made it and one which, I hope, can be reviewed in the future. On behalf of my political party I have tabled just one amendment, which deals with a social question. And this is not because we are not aware, Mr Friedrich, of the need to lighten the tax burden on small and medium\u00adsized enterprises \u2014 a need that, indeed, we also point out in the amendment \u2014 but because it does not seem to us that the way to tackle this problem can possibly be by restricting employees' rights \u2014\u25a0 rights to which employees in smaller concerns are just as much entitled as those who work in larger undertakings. And I hope that the honourable rapporteur, whose programme we support, will recommend, with this in mind, a vote in favour of the amendments that propose this. To the Commission, after expressing my thanks for its commitment along these lines, I would make the fol\u00ad lowing recommendation: you have on the stocks this new initiative of the European cash offices, which may arouse a certain interest: it is a small initiative, which may however develop into something bigger. Now, in allocating the European cash offices I would ask you to keep two needs in mind: first, that the relative weighting between the different countries should be measured in relation to the small enterprises that they have, and not those that they do not have. And secondly, that they should be assigned to institutions that, by virtue of their character and their objective\u00ad ness, are beyond reproach, which is something our Community would not deserve. AMARAL (LDR). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, my Group, in addition to supporting the report produced by Mrs Nielsen, which gives an excellent account of the matters uppermost in the minds of the vast majority of our Members, is particularly pleased that the report seems likely to be adopted with a large majority. Small\u00ad and medium\u00adsized undertakings nowadays constitute a fundamental part of the economic and social fabric of Europe. I would add that small\u00ad and medium\u00adsized undertakings are a strategic instrument within the economy of the Member States for the sake amongst other things of economic and social develop\u00ad ment, a great deal of technological progress, the social balance between all partners constituting our society and the fight against the scourge of massive unem\u00ad ployment. It is therefore time, I feel, for the Com\u00ad munity to assume its responsibilities fully in this area. The Community managed over the past decades, in spite of some side\u00adtracking in recent years, to build an agricultural community based to a considerable extent on the existence in that sector of small\u00adsized undertak\u00ad ings above all. Clearly the intention is not to follow the same criteria as for agricultural development, which remains, in spite of the legitimate criticisms now levelled at the common agricultural policy, an extraor\u00ad dinary example of what a common European policy is capable of. It is time to assume our responsibilities fully and to create a basic framework for the preserva\u00ad tion and of course the quantitative and qualitative development of small\u00ad and medium\u00adsized undertak\u00ad ings. We need to adopt a coherent series of policies for the creation, as rapidly as possible, of what I would term a common European policy for small\u00ad and medium\u00ad sized undertakings. We consider that one essential fea\u00ad ture likely to achieve this in the short term is the fact that we now have a Commissioner dealing solely or mainly with the problems facing small\u00ad and medium\u00ad sized undertakings. ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/223 MARQUES MENDES (RDE). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, we do not need to expatiate ad nauseam on the funda mental importance of small- and medium-sized under takings, above all in creating jobs, which they admit tedly do, and as basic channels for technological inno vation. It is sufficient to say that in some countries such as Portugal small- and medium-sized undertak ings make up more than 90% of the total. The Nielsen report in fact includes essential aspects of a general policy for small- and medium-sized undertakings. We shall support it. It is a pity that it has to some extent come rather late in the day, since the programme for small- and medium-sized undertakings has already been adopted; NIC 4, a new Community instrument financing the policy on small- and medium-sized undertakings, has also been approved, thus putting our report, which has some fine qualities, rather behind the times. I should nevertheless like to mention two aspects I regard as essential: first, as the report says, it is essen tial to free small- and medium-sized undertakings from the various constraints of bureaucracy and administration. The Community must take courageous and determined action in this field; my second point, also referred to in the report, concerns the taxation of small- and medium-sized undertakings. The taxation of SMUs is in some cases very unfair and moreover unjustifiable and should be revised as soon as possible as part of the necessary harmonization of taxation, which is one of the essential features in the creation of the internal market. For all these reasons my group will be voting in favour of Mrs Nielsen's report. IN THE CHAIR: MR SEEFELD Vice-President VAN DIJK (ARC). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, Mrs Niel sen's report does not have much more up its sleeve than what is put forward year after year as a way of rescuing the business sector from the present unfor tunate situation. It is a fact that these classic solutions work well for large undertakings; in recent years they have been in a very good position to benefit from all kinds of subsi dies which have been devised in various quarters. It is the SMUs which have not been able to profit by them, and that is why they are in real difficulty. In order to adjust to this we now have to provide for the SMUs what the large undertakings have snatched from under their noses in recent years. In several respects the SMUs have an important function to perform. With out doubt one of the most important is that in general it can be said that the SMUs provide more employ ment in relation to the capital invested than the large undertakings do. And in itself the report's conclusion that the SMUs are at a disadvatage because of high wage costs is correct. But social security is also included in the wage costs. As long as we continue to defray this, as we have done so far, the SMUs will continue to be at a disadvantage relative to large undertakings. Whatever you may think of subsidies, I cannot imagine that our objective is to subsidize the business sector for ever. The report is a gesture towards trade and industry, without conditions. All hail to free-market mechan isms and an unrestricted flow of money for trade and industry in the name of easing burdens, but without calling for guarantees that it will be coupled with social measures. BUENO VICENTE (S). \u2014 (ES) MrPresident, the Spanish Socialists finds Mrs Nielsen's report very timely since it draws attention again to SMUs \u2014 a sector which in many Community countries provides the most jobs and generates a high proportion of the gross national product. I must, however, say that the Nielsen report does not further the cause of new development or reorganization in this important entre preneurial sector. This report is not going to change the present legal organization, and the actual distribu tion of Community funds for SMUs will not be any further advanced. Ladies and gentlemen, the Europe of the Twelve is not the same thing as the Europe of the Ten. The Com munity now covers a broader spectrum and we need to readjust not only the mechanisms for inter-regional solidarity but also the principles governing the distri bution policies for the scant joint funds. An SMU in the Netherlands is not the same thing as one in Portu gal for example; the size of the undertaking, the laws applicable, the economic climate, social dynamism, the very concept of enterprise are all quite different. We urgently need a Community definition of SMUs, geared of course to the Europe of the Twelve, to ena ble us to adopt policies on a basis of solidarity in accordance with the spirit of economic and social cohesion envisaged in the Single Act. That is why, Mrs Nielsen, I am tabling Amendment No 13 since there is a good deal of ambiguity in the wording of your report as regards the definition of SMUs. We also think a separate definition is required of what constitutes a craft undertaking. It is not sufficient merely to consider these as industrial, commercial or service SMUs. A craft undertaking has its own clearly distinct personality and economic and social features. My Amendment No 14 requires a different definition for this type of undertaking and No 17 requests a special sub-group for them in the independent co-ordinating group, or 'task force' as it says in the English version. In addition to these basic principles which affect inter-regional solidarity and make Europe more of a ",
        "No 2-352/224 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Bueno Vicente reality, we feel that the Community should also launch a further principle \u2014 that of equality of opportunity between the SMUs and large firms. We are not against a free market but we do wish for a sufficient socio economic area and certain coordinating provisions for the SMUs to enable them to avoid always being the subcontractors or poor relations of the large firms. Only then can there be a fair market distribution and ultimately and logically the creation of wealth. Finally we think it is also essential to ask the Commis sion \u2014 and what a coincidence that Mr Matutes should be here today, since this will find an echo in him \u2014 to avoid any misuse of Community funds for SMU programmes. My Amendment No 15, which I already presented in committee, asks for aid to be withheld from certain SMUs which are in fact covert units of large firms. VAN AERSSEN (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not share Mrs Van Dijk's view \u2014 I say this now \u2014 that Mrs Nielsen's report has a mea sure of historic significance, but I do believe that Mrs Nielsen as rapporteur really has produced a hand book for SMUs, the craft industries and the profes sions. For that we are very grateful, Mrs Nielsen! My group sees this report as the culmination of a con tinuing policy on the part of many of our colleagues \u2014 some of whom are no longer Members of this Par liament \u2014 who have for many years defended the interests of SMUs, craft industries and the professions. They have been given recognition by this report today. We are also very pleased that almost all the groups in the House will give it their support. We also wish to thank the Commissioner, Mr Matutes, who, as a new member of the Commission from a new country of the European Community, has taken up Parliament's ini tiative so consistently. We take this as evidence of the fact that although the European Parliament still does not have any real power \u2014 which, as you know, is what we want \u2014 we do in fact have influence. I also think it important to reflect on how the know ledge which has been set down in the handbook can be translated in psychological terms. Primari}', Mrs Niel sen \u2014 and this is my plea to you and your committee, and in this respect you may always count on my sup port and that of my group \u2014 we must be able to mon itor what is being done in practice. We must not leave it to initiatives from Parliament and the Commission, we must examine individual elements in detail. That is the creative role which Parliament has to play. Mrs Nielsen rightly pointed out that Parliament has a responsibility to the SMUs and craft industries. I assume that she includes the self-employed in that \u2014 it is not in fact mentioned in the German translation of the title, but I assume that is what she meant. I am a self-employed man and have a small firm, but I think it is something which was brought out very clearly in the explanatory memorandum and in the motion for a resolution. Mrs Nielsen rightly said that flexibility is the most important characteristic of the SMUs. We must never theless remind the authorities yet again that in very general terms the existence of the SMUs produces a division of power within the economy. It is like the political division of power and is a principle which I think is very important. The most important thing is to strengthen the capacity for innovation. The European Community is like a sleeping princess. It has to be woken, and this report can do that. The European Parliament can do that and I support the suggestion from our colleagues that a data bank be set up to provide information. In the Federal Republic most young people receive their training in SMUs, and not many people are aware of that. No one knows exactly what is possible in the realm of high technology, or what can be done, and a data bank could be very useful here. (Applause) TUCKMAN (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I recommend to the House two amendments down in my name. Amendment No 20 is one that I have tabled many times before. I note that there is a slightly better wind for it now, but it seems to be the sort of subject which requires a lot of talking before people are convinced. Its object is that the exemption limit below which undertakings do not have to register for VAT should go up to 75 000 ECUs, this being the equivalent of \u00a3 50 000. Now why? Not just because we want to be nice to particular people but for an extraordinarily simple reason. It costs at least that much to collect that sort of small sum. It is therefore far better not to have to have an apparatus collecting a large number of small amounts and inflicting form-filling on the large number of undertakings and people who would other wise be engaged,in running and building their busi ness. That is the first point I want to make to the House. The second point is also one I have often made before. It springs from American experience and it is their concept of an advocate for small business. All our experience teaches us that if an idea has the backing of a number of talented and committed people, then something will be done about it, whereas if it is merely talked about in a bureaucratic sort of way, nothing is done. We have made a very major step forward in appoint ing a minister and, in this Community, a Commis sioner for small business. But these represent auth ority. What I want to see is a kind of ombudsman, whose job it would be to speak for small business, to say to the authorities \u2014 be they well-intentioned or ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/225 Tuckman not, that does not matter much: 'Look here, this is something extra you should do or here are certain things which could be harmful'. I know that they would be duplicating a lot of the input into the task force, and we are obviously far better off with that task force than we were before, but nevertheless I still should like this extra amendment and I hope the House will vote for it tonight. ADAMOU (COM). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, in Greece small and medium-sized undertakings are the mainstay of the economy in that they account for 90% of undertakings in processing, commerce and services and employ 60% of the country's workforce. How ever, Greece's accession to the Community, and with it the imposition of Community conditions and rules, has exposed them to a harsh economic wind, and they are now in deep crisis. So far thousands of them have shut down or cut back their activities. Consequently, the prospect of the completion of the single internal market by 1992 poses a lethal threat to their existence unless decisive measures are taken in time. Mrs Nielsen's report makes positive points and propo sals for more favourable tax treatment, improved financing and access to modern technology, and it emphasizes the important role that the SMUs can play in regional development. Nevertheless, it is not without its contradictions. It is a well-known fact that when subcontracting work out to the SMUs the large undertakings impose their own methods of production and payment, and that they take the lion's share of the profits and gradually reduce the SMUs to dependency. It is also acknow ledged that SMUs can survive foreign competition only when they are provided with support in the inter nal market, allowed access to the public sector and given the benefit of increased local consumption, which implies raised purchasing power for the work ers. But this latter, which is one of the most fundamen tal things, is going from bad to worse as the policy of one-sided austerity and the anti-agriculture measures of the EEC bite harder and harder. Mrs Nielsen's proposals for reducing social charges, with the employees being called on to make them up however, and for flexible working with the damaging effects this would have on employees' incomes, cannot but undermine the report's credibility and negate all its positive proposals. Mr President, for the SMUs to survive and improve their position it is essential first and foremost for there to be control over the activities of the large undertak ings and curtailment of the privileged treatment given to them. There is nothing about this in Mrs Nielsen's report, and much less does it figure in the thinking and proposals of the Commission. Experience shows that only through resolute and coordinated struggle with other working people can small and medium-sized operators hope to save their businesses from bank ruptcy and ensure economic survival. GAUTHIER (RDE). \u2014 (FR) MrPresident, col leagues, the report which is before us today is in its own way a charter for SMUs in the Community. This is something which has to be recognized in our coun tries, that the SMUs, like the craft industries, are a key sector in the economy, and a dynamic factor, whether in relation to production, social innovation, creativity or employment. I must emphasize this last point, as it is generally recognised that they play a major part in controlling the tragic levels of unemployment and make a significant contribution towards improving the job situation. We must create conditions which are conducive to their flexibility and industrial environment and give them maximum advantage so that they can set out to conquer external markets and so play a major part in improving the balance of trade and redressing the employment situation. Especially with regard to flexi bility, where the SMUs must be freed from the various constraints to which they are subject, with regard to taxation, where we welcome the amendment to the sixth VAT directive, which seeks to improve the sys tem applicable to SMUs in respect of exemption and simplification, and with regard to competition, where it is imperative for public procurement contracts to be open to everyone and for the SMUs to be able to ten der on more equal terms. Similarly, the completion of the internal market, by increasing competition, poses a threat to many SMUs. We must therefore step up the Community financing for them \u2014 the EIB and the NCI \u2014 as well as increas ing the ERDF on account of the part which the SMUs play in regional development and in maintaining the economic structure of some declining industrial areas. Finally, we must welcome the report's proposal that there be a meeting of the Council of Ministers respon sible for the SMUs at least once a year to discuss Community policy on them. Mrs Nielsen's report is an excellent report which ought to encourage the development of the SMUs at Community level. That is why our group will support BESSE (S). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I have already had occasion to say what I am saying again now, that the larger market is too small for the large undertakings and is likely to be too big for the SMUs. Let us make sure that it is not tailor-made for undertakings from elsewhere, and let us make it possible for the Euro pean SMUs to take up the challenge of the wider mar ket. It is our responsibility, and Mrs Nielsen's report is one stage of that. Nevertheless I should like to point out some of the limitations and shortcomings of this document. ",
        "No 2-352/226 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Besse The first concerns the definition of a SMU. In fact there have once again been numerous debates in the committee on the subject of a definition. An amend ment to Article 2, which has been tabled by our group, emphasised the problem of defining the SMUs. At present the definition varies from one Member State to another. It is absolutely essential that we have an unassailable definition of the SMU, which will exclude the subsidiaries of large undertakings. In the absence of that definition and application of it the identity and selective nature of a Community policy for the SMUs would be at risk. Has the Commission decided on the circumscription of this definition of the SMUs? I think it is an essential preliminary. Second problems: the implications of increased voca tional training. The report rightly emphasises the need for expanding training for the heads of SMUs and their employees. Nevertheless the acquisition of this knowledge, the continuous effort required to keep it up-to-date, has no chance of success unless the mem bers of staff of the SMUs are closely associated with the enterprise. In the same way tax facilities should be made available to employees who wish to take over undertakings which are in difficulty. Multiplying the opportunities and facilities for transfer of enterprises will cut down their mortality rate and, therefore, unemployment. Unemployment is the third point which I shall raise. The report which we are considering does not perhaps lay sufficient emphasis on the employment potential concealed in the SMUs, provided that they have the necessary environment and resources. There is no mention of fiscal measures which could be put forward for people wishing to create or preserve a SMU. Simi larly the report does not give sufficient attention to the job creation potential of cooperatives, particularly in the service sector, which could conclude agreements with user associations, local authorities for example. Finally, the fourth point: the limits of flexibility, which several of my colleagues have mentioned. This report does in fact place great emphasis on the virtues of flex ibility. May I point out that a recent OECD report of May 1986 concluded that at best flexibility was appar ent only as one way of undertaking structural changes. In any case flexibility must not be used to benefit one socio-economic group relative to another. It must not be thought of as a facility to be offered to the entre preneur. On the other hand, flexibility is certainly a positive factor when, for example, it is decided to use machinery better for a longer period by employing two teams instead of one. GANGOITI LLAGUNO (PPE). \u2014 (ES) Mr Presi dent, I welcome the presentation to Parliament of Mrs Nielsen's report, which is a very thorough one, since we regard small- and medium-sized undertak ings as a most important factor in combating unem ployment, especially in times of crisis. We must also create a framework for small- and medium-sized undertakings, since that to some extent gives a boost to the self-respect of the entrepreneur and creates the desire to generate jobs, which is ultimately beneficial to the whole of society. I should like to mention briefly three points in Mrs Nielsen's report. As regards flexibility, I think it is essential to provide significant tax incentives for the creation of new businesses and, on the other hand, to reduce company costs at least to the levels of the United States and Japan. On the subject of the industrial area, I completely agree that the setting up of the internal market by 1992 is a vital task with a view to achieving for small- and medium-sized undertakings an appropriate frame work in which all administrative obstacles, which now to a great extent hamper their development, must be eliminated. We must also insist that small- and medium-sized undertakings should have access to all aspects of new developments, including participation in new technological programmes and the Community framework programme for scientific and technological research and so on. As regards regional development, the small- and medium-sized undertakings will be called upon to play a very important r\u00f4le in the development and promo tion of both under-developed regions and industrial areas under reconversion. As we all know, the indus trial areas under reconversion are in a state of crisis owing to the nature of their production, but it has of course been proved that qualified manpower does exist and that there is a series of businesses which were cap able of creating wealth and which with a minimum amount of assistance would again be capable of doing so. Finally, it is my opinion that the model of small- and medium-sized undertakings could be used within the framework of cross-frontier cooperation. I should just like to congratulate Mr Commissioner Matutes on the great task he is performing in the sphere of small- and medium-sized undertakings in creating the appro priate conditions. He may be sure of Parliament's cooperation as long as he continues along these lines. KILBY (ED). \u2014 Mr President, the huge labour-inten sive factories which characterized our post-war indus trial environment in Europe, giving rise to never-end ing labour relations disputes, are rapidly becoming landmarks of the past. High-unit sales volumes made possible by the creation of our huge, single European market permitted the introduction of a high degree of mechanization, including robotics, which has improved living standards but eliminated millions of semi-skilled jobs, including those tasks which are generally agreed to have been demeaning, highly unpleasant to perform and dangerous to health. In our ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/227 Kilby new scenario, millions of new jobs are being created in the relatively clean environment of high-tech indus tries and the services sector, with an ever increasing percentage of jobs being generated by small and medium-sized enterprises. This changing industrial and commercial scene has created the need for a new political and business cli mate to help such enterprises expand and prosper. Mrs Nielsen has identified the new requirements in her extensive report. It rightly makes the point that those enterprising citizens of ours who are prepared to take risks in bringing their new products or services to the marketplace should be encouraged in their efforts and rewarded generously when they make a success of their ventures. They are the new job creators. The report identifies ihe factors which currently frustrate the small business community, including excessive bur eaucratic interference at both national and local level. The Nielsen report may not meet the specific needs of each and every small business in Europe, but I am quite sure that it will be generally welcomed by the business community at large as a significant step for ward in meeting the new needs of a changed market place. PAPOUTSIS (S). \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the report we are debating does, I believe, get to grips with many of the more important problems of small and medium-sized undertakings and craft industries in the Community. The sections on taxation, funding and industrial cooperation offer positive proposals which, if implemented, will do a great deal to help small and medium-sized undertakings and craft industries, espe cially in countries like Greece where they are the backbone of the national economy. In our opinion, Mr President, the main thrust of the Community's policy on the SMUs should be to devise a tax system which will be geared to the development of small undertakings and help them to establish a cap ital base. With encouragement for the reinvestment of profits to promote self-financing. With measures to facilitate payments of arrears or the rescheduling of tax liabilities for SMUs in difficulties and with pros pects of restarting business and becoming viable. With the implementation of ideal-form social innovations, new forms of organization and new working systems and conditions, with a view to establishing the opti mum framework for the SMUs and craft industries of the Community. All the same I do have a couple of comments to make about some basic points in the policy orientation of Mrs Nielson's report, specifically regarding the estab lishment of cooperative forms of SMU development and the role of SMUs in the regional development and economic and social cohesion of the Community. My first criticism is that insufficient emphasis is placed on the need for cooperative organization of SMUs as a means of equipping them to withstand the withering competition from large transnational and monopoly undertakings. And of course there is always the danger of their being sacrificed to the insatiable appetites of monopoly and transnational undertaking capital. Here, therefore, each member country will have to set up its own appropriate framework and establish the necessary incentives. The second criticism is that insufficient emphasis is put on the role of SMUs in the regional development of the Member States and of the Community more generally. I say this because we have to remain mindful of the fact that revitalization and broad-based rege neration of the economic and social fabric of the Community's regions is the cornerstone for the econo mic and social cohesion of the whole Community. MATUTES, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in rising to reply to the suggestions made, I have great pleasure in thanking honourable Members for the support which the Commission has always received from Parliament as regards its policy for small- and medium-sized undertakings. I realize that this is the customary pro cedure, but I can assure you that in this case at least it is no more than the truth. And I am therefore delighted to be able to confirm it in person. First I should like to say to Mrs Nielsen, who has drawn up this report on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, that we all have reason to be delighted with the quality of this report and the proposals it contains. Secondly, I should like to mention the support which the Commis sion has always received from the inter-parliamentary group on small- and medium-sized undertakings. As Mrs Nielsen, Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou and Mr Bon accini, amongst others, have already said, it is not the first time the European Parliament has, by adopting a resolution, given a decisive thrust to the creation of a European policy in favour of small- and medium-sized undertakings. As long ago as 1983 this Parliament declared and brought to a close the European Year of the Small- and Medium-sized Undertaking, thus bringing to the notice of European politicians, and not of them alone but of European public opinion as a whole, the urgency and need for these new policies in favour of small- and medium-sized undertakings. It was, moreover, the European Parliament which in 1984 developed the broad outlines of the policy we are considering today. However, this is certainly the first time a Commissioner with direct responsibility for Community policy for small- and medium-sized undertakings has appeared before a plenary sitting of this Parliament to discuss a report on an action pro gramme the implementation of which reflects the will of this Parliament, whose unanimous support is still essential to the success of the task upon which the Commission and you yourselves have embarked in drawing up the programme in favour of small- and medium-sized undertakings. ",
        "No 2-352/228 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 Matutes This was evident last year in the debate on the 1987 budget, and I am sure that the debate for the 1988 budget will also highlight clearly defined priorities on which the Commission has wished to base its prelimi nary draft. The Commission considers that these priorities are consistent in broad outline with those in the Nielsen report. In fact as regards both the environ ment for undertakings and other absolutely essential factors \u2014 such as improved access to information, increasing the opportunities for co-operation between small- and medium-sized undertakings across intra- Community frontiers and outside the Community, or improving financing \u2014 the report presents a number of practical suggestions which the Commission will certainly take into account since they are in line with our own ideas and I might add with our present actions. As you know, NIC 4 has already been approved as a financial instrument. Tomorrow, after the end of the parliamentary part-session, I am to wind up a Con gress in Brussels on seed capital and partners in man agement. The communication to the Council of Minis ters and the Parliament on financial engineering and small- and medium-sized undertakings is being put forward; I do not have time to go into detail on that now, but you will no doubt be informed about it in due course. Also next Wednesday I shall be presenting to the Commission the first detailed information on the activities of the task force for small- and medium- sized undertakings during its first months of opera tion. their greatest support in this Parliament, since it is here that there is the greatest awareness of social and employment problems. Clearly, if the number one priority is now job creation and if, as has been amply demonstrated, it is the small- and medium-sized undertakings that are creating most of those jobs \u2014 as Mr Metten so rightly pointed out \u2014 the policy in sup port of those small- and medium-sized undertakings should of course in all logic be one of the priorities of this Parliament. For all the reasons I have just men tioned, Mrs Nielsen's report and the vote of this House are, in my opinion, an absolutely essential sti mulus which is crucial for the Commission to take its policy in favour of small- and medium-sized undertak ings still further. And for this stimulus, this support and this priority, which Parliament has never failed to confirm, I extend my thanks once more. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting time. 6. Hijacking of lorries PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. A 2-25/87) by Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso, on behalf of the Committee on Transport, on the hijacking and des truction of lorries. I should also like to say that it is clear that all the amendments proposed to the report seem to me in general to be absolutely constructive with a view to improving the effectiveness of the programme in favour of these undertakings. This applies also to those amendments which might seem more difficult to clas sify, such as certain observations relating to flexibility, but I think they have been made with the same social awareness which I am sure we all share, although there may sometimes be different nuances as to the practical steps which should be taken. Moreover, the observations made on financial aspects such as Venture Consort, secondary markets, subcon tracting and partners in management, exchanges of successful experiments, data banks or euroguichets are, I can assure you, being given full consideration and are at present the subject of actions by my task force staff. Here I should like to draw attention to Amend ment No 8 tabled by the rapporteur and No 18 by Mr Friedrich, which both acknowledge the close colla boration between this institution, the Parliament and the relevant departments of the Commission which come under me. I can assure you that, as far as we are concerned, that will continue to be the case in the future. I myself am fully aware that my actions in favour of small- and medium-sized undertakings will receive CABEZ\u00d3N ALONSO (S), rapporteur. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, attacks on lorries have produced and are producing serious repercus sions in some Community countries. On previous occasions and basically through questions the Euro pean Parliament has had news of such happenings, which are frequently reported by the media and which have been debated in some national parliaments. We consider the problem a serious one. The first ques tion which occurs to a lorry driver who has been the victim of an attack in any Community country is: how is it possible \u2014 if we are building a European Com munity which aspires to be a single market open for the free movement of persons and goods \u2014 for there to be different levels of legal protection within that Community in countries other than the country of ori gin? Why do we not have within our Community the same protection for the Greek lorry attacked in Italy, the British lorry looted in France or the French lorry destroyed in Spain? And why is there, since this is in our view a Community problem par excellence, a con spiratorial silence by the Commission on so serious a matter? In 1984 and 1985 more than 90 legal actions were set tled by the Spanish authorities by the payment of com pensation to French firms whose lorries had been attacked in Spain. More than 550 lorries were attacked ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/229 Cabez\u00f3n Alonso in Italy in 1984 \u2014 179 of them with foreign registra tion. More than 100 Spanish lorries carrying mostly agricultural produce were destroyed in France in the years 1982, 1983 and 1984. Over the past few weeks Spanish lorries taking straw berries to other Community countries have been attacked in France and their cargoes destroyed. The problem of hijacking, the destruction of lorries and their cargoes is unfortunately a fact of life today. No one will doubt that such occurrences are a serious obstacle to the free movement of goods and persons and thus jeopardize the creation of a single internal market and hamper the necessary economic and social cohesion. And no one will doubt that there is a Com munity dimension to these events which affect trans port policy, trade policy and competition policy: This serious situation gives rise to numerous problems: compensation for the victims \u2014 owner-drivers or employed drivers \u2014 compensation for the damage caused to the vehicles and their cargoes, the loss to the owners of the lorries which have suffered attacks, the refusal of insurers to issue contracts covering the loot ing and destruction of lorries and their cargoes. There should be a control on the drafting of insurance con tracts in order to avoid restriction or penalty clauses in these matters. A further consequence is the deteriora tion in relations between the Member States as a result of these attacks, and a further problem is the human plight of the lorry drivers concerned, finding them selves in a foreign country with no knowledge of the laws and facing difficulties with the language. It is not acceptable, ladies and gentlemen, that the free movement of agricultural products or any other type of goods or products should be subject to or affected by the theft or destruction of lorries or their cargoes, sometimes with the tolerance and complicity of the national authorities. We cannot remain inactive in the face of the threat to lorry drivers. Governments must take steps to prevent such attacks. The Council must gear its policy to the strengthening and development of guarantees for the free movement of lorries between Community Mem ber States. Until there are Community rules in all Member States it will be necessary to provide national legislation protecting vehicles in the territory of each country. These are not simply problems affecting each government \u2014 as was stated in this Parliament, I have heard. In the report we therefore ask the Commission to draw up a Community regulation basically specify ing at least: first, cover for the possible risks; secondly, those entitled to the right to compensation; thirdly, compensation for victims \u2014 whether owner-drivers or employees; compensation for the owner of the cargo destroyed or lost; compensation for damage to the vehicle; the scales to be applied for calculating the loss of income due to loss of use and, finally, the proce dure for making claims so that everyone concerned should know how to go about making such a claim. The Commission should rebuke those Member States who do not behave in a pro-Community manner, that is, those States which do not take steps within their power to end this situation, which has serious conse quences for the safety of lorry drivers on the roads and for the free movement of persons, vehicles and goods. The inadequate attention given to these criminal acts is affecting the necessary harmonization and the balance of free competition. The theft, hijacking and destruc tion of lorries is, as I said at the beginning of my speech, a real and serious obstacle to the harmonious creation of an internal market. The report I am presenting and recommending today was approved almost unanimously by the Committee on Transport of this Parliament. I hope it will receive the same support in this House and I trust also that the Commission and the Council will be receptive to its content and to the recommendations it makes and fin ally will understand what an obstacle these attacks on lorries in Community countries present to the creation of a single harmonious market. CLINTON DAVIS, Member of the Commission. \u2014 Mr President, I propose to cut down quite substan tially the amount of time I would have taken by inter vening at this stage, because I hope there will be time before I have to leave this evening \u2014 I cannot be here tomorrow morning \u2014 to hear the chairman of the Committee on Transport, Mr Anastassopoulos. The Commission shares the concerns which have been expressed by Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso in his report and in his speech \u2014 if I may so, a very compelling speech \u2014 about the hijacking and destruction of lorries engaged in international transport. It is a disturbing phenome non which has been tolerated for far too long. I need hardly remind the House that any matter which is linked to the maintenance of public order is within the exclusive competence and domain of the Member States. So it is essential that Member States should ful fil the responsibilities to which he referred in that speech. Of course it is necessary in certain instances \u2014 and they should take note of this \u2014 that there should be greater cooperation both to prevent and to punish acts of vandalism on our roads. In paragraph 8 of the motion for a resolution Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso invites the Council to take the necessary measures to guarantee the free circulation of lorries between Member States. I would remind the House that the Commission, far from being guilty of the complicity with which he has charged it, has already sent to the Council a proposal for a regulation aiming to eliminate all quantitative restrictions in the international road transport sector by 1992 at the latest. That goes to the heart of the problem. Of course, these will be replaced by qualitative criteria governing entry into intra-Community road haulage, and these ",
        "No 2-352/230 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Clinton Davis criteria will be designed to promote safety, viability, proper conduct, proper regard for the law and social regulations. That is the way in which we should pro ceed. Whether the Council of Ministers elects to go down that route remains to be seen. We need to do that by 1992 at the latest. Of course it is crucial that de jure freedom of move ment is also de facto freedom of movement. Member States have a clear responsibility to guarantee ade quate security conditions. So as we progress towards our target of free circulation, the Commission will cer tainly continue to monitor the frequency and the nature of whatever attacks on lorries take place and to bring such information to the attention of the relevant authorities. I now turn to the proposals on VAT contained in par agraph 13 of the motion for a resolution. As honoura ble Members are aware, the current legal provisions allow Member States to decide in each individual case whether an importer is still liable for VAT in the case of theft of the contents of a lorry. In general, Member States prefer to continue with this system of allowing each situation to be considered on its merits. The objective, of course, is to reduce the possibility of fis cal fraud. Although sensitive to the points made in the report, for the time being the Commission broadly shares the view of the Member States, because there would effectively be no control if we were to abandon that position. I now turn to paragraph 11 of the motion for a resolu tion, where it is requested that the Commission should prepare a Community regulation on the compensatory aspects of the problem. Once again I am sympathetic to the rapporteur's intentions. But I do not think it politically appropriate for the Commission to make proposals along the lines that he suggests. For one thing, the political objective has to remain the elimina tion of these attacks. This, as I have implied, is an issue of policing and, as such, clearly falls within the res ponsibility of Member States. For another, it would be somewhat anomalous for the Commission to propose a compensation scheme of Europe-wide applicability only in the case of attacks such as those referred to in the report. Obviously, there are other situations where a similar form of compensation scheme could be pro posed. So I hope honourable Members will agree that this has to be a matter which remains the political responsibil ity of our individual Member States. I understand that Spain, for example, has a national compensation scheme for street attacks on lorries taking place in the circumstances described in the report. The Commission could not propose a compensation scheme for the Community with any hope of political success \u2014 that is a political fact of life! For the reasons I am outlining, therefore, I cannot concede that it would be the appropriate way the proceed. On a more positive note, I draw the House's attention to paragraph 18 of the motion for a resolution where the Commission is invited to supply detailed statistics to Parliament \u2014 a point made in Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso's speech \u2014 about the hijacking and destruc tion of lorries. I can tell the House that my services have been working on the collection and analysis of this kind of data. When their report is completed, I will, of course, have it forwarded to Parliament. This exercise will allow both Commission and Parlia ment to quantify the exact nature of the problem right across the Community and, as such, it will indicate to us whether and in what specific areas future legislative action will be required at Community level. The Commission is well aware that attacks on lorries have caused a great deal of disquiet, and indeed dis tress, in the Community to a large number of people. The free movement of people and goods goes to the very heart of the raison d'\u00eatre of the Community and must be protected. On that basis, I very much welcome this important debate and I hope that my responses to the specific points indicate that we share Parliament's concern about these disturbing and intolerable actions and, moreover, that the charge of complicity against us is not one which can be realistically sustained. ANASTASSOPOULOS (PPE), Chairman of the Committee on Transport. \u2014 (GR) I am grateful to Mr Clinton Davis for curtailing his speech so that I too can speak this evening. The hijacking and destruction of international trans port lorries in the Community and the theft of their loads is not a new phenomenon. There are no com plete statistics as yet, of course, but the indications are that this form of crime has increased markedly in cer tain Community countries such as Italy, and there is very good cause for anxiety. At a time when we are struggling to overcome the obstacles to the establishment of a free market in transport, something which is an inextricable part of the completion of the large internal market by 1992, the hijacking, robbery and destruction of lorries and attacks on them are very definitely hitting the free movement of persons and goods. Added to this, they are creating problems for transport operators, damag ing trade and, in certain instances, adversely affecting bilateral relations. In some instances the hijackings appear to be the organized work of criminal gangs whose activities are reminiscent of certain well-known films. Last January, 80 kilometres from Bari in Italy, a criminal in a stolen police car and wearing the uniform of the economic police shepherded 6 Greek tanker lorries carrying olive oil from Crete into a parking area where about 15 of his accomplices were waiting to bind and gag the Greek drivers and drive off with their lorries. ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/231 Anastassopoulos In other cases the thefts have, of course, been less spectacular, but the result has been the same. To the hijackings and robberies have to be added attacks on drivers as a form of protest against the carriage of goods putatively inimical to the interests of competing countries or simply because the drivers belong to countries whose governments are taking a line on ter rorism which the attackers do not like. The problem for us, though, is not the reasons, the pretexts or the excuses that are advanced, even when these come dressed up in smart political clothing. We do not accept that even this can justify violations of the law. We have a duty to condemn all of these viola tions without exception, to come down hard on the perpetrators, whether individuals or groups, and to be critical of the governments of those countries where there seems to be indifference to the phenomenon. The problems will not be solved by denunciations and calls for greater vigilance, however. What can we actually do when public order and the dispensing of justice are not in the hands of the Com munity? But does one need to have direct competence over these things to call on the governments of the Twelve finally to institute preventive measures and to call for cooperation between their police in combating the situation? Does one need to have competence to ask for the law to be applied with greater rigour? The idea of safe routes is certainly useful, but not easy to implement. More practical is the proposal for organized transport centres which could ensure safe parking. And, of course, not just the Member States, as the Commissioner has said, but in our view the Community as well must do something at least to achieve a harmonization of legislation so as to ensure proper insurance cover and fair recompense for the victims of these robberies and attacks. Exemption from VAT when the goods imported into a country are stolen or destroyed would, of course, seem to be dictated by commonsense. However, there are countries, such as our friend Italy, where the cus toms authorities are refusing to comply with this com monsense. Article 41 of the international TIR conven tion of 1975 provides exactly for this contingency, subject to the customs authorities being satisfied that the goods have in fact been destroyed or lost as a con sequence of some incident or force majeure. The com plaint is that the Italian customs authorities systemati cally refuse to accept that the loss of goods has been proved in a way satisfactory to them. And with inter pretations like this \u2014 I refrain from putting it any stronger \u2014 the victims lose their right to exemption from taxes, duties and tariffs and to compensation as well. The report by Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso touches on all these matters in a totally satisfactory way, and my group will support it completely in the hope that this initiative by the Committee on Transport will lead on quickly to measures for rectifying this unacceptable Not only should lorry drivers be able to circulate freely on the roads of the Community but they should be able to do so with security as well. Is there anything unreasonable about this demand? (Applause) IN THE CHAIR: MR DANKERT PRESIDENT. row. Vice-President The debate will be resumed tomor- We shall now vote on the motions for resolutions on which the debate is closed. WIJSENBEEK (LDR). \u2014 (NL) On a point of order, Mr President. You are breaking off this debate half way down the list of speakers. I think it would be pref erable if we could finish this debate with the Commis sioner present as there are only a few more speakers down. If that is not possible, the least the President can do, instead of saying that the debate will continue tomor row evening, is to tell us how, when and whether it can take place with the Commissioner present. PRESIDENT. \u2014 I am very sorry about that, but it is the custom in Parliament that votes are taken at fixed times. This is one of those fixed times. We are now going to vote, and tomorrow the debate will be resumed. There may be a better way of doing it, but that is how it is. 7. VOTES Report (Doc. A 2-22/87) by Mrs Simone Martin, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the draft resolu tion on the continuation and implementation of a European Community policy and action programme on the environment (1987-1992) submitted by the Com mission of the European Communities to the Council (Com (86) 485 final \u2014 Doc.

If that is how we want to use our environmental policy, ladies and gentlemen, then it is not even worth the paper it is written on!

(Applause from the left) (Parliament adopted the resolution) ARNDT (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, on a point of order, I wonder what it means when a group accepts all the paragraphs of a report, does not table any amendments and then rejects the report. I do not con sider that admissible under our Rules of Procedure because it misleads the House. (Applause from the left) PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Arndt, my view is that what has happened is perfectly permissible under the terms of the Rules of Procedure. However, perhaps it should be discussed by the group chairmen. Interim report (Doc. A 2-18/87) by Mrs Weber, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on supplementary measures in respect of environmental impact studies Explanation of vote KUIJPERS (ARC), in writing. \u2014 (NL) When Direc tive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the environ mental effects of certain public and private projects on the environment was issued on 27 June 1985, it was clear that this represented a piece of pioneering work in the sphere of protection of the environment and the provision of information for those concerned. The way it is being applied, as in the Netherlands at pres ent, shows that this directive can make a contribution to the preservation of our natural environment. Very shortly after the issuing of that directive it became clear how fragile the whole of our natural environment is. A nuclear catastrophe thousands of kilometres away from us had serious consequences right away; pollution of subsoil and surface water is in many cases (almost) irreversible and air pollution ser iously threatens our future. For these reasons we think that a further tightening up of the directive on the assessment of environmental effects can only benefit our environment. And by this I do not mean simply on our own environment but also on that for generations yet to come, because the irrev ersible pollution will perhaps affect them even worse than us. In this Environment Year concern for our natural environment needs to be manifested not only by words but by deeds. The TGV plans pending at the moment, which basically affect many districts in Europe, provide a first immediate example. That is the reason for the amendment tabled by our Group to make European aid for projects absolutely dependent on an exact assessment of the environmental effects. Those are the reasons for which we support the pro posed motion for a resolution. (Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution) Report (Doc. A 2-30/87) by Mr Van der Lek, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on public access to environmental pollution information Explanations of vote VAN DER LEK (ARC), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I did not expect to have to give this explanation of vote. In Environment Year Parliament has seen fit to remove the heart and all meaning from a proposal requesting the introduction of a certain degree of openness of government in the Community, such as already exists in a number of Member States, naturally with protection for things which must remain secret. Such an arrangement exists already in the Netherlands, France, Denmark and Luxembourg and has been upheld for twenty years in the United States in the so-called Freedom of Information Act. That is something absolutely self-evident. If Parliament takes another look at what it has now accepted, it is com plete gibberish. Certain cries about openness, certain things which actually go a long way, where probably the EPP Group took the wrong view, or perhaps other Groups \u2014 I do not know. But what is left no longer has any connection with a modest attempt of this Par liament to deal seriously in Environment Year with information for the citizen and his right of access to information on the environment. I can only advise my Group to vote against this nonsense. (Applause from the left) WEBER (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, I consider the result a real scandal! The Euro pean People's Party, which always tries to sound so concerned about the environment in its Sunday speeches, has shown in two votes today what it really thinks of preventive environmental policy. It is opposed to the environmental compatibility tests which we called for in 1982 being implemented prop- ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/233 Weber erly. It is opposed to the Member States being oliged to observe them really strictly. It has just opposed a sentence which I would like to read out to you once more: 'whereas every citizen should therefore in prin ciple have the right of access to any relevant informa tion which is available concerning the environment, and whereas secrecy is only justifiable when, within a carefully defined legal framework, it can be demon strated that openness would unfairly harm important interests'. A sentence like that is rejected in our Parliament which always behaves as if it were so pro-environment. So was the call for a directive, although that is pre cisely what was called for in the Commission's fourth action programme during the first environmental debate just now. The citizens of this Community are being refused the right of access to data on the state of the environment. That means Parliament is opposed to enabling the people really to participate democratically in our society on the basis of good and adequate infor mation on the state of the environment. What has hap pened here is a scandal! (Applause from the left) COLLINS (S). \u2014 Mr President, the only thing that surprises me about Mrs Weber's speech just now is that she should be surprised that the EPP Group and the Conservative Group should act the way they have. These groups have demonstrated, as clearly as they ever could, that they have no interest in ordinary peo ple or in the environment; they are merely poseurs for electoral purposes. (Mixed reactions) From the groups that yesterday gave us patronizing speeches by mock doctors, that gave us their policies of inequality, that gave us the excesses of poverty and public squalor, we now have the dismembering of an honourable attempt to give rights back to ordinary citizens. It has been dismembered by these people over there. We now have a wretched debt produced by wretched people for electoral purposes. We should vote against it and so should every right thinking individual in this Chamber. (Applause from the left) (Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution) If he will not retract it instantly and if you want me to insult him as well, I can . . .

Report (Doc. A 2-43/87 by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the European Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1988 COT, chairman of the Committee on Budgets. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, honourable Members, before we vote on the Pasty report, and I have agreed this with the rapporteur, I would like to make the following brief statement. The general intent behind the Committee on Budgets' activities was to help improve the efficiency of our institution, to give it a better profile, so to speak. That can only be done in close cooperation with the staff, who must be closely associated in the implementation of the proposed reform in order to be fully motivated in their work. That means keeping in contact with them throughout our budgetary procedure and, in particular, it means that Parliament's administration must constantly make sure of this participation throughout the coming financial year.

H\u00c4NSCH (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gen\u00ad tlemen, the topic today and the debate we are holding together may tempt some people to polemics. I do not want to succumb to that temptation because I believe that the European Parliament and all of us must show the utmost sense of responsibility in the situation the West now finds itself in following the proposals of the Secretary\u00adGeneral of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. I think the same sense of responsibility exists on the other side of the House too. I am glad that hardly anyone still doubts that the Western Alli\u00ad ance must keep its word and that if the Soviet SS20s in Europe are reduced it must do what we implied in the NATO twin\u00adtrack decision, namely, implement the zero option for medium\u00adrange weapons for the whole of Europe. What we are discussing now is Gorbachev's additional proposal to reduce not just the longer medium\u00adrange weapons but also the shorter ones. You say it would unacceptably weaken our nuclear deterrent power for the West to accept this proposal. We say that even after the removal of the shorter medium\u00adrange weapons there will still be hundreds and hundreds of nuclear weapons in Europe to main\u00ad tain the deterrent effect. You say a gap would appear in nuclear deterrence if the shorter medium\u00adrange weapons disappeared from Europe. We say to you: rejection of the double zero option would inevitably lead to renewed Western rearmament in shorter medium\u00adrange weapons. The American Foreign Min\u00ad ister Shultz has already announced that quite clearly. We do not want to rearm, we must avoid bringing new weapons into Europe! You say: we need these shorter medium\u00adrange weapons in order to avoid a dissocia\u00ad tion of the USA from Europe. But in saying that you are saying that stationing nuclear weapons in Europe is the precondition and the condition for the USA to act as a true ally. Ladies and gentlemen on the other side of th\u00e8 House, it would hardly be possible to express your distrust of . America's willingness to commit itself to the defence of Europe more strongly! This reflects the kind of anti\u00adAmericanism we in the Socialist Group will not endorse. We trust that our ally will keep to its commit\u00ad ments even if this kind of weapon disappears from Europe. You on the other side of the House fear nuclear disarmament in Europe because you fear the Soviet superiority in nuclear short\u00adrange weapons and conventional weapons. We are aware of that superior\u00ad ity too and we do not take it lightly; but we believe that if at this stage we make the disarmament of mis\u00ad siles in Europe conditional on simultaneous disarma\u00ad ment in conventional weapons, that will lead to more rather than fewer weapons. Those who know something about these matters real\u00ad ise that in the case of nuclear missiles it is still fairly easy to count and to assess what weapons are equiva\u00ad lent and can be reduced. But if we move into the field of conventional weapons we know that it is always very difficult to evaluate this. Even with the best of intentions on all sides, it could take ten years or more. Anyone who sets conventional disarmament and a bal\u00ad ance of conventional forces as the condition for nuclear disarmament in Europe does not really want nuclear disarmament at all and is in fact preventing it, and anyone who favours even more preconditions in this field must realise that. Ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group has tabled a motion for a resolution that starts from the assumption that the Soviet proposals will not give us peace for all time but that they do offer us a chance and that we as Europeans must use that chance for the peace of future generations. DE CAMARET (DR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, hon\u00ad ourable Members, the Group of the European Right again expresses its anxiety about the Soviet Union's nuclear disarmament proposals. What is called the zero option could in fact endanger the Europe\u00adUnited States link. If adopted, it would leave our continent completely vulnerable to the other Soviet nuclear weapons. That could be a trick whose sole purpose was the denuclearization of Europe. And let us not forget that the Soviet Union would then have an overwhelming superiority in conventional forces and chemical weapons. It would then become absolutely necessary to balance the two forces. If by any chance such negotiations were to take place, there could be no question of including the British and French forces. Honourable Members, at a time when it is fashionable to talk of Mr Gorbachev's more flexible approach, let us remember that Afghanistan has been occupied by the Soviet Army since 1979. Nothing has changed. Has Mr Gorbachev evinced the least desire to with\u00ad draw his troops from Afghanistan? Has Soviet expan\u00ad sionism come to an end? This so\u00adcalled peaceful intent ",
        "14. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/235 De Camaret is just a way of throwing dust in our eyes, and the Group of the European Right suggests that a confer ence of the appropriate ministers of the Community be called to evaluate the possible development of conven tional weapons, including the neutron bomb. As you know, the neutron bomb could be a very real defence for our people. Europe must not be checked by defeat, that of its common defence policy. On the contrary, we must do our utmust to ensure our own defence and by the same token our future and our survival. Our group has pointed this out frequently. Europe cannot have a genuine political resolve without a common defence policy. That is why we call for a European Defence Charter to be drawn up. HEINRICH (ARC). \u2014 (DE) MrPresident, ladies and gentlemen, the governments of the USA and the USSR have declared themselves willing in principle to agree on a zero option for longer medium-range mis siles, i.e. SS20s, Pershing lis and Cruise missiles, and for shorter medium-range weapons. We urgently call on you to adopt this solution, which even the US For eign Minister openly advocated. Foreign Minister Shultz and now even President Reagan have described as absurd the argument that the double zero option would weaken the West. The F- 111 nuclear fighter bombers still stationed in Great Britain and the nuclear missile submarines under the NATO Supreme Commander for Europe refute the misleading talk of a dangerous denuclearization of Europe, for the USA have nothing and the Federal Defence Forces only have their ageing 72 Pershing missiles to counter the 120 Soviet systems with their tenfold recharging capacity. 1 300 warheads against 72! So who is paying the higher price for disarmament? The Kremlin or the Western Europeans? Anyone who rejects this offer to scrap the missiles must be either a fool or an arsonist! And anyway we have Gorbachev's declaration of intent to remove the imbalance of conventional forces and weapons in Europe by reductions rather than by rearmament. Anyone who ignores this proposal instead of testing its serious intent is laying himself open to the suspicion of wanting to create another pretext for nuclear rearmament. At this moment the Federal Republic is mainly respon sible for the decision as to whether or not the danger that emanates from Central Europe as a nuclear pow der keg can be sharply reduced by a double zero option. For it is neither France nor the United King dom but only the Federal Republic that would be sta tioning further new nuclear missiles if it managed to oppose the expanded zero option successfully. GALLUZZI (COM). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, when the United States decided to station the Pershing and Cruise missiles in Europe, in response to the installa tion of the Soviet SS20s, the governments of the Member States, who had agreed to the stationing of the American missiles, did not fail to point out the danger of a new arms race to the United States and asked President Reagan to take measures to totally or partially reduce these weapons. It was these pressures which, you may recall, led the American President to lay the zero option proposal on the negotiating table in the talks with the Soviet Union. Well, now that this proposal has now been accepted and expanded by the Soviet Union, now that the pros pect of eliminating medium and short-range missiles is becoming real, the European governments have started having doubts and second thoughts, fearing lest this pave the way for what they call decoupling, that is to say, the danger that a Europe separated from the Americans and deprived of the American nuclear umbrella is at the mercy of the Soviet superiority in conventional weapons. Other Members have referred back to the declaration by the American Secretary of State Shultz, who said that an agreement that committed the Soviet Union to remove a quantity of missiles five times greater than that which the Americans would have to remove is in itself an important achievement, not only \u2014 as I myself would add \u2014 from a military point of view, but above all from a political point of view, since it means the Soviet Union is recognizing the existence of an imbalance in their favour in Euro-missiles and because it highlights the desire of the United States and the Soviet Union to rectify this imbalance not by means of a new arms race but by eliminating these deadly wea pons. Of course, undertakings are not enough; wc also need controls, verification, to ensure the agreements really are implemented, but this does constitute an important and essential precondition for the progress of the dia logue. PENDERS (PPE). \u2014 (NL) MrPresident, the EPP Group is not happy with this debate, since in March this European Parliament adopted a resolution on exactly the same subject. And in June, in the presence of the President of the Council, we are once more to devote a debate to security on the basis of a broadly- drawn oral question by the Security and Disarmament Sub-Committee of the Political Affairs Committee, also signed by Mr H\u00e4nsch, whilst there is also a report on the table about the Stockholm Conference. The heart of today's debate is the double zero option for INF and SRINF rockets. Governments of Member States are well on the way towards making up their minds about it. It is a very difficult matter also because of the position of the United States of America and ",
        "No 2-352/236 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 Penders even more difficult in view of the position of the Fed eral Republic. The application of the double zero option would in practice restrict the width of the nuclear strip in Europe, if I may call it that, to the two Germanies. The remaining Member States of the Community are bound by their responsibility for the security of Germany and of the whole alliance to make a very careful assessment. That process is under way between the Member States and I do not think the European Parliament should take an impulsive deci sion late on a Thursday evening with perhaps 50 or 60 Members present. I said earlier that the debate concerns the double zero option and as a result the discussion takes on rather a distorted accent. In essence it should be about the security of Europe both for the West and the East. My conviction and that of my Group is that the security of both parties is best served by a good and constructive operation of the strategy of deterrence based partly on nuclear weapons. History since 1945, with its many conflicts outside Europe and the absence of armed conflicts within Europe, shows that nuclear weapons prevent all wars, not just nuclear wars but conven tional wars too. We run great risks in basing our security purely on conventional systems, even in a situ ation of equilibrium which does not in fact exist. I know it sounds hard, it is not an easy message, but it is an honourable one and a realistic one. There are far too many nuclear weapons in Europe. The levels of nuclear armament can be much lower, but what is cen tral is the preservation of security. As Europeans we must check and consider carefully what nuclear wea pons and how many of each category we need, and it will not therefore come as any surprise that the EPP Group rejects the Communist / Socialist compromise amendment, whilst regretting that the Rules of Proce dure do not allow amendment of the compromise. (Applause from the centre) PRAG (ED). \u2014 Mr President, the Socialists in their original resolution and in the compromise resolution advocate the double zero option, as Mr Penders has just said. The removal from Europe of all intermediate nuclear forces, including those of shorter range, would leave Nato with no nuclear shield in Europe other than the shortrange battlefield weapons which could not reach the Soviet Union anyway. I fully understand the con cern of Federal Chancellor Kohl that any policy of denuclearization would leave Western Europe at any stage at the mercy of the Soviets' immense superiority in conventional arms. This superiority would enable the Soviets to exert a massive diplomatic pressure on European states and put the world diplomatic initiative firmly in Soviet hands. The Socialists are advocating the total removal of a system which has kept the peace in Europe for 40 years. Their original motion did not even ask for verification. I would like to ask them, Mr President, if they are really ready to double def ence spending, because that is the sort of sea change in policy that would be needed to give us parity in Europe in conventional forces. It may surprise the House to know that my group was ready to support the original sensible Communist motion. The Socialists for their part refused. They ins isted on their own motion. That Socialist motion is a perfect example of the heiter skelter rush of the major ity of Socialists \u2014 not all the Socialist parties \u2014 in Western Europe into extreme impracticality and fool ishness on defence. They try to delude themselves, Mr President, and us that you can still negotiate bal anced multilateral nuclear disarmament when you have given away all your nuclear cards before you start. Not only did the Communists in their motion show themselves to be better Europeans than the Socialists. They showed also that they have not lost their political acumen, while the Socialists appear to have gone soft in the head. There is no way, Mr President, that my group will vote for the new joint Socialist / Communist motion. For us defence is too important to play around with. Hope and reliance on good luck will not safeguard the freedom and democracy on which the European Com munity is built. We prefer the insurance policy. (Applause from the right) BAILLOT (COM). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, my friend Mr Galluzzi has just introduced the motion for a reso lution my group tabled on the double zero option in Europe. I shall not repeat his arguments, which I endorse in full. Two and a half months have passed since the Soviet Union made known its proposals on eliminating intermediate-range missiles, namely SS20, Pershing and Cruise missiles. In reply to the new criticism and requirements put forward by some Community leaders concerned about the danger of imbalance, the Soviets have presented new proposals on shorter-range mis siles, those with a range of 500 to 1 000 kilometres. That is the double zero option. And on chemical disar mament and conventional disarmament, which could be achieved in progressive stages. As for verification, they have accepted the principle of on the spot verifi cation, provided of course, the same is done in all the other countries too. In our view this creates the necessary political condi tions to enable Europe to conclude agreements on lim iting and then dismantling certain nuclear weapons, pending complete disarmament. So the process of gen uine disarmament can begin, and in our view we must do our utmost to ensure it does. In our view, the Com munity can make a useful contribution here. Of course we are not unaware of the forces which are still ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/237 Baillot opposed to this, and we are quite familiar with them in France too. That is why we for our part are resolved to begin by sweeping outside our own door, that is to say take action to force our leaders, at whatever level, to help achieve this agreement on the double zero option. That is what we will be voting for this evening. COSTE-FLORET (RDE). \u2014 (FR) MrPresident, honourable Members, although the ERDA group feels that any negotiations on disarmament aimed at reduc ing the military potential of possible belligerents must be viewed sympathetically, it also thinks that, to avoid the risk of it being a trick, the agreement must aim at a disarmament that is simultaneous, controlled and bal anced. I cannot see any sign of these vital conditions in the compromise motion or in the others tabled by the Socialist and Communist groups. In calling, in Para graph 1, for a separate agreement on nuclear weapons, they are forgetting that the reason Europe depends on nuclear weapons today is the imbalance in classical forces. That is a first reason for rejecting this motion. There is a second and in my view even stronger reason. It is in Paragraph 3 where you propose to Par liament that it reject all new preconditions for the con clusion of a separate INF agreement, from any coun try concerned, including European countries. That means you are asking the European states to abandon their responsibilities. I find that particularly shocking at a time when the Prime Minister of my country is just discussing these matters with the Soviet leaders in Moscow. Your motion calls on the European states and Europe to abandon their responsibilities. We think, on the contrary, that it is by assuming them that the Euro pean states will affirm their responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis their people and that it would be a good thing for these states, within the European Community, to speak with one voice in favour of a coherent, simulta neous and balanced disarmament plan. That is what the ERDA Group thinks and that is why it will vote against the compromise motion. VANDEMEULEBROUCKE (ARC). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the disarmament proposals by the two great powers have led on the one hand to the discussion on the desirability of the double zero option, but on the other hand they have had the advantage of jolting Europe into consciousness and obliging us to start discussions together. When Gor bachev made his proposals, the European countries in the last resort could not do much except telephone one another, because there is no political cooperation, there is no Community diplomatic action, and security without defence reduces the whole European discus sion to consultation about a Community industrial agreement for arms manufacture. That goes in pre cisely the opposite direction from what we contem plate. Everyone is rightly calling now for a European standpoint, but I very much doubt whether the will for that exists. To base oneself on the Western European Union for a Community standpoint may be a good beginning for reaching a general European standpoint, but let us not forget that Western European Union consists only of seven Member States and a consequ ence may be that we have a political and military two- speed Europe. European consultation about disarmament proposals must take place within the Community with respect for the country which wishes to remain neutral, and it is sad that the current presidency remains obstinately immovable. I should just like to say this about the wisdom or unwisdom of the double zero option: Europe will appear to be very short of credibility and politically unpredictable if it cannot accept what it has itself been asking for for years, and in connection with this debate I am surprised that the Group of the European Right can summon up the moral perversity in this con text to argue in favour of European manufacture of the neutron bomb. PORDEA (DR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, in response to the Soviet proposals on disarmament, we suggested that a European Defence Charter be drawn up under the aegis of our Community. I think it may be useful to remember at this point that our continent also com prises an Eastern part and that European defence relates to that area too. In the final analysis, the present split in Europe is an expression of the confrontation between on the one hand democracy and on the other the most extremist form of dictatorship. In theory our free world faces the latter with an Atlantic Alliance and a European Community, not to mention the various specialist councils, unions and organizations. Consequently, it seems most astonishing that as soon as Mr Gorbachev had formulated his proposals, we did not hasten to reaffirm the organic links that exist between the two halves of Europe, whose defence is indivisible from the dual point of view of human soli darity and security. After Yalta, Helsinki and the fol low-ups, how can one not doubt the sincerity of a Kremlin that suddenly promises a total about-turn? And how can one not be tempted to invite Mr Gor bachev to prove his interest in the principles of democ racy and his sudden concern for respect for human rights by respecting those of the nations currently under the Soviet Communist yoke? I feel that on the eve of grave East-West negotiations, the European Community ought to call for free elec tions under international supervision in the countries beyond the Iron Curtain. Then it would be carrying out its vital European duty. (Applause from the right) ",
        "No 2-352/238 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 ULBURGHS (NI). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, we live in historic times. The millions of marchers for peace, the so-called naive contingent, those who still believe in breaking that insane armaments spiral, are going to be proved right. The so-called political strategists and military geniuses have been telling us since 1945 that only by still greater nuclear deterrence, only by the potential to annihilate the enemy once, ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times over, can we our selves be secure. Those who plant the nuclear rockets say that if the other side would just dismantle them then you will see something done on our side. The zero option, nothing less than the zero option, was the wish of those rocket-planters. And suddenly a new wind in the Soviet Union! The other side too is sud denly ready to remove intermediate-range rockets. The Western strategists did not mean it that way. Who would have thought that the Soviet Union would take over their option? So a new theme must be sought. The strategists suddenly discover the pressing danger of the short-range rockets. Thereupon some then start dreaming of installing fresh short-range rockets to create a fresh equilibrium with the Soviet Union. But once again luck is not on their side. The Soviet Union is actually adopting all their attitudes. But a fresh stalking-horse is brought from the stable, the prepon derance of the Soviet Union in the field of conven tional weapons. Let us now finally replace the disastrous NATO twin- track decision clearly and definitely by the double zero option. A first disarmament agreement in which there is to be genuine disarmament and dismantling of wea pons. But I hear some of the strategists already raising the question whether the other side is honest, whether Gorbachev is in earnest, whether he is immortal. For economic reasons the Soviet Union needs a peace-time economy at least as badly as we in the West. Let us therfore create a climate of confidence which may lead at a later stage to a complete phasing out, including chemical and bacteriological weapons and a percepti ble reduction of conventional weapons. It is high time for nuclear weapon technology to be banished. People ask whether Western Europe can deliver itself up in this way unarmed to the danger from the Soviet Union. I am convinced that the Soviet Union is experi encing a crisis and cannot continue to hold its own people down. They cannot remain in occupation of Afghanistan. The countries of Eastern Europe want more freedom. Do you think that the Soviet Union can continue to occupy and divide a conscious and morally high-principled Europe? Europe's greatest strength and most important weapon is its high-princi pled culture, its Christian and social capital and its moral power for peace and justice. We must create a future in which love is stronger than hate. (Applause from the left) POETTERING (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is being held on the wrong day and at the wrong time. I consider it irresponsible for a question of fundamental importance to the future of Europe to be decided here by a random majority of perhaps five or ten votes. (Applause from the centre and right) People keep declaring here that we need a common European position, but this manner of holding debates of this kind and taking a decision here at such a late hour is exactly how not to achieve a common, con vincing European position. (Protests) Nor do I find it very loyal to decide now on a double zero solution by a random majority, considering that the Subcommittee on Security and Disarmament is adopting an arms control and disarmament solution by an almost unanimous decision and this is to be debated in a month's time, in June. Let us take a joint approach that really does represent Europe's interests! But you do not seem prepared to do so. We say yes to the zero option for longer medium- range missiles. We see that as a chance to introduce a new element into the East-West dialogue, in that veri fiable methods are being introduced. That would be something really new in the East-West dialogue. But in the case of shorter medium-range missiles, we urge that the Federal Republic of Germany must not end up as the only country in Europe where the shortest- range nuclear weapons of 0 to 500 km could be used. A final comment. Weapons are merely the expression of tensions, while the real reason for the tensions are the various motives underlying the weapons. That is why we do not only need a dialogue on arms control and disarmament . . . (Applause from the centre and right) PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr. Poettering, I am afraid that I must withdraw the floor from you. ROBLES PIQUER (ED). \u2014 (ES) Mr President, our Europe always approaches this grave dilemma with hope and, I think, with some trepidation. Can we or can we not put our trust in the offer made by that other Europe from which we are separated by force which is alien to peoples on both sides? Can we accept words which were not even really addressed to us but to our United States allies? A major British newspaper pointed out a few days ago that experience showed we were justified in fearing that the Soviet challenge might be a trap. But at the same time we all hope that the words will be borne out by deeds, for example, as regards the necessary verification which, although it appears unreliable, as Mr Prag has mentioned, was not even requested in the motion for a resolution origin ally tabled by the Socialist Group in this House. ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/239 Robles Piquer I must say also, speaking as a Spaniard, that I was rather surprised by the impetuosity with which my Prime Minister, Mr Gonzales, seems to have worked up enthusiasm about Mr Gorbachev's words. I do not think he showed the circumspection appropriate in so serious a matter or the solidarity merited by our Euro pean allies who are geographically closer than we are to the armed forces of the Warsaw Pact. Our Com munity should take more united action on defence. We therefore hope that the adoption of the amend ments signed by our Group will help to form a body of doctrine based on three principles: first, true solidarity within Western Europe and of course with the North American pillar of the Alliance to which the majority of the peoples represented here belong; secondly, a great readiness to give detailed consideration to all genuine \u2014 not imaginary \u2014 possibilities of d\u00e9tente and disarmament and, thirdly, a global and certainly not a partial view of the process of disarmament, since Europe does indeed need a system of deterrence to continue to protect us throughout the terms of office of President Reagan and Mr Gorbachev and many years beyond so that we and our children may rely on deeds and not on words. (Applause from the right) TOURRAIN (RDE). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, history teaches us that every time a country lowers its guard, its defences, it pays for it by the loss of its indepen dence and liberty. The same applies to alliances. This resolution is the first step towards resigning our 'res ponsibilities. Coming from the Community, it is neither naive nor gratuitous. It is unacceptable and we do not accept it. If we are currently living in Europe in a state of non- war, it is thanks to the balance of power. If medium and short-range nuclear weapons are removed from Europe, Europe will be faced with the enormous superiority of the Warsaw Pact's conventional and chemical weapons. If that is our concept of peace, then we must say to Mr Gorbachev \u2014 so I believe \u2014 that the zero option is fine, provided it is closely linked to the implementa tion on their part of the Helsinki agreement and, in particular, its third section. And that is the problem. Honourable Members, at issue here is not merely whether to have more arms and missiles or fewer arms and missiles. It is whether or not a dictatorship, a dic tatorial state, would be the ideal partner for building peace. My answer is no! My answer is that until we have democracy in the Warsaw Pact, until we see human, civil and political rights guaranteed in those countries, they cannot be more trustworthy partners than others. (Applause from the centre and the right) We must go to the negotiating table and say no to mis siles, no to weapons, no to chemical weapons, no to swords, no to knives. And at the same time we must say yes to political rights, yes to human and civil rights of the people, yes to the freedom of movements of persons and ideas, yes to the freedom to leave of the Jews. Then Gorbachev will have to say yes to the depature of Ida Nudel, yes to the depature of Cherna Goldort, yes to the departure of the others too. On that condition only can we talk. The zero option is certainly important, but the concept of democracy cannot be dissociated from that of peace and I think it would be an enormous mistake for us to regard peace merely as the absence of war instead of regarding it as part of the building of democracy. (Applause from the centre and the right) What we must do, honourable Members from the right and from the left, is to evolve an agressive policy of peace together. We must require the right and left- wing dictatorships to allow the first germs of nascent democracy into their countries. Only then can they be reliable partners, only then, for peace is constructed with citizens and not with states. But why will Mr Gorbachev not agree to reduce his strategic arsenal by 50%? In short, the Europeans must take the matter of their defence in hand. The French Prime Minister proposed a European Defence Charter to the WEU. Let us hope it is accepted and implemented quickly. BONINO (NI). \u2014 (IT) MrPresident, honourable Members, as non-violent radicals we are for the zero option, the more zero the better, and frankly knives and swords are becoming a bit tiresome too. But I do not think that is the problem. It seems to me that we must ask ourselves what peace is. Is peace simply an absence of war and weapons, or is it also a situation in which democracy and the human, political and civil rights of the people are guaranteed and applied? (Applause from the centre and the right) MALLET (PPE). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I am one of the number that thinks that the debate this evening is not serious and perhaps even irresponsible. By holding this kind of debate, without preparation, on such grave matters, on which the security and fate of Europe for decades to come will depend, in the next few weeks our Parliament is discrediting itself. Having said that, it would be better if I left. Indeed I would have preferred to finish my dinner in peace. Yet i would still like to say why I think this resolution before us is unacceptable.

That is Gorbachev's objective, and he is playing the game well. And the other side does in fact need to be quite lucid to see his real object. May I add that I am scandalized \u2014 there is no other word for it \u2014 by paragraph 3 of this resolution in which you ask the European Community countries not to have a policy. That Europe is an impotent Europe, a Europe that has given up. And that is a Europe I reject with all my strength. (Applause from the centre and right) MEDEIROS FERREIRA (RDE). \u2014 (PT) MrPresi dent, the most recent developments in the disarma ment talks are extremely positive, and public opinion in our democratic countries has the distinct impression that a new era may be dawning for the continent of Europe in military terms. I myself had the opportunity in Lisbon to hear representatives at the talks both from the Soviet side and from our North American allies; both sides showed a clear willingness to reach agree ment. These exchanges of information and explora tory talks are a good thing in themselves because, even though the limitation of nuclear arms in the European theatre is under discussion, the arms in question are not European arms. Both sides nevertheless under stand that the question is one of public opinion which is formed by the citizens of Europe. That is also our strength. The negotiations under way seem to be well conducted and the new atmosphere has not even been disturbed by the increase in diplomatic incidents. The members of the Renewal Group are in agreement with the general spirit of the compromise motion for a resolution but cannot vote in favour of it in view of paragraph 3 which we consider unfortunate and nega tive as regards a European security policy. We shall therefore abstain, since talks are to be held and it would ill behove us to close the door on opportunities for agreement or to criticize the very positive partial progress made to date. Whatever may be the scope of future agreements, the European countries must real ize that a new era is dawning in the conditions for the security of the Member States of the EEC. HERMAN (PPE). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, since this entire matter will be the subject of another debate based on a report in June and since it is not right to discuss the future of Europe \u2014 i.e. the future of 320 million people \u2014 on an impromptu basis and before a very sparse Assembly, I ask for the presence of a quorum to be established.

Some Members certainly did not vote at all. Can I therefore ask you to close the doors and count all of the Mem bers in the Chamber?

Once again one could doubt whether a quorum exists, but I assume that the count would then include everyone, even those who are not taking part in the vote. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Arndt, I would refer you to Rule 48(7) and in particular to the interpretation given in the third subparagraph that 'motion for resolutions in respect of which it is established, following a request under Rule 71(3), that a quorum is not pres\u00ad ent' shall also lapse. This covers the entire debate that we have held on disarmament, and it is not possible therefore to take the vote on the compromise amend\u00ad ment. CHAMBEIRON (COM). \u2014 (FR) MrPresident, I agree with Mr Arndt. Everyone has the right to ask for the presence of a quorum to be established here. But allow me to point out that if Rule 71 is applied, no fur\u00ad ther debate will be possible tonight because every Member can ask for a quorum on every item taken. I think that if you decided to suspend the sitting you would be following the same line as what was decided earlier on. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Chambeiron, the Chair is under a strict obligation to apply the Rules of Procedure without any regard to how people feel about things. The Member who asked that a quorum be established was perfectly within his rights. We made a count and there was not a quorum at that particular moment. All that the Chair can do, interpreting Rule 71, as I have said, in conjunction with Rule 48, is to carry on the sitting, since my attitude is that the Chair is entitled to do this and that the Members have an obligation in the matter. Steel industry PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad333/87 by Mr Wagner and Mr Arndt, on behalf of the Socialist Group, on combating the esca\u00ad lating steel crisis on the Community; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad362/87 by Mr Franz and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the situation of the steel industry in the European Community; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad371/87 by Mr Cervetti and others, on the worsening crisis in the Community steel industry. WAGNER (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gen\u00ad tlemen, it is a good thing for us to take the concerns of the people outside very seriously, and that applies par\u00ad ticularly to the subject now under discussion. Tens of thousands of steelworkers and their wives and children are living in fear and fighting for their liveli\u00ad hood out there. That is unworthy of the spirit and let\u00ad ter of the Coal and Steel Treaty, the cornerstone of European cooperation, European integration. That is why I am thankful that we managed to table a joint motion so that we can join forces in face of the alarm\u00ad ing escalation of the steel crisis \u2014 which is putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk and, for the first time, entire steel\u00adproducing regions \u2014 and use our influ\u00ad ence to ensure that the crisis is tackled seriously and effectively. I am sure I can speak for all of us here in expressing our total solidarity and support for the peo\u00ad ple who are fighting out there in the worst affected areas for their jobs and the livelihood of their families! I am grateful to those members of the European Peo\u00ad ple's Party and Communist and Allies groups who have cooperated in this joint motion, so that we can have a broad majority supporting the necessary mea\u00ad sure. The political and economic leaders must act at last. There have been enough deliberations and investi\u00ad gations, now effective action must be taken. That is why it is a good thing that we formulated demands and proposals in this Parliament on ways of tackling and combating the crisis as early as last October. May I ask the Commission to refrain from moving towards further liberalization of the European steel market for the foreseeable future and in its foreseeable deliberations. That would be poison and would be a huge mistake. We must continue with the steel crisis system in the medium term \u2014 as we say in our joint resolution \u2014 and ensure that far\u00adreaching social and regional supporting measures are taken so that people no longer need fear for their livelihood and so that we can lay claim to what Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet and all those who helped bring this Treaty into being ",
        "No 2-352/242 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 Wagner in the six European states wanted to achieve: that the people can live without fear and with human dignity even in the event of structural and short-term econo mic problems, without fear or loss of livelihood and with secure jobs and living conditions. That is the issue in this situation too, in which we in the European Community are suffering from surplus capacities, imports from third countries, price drops and many thousands of jobs at risk. That is why we jointly call upon the Council finally to allocate the funds needed for supplementary social measures and for far-reaching and effective aid pro grammes to create substitute jobs and safeguard exist ing jobs and training places. We are addressing these words to the Council and the Commission and to the employers, and in that spirit I say 'good luck'! Let us all jointly support this resolu tion and let us use our influence in the right human spirit and set a European example! (Applause from the left) ELLIOTT (S). \u2014 Mr President, on a point of order. On the matter of the quorum, I am in no way ques tioning your decision to move on to the next debate. However, in the course of your remarks, you did say that the resolutions on disarmament fall. As I under stand it, according to paragraph 3 of Rule 71, the resolutions do not fall. They are placed on the agenda of the next sitting. Could you confirm when we will have the vote? competitiveness and help protect jobs in the regions concerned in the long term. But if we want to take full account of the employment and regional problems we must maintain and improve the EC steel crisis system for a three-year transitional period. Firms and unions must use this transitional period to implement the necessary restructuring mea sure. At the same time, the shut-down of unprofitable plants must take place under socially acceptable condi tions and measures must be taken to prevent any dis tortions of competition and subsidies, anti-dumping procedures against cheap steel imports must be simpli fied, tightened and speeded up and funds must be made available to create a comprehensive retraining and further training programme in the affected regions. Integrated programmes must be put forward for the creation of new jobs. The problems that will have to be solved in the Euro pean steel industry in the next three years are so ser ious that there is no point in complaining, accusing or blaming anyone. We will not create and protect jobs by denigrating the Commission, national governments, firms or unions. No country can solve these problems on its own, nor can any single party or group in this Parliament. So it is vital for us to seek solutions together in our Parliament, and also for Council and Commission, unions and firms to cooperate closely in order to overcome the European steel crisis. That is why my group supports the compromise resolution. (Applause from the left) PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Elliott, this item is closed and I must ask you to resume your seat. FRANZ (PPE). \u2014 (DE) MrPresident, honourable Members, when we discuss the steel crisis in the Euro pean Community today, we must not forget what has been achieved in the last few years. In the last few years we have managed, by a great effort of solidarity, to shut down more than 30 million tonnes of capacity in the European Community, on the basis of proposals by this Parliament, without this leading to any serious social difficulties. Through this major effort, many new, forward-looking jobs have been created in the steel regions \u2014 a success no one dreamed of at first. But the fall in steel consumption is continuing. We cannot change the fact that many cars, bridges and machines now only need half as much steel as 25 years ago and that this process will continue. There will have to be another substantial reduction in capacity in the European steel industry in the next few years if at least the modern steelworks in the Community are to be fully used and to remain competitive. What we want \u2014 and may I emphasize this \u2014 is the restoration of fair, free market competition in the European steel industry. Only then can we ensure its international BONACCINI (COM). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, this is not the first time we have discussed the steel crisis in this Chamber and no one \u2014 least of all myself \u2014 would dispute that a real crisis does in fact exist or that our countries and to some extent also the Community have made great sacrifices and great efforts to create solidarity. Many explanations \u2014 some of them quite reasonable \u2014 have been put forward as to why we are going through this crisis. Nevertheless, the disinvestment figures remain enormous; the closing down of plants has affected hundreds of thousands of workers, sacrif iced entire regions. A whole section of the history of our continent has disappeared with the steel crisis. This has happened in my country too, but not only there. I want to ask the Commission: how has it reacted to a phenomenon which had some horrifying consequ ences? Is it perhaps waiting for the balancing acts and ambiguities which have characterized the history of the last few years in the headquarters of Eurofer, Fin- sider or the associations of lesser firms? What is the Commission's position? I am not denying the positions the Commission has taken in the past and the mea sures it took, although with great difficulty and after a ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/243 Bonnacini long time, to help the unemployed in several regions, but what is clear is that it has given no positive answer and no idea how it will resolve this crisis, how it can be approached, with what active policy and how autonomously the Commission will tackle these prob lems. That is why we tabled this resolution, not just to record a problem but to say very forcefully that the time has come when we can no longer continue along the same road \u2014 the road of destroying industrial plants and regions, of making hundreds of thousands of workers redundant. The resolution, tabled unanimously, speaks for itself. There is one point I want to stress, though: there have been several calls for a European conference on the steel industry. This European conference has not yet taken place. Would this not perhaps be a good moment for the Commission to give a sign of life? Would this not be the moment, for the trade union organizations know how to mobilize themselves and express the anger felt by a large section of the popula tion, with an energy and a unity which reflect the will of the workers? That is the hope we express, and I think that in this respect Parliament could take a very positive attitude. SCHMIT (S). \u2014 (DE) I must say that I considered the first two topics taken this evening very important. Since it has been asserted from various quarters that the debate on the first topic was not properly pre pared, I must defend myself against that reproach as one of those who was prepared. But in this case I can account for myself before my constituents and the vot ers of Europe. Coming back to the steel crisis \u2014 although connec tions have sometimes been made between it and arms policy. I agree with what has been said here and the requests to the Commission. We really ought to con vene a steel conference and above all we need a really serious exchange of the experiences we have had in our own countries. I come from a very small country, Luxembourg. The name of my country often conveys strange associations, and not always that of a large steel industry which has been trying for years to find viable solutions. I would be really glad if we could have an exchange of views, if we could go beyond ideological barriers, such as the idea of a further liber alization of the market, because then we would risk being ruled by the law of the jungle. We are well aware that under that law the strongest, the most bru tal, the economically most powerful would win, or shift to another continent, while many of our electors, the electors of this Parliament, namely the steelwork- ers, would fall by the wayside. (Applause from the left) M\u00dcHLEN (PPE). \u2014 (FR) Mr president, I am glad it has proved possible, within the framework of a joint resolution by the EPP and the Socialist Group, which was also supported by Mr Bonaccini and Mr Cervetty; to make Parliament more aware of the worsening situ ation on the steel market. The situation on the steel market is such that we must pay more attention to it now, for the following rea sons. First, according to Vice-President Narjes, the surplus capacity on the steel market is currently esti mated at about 30 million tonnes compared to 20 mil lion a short while ago. Secondly, it is not just pressed but also rolled steel products which are now affected by the closure of outlets and the falling prices. Thirdly, the attempts to control and check imports and dump ing prices have so far proved unsuccessful. That is to say, the necessary preconditions have not yet been ful filled, under present circumstances, for speeding up the liberalization measures: adjustment of production capacities, control of cut-price imports and introduc tion of the social measures which are the prerequisite for any reduction in capacity. The Commission, which now seems to be taking a more realistic view, must persevere in its efforts to consolidate the steel market in order to prepare it carefully for a return to the rules of a market economy. MATUTES, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regards the cri sis in the steel industry the Commission is obliged to confirm \u2014 not because these are our own ideas, but unfortunately, as Mr Franz mentioned, because of the facts facing us \u2014 the information contained in the general objectives of Document 431 final of 31 July 1985 and in another document \u2014 No 515 of 7 Octo ber 1986 \u2014 which clearly shows that the demand for steel in the Community has fallen and will continue to fall for structural and, unfortunately, inevitable rea sons beyond our control. These two documents, which have certainly been widely distributed and which Par liament also has received, show that we still have sur plus capacity in our steel industry. This surplus capa city exists, moreover, in all industrialized countries in the world without exception, and according to OECD forecasts world steel surpluses are at present of the order of 200 million tonnes per year. The Commission and the Council have never believed \u2014 and I mean never \u2014 that the European steel indus try should or could be sacrificed; on the contrary, we must realize that European industry is in a period of restructuring and is trying to find a new equilibrium to make it viable in the medium and long term. Steel must be defended wisely. On the one hand against competition from substitute materials and on the other against imports which are a threat to the Community, particularly in view of the fall in the exchange rate for the dollar. Community restructuring policy not only includes the closing down of surplus capacity but also promotes ",
        "No 2-352/244 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5. 87 Matutes investment to encourage a sufficient increase in prod uctivity and competitivity to enable the industry to serve its natural market (that of the Community) whilst retaining a presence on non-Community mar kets, particularly in the field of high-quality products. The Commission has therefore always attached, and will continue to attach, special importance to support for steel research to improve productivity and compe titivity. The Commission has maintained the principle, especially in the face of the recent Eurofer initiatives, that the anti-crisis measures and, in practical terms, market control by means of the quota system must never be regarded as an end in themselves but rather as measures for a limited period of time so as to ensure, moreover, that the process of restructuring is less brusque and less traumatic. It will be for the Commission to check by broad cate gories of products \u2014 as it is now doing \u2014 whether the state of manifest crisis should be maintained. The Commission proposed the liberalization (only of given categories of products) which came into force on 1 January 1985 for concrete reinforcing bars and coated sheet and, from January 1986, for galvanized sheet. It has also proposed to liberalize wire rods, mer chant bars and some sections in the near future. But the Commission does not at present intend, for any of these last-mentioned products, to continue the quota system beyond 31 December of this year. Nevertheless the Commission believes that alongside this policy scrupulous attention should be paid to steel imports into the Community and we must be particu larly vigilant in applying anti-dumping procedures, as requested by Mr Franz, Mr M\u00fchlen and other speak ers. Clearly this policy is going to have its negative aspects in addition to bringing about an improvement in productivity and viability in the medium and long term. The Commission intends to overcome these by means of wise and essential restructuring using two types of policy. On the one hand direct intervention, as requested by Mr Wagner and Mr Bonaccini, in favour of workers: system of early retirement, com pensation for reconversion etc. Secondly the creation of alternative jobs in the steel areas most seriously affected by the crisis. The Commission has therefore suggested to the Council and the Member States that the concept of integrated programmes should be applied, making it possible by means of a coordinated concentration of policies and instruments to allocate the maximum possible amount of resources, particu larly financial resources, for the creation of new jobs in the areas most directly affected. All the Commis sion's initiatives within the framework of this inevita ble restructuring, which is essential since it is the only means of achieving viability in the medium and long term for the European steel industry, will be accompa nied by both social and regional proposals and initia tives. Particular attention will of course be paid within the context of this policy to the contributions which small- and medium-sized undertakings may make, particularly within the most dynamic sectors. For the record I should like to say that unfortunately the Council has not continued its policy of transferring from the general budget to the ECSC budget those resources intended for those very social measures envisaged in the ECSC Treaty. The fact that the Council refused last December to make these budget transfers is all the more damaging since, as you know, the ECSC budget, financed from levies, is rapidly run ning out and, what is more, is sinking below the level required for any possibility of intervention in social matters, just at a time when there is a great and urgent need for some action to be taken. It is too soon to say what definitive market mechanisms the Commission is intending to bring into force should any form of quota system continue. The technical problems to be solved are, as you know, extremely complex and the Commission, precisely because the question is a delicate one, is still reflecting about the best solutions, which will have to be applied gradually, and of course in order to ensure the neces sary area and market for the most productive firms and at the appropriate time to help those who are less productive to restructure and to increase their invest ments and productivity and not their production. Finally, as regard the organization of the conference favoured by Mr M\u00fchlen, Mrs Schmit and almost all speakers \u2014 to include representatives of the Council and the Commission and unions and employers from the steel sector \u2014 the Commission, whilst naturally in favour of the idea and of everything which will contri bute to a major dialogue, still has some doubts as to the practical results which might be achieved. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The joint debate is closed. (Parliament adopted a joint resolution 1 replacing the three motions for resolutions with a new text) CINCIARI RODANO (COM). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, excuse me, I had asked to speak on a procedural point before you called the first speaker on the problems in the steel industry. I do not take it personally, for it is not the first time the Presidency, which is always look ing the other way, has failed to notice when someone at this end of the Chamber has asked to speak on a procedural point. As a result, however, it is not my fault that I am forced to make this procedural point at an inappropriate moment. My procedural point concerns the interpretation of Rules 71 and 48. When you referred to Rule 71, Mr President, which specifies that 'if the vote shows that the quorum is not present, the vote shall be placed This joint motion for a resolution was tabled by Mr Wagner and Mr Arndt, on behalf of the Socialist Group, Mr Franz and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, Mr Bonaccini and Mr Cervetti. ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2\u00ad352/245 Cinciari Rodano on the agenda of the next sitting', I do not think you took into account that in our case that rule must be read in conjunction with Rule 48, according to which motions for a resolution on the same topic are put to the vote one after the other until one of them is not adopted, and only then do the others lapse . . . PRESIDENT. \u2014 You are raising once again a matter that the Chair, on the basis of its interpretation of two rules, has declared to be closed. I regard the matter as over and done with. However, you are within your rights in making your protest. If you so wish, of course, you can also propose that the matter be referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, Verification of Credentials and Immunities. IN THE CHAIR: MR MEGAHY Vice\u00adPresident Human Rights PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad350/87 by Mr De Gucht, on behalf of the Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group, on human rights in Morocco; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad352/87 by Mr Pranch\u00e8re and others, on behalf of the Communist and Allies Group, on the fate of the family of General Oufkir and hundreds of miss\u00ad ing persons in Morocco; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad356/87 by Mrs Bonino and others, on the death sentence passed on Paula Cooper in the Ameri\u00ad can State of Indiana; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad372/87 by Mrs Cassanmagnago Cerretti and others, on the death sentence passed on Paula Cooper in the American State of Indiana; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad375/87 by MrTelk\u00e4mper and Mr Tri\u00ad dente, on behalf of the Rainbow Group, on the situa\u00ad tion of 14 prisoners in Chile; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad379/87 by Mr Boesmans, on behalf of the Socialist Group, on the situation of Chilean political prisoners following the Pope's visit to Chile; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad355/87 by Mr Lomas and Mr Glinne, on behalf of the Socialist Group, on the trials in Namibia; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2\u00ad366/87 by Mr Andrews and others, on the trial of eight Namibians, Messrs Akweenda, Heita, Matthews, Nangombo, Nagolo, Paulus, Shipanga and Tangeni. LACERDA DE QUEIROZ (LDR). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our motion for a resolution was tabled for purely humanitarian reasons. We are pointing out that these four young people, detained over fifteen years ago when they were mere children, should be freed. The Kingdom of Morocco should grant them the necessary permission to leave the country. General Oufkir may have had a rather sinister reputation, but there can be no justification for persecuting anyone for crimes alleged against their parents. The Member States should demonstrate their good will towards these young people, who have been persecuted, by giving them an opportunity to emigrate and take up residence in one of the Community coun\u00ad tries. We nevertheless urge Parliament to reject, I repeat, to reject, the amendments tabled by the Com\u00ad munist Group since they in no way serve to solve the problem facing these people but rather, by broadening the scope of our resolution, rob it of its purely human\u00ad itarian nature; even though some of the points they make seem to me to be relevant, they might prompt the Moroccan authorities to make a negative response and thus thwart the aims we all cherish for this parti\u00ad cular case. The Kingdom of Morocco has many affinities with Europe which would certainly be strengthened if the Moroccan Government would show clemency towards the children of General Oufkir. We are confident that our approach will meet with success. CHAMBEIRON (COM). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, it is now fifteen years since the wife and children of the former General Oufkir were interned without legal grounds in the King of Morocco's prisons. Although their escape \u2014 and we all know how they travelled \u2014 only lasted a few days, it served as terrible and irrefut\u00ad able evidence to public opinion that in Morocco peo\u00ad ple disappear, men, women, children, at the sover\u00ad eign's whim. The League for Human Rights and a large number of associations and relatives of the disappeared have been trying for years to obtain information on the fate of hundreds of missing persons. Whether they are mem\u00ad bers of the opposition or their relatives, victims of the colonizing war against the Sahrawi people or simply the victims of personal enmity, no justification is ever given for their arrest, no news is given of their fate, buried alive in prison. And we think it is now time to remove the veil of false democracy assumed by the Morrocan regime. It is time public opinion called them to account. Where are General Oufkir's wife and chil\u00ad dren? What has happend to the three Boureka broth\u00ad ers, French nationals who have been held without any explanation since 1973? And what has happened to the hundreds of missing Sahrawi and Moroccan citizens? That is the question we are asking! BONINO (NI). \u2014 (IT) MrPresident, honourable Members, the resolution I have tabled together with ",
        "No 2-352/246 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 Bonino another hundred or so Members concerns the viola tion of human rights, in the West this time, in a coun try regarded as democratic and friendly; I am speaking of the United States of America. It concerns the 'Paula Cooper affair' \u2014 which I am sure you have heard about \u2014 the case of a minor, who was certainly responsible for a terrible crime, who was sentenced to death and is now waiting in prison until she reaches the ago of majority in order to be exe cuted. For us Paula Cooper is a symbol for the other 32 minors held in US prisons awaiting execution. We consider that the death penalty, especially when inflicted on minors, assumes the form of a kind of legal vendetta and that it is evidently not worthy of a democracy, a democratic state, to inflict the death penalty, and especially not on minors. Honourable Members \u2014 including those of you who, I think, heard my earlier speech \u2014 I think that our Parliament has one sole raison d'\u00eatre: we believe that the fundamental values \u2014 and in particular the value of life \u2014 are not a commodity that can be traded to the left or the right, with a fluctuating or relative value depending on who owns or uses it; we believe that the fundamental values are inalienable, whether they are violated in the East or the West. In particular, given that the US is a Western, friendly state, one that is considered democratic, this Parliament, which repre sents Europe, must apply increasingly strong and firm pressure to show that, for us Europeans, fundamental rights cannot be bartered but represent the same values on which democracy is and must be based, which is why I hope everyone will vote in favour of this resolu tion. ANTONIOZZI (PPE). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, honour able Members, I refer to the motion for a resolution I tabled together with others. The story of Paula Cooper not only gives rise to an emotion made up of the human feelings of pity and concern for a very young girl tragically waiting to undergo the death penalty. I think it is also a story of great social import ance. The world in which we live, which devotes so much time every day to human rights, should reflect care fully on this case which is really important for the society we are living in, concerning as it does the death sentence inflicted on a minor. And above all it is the Western world and the democratic countries, who are willing to consider the human race from all its aspects, who should give thought to this matter. In countries which are not democratic \u2014 and sadly there are many of them in the world \u2014 where there is no freedom of press or of opinion, it is often impossi ble to find out about such things or, if they are known, to speak about them with impunity. But here, where liberty and democracy are the foundations of our social life, we have the right and the duty, especially in this free European Parliament, to speak out loudly, to address a human and political appeal to that great democratic country, the United States of America, to respond to our request and not let one of its states commit this murder by execution which, given its methods, the actual procedure applied, and also the extremely serious fact of taking the life of a human being, we cannot accept without a cry of grief and condemnation. That is the appeal we make to the Council and the Commission, on the basis of the reso lution tabled in this Assembly, asking them to forward it to the appropriate authorities of the State con cerned. TRIDENTE (ARC). \u2014 (IT) My dear Mr President, honourable Members, I have just come back from Chile where \u2014 on visiting the Chilean prisons and from the meetings I had there with political prisoners, and on visiting the communities of the Mapuches tribes who are dying out partly because the government is taking away their land and therefore their raison d'\u00eatre \u2014 I found a situation of systematic, institutional even if selective violence still continuing. In fact the Pope's visit did nothing to change the situa tion. It simply obliged the regime to take cosmetic measures, for the time being at least. Although a recent government decree has shut down the prisons of the CNI secret services, there is an increase in the number of kidnappings, the cases of brutal violence towards those who spoke out in public about the situa tion of the people during the Pope's recent visit. Those who oppose the regime of violence, assassination and torture are being treated even worse and even more harshly. The fate of the political prisoners, who have suddenly been sentenced to death, is especially grave. We in the democratic world, in Europe, must not only call on the Pinochet regime, on the dictatorial government of Chile, to commute the sentences of those condemned to death, pending the decisions of the Supreme Court, to expulsion from the country, but also to follow the example of many European countries who have tac kled the situation with courage and dignity and offered entry visas as a means of saving these people. Our decisive, our resolute denunciation of the situa tion in Chile may help save the lives and suspend the sentences of the political prisoners, and impose free elections leading to a return to democracy. If we suc ceed in this, we will also be really entitled to raise our voice strongly in condemnation of other forms of viol ence and arbitrary acts in other parts of the world. BOESMANS (S). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I shall con fine myself to a shorter speech because most of the ground has already been covered by Mr Tridente who, with first-hand knowledge, has undoubtedly had a better opportunity than I to deliver the message from ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/247 Boesmans all these prisoners. But I should like to put the case for Mrs Castro, the representative of the political prison ers and their families, who has been here for a two- day visit to Parliament and has had the opportunity to talk to various Members. She has also mentioned that the Pope's visit was perversely seized upon by the r\u00e9gime to missuse the apertura, the opening which was created so to speak, and to effect further repression. What can we do? In fact we can try to increase our political pressure, but we can also do something prac tical, as already mentioned by Mr Tridente. We can make use of the opportunity presented by Decree No 504 to apply pressure via diplomatic missions on behalf of these political prisoners \u2014 at the moment there are 431 who have already been several years in prison and 80% of them have in fact never been con victed \u2014 so that these people may actually leave the country. Till now much too little use has been made of this. Let me give some figures of the visas granted to these political prisoners. Belgium 42, France 8; Den mark 2; Netherlands 3 and the German Land of Hes sen will provide a refuge for the 14 who have been condemned to death if they can in fact obtain their freedom. That is too few from a total of 431 people who have already been in prison for so long! I should like to take advantage of this occasion and these resolutions, which I hope and am convinced will be supported today, to call upon the governments to make more use of this asylum and to call upon our diplomatic missions in Chile to exert pressure so that the undertakings in Decree No 504 may be fulfilled and that these political prisoners may leave the coun try. ANDREWS (RDE). \u2014 Mr President, I have not had an opportunity of putting on public record my congra tulations on your election as Vice-President. You arc one of nature's true gentlemen and I am delighted to see you in the Chair. On 20 May the trial will resume in Windhoek, Nami bia, of eight Namibians charged with contravention of the Terrorism Act. The accused in the case have been in detention since 1985, mostly in solitary confine ment. During the trial the security police officially acknowledged for the first time that systematic torture is used on detainees. At the beginning of March this year evidence was given by the defence of tortures that in one particular instance were condemned by the judge as inhuman. These tortures have been described in the Weekly Mail of Johannesburg and the Indepen dent, a most prestigious journal in London. One accused showed the court scars on his back and photographs taken by his solicitor a few weeks after wards. These were shown in court. These tortures were inhuman assaults. But there are also the circum stances in which the case was brought and the way in which investigations were carried out by police. These officers avowedly believe that normal rules do not apply to them in their task, which is to track down SWAPO terrorists and exterminate them. A warrant officer expressed this attitude in the words: 'It is all right to do whatever you want to detainees as long as you do not unnecessarily kill them.' Following these admissions, all written confessions by the accused were withdrawn by the state. However, this is surely not enough. The charges themselves should be withdrawn, since it has manifestly been shown that the investigators were totally unfit for their task and the case is in the fact the outcome of their investigations, the interrogation of the accused over long periods of solitary confinement and inhuman treatment and the framing of those persons. The South African Government should order the abandonment of the trial and the immediate release of the accused. LENZ (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, once again Chile is on the agenda. However much the opponents of the death penalty in my group agree with the idea of a declaration against death sentences and torture and above all against the arrest of political dissidents, for the political prisoners in Chile also include friends from our camp, Christian Democrats, I must make a few comments on this resolution. One, in resolutions of this kind one must take great care to check the list of names properly. That does not seem to have been done here. For one of the indivi duals named was sitting with us at our group meeting the day before yesterday and helped us find out more about this country and its political conditions. Two, in the case of Chile too, the sanctions that have once again been demanded would only affect the peo ple and would help rather than harm Pinochet. Three, we should support the intention of the demo cratic parties in Chile to cooperate specifically in order to achieve a return to democracy, especially since the aim is national reconciliation. Four, according to the Chilean politician who is just visiting the European Parliament, the Pope's visit \u2014 and here I must firmly contradict Mr Boesmans \u2014 is to be regarded as purely for the purpose of strengthen ing democratic aspirations and human rights in Chile. Five, military courts for civilians are not and may not be an instrument of democratic and constitutional states, and certainly not if there is no chance of appeal to the supreme courts. Six, in view of the blanket assertions made in both the motions for resolutions, each member of our group is free to decide for or against them. In any case we remain opposed to dictatorship. ",

WELSH (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I am one of those who are totally opposed to the death penalty for any body under any circumstances, however ghastly their crime. Therefore, I am totally in sympathy with Mrs Bonino's resolution. However, the first indent does contain something rather misleading. The fact of the matter is that Paula Cooper is in jail, her sentence is subject to a manda tory appeal to the Indiana State Court, she then has a whole appeal process to go through up to the United States Supreme Court which could take anything up to 10 years. The idea therefore that she is being kept in prison until she reaches the age of 18 and will be immediately executed is actually untrue. Not only is it untrue, but I think it would be rightly resented by the American people to whom this resolution is addressed if they felt that the European Parliament were holding them responsible for that particular sort of atrocious behaviour. I did explain this to Mrs Bonino and she kindly agreed that she would accept the deletion of the last part of the first indent. I think we were much moved by her words on Parliament's role as the expression of the democratic forces in Europe, but we owe it to our own democratic principles to be accurate in our facts. TELK\u00c4MPER (ARC). \u2014 (DE) I would like to ask Mrs Lenz the name of the person who is listed in the resolution but who was here only two days ago. The resolution refers by name to someone for whom we already tabled an urgent motion in the European Par liament two years ago and from that earlier motion. . . PRESIDENT. \u2014 That is not a point of order. TRUPIA (COM). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, it is worrying to learn that when the death sentence is carried out in the United States, in most cases the persons concerned are those in the margins of society, the weak and the Blacks. In a sense Paula Cooper is the symbol of this situation because she represents the three faces of weakness: she is a minor, she is black and she is fem ale. Our resolution is therefore extremely important, and all the more so because it concerns a civilian and democratic country like the United States. It is parti cularly serious to find that in that country, as indeed it would be in a European country, the existence of such a barbarous practice as I consider the death penalty to be is still tolerated. The cases of Chile and Namibia are very different. There the human rights of the individual coincide with the right to freedom of an entire country and its peo ple. In such cases it is of course necessary but sufficient for us to call for the release of the prisoners and an end to the persecution of specific individuals. The list is bound to grow. We can and must do far more, we must propose practical measures. How often have we condemned Pinochet in this Assembly! Endlessly! Yet the situation is worsening there and even the Pope's visit to Chile did not improve it. Only a few days ago two anti-fascist and Communist leaders returned from exile and were taken into detention. How many more will there be? We must do more. As Mr Tridente said, we must call for the expulsion of political prisoners from Chile and we must organize a meeting of the democratic forces of opposition to the Chilean regime. That is one way to encourage unity. The same applies to Namibia, where horrendous crimes are committed against civilians and children. One representative of that country asked us yesterday to apply the sanctions against racist South Africa to the full. That is the only way to help the suffering peo ple of that country who fear nothing because, alas, they have nothing to lose, except the only thing they possess: apartheid. LACERDA DE QUEIROZ (LDR). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Portugal was one of the first countries in the world to abolish the death penalty \u2014 so long ago as the 19th century. We are therefore shocked at the idea that as we approach the 21st century civilized countries could have legislation permitting human life to be taken. What is even more shocking is that many of the social pressures and opi nions which tend to support such capital punishment are the very ones which, in the name of the right to life and respect for the individual, oppose, amongst other things, genetic research, even if it is pursued for the good of mankind, and are committed to banning vol untary abortion in those countries where it is allowed. This is, to say the least, a blatant contradiction and crass inconsistency. The European Parliament is called upon today to con sider a tragic problem \u2014 that of a young woman under sentence of death for a crime committed when she was 15 years old. It is claimed that there are doz ens of similar cases of minors languishing under sen tence of death in United States gaols. I am not about to launch into a condemnation of the United States, which is our friend and main ally, but, for the very reason that it is a friend, I am all the more inclined to say that such behaviour and such legislation are not consistent with modern times or with the image of a country which claims to be a champion of the indivi dual and respect for human rights. But how can this be reconciled with the death penalty, even worse with the death penalty applicable to minors? ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/249 Lacerda de Queiroz From this House, in pursuance of the motion for a resolution of which I am a co-signatory, I call upon the various States of the Union which still retain the death penalty to suspend all executions and to com\u00ad mute all such sentences, to repeal their legislation on capital punishment and meanwhile not to apply it to minors. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many ways in which a country can safeguard its image and its credibility, especially when some point of reference exists or is asserted. Clearly this will vary according to different parameters with different specific weights. In my opinion the United States would be doing them\u00ad selves a good turn in complying with our wishes, since they would be the beneficiaries. I am confident that things will turn out that way. RIPA DI MEANA, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, honourable Members, I am reply\u00ad ing to the two motions for a resolution addressed to the Commission on the death sentence passed on Paula Cooper. First of all, the news. As we have just heard, the judge, Mr Jack Crawford, who had presided over the trial of Paula Cooper and passed the death sentence, lost his life in an accident a few days ago. The Governor of the State of Indiana is therefore proceeding to appoint a new magistrate. We are waiting to hear who is cho- Moreover, on 11 May \u2014 that is, three days ago \u2014 the counsel for the defence of Paula Cooper, William Touchette, submitted a request for a retrial on the grounds of various inadequacies in the proceedings of the first trial. So at the moment we have a plea for mercy submitted to the Governor of the State of Indiana, an application for retrial and an appeal, which had already been deli\u00ad berated and approved by Judge Crawford, and which the new magistrate will probably confirm. The two resolutions, and all the speeches I have lis\u00ad tened to on them, reaffirm Parliament's frequently expressed opposition to the death penalty, an opinion shared by the great majority of the people of Europe and which received historic confirmation in this Chamber on 18 June 1981, because that was on the eve of the day when one Member State of the Com\u00ad munity decided to abolish capital punishment. Parlia\u00ad ment therefore regards the death sentence passed on minors as an even clearer violation of the international conventions and charters on the rights of the indivi\u00ad dual, as the text of the motion for a resolution by Mrs Cassanmagnago makes plain. The Commission is of course very sympathetic towards the concerns expressed by the honourable Members and shares their views on the death penalty and its infliction on minors. At the same time, the Commission regretfully finds that it does not have the power to intervene formally in the case in question. Nevertheless, Mr President, on 30 April, considering it my duty to act as interpreter of the vast movement of public opinion in the Member States of the Com\u00ad munity \u2014 a movement of opinion of which I was and still am fully aware \u2014 I wrote to Mr Robert Orr, Gov\u00ad ernor of Indiana, asking for the death sentence to be commuted in view of the prisoner's age \u2014 it is a mat\u00ad ter of record that the crime was committed at the age of 15 \u2014 and of the dreadfully violent conditions and degradation in her home life. That same day, 30 April, I received the United States Ambassador to the Communities, Mr Alfred Kingon, to whom I, as Commissioner to the People's Europe, expressed the deep anxiety of public opinion in our countries, asking him to inform the appropriate auth\u00ad orities in the State of Indiana that we hoped for an act of clemency. As I have already informed Governor Orr, I am pre\u00ad pared to describe to him in person the concern felt by public opinion in Europe, and, for the rest, I gave a positive reply, as did some Members of the European Parliament, to defence counsel William Touchette's proposal that citizens of the European Communities attend the next appeal hearings or the retrial hearings most recently requested by the defence, and to which I referred earlier, as observers.

        "No 2-352/250 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 VAN DEN HEUVEL (S). \u2014 (NL) MrPresident, there is another resolution on Chile. You definitely said that on human rights, in contrast to all other items, even a second resolution on the same subject may be put to the vote. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The point is this, that the other resolution on Chile is on exactly the same subject. PROUT (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I think your ruling is quite right in this sense that under human rights we effectively have several different subjects proposed to us by the human rights subcommittee every month. Some of the subjects have a number of motions for resolution of the same topic. Now you are correct to take the first resolution of a number of resolutions on the same topic unless there is a compromise resolution in which case all the resolutions under the same topic are merged. Now in this case there were two resolu\u00ad tions on Chile \u2014 you took the first one. That was per\u00ad fectly correct and you cannot be criticized for that. My question is why the same practice was not fol\u00ad lowed under Morocco, but that is now water under the bridge. SAKELLARIOU (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I insist that we vote on the next motion for a resolution by Mr Boesmans. That is, after all, the procedure you have introduced in this House. We were able to admire your French, and the fact that this resolution may now be in Dutch should not be an obstacle. PRESIDENT. \u2014 It is not a language problem. NORDMANN (LDR). \u2014 (FR) I think it would be useful to ask the Committee on the Rules of Proce\u00ad dure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to clarify this matter. I think that in the case of Mor\u00ad occo you have made a mistake, Mr President, for on human rights it is vital to make a distinction between several subjects, but it would be inconsistent with our Rules of Procedure to put a second resolution to the vote on each subject after having adopted a first one. (Applause) PRAG (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I had something to do with this text. Rule 48(6), subparagraph 4, is perfectly clear. It states: If a resolution is adopted, the other motions for resolutions on the same subject within a subject group shall not be put to the vote, save where the President decides otherwise. You are perfectly at liberty to do exactly as you please. That is what the Rule says. However, normally when motions for resolutions are on the same topic, even on human rights, they fall and are not voted on. You have not broken the Rules because you can decide other\u00ad wise. You did decide otherwise. We hope you will not again. But I suggest that we pass on to the next item. CINCIARI RODANO (COM). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I agree with Mr Prag. The Rules do not say that the adoption of one resolution automatically precludes the others, they say that it is up to the President to decide. He has decided to put two resolutions on Morocco to the vote. At this point it would therefore seem to me that for the sake of consistency we should also vote on two resolutions on Chile, for otherwise there would be no logic behind the first decision. It is your right to decide, you have given us one interpretation, and we ask you to adhere to the spirit of that interpretation in this case too, which is identical to the preceding one. GUERMEUR (RDE). \u2014 (FR) I thank Mr Prout, who is the expert here, for bringing this matter up. He is very familiar with it, since it is he who presented the draft rule. What I wanted to say, Mr President, is that this rule is quite comprehensible insofar as it avoids the contrad\u00ad ictions that used to arise in Parliament under the old rule. But provided the proposed resolutions are not con\u00ad tradictory and concern, if not different subjects, at least different themes and cases, it is quite feasible to vote separately on the different resolutions, especially since, as Mrs Cinciari Rodano said, you, Mr Presi\u00ad dent, have sovereign power to decide whether to put only one or several resolutions to the vote. So on the subject which will be coming up soon, South Africa, I hope all the resolutions will be put to the vote separately, for there is no possibility of contradiction between them. PRESIDENT. \u2014 We could continue all night on this particular topic. I recognize the validity of what some Members have said to the effect that there has been some inconsistency. If there was inconsistency on my part in accepting two motions for resolutions on the same topic earlier on, then I made a mistake. But I am convinced by the arguments advanced that in this particular section one ought not to have two motions for resolutions on exactly the same topic. Therefore, I must stick by my earlier decision. I should not com\u00ad pound one error by making another. Therefore, I rule that I should not take a vote on that particular motion for a resolution.

(Parliament adopted resolution Doc. \u0392 2-366/87) Trade and economic problems PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: \u2014 Doc. B 2-33C/87, by Mr Rogalla and others, on the recent decisions of the Danish and Irish Governments concerning reductions in personal franchise amounts for their citizens crossing Community borders and other restrictions on their rights; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2-348/87, by Mrs Maij-Weggen and others, on the introduction in the US of punitive levies on Japanese electronic goods and the implication thereof for the European electronics industry and employment therein; \u2014 Doc. \u0392 2-365/87, by Mr Zahorka and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the new US trade law of 30 April 1987 and the Gephardt amendment. ROGALLA (S). \u2014 (DE) MrPresident, honourable Members, 'it is only at night that Friedland's stars can shine', as Schiller wrote in 'Wallenstein's Death'. At this moment I am thinking of the situation of the citi\u00ad zens of the Community: it is only at night that their concerns are discussed! But, as you can see, we stay awake at night too and want to prevent European cooperation, which so far has brought little benefit to the individual, from being further restricted. Denmark and Ireland have done that, with effect from early April 1987, in the night, so to speak. Even the German Bildzeitung, which is not a pro-European paper, den\u00ad ounced this on its title page in the first report on it. So today we want to address a clear warning to the gov\u00ad ernments concerned from the European Parliament. Contrary to a Community regulation, these govern\u00ad ments reduced the personal duty-free amounts over\u00ad night, Denmark from nearly DM 300 to about DM 70. They also restricted them to specific situa\u00ad tions, such as a minimum duration of stay in the neighbouring country. This encouraged arbitrary act\u00ad ion by officialdom and excessive controls. Where approximation between nations is called for, they demarcate and create borders; we are seeing more searches of bags and car boots again. As I said, it is not a question here of commercial deliveries which threa\u00ad ten to distort competition but of private consumption, of goods on which the full duty has already been paid. What Danish citizen with an average income of about DM 2 000 a month would buy fridges in Flensburg for fun, or beer that goes sour, or is he perhaps intending to pour it into the Flensburg fjords from Denmark? These measures are contrary to Community law and they are cynical. There are no rational grounds for them. They take the tiny glimpse of sky and the small privileges away from people and it is essential that the Danish Government revokes this measure without delay. That is what we, the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, whom I represent here, call for in this motion for a resolution. I personally am sad have to say this to my Danish friends of all people: your attitude has deeply disappointed me. The Heads of State and Government have taken cer\u00ad tain decisions. These decisions have been disregarded. We can only regard all this as mere empty words! When the Minister of Finance announces a shortfall of revenue, Prime Ministers evidently go weak at the knees and forget the citizens. We want no more of that, which is the reason for this warning at such a late hour. MAIJ-WEGGEN (PPE). \u2014 (NL) MrPresident, in the resolution which I should like to introduce here, and which has a completely different content from Mr Rogalla's, we wish to express our serious concern about the aggressive selling of electronic equipment from Japan in the United States and Europe. The United States has recently decided to place a penal levy on Japanese semi-conductor products. I do not need to explain that measure here, as I think it is generally known. However, I should like to speak about the consequ\u00ad ences, as they may be very dangerous for the Euro\u00ad pean electronics industry. I live myself in a district in which this electronics industry provides much impor\u00ad tant employment and I can tell you that people are very concerned about this matter. If Japan, as a result of the American boycott, is to transfer its pattern of trade in the field of semi-conductor products to Europe, the consequences may be disastrous for employment \u2014 in the district in which I live, for example, amongst others. And I may perhaps demon\u00ad strate with hard facts that this is not a figment of the imagination. For some time past there has been a sort of American import quota on Japanese cars and since the beginning of this year the export of Japanese cars to Europe has increased by 32%. Thus here too there has been a transfer of a pattern of trade. If something of that kind happens with electronic products, there ",
        "No 2-352/252 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 Maij-Weggen will be dire consequences for Europe and we therefore ask the Commission what it will do in that case. The Japanese surplus in its trade balance with the EEC last year amounted to 16 thousand million. That is really enough. We should like to ask the Commission to adopt measures, not in a protectionist sense, there must be fair consultation, but something must be done. That is what we should like to stress in this resolution. ZAHORKA (PPE). \u2014 (DE) MrPresident, I am speaking on the part of the motion for a resolution referred to by Mrs Maij-Weggen that concerns the new US trade law \u2014 adopted by the House of Repre sentatives in its first draft on 30 April \u2014 and in partic ular on a provision called the Gephardt amendment. This is not being followed with enough attention here in Europe, and none of us seems to realise what the Commission's trade politicians and experts already suspect, namely, that it could have disastrous conse quences for the Community. This provision lays down that any state which exceeds certain surpluses in its trade with the USA must reduce these by 10% annually or else face sanctions in the form of import quotas and punitive import levies. Sometimes there are trade surpluses, sometimes not! How can we calculate trade with the USA, given the fluctuations in the dollar we have seen in the past eight years? That is the question! The European Community is affected, but the law is aimed at Japan and only a few countries within the EEC are affected. That is why Community solidarity is also necessary because it is the EC institutions that have the power to negotiate, even in the case of retal iatory measures. Such laws are increasingly often motivated by domestic policy considerations on all sides in the USA, which I regret. On the other hand I welcome the fact that the US Government intends to veto this law and I would like to call on the members of the Senate and House of Representatives to deal so plainly with this law \u2014 which still has a few readings to go \u2014 as to ensure that it does not endanger the Uruguay Round in Geneva. Some members of Congress have said that this law, like the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act, reflects a protec tionist trend which many people regard as responsible for the worldwide depression. So I ask you to support our motion for a resolution. FICH (S). \u2014 (DA) Mr President, I rise to speak not on behalf of the Socialist Group but on my own behalf. There are objective reasons for restrictions on the free exchange of goods at certain frontiers in the EEC. In Denmark social welfare is founded on a high level of provision, funded by taxes and duties. In other countries, including West Germany, the situation is different; use is made of sources such as employers' contributions. But we apply a system of taxes and duties, which enjoys the support of the population. For countries which have more or less the same system of taxes and duties, there is no problem in undertaking total harmonization, thus easing frontier crossings, and of course we support that. But for Denmark the situation is different. We have a system of taxes and duties which is very different to that applied in West Germany, and that means of course that problems will remain for movements across frontiers. Clearly we could harmonize the two systems completely, but that would mean that we also have to harmonize the health and social services systems. That in turn would mean removing the right of individual populations to organ ize their social system the way they want it. It would mean, for example, that we in Denmark would not be able to establish a welfare society if they did not do so at the same time in West Germany too. I reject such a course. The motion for a resolution says that we demonstrate a total disregard for European citizens' needs and wishes. I should like to say that the only people affected are Danes, and the journeys in question are not even normal journeys but exclusively trips for spe culative purposes. I must emphasize that the decision has the near-unanimous support of the Folketing, which is a reflection of the wishes of the Danish peo ple. I will conclude by saying that I defend the need for regulation measures at certain frontiers \u2014 it is perhaps surprising that I should be the one to defend them; it should have been my Danish Concervative colleagues, since it was a Conservative Danish minister who introduced these measures. But I defend them never theless, and I defend the principle that there is a need for regulation at certain frontiers. I shall therefore vote against Mr Rogalla's motion for a resolution. McCARTIN (PPE). \u2014 Mr President, it is ironic that at this time of night we should be getting down to dis cussing problems in the border areas of Ireland and Denmark. I know that in my constituency in Ireland it is at this time of night that the ordinary citizens get busy to get around the laws that parliaments such as ours make to prevent them from doing what they regard as their rightful business. Saint Thomas More of England said many years ago that you can knock down in the interests of expe diency one after another of the laws we make; but when you have done that, nobody will be able to stand upright in the wind that will blow. I regard the laws of the European Community as just as important a part of our democracy as the laws of our Member States. I think it is regrettable that governments break these laws without carrying out the consultations open to them to carry out. I believe that in Ireland's case there was a good case to be made and that that means should have been exploited first. ",
        "14.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/253 McCartin In Ireland we have high public spending. We pay social welfare 30% higher than in Britain. On educa tion we spend a higher percentage of GDP than any country in the world except Canada, and housing is probably better than in any other country in the world with housing lists practically abolished in urban areas. The situation is different in Northern Ireland where you have very high public spending but relatively low taxation because funds are transferred from other parts of Britain. The other side of the coin in the Republic of Ireland is that public generosity leads to higher taxation; we have penal rates of tax, excise duties and, of course, income tax. The result is very slow economic growth and high unemployment. Traders in the border areas have been hit by those problems and by the arrival of large supermarkets on both sides of the border. These problems have been aggravated by curreny fluctuations and the fact that Britain is not part of the EMS. In recent times there has been as much as 15% more divergence between the two currencies than I believe there ought to be. One of the good effects of this is that people in the border areas on a similar income enjoyed a higher standard of living than their counterparts further south. However, the traders kicked up hell in plain speaking and at the last election the government suf fered the backlash. Our Government was forced to take some action to solve the problem. Of course, the action is only temporary and one solution to it is lower taxation. We have serious financial problems in Ire land \u2014 a high deficit and massive debts \u2014 and we will need the forbearance, patience and understanding of this Community for some time to come. PATTERSON (ED). \u2014 Mr President, Mr Rogalla, I think, began this debate by quoting Schiller and earlier Mr van Aerssen likened Europe to a sleeping princess. If I can be equally poetic, I would liken Europe to a sky filled with dark clouds, clouds of bureaucracy and frontier controls, which have to be blown away by 1992. The travellers' duty paid allowances are a patch of blue sky for European citizens in this picture. Notice I say 'duty paid'. People who cross frontiers and buy goods are not evading tax, they are paying tax in the country in which they are purchasing. It is a valuable right for all our citizens. One should not want to criti cize the Danish and Irish Governments too much. We recognize their difficulties. For example, I entirely accept Mr McCartin's strictures. Our group has been in favour of sterling being in the EMS for a very long time now and I except we shall be very soon. But in the last resort, both these countries must make up their minds whether they wish to be in a real common mar ket or not with no barriers and no tax frontiers. They have already both had derogations on these matters for many years. The whole idea of controlling the time in which citizens have to be out of their countries leads to the collection of hotel bills to prove you have been outside and to all kinds of fraud and bureaucratic controls. We know what the root cause is. The fact is that the Danish VAT is 23%, the Irish is 23% and the Community average is 16%. Sooner or later we are going to have to have fiscal approximation. I now turn to the Commission because this is the important point about this debate. What is the Com mission going to do about this kind of thing? We have had innumerable documents; pages and pages have been written about a citizens' Europe, about enlarging the rights of citizens who cross frontiers. We have been told that these allowances will be eventually enlarged to infinity and here we have an example of going in exactly the opposite direction. I ask the Com mission: what are they going to do to defend the documents that they have produced on a citizens' Europe? MAHER (LDR). \u2014 Mr President, Mr McCartin has covered the subject very adequately. I cannot defend the action taken by the Irish Government. I am cer tainly not here to defend the position of the Danish Government. But if these things are happening, and they are \u2014 everybody can see what is going on \u2014 there is a reason for them. Mr McCartin has touched on some of those reasons. In the case of Ireland we are in very considerable economic difficulty and have a high international debt. Part of that is our own fault and I do not think we can excuse ourselves by claiming that somebody else has caused it. But it is also true, nevertheless, that Ireland joined the European Community from a relatively weak position. While it is true that the agricultural policy has benefited the Irish economy very considera bly, where industry, that was relatively weak and developing when we joined the European Community, is concerned we have experienced very considerable difficulties, particularly in the case of traditional industries. Therefore, it would be wrong to say that membership of the European Community has been a total blessing. It has created problems also for us and I think that must be understood by the other stronger members of the European Community. If we had been more devel oped when we joined, perhaps we would not have the problems that we are confronted with today. I am not defending the position adopted by the Irish Govern ment in imposing these strictures, because I believe very strongly in a free and united Europe without bar riers. On the other hand, a lot of unseen barriers, non-tariff barriers, still exist between member coun tries, even between strong countries of the European Community. It is extremely difficult to do away with them. In fact, they are not even declining, Commis sioner. They are on the increase in spite of everything that has been said. So, do not look at the position of Ireland and Den mark in isolation. At least what is being done in this ",
        "No 2-352/254 Debates of the European Parliament 14.5.87 Maher particular case is completely transparent. In many other cases these transgressions cannot be seen. I would like the whole situation to be tackled head on. As Mr McCartin rightly said, it would, I think, be a good beginning and a good example if the countries that have not yet seen their way to joining the EMS and moving towards monetary union were to do so right away. I think that would be a good example to the rest of the countries, because that is the real way to achieve a united Europe. I often make the point that if every state of the United States of America had a dif ferent currency, it would not be the powerful econo mic institution it is today. I would suggest, Commissioner, that you might con sult with the Irish Government and see what could be done to improve the general economic situation, thereby making measures of this kind unnecessary. FITZGERALD (RDE). \u2014 Mr President, I vehe mently oppose the motion condemning the Irish Government for endeavouring to close a loophole that has caused economic, social and business devastation, especially in the northern half of the Republic, over the last few years. This is not an ordinary frontier situation. Nor is it the normal type of business transaction across frontiers. The border within my country, Ireland, Mr Rogalla, is an artificial one with a lot of daily crossings and con tacts both back and forth. In 1986 alone there were 3.6 million trips across the border. This represents a considerable increase on previous statistics available. Our Revenue Commissioners estimate that in 1986 alone \u00a3 300 million worth of goods crossed the border into the Member State that I represent. This is equiva lent to \u00a3 300 per person employed in my country and is more than three-quarters of a million pounds per day. In a small country such as Ireland the loss of business has been devastating to the economy and could not be sustained. The type of business that this had generated involved coachloads of people from all over Ireland travelling north across the border on day trips. These were purely shopping expeditions to bring in duty free goods. To give an indication of the seriousness of the situation and the extent to which it has deflected the normal course of trade, on Easter Saturday 1986 a total of 70 coaches made cross-border trips. On Easter Saturday 1987 the number of such shopping expedi tions was reduced to two coaches \u2014 that was after the introduction of this safeguard. The only restriction imposed by our Minister for Finance has been that a person must be out of the country for 48 hours before being entitled to normal duty free allowances. I fully appreciate that the major ity of the signatories to this resolution are completely unfamiliar with the real problem. I am extremely disappointed that two Irish Members of the European Parliament should have signed this resolution and that they are actively supporting this exploitation of the ordinary business people of our Community. No amendment or group of amendments to this resolution can alter that position. CHRISTENSEN (ARC). \u2014 (DA) MrPresident, a Danish Conservative colleague is one of the co-authors of this motion for a resolution, directed against Denmark, the Folketing and the government of her fellow party member, the Danish Minister for Fiscal Affairs. She and the other proponents of the motion threaten us with the Commission and the European Court of Justice because we venture to defend our independent tax and redistribution policy against being undermined by the EEC. The motion calls the Danish measures to restrict duty-free imports a total disregard for European citizens' needs and wishes. As though there were an insatiable need among the Community's citizens for duty-free imports of video recorders and colour TV sets. What is con sistent with the needs of the Danish people is the maintenance of a social security system based on social solidarity. That will not be possible if we are to have EEC harmonization of our indirect taxes forced on us. TAYLOR (ED). \u2014 Mr President, the Irish Republic has a favourable trade balance with Northern Ireland and, therefore, its decision to impose restrictions on the border was most hurtful to Northern Ireland, which is one of the poorer regions in the EEC. Our group took the initiative last month to raise this matter. We were very pleased that the Commission acted immediately, following the promise by Commis sioner Clinton Davis that it would be treated as a mat ter of urgency. The Commission has served notice on the Dublin Government to respond within four weeks. Later this month the Irish will be voting on the Single European Act. Yesterday President Delors made it clear that no matter what they vote, the SEA is here to stay and they have to live with it. Irrespective of the present hiccough that we have on this border at the moment on trading matters, it is true that within five years the Single European Act will expedite the inter nal market within the European Community. When that happens, no trade barriers can be erected by Dub lin on the Irish border and we in Northern Ireland will welcome hundreds of thousands of people from the South of Ireland to purchase cheaper goods in North ern Ireland. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Under Rule 86 I propose that the debate be closed. We have heard speakers from every group, apart from the Communist Group because Mr Wurtz was not present. In order to allow the Commissioner to reply and the vote to be taken I pro pose that we close the debate. ",
        "14.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/255 CASSIDY (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I am most emphati\u00ad cally against the proposal. I have been sitting here all night listening to other people rabbiting on. You with your endless points of order trying to get our proce\u00ad dures sorted out in the vote and so on. We could have completed this debate and heard my carefully pre\u00ad pared speech responding to the inaccuracies in other people's speeches. All of this could have taken place, Mr President, if you had conducted the procedures with greater despatch. Therefore, I speak strongly against your proposal. (Mixed reactions) (Parliament agreed to the President's proposal) MATUTES, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regards the motion for a resolution No 62-330/87 tabled by Mr Rogalla, Mr Patterson and others, the Commis\u00ad sion was in fact informed by the Republic of Ireland on 31 March last and by the Kingdom of Denmark on 7 April last of the new measures adopted by those States concerning duty-free allowances for travellers. These measures, as Members have said, by putting a tremendously restrictive interpretation on the concept of traveller, which the Commission considers totally improper, considerably reduce or even wipe out entirely duty-free allowances as such. These measures thus seriously affect the Community's long-standing efforts to guarantee the free movement of persons within its territory. The Commission therefore in both cases immediately set in motion the procedure under Article 169. of the EEC Treaty for failure to fulfil obligations. And although the consultations advocated by Mr Maher are to take place, no doubt, the Commission is delighted with this Parliament's resolution for urgency and will do whatever is necessary to see that the pro\u00ad cedures already in train are energetically pursued. As regards the adoption of a position on Mrs Maij- Weggen's motion for a resolution on the American reprisals against Japanese goods, the Commission fully shares Parliament's fears as to the negative effects which the measures adopted by the United States on 17 May might entail. The Commission has already called the attention of the Japanese authorities to this problem in the course of various contacts, in particular in view of the four- power meeting held in Japan. Mr Commissioner De Clerq informed the then Japanese Minister Mr del Miti that the Community would not allow Japanese exports to the United States market to be diverted to the Community market. The Commission therefore took two initiatives: on 4 May it decided to take preliminary measures for Community monitoring of imports of products origin\u00ad ating in Japan. This will at least provide us with the most rapid information on trends in such imports. Moreover, as Parliament suggests, the Commission has come to the conclusion that if such products were diverted as feared, it would be useful for the Com\u00ad munity to be in a position to take immediate steps before importation which would make it possible to safeguard its legitimate interests. The Commission has therefore submitted a proposal for a regulation to the Council in case such imports from Japan should exceed given thresholds, in which case a 100% duty would be applied. The Council will have to decide on 25 May, we hope favourably, on this Commission pro\u00ad posal. As Parliament wished, the Commission has acted swiftly and firmly in this matter. We intend, I can assure you, to continue in this direction. (Applause) PRESIDENT. \u2014 The joint debate is closed. (Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution Doc. \u0392 2-330/87) MAIJ-WEGGEN (PPE). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, it is for you to decide to make a declaration under the Rules of Procedure, that the other motions for resolu\u00ad tions lapse, but I must tell you that the subject of that resolution is quite different from Mr Rogalla's. That one was about the internal market and this one is about external relations. I ask you to allow the vote to be taken on this resolution. I have the impression too that other groups would like to see that. WELSH (ED). \u2014 MrPresident, I have a lot of sym\u00ad pathy with Mrs Maij-Weggen's point. However, I think you have to stand by your original ruling. If I may say so, you are put in this embarrassing position because the President, when selecting the items for debate, put totally disparate items in the same topic. I suggest, Mr President, that you might make this point in the Bureau that the urgency procedure will not work unless similar topics covering the same subject matter are put in one heading. That is why Mrs Maij- Weggen finds herself in this embarrassing position. PRESIDENT. \u2014 I agree with your point of view, Mr Welsh, it is an invidious situation and I think the group chairmen must consider it carefully. 1 (The sitting was closed at 12.05 a.m.) Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes.

I pointed out to the Chair, your colleague Mr Dankert, that that was an unacceptable procedure for those who had not yet spoken. If we first let the rapporteur and then the Commissioner speak and then interrupt the debate, there is naturally not much point left for subsequent speakers. If then the officiating President promises that we shall carry on on the following morning as the first subject and it then appears that there is not only a series of votes but also a series of other reports coming up for discussion first, it gradually begins to be worse than unaccepta ble. In my view we are not applying the proper method ",

It would be better to transfer the whole debate to a later date when it is known that a debate on a report cannot be concluded. You can understand, Mr Presi dent, that for those who have not yet been called to speak in a debate, once the rapporteur and the Com mission have already replied, it is like having mustard after the meal. I should therefore like to make a mild protest. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Be grateful, Mr Wijsenbeek, that you got some mustard, some merely get presented with the bill. The members of the Commission and Ministers can of course, under the Rules of Proce dure, speak at any time. The matter to which you are referring is Item 8 on today's agenda. But we first have to deal with all the urgencies, because this was the decision we took. You can ask for the matter to be referred back to committee when the item is called. ANASTASSOPOULOS (PPE), chairman of the Com mittee on Transport. \u2014 (GR) When we were discussing this yesterday in the House with Mr Danken, he stated that the debate would be continued today before the other reports were taken. Therefore, I do not understand why Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso's report has been allocated this place on today's agenda. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Thank you Mr Arndt. That will be done. We certainly chose the zero option yesterday evening. HERMAN (PPE). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the point raised by Mr Arndt has already been discussed in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure which gave a very clear interpretation which I would be happy to repeat for him. When it is a question of resolutions dealing with the same topic . . . PRESIDENT. \u2014 Thank you, Mr Herman, but we do not wish to go into the question in detail now. We will refer it to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and ask them to deliver an opinion. ANASTASSOPOULOS (PPE), chairman of the Com mittee on Transport. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I listened to what you said, but I would like to ask you to change the agenda in line with the decision taken yes terday by Mr Dankert. We did decide that the topics for urgent debate should be taken first; that is what we have always done. However, since Mr Dankert and the House decided yesterday evening that the debate on the Cabez\u00f3n Alonso report would be taken first, it should be the first item. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Mr Anastassopoulos, the agenda is in order because all the items before the reports are the urgencies which were included in the agenda by decision of Parliament. PRESIDENT. \u2014 That is not possible, Mr Anastasso poulos, because when we adopted the urgencies, it was decided that they would be the first item on Friday's agenda. ARNDT (S). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, a point arose during the debate on the topical and urgent debates yesterday evening which requires clarification under the Rules of Procedure. I did not insist on this yester day, but I should like to ask you today to refer this question to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. There were several motions for resolutions tabled under the first heading. In accordance with the Rules of Procedure a request was made in relation to the first vote to establish whether a quorum existed. The chair at that time then said that the question of a quo rum had been established for all the motions for reso lutions under this item. I did not believe this was cor rect but I did not make an issue of it because I assumed that the person who asked for the quorum to be established would have repeated his request any way. Nevertheless, I believe that my view is correct. For example: if five motions for resolutions are tabled on human rights and it is established that there is not a quorum in relation to the first motion, this does not mean that this applies automatically to all the other motions. BANOTTI (PPE). \u2014 Mr President, on a point of order. I presume we are now discussing the agenda for today. I would like to inform you that Item No 89 will not be my report on behalf of the Committee on the Environment. I shall be explaining to the House why when we begin to discuss the Council urgencies at the beginning of the agenda. MEDINA ORTEGA (S). \u2014 (ES) Mr President, I not ice that Item 92 on the agenda is the Commission's proposal to the Council (COM(87) 72 final Doc. C 2-35/87) on the arrangements applied to the Canary Islands. It was agreed that this subject would be debated by urgent procedure but I see it has been put after other reports. Could we please have a vote, Mr President, after the procedures without report, that is after item 87, rather than waiting until after other items have been discussed, in which case the speakers due to speak on this item would forego their right to speak? I would therefore ask you to investigate this matter so that the position is clear in future. PRESIDENT. \u2014 I am afraid that is not possible, Mr Medina; the order is fixed because of the urgencies. ",

Since the President only needs to refer a rule matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verifica tion of Credentials and Immunities if it is unclear, in my view such a referral would be a waste of your time, the House's time and the committee's time. The rule is clear. All you have to do is to make a ruling and that should be an end of the matter. PRESIDENT. \u2014 That is not for me to decide, because I was not in the chair yesterday. Mr Arndt has asked for an opinion from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. If it was as clear as you say, these quer ies would not have arisen.

A 2-27/87) by Mrs Nielsen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on small and medium-sized undertaking and craft industries Explanation of vote CHRISTENSEN (ARC), in writing. \u2014 (DA) The Member responsible for this report calls herself a lib eral. One cannot be a liberal in the ideological sense of the word and introduce a mass of direct and indirect subsidies to small and medium-sized undertakings, paid for by Community taxpayers. It is worth noting that there is no clear definition of the concept 'small and medium-sized undertaking'. The report offers nothing by way of clarification. The call for harmonization of VAT and direct taxation comes as no surprise except, possibly, to the taxation and excise Minister in the government of which Mrs Tove Nielsen's party is a member. We shall naturally be voting against this 'opus'. LACERDA DE QUEIROZ (LDR), in writing. \u2014 (PT) In a society in which market forces and hence free competition linked to free initiative apply, as in the social model governing the Europe of the Twelve, small- and medium-sized undertakings assume a very special, even a fundamental, r\u00f4le. In conjunction with the co-operative model they could provide a tonic with a greater social emphasis, which for many people who want to see a fairer society \u2014 and naturally I am one such person, since it is the philosophy of the Portuguese Social Democratic Party which I represent here, \u2014 could play a decisive r\u00f4le: the transformation of a purely market economy into a social market econ omy. A distributive policy is of course essential, chiefly by means of tax mechanisms, but it would not be out of place for this policy to begin at the level of produc tion and for the second to be cumulative upon the first. Given that the driving force behind economic development must necessarily be private initiative and that without economic development there can be no wealth and therefore no means for providing a high quality of life, small- and medium-sized undertakings, co-operatives and craft industries must be encouraged. This must be done firstly as a means of fighting unem ployment, which the peripheral regions and the indus trial areas in decline feel particularly keenly. Secondly because they can play an important r\u00f4le in the econo mic revival of the Community by virtue of their spirit of competitiveness, their energy, their greater flexibil ity and ability to adapt themselves to market fluctua tions, their greater readiness for the introduction of new technologies and finally by virtue of their capacity for innovation and revitalization of the fabric of the economy. Thirdly because of the special human and social relationships normally typical of labour relations ",

They are sometimes also the birthplace of new experiments in the organization, method and conditions of work, which are often suitable for trans fer and application to similar firms. With the approach of 1992, the year of the introduction of the great internal market, these initiatives should be encour aged. We should also emphasize their potential for occupational training in particular for young people, for whom the adoption of means for the acquisition of 'know-how' will be vital. The report we are debating, which was drawn up by a member of my political group, expertly covers such concepts and this type of analysis. We therefore agree with the diagnosis and with the treatment prescribed: that the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) and the Social Fund should be provided with budgetary headings for such initiatives. The European Investment Bank should be more actively involved in this sector and with larger resources. The so-called local employment initiatives should also be brought in with an increased allocation of funds since they aim at galvanizing local initiatives and could achieve much more, particularly as regards craft industries. In a matter as important as this there are many things to be said, but time will not allow. There are many points to be clarified, such as the exact definition of the SMU. Are we to decide by the number of employ ees, or turnover, or both? I should like in conclusion to say that the principle of 'small is beautiful' still holds true and that I support the matter under consid eration. (Parliament adopted the resolution) 2. Products which endanger the health or safety of consumers PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. A 2-64/87) by Mr Collins, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (COM(86) 499 final \u2014 Doc. C 2-109/86) for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning products which, appearing to be other than they are, endanger the health or safety of consumers. COLLINS (S), rapporteur. \u2014 Mr President, this report deals with a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning products which, appearing to be other than they are, endanger the health and safety of consumers. I must say when I first saw the title I thought it was a reference to some of my colleagues on the benches opposite who pretend to be in favour of environment policy when in fact they are not. However, I soon realized that this is in fact a very important consumer document which examines the problems created by, for example, products like eras ers which are made to look like sweets. Children swal low them and suffer the awful consequences. So the Commission, quite rightly, is trying to outlaw such products and to set up a system whereby they can be withdrawn from the market. However, much as I think the Commission's inten tions are honourable and, indeed, more than honoura ble in this case, I think they have to go a great deal further. When you examine the proposal you see very quickly that it is a special case of a very general prob lem, the problem of products on the market which are dangerous. Regrettably this is all too common. If we do indeed push forward towards the completion of an internal market by 1992 it would be very bad indeed, in the view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, if we merely created an open and free market in goods that were unsafe. It is all very well to have goods freely available in all twelve Member States but if that freedom is merely a freedom to injure consumers, particularly when those consumers may well be children, then it is no freedom at all and we really have to guard against it. So the resolution attached to the Commission proposal \u2014 the resolution agreed by the committee \u2014 suggests to the Commission that what we really want in the Community is an obligation on the part of traders to deal only in safe goods. This approach is favoured in France and is gaining greater favour in the United Kingdom, certainly among trading standards officers and other people who are responsible for seeing that goods do not injure consumers and that they are indeed what they are intended to be. I realize, of course that the Commission has good intentions in this direction and I also realize \u2014 and we say this in the resolution \u2014 that they intend to bring forward proposals for legislation later this year. Since they say later this year, knowing the Commission, per haps it will be next year! But our aim is to give them the political impetus to do this. It has not escaped Par liament's attention, and certainly not the attention of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, that in the field of con sumer protection the Commission has been somewhat lacking in drive in recent years. We are determined to change that and to give them the political impetus necessary to bring forward legislation in this area quickly. I only hope that when they do it will be looked upon favourably in the Member States. As I said earlier, there is very little point in producing a free and open market if all we do is produce a free and ",
        "No 2-352/260 Debates of the European Parliament 15.5. 87 Collins open market in shoddy and dangerous goods. That gets us nowhere at all. We need protection and that is what this resolution is about. SCHLEICHER (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I say on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party that the Commission's proposed directive can only be welcome to consumers. The figures recently published by the Commission on accidents in the home highlight once again how important all measures are which can help prevent accidents of this kind. This problem affects in particular categories of consu mers who are already at a disadvantage, such as chil dren, the elderly or the illiterate, of which latter cate gory there are unfortunately a large number in the European Community. Each year in the Member States of the European Community, 20 000 children and young people die in accidents in the home. 20 mil lion people under the age of 18 are injured so severely either at home or in leisure activities that they require hospital treatment. The main types of accident encountered in the home and during leisure time are poisoning, burns, falls or drowning. The products with which this draft directive deals are a contributing factor in these appalling accident statis tics. It is mainly a question of products which look, taste or smell like food but are in reality something quite different such as erasers designed to look like strawberries. There are also products that could be confused with food or drink such as shampoos or bub ble bath solutions packaged in such a way as to resem ble champagne or some other popular drink. There are also products which are packaged or presented in such a way that their appearance does not correspond to the actual content or function. Our group gives its full, wholehearted backing to the Commission proposal to ban products which can mis lead consumers if they contain dangerous substances. They must at least be labelled so clearly that there is no possibility of confusion for inexperienced readers or consumers in a hurry. My group does, however, have serious misgivings about the procedure which the Commission proposes. In order to implement this directive, the Commission proposes setting up its own information system. The Council of Ministers has, however, already decided with support from Parliament to set up an information system on accidents involving consumer goods and work has begun on this. We do not see why this direc tive cannot be implemented using the information sys tem which currently exists. The representative from the Commission put forward the argument to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection that the new information system would be more comprehensive and detailed. But why, we ask, can the existing information system not be developed accordingly? Why do we need a second? Particularly given that finances are so limited in the field of consumer protection, we should use them as efficiently as possible and not create unneces sary bureaucratic structures. A certain dilemma will arise anyway in the implemen tation of the directive. On the one hand it is necessary in the interests of protecting the public that the goods which fall under the draft directive should be immediately and completely removed from the mar ket, particularly when they contain dangerous subst ances. On the other hand, such removal from the market is a drastic sanction which should not really be imposed until all those involved have been thoroughly con sulted. But dangerous substances mean that a swift reaction is needed. As a result the wrong decisions are bound to occur from time to time and we therefore believe it is particularly important when this directive is being implemented that every possible provision should be made to correct mistaken decisions when they occur. I therefore support the proposal and ask you to vote for the amendments relating to these points. I should also like to congratulate Mr Collins on his work. MATUTES, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank you on behalf of the Commission for agreeing to deal urgently with this proposal for a directive on dangerous imitations in consumer goods. The Commission attaches great importance to this proposal since it regards it as a practical example of Community action in the field of product safety and consumer protection. This proposal for a directive, as Mr Collins and Mrs Schleicher have pointed out, has its origins in the problem of the famous erasers made to look like sweets, which came to light in 1984. Later this propo sal was extended to other dangerous imitations of con sumer products. National measures have certainly been adopted to ban this type of product but the scope and content of these measures differ and in some Member States no measures have been adopted at all. Thus it seems essential for us to have in the future an instrument of Community scope to enable us to take swift and co-ordinated action whenever such a prob lem arises. Such an instrument as we are considering here seems essential therefore both from the point of view of the internal market \u2014 as Mr Collins men tioned \u2014 and for the protection of potential consu mers or users of such products. ",
        "15.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/261 Matutes The Commission therefore thinks that we need a fairly extensive definition of the sphere of application of the directive so that we can begin right away to take co-ordinated action against any dangerous imitations which might appear on the European market. The Commission is determined that this field of application must include imitations of any foodstuffs. The Commission suggests that dangerous imitations should be withdrawn from the market and steps should be taken to prevent their manufacture or sale, their import or their export. Finally the Commission considers that, as regards the internal market, we simply must have a similar mechanism at Community level for evaluating prac tically and accurately the national measures for the banning and withdrawal of these dangerous imitations. In a Europe where goods are circulating ever more freely it is not enough simply to exchange information on the serious and immediate dangers presented by certain consumer goods. The Commission's proposal is therefore aimed not only at achieving an exchange of views on the measures adopted by each of the Member States in response to the directive, but is intended to enable the Commission to make an imme diate assessment of these measures and to decide whether the measures are well founded or on the other hand insufficiently justified. The Commission is confident that the Parliament will be able to support this proposal in its entirety and, in particular, the definition of a field of application and the implementation of this Community mechanism for the assessment of national measures for banning or withdrawing such products. The Commission is extremely interested in the con cern voiced by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy about the need to avoid having too many legal provisions within the Community and to cut administrative costs. Personally 1 have a great deal of sympathy with this request, but at the same time the Commission would like to draw attention to the differences between the present pro posal for a directive and the Council Decision of 2 March 1984, which is known to you, for the setting up of a Community system for the rapid exchange of information. The 1984 decision provides for the setting up of a sim ple information system, and that system has certainly proved useful. But it has also \u2014 and here I wish to make this point to Mrs Schleicher \u2014 shown its limita tions when it comes to following up information with action. The present proposal for a directive did not therefore consider the possibility of having recourse in practice to the Advisory Committee set up by that decision. In any event the Commission will certainly try to avoid any unnecessary repetition both as regards evaluation meetings and notifications, which is why the proposal suggests that a single notification should be sufficient. As regards the invitations by means of which the Com mission plays an active r\u00f4le and which are presented by the Committee on the Environment, I am able to inform you that the Commission has just prepared two communications which will shortly be sent to Parlia ment. One is a communication on the Community child safety information and awareness campaign due to begin in 1988, and the other is on consumer safety with regard to consumer products. The Commission is aware how important progress in type-approval is to consumers. At the beginning of next month the Commission is organizing a sympos ium which will be on type-approval for such products and which will be attended by experts on the subject. As regards the request for information on accidents due to consumer products, the Community system for gathering statistics on accidents in the home and during leisure pursuits provides figures broken down by country, which the Commission thinks might con veniently be used. Finally the Commission has already organized various European conferences in the sphere of co-operation between administrations for the purpose of monitoring and intends to organize more. In conclusion, the Commission thanks Parliament for the interest shown in its proposals on this policy for consumer safety and is confident that it will have Par liament's support on this proposal on dangerous imita tions. This proposal represents for the Commission an important example of the practical implementation of this policy. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. Explanation of vote SHERLOCK (ED). \u2014 Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity of recommending the House to vote in favour of this report so that we can offer the rapporteur the thanks he deserves for this particular performance which comes at the end of what was a singularly undistinguished performance during the earlier part of the week, no doubt conditioned by the daily series of disappointments he has read about on the days when his newspaper has managed to arrive.

A 2-68/87) by Mrs Banotti, on behalf of the Com mittee on the Environment, Public Health and Con sumer Protection on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (COM(86) 576 final \u2014 Doc. C 2-154/86) for a directive laying down the health rules for fresh meat and the level of the fees to be charged in res pect of such meat pursuant to Directive 85/73/ EEC. BANOTTI (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 Mr President, the confusion you have witnessed this morning is not untypical of the confusion that has attended all discus sions of this ragbag of amending directives which were sent to the committee a couple of months ago. In fact, I was quite surprised to discover that my ugly duckling of a draft report had suddenly turned into a swan this week and emerged as a fully-fledged report. We have not discussed this in any great length in committee. As a result, at an emergency meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, following the Commission's request for urgency, the committee and myself as rapporteur decided to ask for the application of Rule 85 to refer this report back to the committee where we can prod uce under my rapporteurship a more comprehensive report laying down the health rules for fresh meat and the level of fees to be charged in respect of such meat pursuant to Directive 85/73/EEC. I understand that the Commission may wish to com ment on this. MATUTES, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, the question has been discussed but it still has to be dealt with in committee. BANOTTI (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 Mr President, pres umably that means that the Commission accepts that we are going to send it back to committee. The committee would like it to be known that we hope to bring this report to the House in July so it will only mean about a month's delay for the directive. PRESIDENT. \u2014 You are therefore asking for refer ral back to the committee under Rule 85. As no one wishes to speak for or against this request, I will put it to the vote. (Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the committee) PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. A 2-53/87) by Mrs Llorca Vilaplana, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (COM(86) 729 final \u2014 Doc. C 2-193/86) for a regulation on action by the Community relating to the environment. LLORCA VILAPLANA (ED), rapporteur. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, it is quite a coincidence that the second regulation on action by the Community relating to the environment should be presented in European Envi ronment Year. It just shows, albeit incidentally, that the environment has become one of the Community's major priorities. From the first stages in the campaign for better living conditions, which one felt were com ing under threat and being eroded, the European Par liament assumed a punitive attitude, summed up in the 'polluter pays' maxim. Now we have something much more reasonable and, indeed, much more effective. Payment is not enough; we need prevention. The pres ent regulation, following this policy, is clearly aimed at monitoring and encouragement and drawing attention to this new way of looking at the environment. The programmes included in this regulation are devoted wholly and entirely to the following aspects: first the genetic protection of biotopes; secondly the develop ment of new, clean non-polluting technologies; and thirdly means for monitoring the quality of the envi ronment. I should like to point out, in giving this brief outline of the proposals in the regulation, that for its successful implementation it is essential for care to be taken to preserve the necessary balance between the first and second aspects, that is between the genetic protection of biotopes, which occur in a precarious and threatened state, for the most part in southern European countries, and the development of clean industries, situated mostly in the north of Europe. On the achievement of this balance and on the regulation's harmonizing measures will depend to a large extent its coherence and the continuity of its task. But its success will also generate the necessary co-operation between governments and the Commis sion, between officialdom and private undertakings; and it will also be the permanent living proof of the benefits derived from the elimination of frontiers, one of the indirect but most important and positive aspects of the programme for the environment. Similarly if this regulation is sufficiently widely published and known it will awaken a civic awareness in which peo ple will see from another point of view, as interested parties, the significance and the risk entailed in con duct which ignores the dangers of a polluted environ ment. In recent months and over the past few hours we have had debates in this Parliament highlighting the threat to life posed by indifference or negligence in the ",
        "15.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/263 Llorca Vilaplana use of products and energy sources. The success achieved by this regulation in the brief period of its existence and implementation may serve as an indica tion of what its implementation may achieve in the future. If we compare the first regulation presented in this Parliament in 1983 with the present regulation we can see the efforts made by the Commission to improve it in the drafting and in the major modifications includ ing most notably the extension of its field of action, the reduction in the numbers of bureaucratic obstacles and the increase in budgetary allocations. In addition there have been the amendments tabled in the Com mittee on the Environment by Mrs Lentz-Cornette and Mr Muntingh and approved in committee, which were most useful although few in number, and made improvements to the original text. I should be grateful for the Commissioner's view on the adoption of these amendments. Similarly the recommendations made to the Commission in the motion for a resolution and in the explanatory state ment to continue along the same lines in future are also meant as guidelines in a spirit of collaboration. The Committee on the Environment fully appreciates the value of these programmes for Community conso lidation. In presenting and recommending this report on behalf of the Committee on the Environment I should like to express my thanks for the co-operation I have received and to ask the Parliament to approve the report so that the present regulation may come into force on the date envisaged and start to provide the services which will be so useful in maintaining that position in the van of progress which involves changing the ecological map of Europe whilst conserving its beauties and natural features. The Committee on the Environment also welcomes other aspects of the regulation as regards what it will mean for an improvement of jobs in the forefront of progress for the future \u2014 and not merely for creating more jobs but for a renewal of the forms of work in line with a new society in which concern for the envi ronment will be a primary preoccupation and require ment. policy, you will weep. It is a drop in the ocean. Per haps it is a beginning and in time this regulation may grow to be a fully-fledged instrument to provide a counterbalance to others. Secondly the Commission takes the view that the pro jects should be sent to the Member States, whereas in our view they should be addressed direct to the Com mission for the simple reason that if there is a good environmental project in a given country and for var ious national reasons that country feels unable to accept it, such a project makes no further progress. Nature knows no frontiers and must be judged by other than national criteria. We therefore think that projects should go direct to the Commission. As regards the following important point I am trying to eavesdrop on my British and Danish colleagues. I have gathered that when this regulation comes before the Council the Council is likely to play the same trick as it has already done in the past, namely it will restrict this regulation to the guide-lines on birds; the United Kingdom and Denmark in particular, those two coun tries which are always against this sort of thing, try to object in the Council that this regulation is applicable to all threatened plants and animals in Europe. It would be an unbelievable disgrace if this directive were to be restricted exclusively to the guide-lines on birds. That cannot and must not happen. I therefore once again urge the Commission to try its best to ensure that this regulation is approved as the Commission has proposed it, namely for all aspects of nature under threat in Europe. And I implore my colleagues from Britain and Denmark to do their level best to ensure that their governments do not play the silly tricks which they have played in the past and which may result in an animal such as the monk seal quietly becoming extinct in Europe. That would be a piece of effrontery at this time. I should like to conclude by saying that this regula tion, which is the result of an initiative from the Socialist Group, is nevertheless a particularly good step forward on the way to a good European environ mental policy and I should like once again to give my sincere congratulations to the Commissioner and the Commission. MUNTINGH (S). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, in the Socialist Group's view the present piece of legislation is an example of how things should be in the Com munity. We should like to begin by sincerely congra tulating the Commission on this regulation and I should also like to congratulate Mrs Llorca Vilaplana on her report. I have one or two remarks to make. The first is that naturally there is a question of money. If you look at the sums made available in connection with this regulation and compare them for example with the funds for agriculture or regional and social HABSBURG (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, it is often so frustrating that the most important reports of all are the very ones to be dealt with at a time when there is virtually nobody left in the Chamber. These Friday reports are actually quite important in that they are concerned with practical and tangible matters. To get down to the topic we are discussing, I should like to thank Mr Muntingh for pointing out that in reality it is only by means of transfrontier action that such projects can be tackled. If we take a good hard look at the various environmental problems we have today, it is clear that in every case most of the damage ",
        "No 2-352/264 Debates of the European Parliament 15.5. 87 Habsburg done to the environment comes from the far side of some border or other. We cannot tackle 20th century environmental problems using 19th century ideas; we can no longer fool ourselves that borders are anything but meaningless in this connection. I have also heard it said \u2014 not here in this House but outside it \u2014 that we are asking for too much where the environment is concerned. I find that somehow irritating, because we must never forget that vast amounts of money are being spend in this Community for certain purposes. Yet in the one area that is going to be of absolutely vital importance to our children, all at once we are beginning to economize. I am gradually getting fed-up with the way our gov ernments treat the Community in financial matters. First we are lumbered with various projects, but then we are told: Of course, you must not spend any money on them, because we can't afford any increase in expenditure! Once and for all we should put the boot on the other foot and lay it on the line to our beloved governments that maybe they could begin economizing in certain areas, where it would not even hurt them as much! Just think of all we could save if we only had a single place of work! One stroke of the pen could save us vast sums of money. Think of all the money that could be saved on translation! And in the matter of the internal market, if our governments would just stop being so obstructive, they could give Europe's economy an injection of 120 COO million annually, thus reducing all our current financial prob lems to nothing when compared with the boost given to the economy. I feel that this is a good report. It has made good ground, insofar as that is possible, but we are not entirely happy with it. We therefore support the amendments \u2014 modest enough, God knows \u2014 tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. I should like to conclude by singling out some of the positive elements. Another viewpoint that I share with Mr Muntingh is that it would be a step forward if the proposal were to be extended to cover the animal kingdom in its entirety. Let us not forget that all facets of nature are interrelated; that is why animal protec tion is such an urgent necessity, particularly for us here in Europe where so many animal species are at present disappearing. I should also like to mention that while the fact of shorter intervals between reports does put more pressure on the administration \u2014 and I am certain that the Commission is not entirely happy about this \u2014 nevertheless it is of the utmost import ance where the dissemination of information and the moulding of public opinion are concerned. Finally, I should like to stress how important it is that special attention be devoted to Spain and Portugal. In the field of environmental protection these two coun tries presently lag far behind the countries to the north of them. They have an enormous amount of catching up to do, and therefore we ought to give them our staunch support as part of the Community's southward enlargement. Once again I thank Mrs Llorca Vilaplana for her excellent report. I hope that the House will adopt it by the largets possible majority, perhaps even unani mously. RIPA DI MEANA, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I associate myself with the very posi tive remarks in favour of Mrs Llorca's report. I also welcome on behalf of the Commission the very explicit requests made to us by the rapporteur and by Mr Muntingh and Mr Habsburg: to develop the Commis sion's work on the environment with ever-growing energy and to devote more financial resources to it, as Honourable Members have suggested. The regulation on action by the Community relating to the environment, adopted by the Council in July 1984, is valid for an experimental period of three years and will therefore expire on 3 July next. The experi ence gained in the meantime has been very positive: the operation of the instruments made available has been found by the Commission and others concerned to be satisfactory, as has been confirmed by both industrial circles and by those interested, perhaps in opposition to the former, in the conservation of nature. At the beginning of the year the Commission therefore presented a proposal for a regulation to replace the one in force and to broaden its scope in the light of needs which have become apparent since 1984. It may reasonably be assumed, in view of the unanimously positive opinions of the Member States, that the Council of Ministers will adopt the proposal at its next meeting on 21 May. But the Council cannot come to a decision before first considering Parliament's opinion. I am therefore pleased to note that, in response to the Commission's request, Parliament has decided to fol low the procedure for urgent debate. I should like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mrs Llorca, and to the Committee on the Environment, who have suc ceeded in completing their work in a very short time. From the political point of view it is appropriate to prevent a legal void from arising from a failure of the Council to take a decision next week. The Commis sion is therefore very glad to note that both Mrs Llorca's report and the motion for a resolution express full support for the Commission's proposal for a reso lution since this was the line taken by Members who expressed themselves a short while ago. However, I should like to say on behalf of the Com mission that not all the requests contained in the ",
        "15.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/265 Ripa di Meana motion for a resolution meet with our approval. In particular I should like to comment on certain amend ments, starting with the first, namely the suggestion to delete the last sentence of Article 1(1). The Commis sion feels that in view of the economic pressure which very often afflicts sensitive zones requiring protection, the possibility of combining contributions under sev eral instruments must be excluded. As regards the second amendment relating to the level of the Com munity's financial support, the Commission has recently revised its own proposal in view of the widely differing nature of projects. It is clear that projects covered by (a) and (b) are almost always the subject of industrial and economic interest. Moreover financial support of more than 30 % may perhaps arouse prob lems of competitivity. On the other hand as regards projects under (c) and (d) the public interest is clear, whereas purely private economic interest is perhaps less obvious. As to projects relating to biotopes, the Commission continues to feel that a Community contribution of more than 50% should be envisaged solely for species in danger of extinction and that a certain financial contribution from the Member State concerned should be expected for initiatives for the preservation of bio topes. As regards the third amendment relating to the procedure for making applications, we remind Hon ourable Members that projects under (a) and (c) are always the subject of invitations to submit projects and are sent direct to the Commission, whereas projects relating to the preservation of biotopes, subparagraph (e), are sent to the national authorities since they almost always relate to the general regional planning and it is therefore appropriate to involve the national authorities as well in the programme. I can however say that the Council, knowing your feelings, may opt for a solution requiring Member States to send the Commission all the applications received, possibly accompanied by a commentary. The expression 'the Member States shall make known' therefore does not seem necessary in so far as the Advisory Committee has the specific duty to notify the Commission of the opinion of the Member States. As to the fourth amendment relating to the composi tion of the Advisory Committee, the Commission would prefer the competent authorities to be given responsibility so that it would then be for them to appoint their own experts within the committee itself. This method of working moreover has so far been found fully satisfactory by all parties, as is shown by the successful operation of the committee itself. Fur ther, the question affects the existing organization of committees, so the Commission does not think it appropriate to modify its own proposal. As regards the fifth amendment relating to Article 11 \u2014 submission of the report by the Commission \u2014 having regard to the period required for execution of projects, the Commission feels that a three-year inter val would be appropriate. It is however preparing a proposal on the co-ordination of all the requirements contained in Community directives and regulations on environmental matters applicable to the presentation of a report. Finally, for the sixth amendment concerning budget estimates, the Commission notes Parliament's wishes with interest and will take account of them in the debate on the annual budget. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. (Parliament adopted the resolution) 5. Convention (UNRWA) PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. A 2-47/87) by Mrs Cinciari Rodano, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (COM(87) 18 final \u2014 Doc. C 2-214/86) for a decision on the conclusion of the Convention between the European Economic Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) concerning aid to refugees in the countries of the near East. CINCIARI RODANO (COM), rapporteur. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, the Committee on Development and Co-operation has unanimously approved the proposal for the renewal of the Convention between the Com munity and UNRWA for the next three years. As Honourable Members know, UNRWA is the agency set up by the United Nations as long ago as 1948-1949 to help Palestinian refugees in the countries of the Middle East. Today the agency helps more than two million Palestinians with refugee status (in 1949 there were 700 000) and administers numerous refugee camps, operating both in the territories of Gaza and the West Bank, under military occupation, and scat tered camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. The UNO agency helps the refugees basically in three ways: above all it provides health aid both of a preven tive nature \u2014 vaccinations \u2014 and of an environmental nature \u2014 camp hygiene \u2014 and actual medical treat ment in particular child care, midwifery, specialist opt ical treatment and so on. In the second place it provides educational aid in so far as it provides elementary education to school-age children according to the rules of the host country and administers also eight occupational training centres with some forty courses. Thirdly it provides emergency aid to families in special need. To give an idea of this aid, I may say that when ",
        "No 2-352/266 Debates of the European Parliament 15.5.87 Cinciari Rodano in a family unit one person works, aid is not provided even if there are more than ten dependants. It is there fore genuinely reduced to the minimum. UNRWA is financed by voluntary contributions except for a small contribution from the United Nations and its funds are constantly inadequate for its needs. In essence the Community's contributions go to two programmes \u2014 the educational and food aid pro grammes. For the educational programme there is an allocation of 20 million ECU for each of the next three years with an increase of 5% to take account of the increase in the school population and a rate of inflation of the same percentage. The Committee on Development and Co-operation, whilst appreciating the effort made, is asking \u2014 and for this purpose has tabled an amendment to the pro posal for a decision \u2014 for the possibility of increasing this contribution in future financial years to be left open, for the basic reason first that there are the real needs of the educational service and secondly \u2014 since the rules of the host State must apply \u2014 there is the possibility that such rules may change. Together with certain colleagues, including some from other Groups \u2014 Mr Bersani, Mr Pons and Mr Ulburghs \u2014 we visited the UNRWA establishments. We were told in Jordan for example that the raising of the compulsory period of education from 9 to 10 years is under discussion. If it takes place the compulsory period will have to be increased by a year in the UNRWA and camp schools as well, which will involve further expenditure which cannot be foreseen or cov ered. Hence we should like a certain flexibility in the contri bution to be retained. Moreover it must be said that even at present this educational programme is encoun tering great difficulties. We have seen classes of 51, 52 and 53 children in rather cramped premises; two or even three classes have to take turns during the day, so the service needs to be improved. I think too that account must be taken of the situation in Lebanon, where almost 50 thousand refugees in the camps are now newly displaced persons, that is they have been expelled from settled camps and are now dispersed in West Beirut, Sidon, the Bekaa Valley, the area round Tripoli and the Chouf. This means that all the UNRWA services in these regions have to be reorgan ized. As regards food aid we call attention to the need for precise and scrupulous application of the provisions of the new 1986 regulation on food aid, particularly as regards the possibility of buying products on the spot, which is very important in emergency situations. I feel that apart from the Convention it is necessary for the Community to continue to meet the needs of the population in Lebanon \u2014 whether Palestinian or not \u2014 affected on the one hand by Israeli bombing and on the other by armed conflicts and sieges of the various factions in the Amman Camp and by other developments in that tortured region. I should like to pay public tribute to the dedication and courage of the staff of UNRWA working in the Middle East and particularly in Lebanon. I should like to point out that in the performance of their duties five international officials have been killed, three injured and 18 kidnapped or detained during 1986 alone, which illustrates the conditions under which this agency works. Some final points, Mr President: it is clearly unthinka ble that upwards of two million people should con tinue to live as refugees and we therefore ask the Community to continue with the programme under taken either by convening an international conference or by guaranteeing Community preference for prod ucts from the occupied territories or by development programmes. That does not prevent us at the present time from renewing the Convention as a matter of urgency. DE BACKER-VAN OCKEN (PPE). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal to continue EEC aid to UNRWA is of the greatest importance if only for humanitarian reasons. It concerns the Palestinian people who were forced to take refuge in camps after the various wars in the Mid dle East. The figures are clear: 400 000 refugees in Gaza, more than half of them in camps; 386 000 on the West Bank; 800 000 in Jordan, 200 000 of them in camps, and finally 500 000 refugees in Lebanon, 250 000 in Syria and 100 000 in Egypt. More than two million in all. A large part of the Palestinian people have thus been compelled to live as refugees in Gaza more than 40 years and elsewhere for an average of 20 years. The EEC contribution is an important support for the aid programme and has always been strongly backed by Parliament. A strong emphasis has been and is being laid above all on education and training, as has been very well explained by Mrs Cinciari Rodano. The difficult situation in Lebanon, Gaza and on the West Bank would be much more explosive without the United Nations UNRWA programmes. The aid from the EEC, but also from the United States, Canada and other European countries is well administered and keenly appreciated by the population. But we must be clear, neither the United Nations themselves nor the Palestinians see these programmes as a de facto alter native to a political solution for the Palestinian ques tion. A political solution has been proposed again and again by the EEC Foreign Affairs Ministers, amongst other occasions in the Venice declaration. As regards the United Nations alternatives, there are two. Better ",
        "15.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/267 De Backer-Van Ocken living conditions, above all for children and women, but on the other hand the creation of a framework offering hope for adequate solutions to the tensions in the region. As regards the latter we are making pro gress. The international conference for the Middle East is an opportunity to find a peaceful solution based on dia logue and negotiations with the participation of all parties concerned. Here the Community has the opportunity of making a contribution with full respect for the fundamental rights of the Palestinians and of the Israeli people. This chance must be seized and the EEC is seizing it. I should like to remind Honourable Members that very recently a number of representatives of both peo ples signed a joint document stating clearly that here it is a question of two peoples pre-destined to live together in the same territory, both of whom have a right to continued existence in peace and security as good neighbours. My Group is therefore in full agree ment with Mrs Cinciari Rodano's resolution and we also support the amendments of the Committee on Development and Co-operation. IN THE CHAIR: MR DANKERT Vice-President JACKSON, Christopher (ED). \u2014 Mr President, like the earlier speaker, on behalf of my group I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and say that we fully support her report and the amendment tabled by the Committee on Development and Coop eration to the Convention. We are very pleased that the new Convention is going to increase Community assistance to UNRWA. This assistance is very important to a body which has fixed needs but unreliable income. It really is terrible that UNRWA is still so sorely needed. It is not a question of helping a diminishing number of old refugees. This is a series of living and growing communities of over two million people in sixty camps, more than live in many countries. They are people who are denied the privileges of statehood \u2014 the privileges that we take for granted. No wonder the Palestine situation is a breeding ground for terror ism and crime. Although the signs are not good, I very much hope that it will not be too long before a political solution to the area's problems can remove the need for this sort of assistance and can remove the presence of these refugees. As suggested in the report, we give strong support to the convening of a peace conference under the aegis of the United Nations. I hope the Commis sion and Council will consider not only this but also any other political initiatives they can bring to bear to help to resolve the terrible situation out there. Finally, I would like to endorse the sentiments expressed in the report concerning the UNRWA staff. They frequently work in difficult and dangerous con ditions, in Lebanon even facing kidnapping and death. We pay great tribute to their courage and determina tion. RIPA DI MEANA, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I am very glad to note that Parliament unanimously sup ports both the renewal of the Convention and the rea sons and prospects for that renewal: an increase in its financial endowment and an unreserved acceptance by Members of the European Parliament of the reasons given, together with a major political statement on European Community aid for Palestinian refugees and a peaceful solution to the conflicts tormenting that region. I must say too that the informative and persuasive speech made this morning by Mrs Cinciari Rodano finds the Commission fully convinced of the needs outlined by the rapporteur: to maintain flexibility in the Community contribution to take account of fresh possibilities and requests which may, as she has reminded us, arise as a result of changes for instance in the educational system in some of the host countries. The Commission also endorses what Mrs Cinciari Rodano and Mr Jackson have said about the opera tions of the United Nations agency \u2014 UNRWA \u2014 operations carried out at great risk and with personal and direct sacrifices by international officials. The Commission greatly admires this United Nations agency and is informing Mr Ambassador Giacomelli, who is in charge of its work, of its support. I now come to a point which appears as Paragraph 7, if I am not mistaken, in Mrs Cinciari Rodano's motion and would say that the Commission intends to take specific steps under the agreement between the Euro pean Community and the occupied territories of the West Bank to improve trade relations. This is an inter esting option developed and formulated by the Com munity which today needs to be implemented in prac tical terms. There are quite a few problems involved in implementing these agreements as regards forwarding to the ports and airports the perishable goods to which they relate. The decision has at the moment only sym bolic value but the Commission intends to apply it in practice. I now turn to the proposed amendment which the Commission cannot unfortunately accept. In fact the Community's contribution to the UNRWA education programme, in the actual framework of the new Con- ",
        "No 2-352/268 Debates of the European Parliament 15.5.87 Ripa di Meana vention, would represent \u2014 if, as we expect, it is renewed on 21 May \u2014 an increase of 20% over the previous Convention, 60 million ECU in all, compared with 50 million for the years 1984-86. This increase exceeds that of the Agency's own education pro gramme due to inflation, the increase in the school population and the changes foreseen in the syllabuses \u2014 and here I refer to Mrs Cinciari Rodano's very clear speech \u2014 an increase estimated for the same period at 15%. UNRWA, which negotiated the new Convention with the Commission last November, is pleased, for its part, with both the form and the content of the proposed text. Moreover, neither at the negotiations nor later did the UNRWA representatives refer to changes in the educational systems of the host countries, which might have led to an increase in the costs of the pro gramme. However, it is my duty today to take careful note of any of Mrs Cinciari Rodano's comments which in any way modify the opinion expressed last November by the representatives of the United Nations agency which will therefore confront the Commission with a fresh problem. The Convention provides for a system of calculation for the annual education programme, introduced for the first time in 1984 and bringing advantages to both parties: better financial security and the possibility of easier planning for UNRWA and a clear view of the financial obligations of each financial year for the EEC budgetary authorities. The inclusion of the amendment proposed by Parliament in the text of the Council decision would therefore be, in our view, con trary to the logic of the system. However, in the event of an emergency the Commis sion would be able to consider the possibility of grant ing special aid within the scope of present procedures, as happened for instance for emergency food aid and medical supplies for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, granted in fact at the request of the United Nations agency. There are other examples, more recent, which I ought to mention in this respect: in October last year 1 000 tonnes of wheat flour were given to the Palesti nian refugees in Lebanon and in March this year 1 600 000 ECU were supplied in the form of emer gency aid \u2014 medical supplies, blankets, tents \u2014 for the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. Hence the Commission, whilst unable to accept the amendment proposed, certainly accepts its spirit and is prepared to organize its own work so as to face new situations in the light of the joint position expressed here on behalf of the European Parliament by Mrs Cinciari Rodano, Mrs De Backer-Van Ocken and Mr Christopher Jackson. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. Proposal for a decision After the third indent \u2014 After the adoption of Amend ment No 1 CINCIARI RODANO (COM), rapporteur. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, the Commissioner has already said that the Commission does not accept that amendment. I renew my request and would remind him that Parlia ment voted for it unanimously. RIPA DI MEANA, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I followed with great attention what has been said and have drawn up a memorandum for the Commission which I shall be sending within the next few hours. Explanation of vote NORDMANN (LDR). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, Mr Giacomelli, the UNRWA High Commissioner appeared before the Committee on Development and Cooperation. During the hearing he admitted that cir cumstances \u2014 he did not state which circumstances \u2014 had led him to help the Amai movement. This state ment, not to say admission, greatly surprised and puz zled me. It was this puzzlement which prevented me from voting in favour of Mrs Cinciari Rodano's report today. I believe that we are faced with a serious prob lem. We must give humanitarian aid whenever this aid is required and whenever it is humanitarian, but we have to do everything possible to be on our guard that the aid we give does not help, even indirectly, to finance international terrorism. For that reason, although I approve the principle of giving humanitarian aid to peoples who are victims of the lack of solidarity among Arab countries, we must exercise a certain degree of critical vigilance. That is what prevented me from voting for Mrs Cinciari Rodano's report. Of course, we must give aid and we must give as much humanitarian aid as possible, but we must not close our eyes when we increase this aid. (Applause) (Parliament adopted the resolution) 6. Canary Isles PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the proposal from the Commission to the Council (COM(87) 72 final \u2014 Doc. C 2-35/87) for a regulation concerning certain ",
        "15.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/269 President adjustments to the arrangements applying to the Canary Isles. MEDINA ORTEGA (S). \u2014 (ES) I shall be very brief since today's sitting is something of a tour d'horizon. The regulation proposed by the Commission is a con sequence of Community agreements made with non- member Mediterranean countries. With the adoption of these agreements we might see a Community region \u2014 such as the Canary Islands \u2014 placed at a disadvan tage as compared with the territories of non-member countries. The Commission is therefore now propos ing, in accordance with Article 25 of the Act of Acces sion which provides that Protocol No 2 on the Canary Islands may be amended as may prove necessary, to implement certain adjustments which will make it eas ier for some agricultural products from the Canary Islands, which have been experiencing difficulties, to enter the Community. I do not think that this adjustment to Protocol No 2 will be the last, since it is possible that in the not too distant future some products such as tomatoes, hand made cigars, certain fishery products, cut flowers and living plants may also have to be the subject of adjust ments. The Canary Islands are, moreover, a peripheral region 1 000 kilometres away from the Continent of Europe and are comparatively densely populated with 1 500 000 inhabitants with scant natural resources, very little cultivable land and scarcely any water. The measures which may be taken in respect of the Canary Islands, which are constantly becoming less of an agri cultural region and more of a service region, must therefore follow the pattern of Community aid to the most backward regions. This Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy is at present considering the whole Canary question and might shortly be presenting us with a motion for a resolution and a report. I am grateful to the Commission for its efforts to make the system for the importation of Canary products more flexible and I should like to say that, although it is not the first time we have taken a decision on the Canary Islands it will certainly not be the last. I ask you to vote in favour of this Commission regulation. HABSBURG (PPE). \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I can only endorse what Mr Medina Ortega has said about the Canary Islands. I have often had occasion to visit the Canary Islands, and not merely as a tourist. I had many contacts with the local people and therefore I know how serious the problems are and what obliga tions are encumbent on us vis-\u00e0-vis these people. Far removed as they are from the European continent and certainly also exposed to some threats from out side, the Canary Islands still hold fast to Europe. For this reason we have obligations towards them, to put it quite simply. Indeed that was why the Political Affairs Commitee held a meeting in the Canary Islands immediately after Spain's accession to the Community. It wanted to drive home the point that the Canary Islands are an integral part of Europe but also that they have a special claim on our help. We welcome this first step therefore, which will be fol lowed by others, and we hope that this report by our Committee on Regional Policy and Regional Planning will enable a programme to be drawn up for the Canary Islands that will improve the living standards of these admirably industrious people and also make it clear to them that Europe is on their side. (Applause) ESCUDER CROFT (ED). \u2014 (ES) Mr President, it is clear that we shall be adopting today, I hope almost unanimously, an important improvement to Protocol No 2 to the Act of Accession of Spain to the European Communities \u2014 which constitutes, and we appreciate this in the Canaries, \u2014 an important attempt to enable our islands to improve and establish their export quo tas and is also an acknowledgment of the fact that, in principle, products from the Canaries receive less favourable treatment than similar products from non- member countries. This draft regulation entails the partial implementation of a resolution adopted by this Parliament in September requesting the Commission and the Council, in accordance with Article 25(4), to increase the quotas and consider what measures were necessary for adjusting the system applicable to the Canary Islands. Nevertheless we must be realistic. These rules do not meet the demands of the Canary agriculture sector for the simple reason that Protocol No 2 to the Act of Accession of Spain to the European Communities was drawn up without the agreement of the Canary Parlia ment, that is without the full agreement of all its politi cal groupings. It was drawn up purely for political rea sons and no one understands how it came to be accepted that Canary products should not be granted freedom of movement in the version presented by Par liament. These rules also show a lack of vision for the future. When a farmer is thinking of changing to crops of which Europe has a shortage he cannot be thinking in terms of one year hence or be dependent on the quo tas to be applied in one year's time or two years' time; if the Canary Islands, as a European region, have to be dependent on all these factors there will be no security for investment and the lack of security will act as a brake on investment. The main problem in the Canary Islands today is that unfortunately we have one of the highest rates of unemployment in Europe, with approximately 26% of the Canary population of working age unemployed. Export agriculture \u2014 'agri cultura de primor' as we call it in the Canaries \u2014 ",
        "No 2-352/270 Debates of the European Parliament 15.5.87 Escuder Croft could create many more jobs than it now does and could improve the socio-structural situation in the Islands. I congratulate the Commission and the Council for drafting and approving these rules, which clearly go in the right direction in aiming not to increase unemploy ment, but they will not achieve the goal of creating stable employment, which could have been achieved with more ambitious rules. Finally I should like to ask the Commission to keep up the struggle to meet the demands of the Canary Islands, which I am sure we shall manage to do between us all. MATUTES, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares the sentiments expressed by Mr Medina, Mr Habsburg and Mr Escuder. As can be seen from the guidelines for the adaptation of the system applicable to the Canary Islands, which the Council approved in October 1986 \u2014 within the framework of talks on the Mediterranean policy of the enlarged Community \u2014 the Commission presented to the Council a proposal for a regulation along the following lines, which seem to me to satisfy the demands expressed here, and in order to save time I shall dwell only on the essential points. First: an increase in certain quotas provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 2 to the Act of Accession; secondly the reinstatement and amendment of the pre ferential tariff system for 16 products which were part of the former EEC/Spain Agreement but which were not specifically included in the Treaty of Accession; thirdly the application of a tariff preference system to seven products which are new in relation to the former EEC/Spain Agreement; fourthly modification of the entry price from 1990 for products subject to reference prices; fifthly the removal, also from 1990, of the quantitative restrictions which Mr Escuder mentioned. The Commission therefore considers that these propo sals take account of the interests of the Canary Islands and give them appropriate treatment which will in no event be, and has never been, worse than that extended to non-member Mediterranean countries. (Applause) PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. (Parliament approved the Commission proposal) 1 7. Hijacking of lorries (continuation) PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report by Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso (Doc. A2-25/87). 2 MOORHOUSE (ED). \u2014 Mr President, our compli ments go to the rapporteur for this report on the hijacking and destruction of lorries within the Com munity. It is an excellent report. The rapporteur has done a valuable service in highlighting what is a very serious problem and, frankly, the extent of the prob lem has come as a nasty surprise and indeed shock to many of us. First of all there is the straightforward question of theft of lorries and their contents which goes on all the time. Indeed my honourable colleague, Mr Newton Dunn, was telling us only yesterday how in the United Kingdom, every other day, a lorry vanishes into the blue. I repeat, vanishes into the blue without trace! A most extraordinary statistic and a most extraordinary fact which bears further examination, But perhaps the main problem we are concerned with here today is the question of lorry drivers driving through a Member State not their own, finding them selves being attacked, their lorry damaged, the tyres slashed, the contents stolen and they are left high and dry. And they have a terrible problem trying to get compensation from any quarter. This has happened to British lorry drivers in France for instance, but not only in France. My Spanish colleague will no doubt recount what has happened to Spanish drivers in another Member State. And it is for that reason, Mr President, that we sup port very strongly a Community-wide approach to this question. This is where the report is extremely valua ble. Let us take one particular question, that of com pensation for the lorry driver himself, but also for the lorry owners. They have to deal with national bureau cracies not their own. They will not know precisely what their rights are, if indeed they have any. If they are lucky the lorry owners may secure compensation but there is every chance that the lorry driver himself will not get compensation for, say, loss of earnings. So we ask the Commission in particular to look at this question very seriously. We support the call in the report for a uniform criminal law and compensation levels in all Member States with Community legisla tion governing clauses in insurance policies. Lastly, of course, prevention is better than cure. These things should not be happening and we must reduce them to a minimum if we can. That is why we call on Member State governments \u2014 that is to say the rap porteur does with our support \u2014 for further backing from national authorities and for the setting up of a network of guarded parking areas in transport centres to give more protection to the lorry drivers, particu larly in Member States that are not their own. We beg to support the report. 1 Approval of the Minutes: see Minutes. 2 See the Verbatim Report of Proceedings for the previous day. WIJSENBEEK (LDR). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, first I wish to express my dissatisfaction that we tackled the ",
        "15.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/271 Wijsenbeek report yesterday without finishing it. It would have been better to hold the whole debate this morning. In particular I should like to ask Mr Commissioner Ripa di Meana, who is here today, to say a word or two presently. I regard the arguments presented yesterday by his colleague Mr Commissioner Clinton Davis as unacceptable. That the European Commission should presume to state in this Parliament that it is not our task but that of the Member States to find the solution to the problem when lorries are being attacked pre cisely on account of Community rules in our Member States, when they are overturned, when the contents are drenched with petrol and set on fire; how can it say that it is not our affair \u2014 that simply will not do! It is the foundation and the corner-stone of the Com munity market that our products and our transport can circulate freely without being attacked. The second point which I find particularly unaccepta ble in the Commission's statement yesterday is this: the Commission says that when lorries disappear and are attacked a refund of VAT may be made. It also says that that is not our concern, let the Member States settle it. Since when has the Commission no longer been responsible for Community policy? Since when has the Commission presumed to refuse its res ponsibility? I think we have had things out so often here with Mr Commissioner Clinton Davis that he would like to fall back on the Member States. But for a Member of the Commission who has stated before the Court of Justice that he will perform his Com munity duty, that is unacceptable! I should like to conclude by saying that I fully and enthusiastically support Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso's report. MARLEIX (RDE). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in certain parts of the Community theft and destruction of lorries is so widespread that it is threatening road traffic safety, free circulation of goods and is, of course, distorting competition. As this form of vandalism challenges the very princi ples on which the common market is based, the Euro pean Parliament is competent to debate questions relating to these present-day acts of piracy. I therefore congratulate the rapporteur for having taken up this delicate question and for having dealt with it so well in his explanatory statement. There are in fact three motives for the destruction and pillage of heavy goods vehicles: theft and resale of the goods being transported, or of certain parts of the lorry itself; to put pressure on and frighten drivers who refuse to accept or to follow orders for industrial action or strikes; and political pressure of the sort resorted to by some of our farmers who are protesting against the importation of certain products from another Member State or arising from political acts, particularly in the Spanish Basque country. Although the motives are different, the results are the same: deterioration in political and trade relations between the Member States and economic and social injury to the drivers concerned and to their firms and disparities in a distortion of competition with regard to insurance and the application of VAT to the goods destroyed. The virtue of Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso's motion for a reso lution is that it takes account of the ver}' serious diffi culties facing road hauliers who are victims of these different types of attack. However, paragraph 7 of the motion for a resolution calls for safety measures which would tend to restrict freedom of movement and lower the competitivity of transport firms by requiring them to group their vehi cles. That at least is my opinion. The experience gained in 1979, 1980, 1984 and 1985, particularly in the Basque country, has shown that recourse to con voys protected by the police can only be used to a limited extent in regions which are heavily dependent on road transport for their economic activity. In this type of situation roads have to be kept under constant surveillance to prevent any form of attack. Security has also to apply to parking areas and industrial instal lations where lorries load or unload their goods. This is clearly not the case where, as in the South of France in particular, the goods vehicles are only in transit in the regions where the attacks occur. We believe that we should at all costs avoid safety mea sures which would be discriminatory by eliminating from the market foreign hauliers or those from a Member State which is a target for certain political or terrorist organizations. At the same time Community bodies should intervene where a crisis situation exists by suspending the regulations, particularly when strict application is incompatible with security. I am thinking particularly of the provisions of Regulation (EEC) 38-20/85 which limits the amount of time a driver can drive without taking a break. For this reason our group has tabled the only amend ment to this report since it woud be absurd to criticize a driver for not stopping in an unsafe area even if the maximum driving times laid down in the Community regulation where exceeded. ESCUDER CROFT (ED). \u2014 (ES) Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso since he has clearly presented a good report which contains a systematic analysis of the origins and consequences of a series of past actions. We should like, however, to make some constructive comments on what we regard as the report's two weaknesses: it makes a half-hearted and over-cautious request to the Council for the measures required and then, as if it hardly dares to believe that the request might be granted, asks for legislation throughout the Twelve Member States \u2014 although of course in some of them this will have to be done on legal grounds or by reason of provisions of the Treaty of Rome.

        "No 2-352/272 Debates of the European Parliament 15.5.87 Escuder Croft The Parliament does not have the legislative capacity for this, which is perhaps why we think it is a good thing for Parliament to be the driving force which per suades the Commission and the Council to adopt mea sures with a view to the future and for the further expansion of this internal market and the European Communities. r\u00f4le assigned to it by the Treaties establishing our Community. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. We Spaniards are particularly interested in this report since some countries are suffering more than others from attacks on lorries. You are all aware of the prob lems which arose with regard to crops of early fruit and more recently with the transport of strawberries. Of course we must roundly condemn this state of affairs, not as Spaniards, but as Members of this Par liament. We ask the Council to take more far-reaching measures, since it does not cost anything to pass legis lation; passing laws and enforcing them will not cost the Communities any money, but it will bring security to our internal trade. We shall, in any case, be voting in favour of the report and once again congratulate Mr Cabez\u00f3n Alonso. RIPA DI MEANA, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to speak again briefly, certainly not to change the Commission's point of view as it was expressed here yesterday by my colleague Stanley Clinton Davis, but to assure Parliament that I have carefully noted the contents of speeches made here this morning and shall be making a report on them: for example the proposal put forward by Mr Moorhouse on guarded parking areas as well as other features mentioned in the debate this morning by Mr Wijsenbeek, Mr Marleix and Mr Escuder Croft. But I should also like to say that I simply must reply to a very vehement attack made by Mr Wijsenbeek upon my colleague Mr Clinton Davis, which leads me to repeat the words of Mr Commissioner Clinton Davis himself in this House. Referring to the phenomenon of blockading and destroying lorries engaged on interna tional transport he stated that this 'disturbing pheno menon has been tolerated for far too long'. There has been no laxity and no passivity on the part of the Commission or the Commissioner responsible; on the contrary it is his intention and that of the whole Com mission to react with fresh vigour to this sickening wave of burnings, blockades and damage to persons and vehicles used for international transport and the phenomenon, equally serious, of thefts and other criminal acts perpetrated against motor vehicle trans port in our Community. Nevertheless the Commission recognizes that \u2014 as may be a painful fact for everyone and particularly unwelcome in circumstances like these \u2014 problems of the maintenance and protection of public order remain the exclusive and direct responsibility of the Member States. In these circumstances the Commission is at the limit of its powers and obviously cannot overstep the Explanation of vote NEWTON DUNN (ED), in writing. \u2014 I support the report because it proposes to tackle a particularly ser ious \u2014 and growing \u2014 problem of the disappearance of lorries. One large lorry has disappeared on average ever}' other day in the United Kingdom for at least the past eighteen months. Very few are ever recovered. It is not so much the loads as the vehicles themselves that are the targets of the thieves. One in three taken is a tipper lorry. Lorries with cranes also appear to be popular. At present, we do not know what happenes to them. Either they are stripped down with the parts and resi dual metal being sold and recycled or they are dis guised and sold abroad. With the increasingly open common market possibly the lorries are shipped out for use in other European Community states. I welcome the Commission's acceptance of the task to collect Europe-wide statistics about this. Only when we know the size and extent of the problem can action on a Europe-wide scale be taken. Although the solving of crimes is the responsibility of each of the many separate police forces throughout the European Community, there is, as yet, no satisfac tory cooperation between them to tackle this kind of problem. Only when police cooperation is adequate can we safely remove the internal frontiers between our twelve States, so achieving our goal of a true huge home market for Europeans by 1992 increasing pros perity and leading to lower unemployment. (Parliament adopted the resolution) 8. Unemployment PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. A 2-70/87) by Mr Papakyriazis, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council concerning the follow-up to the Council resolution of 7 June 1984 on the contribution of local unemployment initiatives to combating unemployment. ",
        "15.5.87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/273 BACHY (S), deputy rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since my colleague Mr Papakyr- iazis has had occasion to return home, it falls to me briefly to present the substance of this report. We now have sixteen and a half million jobless in Europe, a situation no one can accept. Unemployment is not only determined by macroeconomic policy. It is also connected with the capacity to strengthen resources and job-creating initiatives appropriate to each region. Local economic development and local job-creating initiatives can thus play a critical role on two levels: first, the overall reduction of unemploy ment in Europe; second, a reduction in the disparity between the rich or expanding regions and those regions most affected by the crisis or by economic under-development. But local job-creating initiatives must receive more active support not only from national government, but also from the European Community. The Commission has already given a very favourable assessment of pilot projects to create local employment in a number of countries. The aim of the report by Mr Papakyriazis is to draw the attention of the next meet ing of the Social Council in a few weeks time to the need to give supplementary financing to these local job-creating initiatives. This is necessary if such pro jects are to be much more extensively developed. I would point out that the report was unanimously adopted in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment and I trust that the same will be the case in this Assembly. ALVAREZ DE PAZ (S). \u2014 (ES) Mr President, this report, which has been adopted unanimously, is a good one. The original report was already good but was significantly improved by the many amendments developed by the group and in committee and accepted by the rapporteur. On the subject of the figures quoted by my colleague Mr Bachy, I should like to add that over 12% of the Community population of working age is unemployed at the moment and that 40% of those are young peo ple under 25 years old who are encouraged by a con sumer society to acquire possessions and to make a success of life, but who are not given access to the means or channels of production so that they are denied any hope of a worthy life. The success of the campaign to stamp out unemployment \u2014 which according to the Commission would mean reducing the figure to 7% by the end of the decade \u2014 does not depend solely on the implementation of national and Community measures but also on the creation of a favourable economic and social climate within the geographical limits in which each one lives and works, by encouraging co-operation between those parties active on the local labour market and by introducing national employment policies at local level. In my opinion these initiatives involving, as the report indicates, available local resources in problem areas of the economy, need the decisive thrust and support of the public authorities. We shall be interested to hear the reply of the next Council of Ministers, to which my colleague also referred. CIANCAGLINI (PPE). \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has already expressed its views in 1984 on local employment initiatives. Today we have a communication from the Commission recording certain progress in the Member States towards the realization of these initiatives. This pro gress does not, however, seem sufficient in the light of the present employment situation. In fact, despite cer tain clear signs of growth, the Community now has more than sixteen million unemployed, with a labour market characterized by ever-growing regional dispar ities. In this situation local employment initiatives may play a fundamental r\u00f4le in turning to account the human potential and local resources of the less-favoured regions. It is essential to bring into play all these initia tives, which reflect better the requirements and econo mic propensities of actual local conditions and are consequently able to create a multiplier effect on the growth of employment. The various Member States have already to some extent adopted laws calculated to inspire such initia tives. With regard to Italy I might mention the De Vito Law in support of employment initiatives in the South, above all in the sector of youth employment. All the same it is necessary to promote measures at Community level to encourage local employment ini tiatives, taking greater account of their special fea tures. They cannot in fact be regarded simply by the yard-stick of normal or small-scale undertakings even though there are many similarities. The difference often lies in the social and economic context in which local employment initiatives come into being and the multi-faceted forms of operation which they may involve. The element of novelty consists in the spirit of initiative and co-operation between entrepreneurs, the social partners and local authorities. In view of the backwardness of the regions in which they occur, often as the only generators of employ ment, and the exceptional importance of the human factor, local initiatives warrant the closest examination by national, regional and Community authorities. It is therefore necessary to increase exchanges of experience and information and training structures as regards administration and the possibilities of financ ing for those promoting local employment initiatives in less-favoured regions. A campaign for awakening public opinion as regards financial and organizational instruments may prove decisive for the realization of such entrepreneurial initiatives. ",
        "No 2-352/274 Debates of the European Parliament 15.5.87 Ciancaglini The information system promoted by the Commission to encourage exchange of information on local initia tives and the creation of the task force of small- and medium-sized undertakings is certainly of great interest. Apart from information, the element of financial sup port is decisive. In this sector it is essential for national authorities and the Community to join forces. Com munity financing may be sought in a whole range of instruments, from the ERDF to the Social Fund, from the European Investment Bank to the new Community instrument. Under the new rules, the framework which, according to the Single Act, will have to regulate the structural funds, it would be appropriate to give priority to all those programmes intended for entrepreneurial and co-operative initiatives at local level. Apart from the financial commitment, the Member States must be asked to provide greater flexibility at legislative and administrative level by removing all the obstacles which at present complicate the implementation of these initiatives. Nor must we forget tax incentives for the promoters of undertakings and local initiatives. Finally I should like to emphasize that local employ ment initiatives are destined to assume ever greater importance for the completion of the internal market. They may in fact develop an essential r\u00f4le in rectifying those structural and economic imbalances which, if they are not eliminated, will prevent the great Euro pean market from achieving its goal. And with an eye to the completion of the internal market the Commis sion should take the lead in convening a Conference on local employment initiatives with the participation of local and regional authorities, development agents and above all those who promote initiatives. scrubbed. We think that what Mrs van Dijk wants to do to paragraph 11 is entirely inappropriate and there fore we are voting against that amendment. Finally, we like what Mr Alvarez de Paz has to say. Mr President, we are having a splendid morning. You have allotted me more time than I need, which is very unusual, and I therefore recommend this report and sit down. PRESIDENT. \u2014 Thank you, Mr Tuckman, for your nice comment on the time allowed you to speak. I am a bit astonished at your statement that the amendment had too many words, and that you had too much time to speak! MATUTES, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wel comes the initiative of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, since it has always been in favour of local initiatives. To this end the Commission was instrumental in setting up the European network for the exchange of information on local employment ini tiatives. The Commission takes note of this proposal and, with a view to developing it, will be examining its practical implications within the context of the study which the Commission and the Council are carrying out jointly on reforming the Structural Funds. Simi larly, as various speakers have mentioned, the agenda for the next meeting of the Council of Ministers for Social Affairs to be held on 26 May includes an item dealing specifically with the problem of financing of Community and national programmes, including those concerning long-term unemployment. I am confident that Parliament's resolution will bring some light into this discussion. TUCKMAN (ED). \u2014 Mr President, we also think this is a good report. We think that it addresses in a very practical way one of the possibilities of getting extra employment, and that is fine. We have also given serious thought to the four amend ments, and our reaction is to use the whole range of that which is available. We are abstaining on Amend ment No 2 by Mr Filinis for a reason which you, Mr President, as a linguist might appreciate. We really find it quite impossible to understand what those many words are trying to say, so we thought we had better not vote. On the next one, also by Mr Filinis, we think that he has a good point in that he places these local employment initiatives into their wider framework, so that is one we would go along with. Mrs van Dijk's Amendment No 1 is an example of one of those nasty things which keeps on cropping up in Europe, when people talk not about what should be distributed but about how that which is to be distri buted should be earned. Any phrase like that has to be PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. (Parliament adopted the resolution) 9. Adult training infinns PRESIDENT. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. A 2-71/87) by Mrs Maij-Weggen, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on adult training in firms (COM(86) 780 final). MAIJ-WEGGEN (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment welcomes the Commission document on adult training in firms. It is becoming ever clearer that the education one has had in one's youth is not suffi cient for the whole of one's working life. We agree with the Commission that the current regeneration of trade and industry is too dependent on young employ- ",
        "15. 5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/275 Maij-Weggen ees with an appropriate technical education. We also agree with the Commission in fearing a gulf between young employees with a good knowledge of new tech nologies and older employees who cannot accommo date themselves to new machinery and new production methods. Regular re-training and in-service training of older and younger employees in firms is therefore highly necessary in the near future. Like the Commission we expect that big industries which often possess good industrial training facilities may tackle these new developments themselves, but we share the Commission's concern as far as the position of medium and small-sized undertakings is concerned. We therefore support the idea of installing regional offices which may set up partnership programmes between medium- and small-sized businesses and regular instruction in support of continuous training in the undertakings. The Social Committee has a further idea in this field. We propose the setting up of a data bank to register training schemes of concerns involved in advanced technologies so that the experience gained may also be put to use elsewhere in Europe. The Social Committee's second idea concerns the structure of continuous training in firms. For this we should like to encourage the introduction of a system of paid educational leave in accordance with an ILO Convention applied in five of the Community Member States. In our committee's view employees should have an annual right to a given number of days of paid edu cational leave. The committee regards any further- going proposals in this sphere such as paid educational leave for both employees and non-employed, not only for the purpose of the pursuit of one's occupation but also for courses of general education, as unpracticable and prohibitively expensive. Finally, along with all praise for this Commission pro posal, two points of criticism. In November Parliament made a large number of proposals in the sphere of European social policy to accompany the European internal market policy. The report of the Honourable Members Mr Baron Crespo and Mr Von Wogau refers again to this relationship. This proposal for con tinuous training in firms is a part of the package which we asked for in November. We hope and expect that Parliament's other proposals will also be implemented and we would rather see an integrated action pro gramme in the field of European social policy and labour market policy than receive isolated proposals here. A second point of criticism concerns financing. We think that should be done under a special budget heading as for instance under the Community educa tional programmes. We should prefer this programme not to be financed from the European Social Fund. The European Social Fund is for training the unem ployed and there are too many unemployed in the European Community to finance programmes for employees from the same fund. Mr President, our opinion on this document, apart from the individual points of criticism, is generally positive, even very positive. We hope the Commission will quickly follow this communication up with a spe cific action programme. BACHY (S). \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the report by Mrs Maij-Weggen follows both the spirit and the logic of the eight reports adopted by Parliament last Novem ber in a major debate on the functioning of the labour market. The report lays particular emphasis on three points we consider important. First, the need to considerably increase resources to promote professional training beyond initial educa tion. Second, the need to grant workers in undertak ings a genuine right to training, on the basis of a paid day-release system negotiated each year between trade unions and heads of undertakings. Third, the need to develop regional professional training programmes. In this way it provides for cooperation between under takings and educational establishments. We have only two reservations about this report. First, owing to the procedural priorities and the very full agenda for this part-session, it has not been possi ble to jointly debate another report presented by a col league from the Socialist Group, Mrs d'Ancona, which also deals with professional training matters but can only be taken at a later part-session. It would have been more logical and convenient, in our opinion, to take the two reports together even though the Maij- Weggen report was drawn up at the initiative of the Social Affairs Committee and it was imperative that it be put to the vote before the Social Council of 26 May. Our second concern is that it would be most regretta ble if professional training were to be the only area in which the Commission and the Council took account of Parliament's resolutions. Last November we adopted, by a very large majority in this Parliament, a package of concrete proposals bearing on the func tioning of the labour market, and most notably: flexi bility of employment, social security matters, the role of employers and labour and a report on training for the new technologies. It would be a pity therefore if, in the development of the consultation process between Parliament, Commission and Council in rela tion to these matters of professional training, we went no further and that what Parliament has voted is not discussed and taken up more widely by the other European institutions. Notwithstanding the above reservations, which in no way detract from the value and positive character of Mrs Maij-Weggen's report, we shall vote for this ",
        "No 2-352/276 Debates of the European Parliament 15.5.87 Bachy report. However we shall vote against the two amend ments tabled by Mr Tuckman and Mr Le Chevallier, respectively, since in our opinion they add nothing to the report. TUCKMAN (ED). \u2014 Mr President, let me start where Mr Bachy left off, namely, with the question whether or not the amendment that I have put in, adds anything. Unlike Mr Bachy, I have actually had the job of going around Europe visiting companies and finding out what it is that stops women from getting on as well as men. Three factors are mentioned. Peo ple say that they obey the law on advertisements, therefore women have an equal chance of getting into the company. They say, secondly, that they obey the law as far as pay is concerned. But they then say when it comes to promotion, 'No, we don't want women in charge of men'. I have even heard it said that the woman's brain is supposed to be marginally lighter than that of a man. Well, seeing that this information came to me from a gentleman who then informed me that his daughter was studying architecture, and who went on to say that women lack the concept of space, his assertion is somewhat questionable! I think my proposal that we should stress promotion where women are concerned, since it is the area where they suffer most, does add something, and, therefore, I would have hoped that Mr Bachy could still change his mind. I would not have thought that this is a party point, but a content point. I would just like to explain why my group will vote against the amendment which comes from the Euro pean Right. At first sight it reads splendidly, and like good sound stuff, until you come to the last few words, where it says that everything should be done for 'those who are EEC nationals'. In this House and in the Community in general we have always tried to treat people equally and not to take too much notice of their particular nationality. It is the racist approach we do not like. Turning now to the report as a whole, we are in favour. We think that Europe needs many more trained people. We are being out-performed on the training front quite enormously by the Far East. There is no reason for that. Our base of knowledge is equally great. It is just a matter of applying ourselves. There fore we like the idea. We are happy with this report now. When it first surfaced it seemed to be calling for better education, whether it was in matters which would help the company, which would help you to earn your living or whether it was simply that general broad education which is what makes the European. We feel that general education is out of place here. Most of it has now been put under the heading of mat ters which can benefit the firm. That is why we are in favour of the report. I hope it will go through without any difficulty. LARFVE-GROENENDAAL (LDR). \u2014 (NL) Mr President, my Group wonders why this report must be dealt with at top speed and since when an opinion on a communication has been so urgent that the rapporteur has not even had time to draw up an explanatory state ment to go with the resolution. I have what is perhaps the rather strange habit of preparing for the reports to be dealt with in plenary session and, as we all know, this report was not on the agenda and on 27 February the Bureau of the Parliament gave no assent to the preparation of this own-initiative report. I am aston ished that it is now rushed through on a Friday \u2014 all the more so, as Mr Bachy has already said, because Mrs d'Ancona's report on the same subject, paid edu cational leave, is at the moment being carefully consid ered in the Social Committee. We should have regarded it as more efficient and also as fairer if both reports were dealt with at the same time in plenary session. The right to training in trade and industry is generally recognized. And the benefit is acknowledged by the Member States and employers: continuous training, investment in industry, leads to higher production and efficiency. Most employees too are convinced of the benefit: more pleasure in the work, greater opportuni ties on the labour market and better chances of prom otion. The European Parliament is convinced too. This is proved simply by the resolution drawn up by me on behalf of the Social Committee on education and training in new technologies, approved unani mously by Parliament on 11 November. In it Parlia ment stressed that training no longer lasts for life. As regards the philosophy behind continuous education there is therefore general agreement. The rapporteur regards the Commission's proposal as too all-embracing and not specific enough. But my Group wonders whether its proposals contribute much to an improvement of the present situation. In all our Member States there are already many forms of inter nal and external industrial training schemes. In Ger many employees are entitled to five days' educational leave a year to be taken when desired. In Belgium and France too the individual right to educational leave is known. In the Netherlands for instance industrial advisers give joint management training. In the context of a recent investigation which I carried out into trade and industry in the Netherlands on the content of annual social reports it was clear that much attention is devoted in my country too to industrial training, from manuring vegetables to higher management, from dis cussions of bad news to the multinationals, even liter acy courses or training in relations with customers. But the situation is so different in the various Member States between the different sectors and industries that compulsion by means of a directive would serve no purpose. Contrary to the views of the rapporteur the Commission is rightly reluctant to go further than a recommendation. My Group therefore welcomes the fact that the original proposal for a directive has been ",
        "15.5. 87 Debates of the European Parliament No 2-352/277 Larive-Groenendaal superseded by a recommendation. Paragraph 10 of the resolution stresses the important r\u00f4le of the social partners. Of course! But why then impose mandatory rules? In most countries collective labour agreements are concluded for a given sector or for each large industry and that is where agreements about training must also be concluded. The difference between voluntary agreements and an obligation to provide training for employees may amount to bank ruptcy or to top-heavy, wasteful and inefficient organ izations controlling and implementing the schemes. Stimulating education and training by removing obsta cles for undertakings and employees as far as possible \u2014 and the greatest obstacle is the fragmented Euro pean market \u2014 and by encouraging co-operation, in particular for medium- and small-sized undertakings in the sphere of training, is a different matter. Paragraph 12 of the resolution also speaks of links with ordinary education. That is all very well, but then one must also allow schools to obtain the training facilities. I know in my country that is not automatic. The biggest complaint on the introduction of data- processing turned out for instance to be shortage of lesson-time together with shortage of teachers. Educa tional resources must also be taken into account. My Group does not favour the proposal for setting up a data bank for continuous training. What help would it be? Data banks serve a purpose only if the informa tion they produce is of wide application, but what use has for example a Netherlands undertaking for a course on customer relations in Greece? Moreover information about training schemes is in plentiful sup ply for example in Chambers of Commerce which in fact are also data banks. What is more, data banks could only be useful with a Community labour market to which employees in all Member States have free access. Data banks are even essential with cross-fron tier operations as for example exchange of students and teachers. In the framework of Erasmus, which was at last approved yesterday, I asked for a data bank for further education. All things considered, the report does not provide much that is earth-shatteringly new and fortunately it did not appear that anything of that kind was needed. What is needed is the cultivation of a mentality in which the value of education is appreciated in so far as such an attitude does not exist, and nothing positive will be achieved by compulsion. MAIJ-WEGGEN (PPE), rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, a point of order. I should like to remind Mrs Larive that there was a debate about this report and about Mr Papakyriazis's report when the agenda was dealt with on Monday. It was stated then that the Bureau had been delayed in approving the report and that was why it was not on the original agenda this week. The Bureau fully corrected that. On Tuesday the Bureau agreed to put this report on the agenda for Friday. If Mrs Larive is here on Mondays in future when the agenda is discussed she will not need to make such astonishing remarks, because everybody knows what happened. PRESIDENT. \u2014 I shall not comment further on this from the chair although there is a great deal I might add. PEGADO LIZ (RDE). \u2014 (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact, in itself significant, that two reports like those of Mr Papakyriazis and Mrs Maij- Weggen, under discussion today, should be discussed and voted on at such a late hour on Friday morning with so few Members present is certainly a matter for concern as regards the effective and simultaneous real ization of a European social area in the same schedule and parallel with that of the great internal market. And I am afraid that such an apparent lack of interest today might extend to a whole series of measures which need to be adopted for the essential redefinition of the European social area and the parameters which it must involve and to the manifest lack of political will \u2014 at least up to now \u2014 on the part of certain Member States' governments in establishing the conditions required for the effective implementation of the princi ples of Community social law. As regards the communication which is the subject of this resolution, the Commission itself has not pro gressed beyond the stage of generalities in a field as important for the restructuring of the labour market as continuous worker training. We therefore fully support the proposal of the rappor teur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, for a recommendation on paid educational leave on the precise terms and condi tions to be applied, notwithstanding the more exten sive debate to be held on the next report on this sub ject by Mrs d'Ancona, and it is just a pity that it is not ready at the same time for presentation at this part session. We also support the proposal to assign to the Euro pean Social Fund a more clear-cut programme for occupational retraining and re-education to meet the essential needs of training for young people, women, the handicapped, the long-term unemployed and for eign migrant workers; similarly we reject the xeno phobic amendment tabled by the Group of the Euro pean Right which is clearly contrary to the European spirit on which the restructuring of the labour market at Community level must be built. Finally I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, for her well-drafted report which highlights the essential lines along which the Commis sion should develop its future work in this important field. ",
        "No 2-352/278 Debates of the European Parliament 15.5.87 FITZGERALD (RDE). \u2014 Mr President, I also wel come the inclusion of Mrs Maij-Weggen's report on today's agenda and I thank the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment for supporting the amend ments which my colleague and I tabled at committee level. As we pointed out in committee, the importance of having a well-trained workforce for firms in all industrial, commercial and service sectors must be recognized. We also emphasize, however, that paid education leave sought by employees must be appro priate to the tasks they carry out in the firm. There should, of course, be the exception of retraining where the employee would be learning a new skill because of a change in his function in the firm. I welcome the inclusion in the resolution of the refer ence to the eight resolutions on the restructuring of the labour market. In particular, I would refer to my own report on employment problems at regional level and direct a question to the Commission. Has the Commission examined this report? If so, what action is it proposing. Members will recall that at the committee meeting one of the major proposals put forward by the rapporteur was the call for a directive on paid educa tional leave. I am particularly pleased that the com mittee appreciated the points made in my amendment and adopted the proposal for a recommendation con tained in paragraph 9 of the text. It is not only impor tant to have regard to the cost to the firm of having employees on paid educational leave, it is a fundamen tal consideration for the survival of many industries. The recommendation we have called for must be rel evant to the work that employees are carrying out in their firms. It must take account of, as a fundamental condition, the circumstances of the firm and its ability to pay. There can be no deviation from that. Finally, it is not only desirable but essential that more resources be provided for the European Social Fund so that the essential training needs of the unemployed and the long-term unemployed are looked after. All proposals must give priority to these two categories. We support, and urge the Commission to act on this priority. MATUTES, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission recognizes that one of the most effective means of combating unemployment is continuous worker train ing. It must not be forgotten that technology and industry are being transformed and we need, more than ever before, to be versatile and flexible \u2014 not only the firms themselves but their workforce \u2014 to make the permanent adjustments required for the new market conditions which are rapidly changing, in particular in times of technological change. There is no doubt that continuous worker training is an effec tive way of providing greater opportunities for work ers not to lose their jobs or for the unemployed to obtain jobs. The problem of financing the Community action pro gramme will be the subject of an initial exchange of views at the next Council of Ministers for Social Affairs to be held on 26 May. On the basis of the deci sions taken at that Council meeting the Commission will present the programme as soon as possible. Mrs Maij-Weggen and other speakers will then have an opportunity to give their views on the correct form for financing the programme and other matters, since together with the European Parliament and the social partners it will be the competent authorities as a whole which will adopt whatever practical measures the Commission thinks appropriate to propose to the Member States and the social organizations con cerned. PRESIDENT. \u2014 The debate is closed. (Parliament adopted the resolution) PRAG (ED). \u2014 Sometimes we fail to notice the mira cles which our staff works for us. But that yesterday's Minutes, with 168 pages for proceedings which ended at midnight, should be on our desks at 9 o'clock this morning was really quite a miracle of organization and hard work. Our congratulations and thanks are due to our staff. (Applause) PRESIDENT. \u2014 I join in with your thanks, Mr Prag, because so many pages between midnight and 9 o'clock this morning is a lot in 9 languages. 1 10.
