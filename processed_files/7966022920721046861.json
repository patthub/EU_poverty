        "Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY I. Sub-Saharan Africa is not on track to meet the mil- lennium development goals for water and sanitation. The audit aimed to assess whether the Commission has managed EU development assistance for drinking water and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa so as to lead to effective and sustainable results. II. The Court examined a sample of 23 projects in six countries, which represent a significant part of the aid delivered to that region, to see whether project results had been delivered and were likely to be sus- tained over time. III. The principal findings of the audit were as follows: \u2014 Overall, equipment was installed as planned and was in working order. \u2014 However, fewer than half of the projects examined delivered results meeting the beneficiaries\u2019 needs. \u2014 Overall the projects examined promoted the use of standard technology and locally available ma- terials: they were sustainable in technical terms. \u2014 For a majority of projects, results and benefits will not continue to flow in the medium and long term unless non-tariff revenue is ensured; or because of institutional weaknesses (weak capacity by opera- tors to run the equipment installed). \u2014 The Commission\u2019s project management proce- dures cover sustainability comprehensively but the Commission did not make good use of those procedures to increase the likelihood that projects will bring lasting benefits. IV. The Court recommends that in a number of respects the Commission should make better use of its exist- ing procedures, so as to maximise the benefits from EU development expenditure in this area and sector.

        "7 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR: ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES 1. Improvements in water supply and sanitation are critical elements in meeting the millennium development goals (MDGs) 1 . Safe drinking water and sanitation contribute to economic growth and reducing poverty, mainly through better public health 2 and support other development objectives including gender equality and food and nutrition security. 2. The sector presents some characteristic challenges. The systems installed need to be environmentally sustainable, avoiding both degradation of water resources, for example by overuse, and ecological damage such as results from inadequate sanitation and waste water disposal systems. 3. Sanitation improvements usually need changes in personal behaviour, and so depend on hygiene campaigns to achieve general social accept- ance and adoption. And particularly in rural areas, operational tasks, minor maintenance and financial management generally fall not to a permanent agency but to local people who need both training and support in establishing suitable institutions. 4. MDGs include a specific target (MDG 7, target 7c) for water and sanita- tion, which is to \u2018halve, by 2015 (by reference to 1990), the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation\u2019. The WHO/Unicef Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation is the United Nations\u2019 mechanism for monitoring progress towards the water and sanitation MDGs. 5. According to the 2012 JMP report, the world has reached the drinking water target, although it is unlikely to meet the target for sanitation. Urban\u2013rural disparities are striking: worldwide, 79 % of the people still lacking an improved drinking-water source, and 72 % of those without improved sanitation, live in rural areas 3 . er ci1 The millennium development goals were established by the United Nations Millennium Declaration, signed in September 2000 by 189 nations (http://www. un.org/millennium/ declaration/ares552e.pdf), to free people from extreme poverty and multiple deprivations by 2015. Those goals refer to eradication of poverty and hunger, universal education, gender equality, child health, maternal health, the fight against HIV/AIDS, environmental sustainability and the global partnership for development. Water and sanitation are included under MDG 7 on environmental sustainability; however, they make a key contribution to the achievements of all MDGs. 2 The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 6,3 % of deaths worldwide (8 % if considering only developing countries) could be prevented through better water supply, sanitation and hygiene. The majority of those preventable deaths are children in developing countries. 3 The Unicef/WHO JMP defines an improved drinking water source as one that is protected from outside contamination, in particular from contamination with faecal matter. It considers the following as improved sources of water: piped water into dwelling, yard or plot; public tap or standpipe; tubewell or borehole; protected dug well; protected spring; and rainwater collection. An improved sanitation facility is defined as one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact, such as: flush or pour-flush to piped sewer system, septic tank, pit latrine; ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with slab; or composting toilet (http:// www.wssinfo.org/definitions- methods/introduction/). INTRODUCTION ",
        "8 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 6. Water and sanitation targets are far from being met in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2010, 39 % of the population had no access to an improved source of drinking water and 70 % were without improved sanitation facilities. The respective targets were 25 % and 36 %. 7. Estimates of the funding (additional to that already planned) needed to meet the MDGs for water and sanitation differ significantly. The World Bank published an estimate of the funding gap in sub-Saharan Afri- ca (both urban and rural areas) of 11,8 billion US dollars a year from 2011 to 2015 4 . The Marseille Declaration of March 2012 5 , on the other hand, quotes 8 billion US dollars as the total additional sum to be mo - bilised over the period from 2012 to 2015 to meet these targets in the whole of rural Africa. EU POLICY AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR WATER AND SANITATION POLICIES 8. EU development assistance for water and sanitation is guided by the 2002 Commission communication on water management 6 , as endorsed by the Council resolution of 30 May 2002 on water management in de - veloping countries 7 . The importance of water in EU development assis- tance was reiterated in the 2005 EU Consensus on Development 8 . 9. The 2002 Commission communication identifies, as one of the main objectives of development assistance, ensuring a supply to every human being, especially the poorest, of sufficient drinking water of good quality and adequate means of waste disposal. 4 Table 8.7 in Sudeshna Ghosh Banerjee and Elvira Morella, Africa\u2019s water and sanitation infrastructure: Access, affordability, and alternatives , World Bank, 2011. 5 Declaration of the Conference on the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative and the African Water Facility, Marseille, 14 March 2012 (http://www.afdb.org/fihttp:// www.afdb.org/fileadmin/ uploads/afdb/Documents/ Generic-Documents/RWSSI- AWF%20Conference%20 Declaration%20Final%20 14%20Mar%202012.pdf). 6 COM(2002) 132 final of 12 March 2002 \u2014 Water management in developing countries: Policy and priorities for EU development cooperation. 7 Council document 9696/02. 8 Paragraphs 80 and 81 of the European Consensus on Development (OJ C 46, 24.2.2006): water (together with energy) is included amongst the nine priority areas for EU development policy.

Stemming from the communication, at the 2002 World Summit on Sus- tainable Development in Johannesburg the EU launched a Water Initia- tive (EUWI) designed to help achieve the MDGs for drinking water and sanitation (see Box 1 ). FINANCING 11. The EU channels funds for water and sanitation through both thematic and geographical (national and regional) programmes 9 . Furthermore, the EU provides funds in the context of humanitarian aid operations. 12. The Commission\u2019s external actions information system, the Common Relex Information System (CRIS), shows that expenditure on water and sanitation in sub-Saharan countries between 2001 and 2010 was 1 010 million euro (see Annex I ). However, since funding for water and sanitation also features in other sectors of assistance, such as rural de- velopment, agriculture, environment, health and education, the total amount of the support provided by the Commission will have been higher. 9 European Development Funds (EDF) for the ACP countries and, for the 2007\u20132013 financial framework, the Development Cooperation Instrument for Asia and Latin America and the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument for neighbourhood countries. BOX 1 OBJECTIVES OF THE EU WATER INITIATIVE The EUWI aims to: \u2014 reinforce political commitment to action and raising the profile of water and sanitation issues in the context of poverty reduction efforts; \u2014 promote better water governance arrangements (through strengthening institutional capacity and pub- lic\u2013private partnerships); \u2014 improve coordination and cooperation in the implementation of water and sanitation-related interventions; \u2014 encourage regional and subregional cooperation in the framework of integrated water resource manage- ment; and \u2014 catalyse additional funding.

        "10 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries AUDIT SCOPE AND APPROACH 13. The audit assessed whether EU development assistance for drinking water supply and sanitation in six sub-Saharan countries selected for their financial significance amongst the 10 most important recipients is leading to sustainable results. It focused on the following two questions: (a) Were the planned results of the projects financed by the EU achieved, and are they sustainable? (b) Did the Commission take appropriate steps to ensure sustainable results in water supply and sanitation? 14. The audit considered whether projects met the technical, financial and institutional conditions necessary for them to be sustainable. To the extent possible, consideration was also given to whether the projects also had social and environmental impacts 10 . 15. The audit work was carried out between February and December 2011. It included detailed examination of EU-funded water and sanitation pro- jects in six beneficiary countries: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania (see Annex II ). Visits to Burkina Faso, Nigeria and Tanzania were carried out between April and July 2011. 16. The audit examined a sample of 23 projects and programmes, under contracts financed through the seventh, eighth and ninth European De- velopment Funds, including the first ACP\u2013EU Water Facility (funded by the ninth EDF), and from the EU general budget. The total cost of these contracts was over 400 million euro, 49 % of which was funded by the EU. Annex III provides a list of all projects and programmes selected for the audit. 10 In line with the Commission position as expressed in COM(2002) 132 final, \u2018The strategic approach for sustainable access to and management of water resources integrates sectoral and cross-cutting issues and encompasses all aspects of sustainability.

The Court\u2019s visits and analyses of reports showed that appropriate equip- ment for water supply had been installed for all the projects.

At the time of the audit, information was available (either from EU dele- gations or as a result of inspection by the Court\u2019s auditors) about the current operation of: \u2014 water-supply equipment in 18 of the 23 projects; \u2014 sanitation facilities in 10 of the 17 projects with a sanitation com- ponent.

The project financed the construction of simple water-supply systems (boreholes and a water network) which were in good condition and functioning correctly at the time of the auditors\u2019 visit (July 2011). In addition, household latrines were built using locally available materials. The project did more than provide infrastructure. By helping local communities identify for themselves what they needed from the project, it aimed to make long-lasting changes in behaviour. Water consumer associations participated in the discussions on the technical specifications of the water-supply and sanitation systems, tak- ing into account the needs of the customers, and were in charge of the day-to-day operation of the systems. They received support from the water and sanitation state agency when maintenance and repairs were needed. The project has had positive effects on the lives of local communities. The small towns were visibly free from the problem of open defecation and there has been a decrease in water-borne illnesses. At the time of the audit, the project was replicated in over 100 small towns. \u2018CROSS RIVER STATE RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION\u2019, NIGERIA The beneficiary of the grant submitted an \u2018Interim narra- tive report\u2019 on 7 June 2011. This report covers the whole period of the implementation (from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010). According to the interim narrative report, the main outputs of the project had been implemented as provided by the project proposal and the grant agree- ment, with two main exceptions, namely, (a) the reduction of the number of boreholes that had been repaired to 61 (against 120 in the agreement) and (b) the abandoning of the construction of sanitation centres and latrines. In order to compensate for the reduction of the number of repaired boreholes, the grant beneficiary constructed 15 additional new boreholes.

In 10 out of the 18 projects for which information was available, the water-supply equipment installed was maintained in clean and good condition and was operating. Seven projects suffered from minor weak- nesses affecting part of the project while for one serious weaknesses were noted (see Box 3 ). 20. Out of the 10 projects with a sanitation component for which information is available, five were successful, in two cases the facilities constructed were not in operation or in adequate working order, and in three other cases there were minor weaknesses (see Annex IV ).

As regards the boreholes rehabilitated in East Gonja and West Mamprusi, the following problems were reported by a verification mission carried out in 2010: \u03bf in East Gonja, out of 17 boreholes inspected, five were not functioning and three were not in use, and \u03bf in West Mamprusi district, out of seven boreholes inspected, one was not functioning. Following a first visit carried out in 2009, it had been reported that, out of seven boreholes selected for inspec- tion in the two districts, one had not been found and three were in bad working condition. In addition, out of the 40 boreholes inspected in the West Gonja district in the context of the project\u2019s technical and financial audits conducted in 2009, three were not functioning. ",

BUT BENEFICIARIES\u2019 NEEDS WERE NOT SATISFACTORILY MET IN MOST CASES 21. The needs of beneficiaries as defined in the projects were clearly met in only two of the 23 projects audited, and met with minor weaknesses in a further six cases. In other cases there were more serious weaknesses (see Annex IV and Box 4 ). 22. With two exceptions, the entities running the facilities did not carry out regular checks to ensure that the water quality meets the minimum standards required for human consumption (see Box 5 ). 23. Difficulty in organising regular tests and the risk of contamination 11 were among the most common obstacles to achieving these standards. There- fore, the populations served are often strongly advised to boil the water before using it for drinking or cooking. FOR A MAJORITY OF PROJECTS, RESULTS AND BENEFITS WILL NOT CONTINUE TO FLOW IN THE MEDIUM AND LONG TERM UNLESS NON-TARIFF REVENUE CAN BE ENSURED 24. The Court assessed the technical, financial and institutional sustainability of the projects audited and, where possible, their social and environmen- tal impact, by analysing technical documents and inspecting projects (see paragraph 14 and Annex IV ). 11 Old water distribution pipelines and insufficiently protected water sources are among the factors that more significantly contribute to contamination of the water supplied. Even where facilities are new, if piped distribution systems are not used the processes of transport and house storage of water add to the risk of its contamination. ",
        "Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 15 BOX 4 \u2018SMALL TOWNS WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROGRAMME (STWSSP)\u2019, NIGERIA The programme included construction of boreholes, pumps and distribution networks in 24 small towns in Adamawa, Delta and Ekiti states. The plans had relied on the electricity grid to power the pumps, but in the event this supply is almost non- existent. Although standby generators were installed, sufficient diesel to run them on a routine basis is too expensive. As a result the installations, though in good operating condition, were at the time of the audit being run only on rare occasions. Potential users therefore continued to use their previous sources of water, and the programme aimed at providing a reliable improved source of drinking water had delivered practically no benefits. \u2018WATER SUPPLY PROGRAMME REGIONAL CENTRES PHASE I \u2019 , TANZANIA In Mwanza, the construction of the waste water treatment plant originally planned was postponed to Phase II, albeit the implementation of the water-supply component of the project was already completed. BOX 5 WATER QUALITY IN ANGOLA AND TANZANIA In the city of Tombwa, Angola , the entity in charge of the management of the water supply system declared that water analyses were carried out daily; however, no records of these analyses were provided to the auditors. Water provided to the suburban areas of Luanda was chemically treated in the water treatment plant before distribution, and according to the reports it met the criteria suggested by WHO guidelines. However, the water network was subject to frequent breakages which increased the possibility of water contamination during distribution to the users. In the rural areas, for the project to supply 10 villages of the northern province of Uige no water analyses were carried out due to logistical difficulties in reaching the water catchment area. In Tanzania , the rural project to supply water to villages in Njombe could count on support from the local laboratory for water analysis, although quality tests were carried out irregularly. However, local farmers had recently planted barley near the water catchment area, using chemical fertilisers and pesticides. The local la- boratory was not equipped for detecting these kinds of contamination and the water samples had to be sent to the capital, which implied long waiting periods for the results of the analysis to be known and increased costs.

        "16 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries TECHNICAL SUSTAINABILITY 25. Overall the projects audited promoted the use of standard technology and locally available materials for both water-supply and sanitation com- ponents. Particularly in the case of rural projects (15 of the 23 projects), they built easy-to-maintain boreholes, dug wells equipped with hand pumps for water supply and promoted the construction of low-cost toilet models using locally available materials. 12 Council resolution on water management in developing countries: Policy and priorities for EU development cooperation (9696/02 of 7 June 2002), paragraph 7. 13 Although it has not to date been covered in EU development policy statements on water and sanitation, the use of a mix of tariffs, taxes and \u2014 for capital investment \u2014 transfers (\u2018the 3Ts\u2019) is discussed, for example, in Managing water for all (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2009). Standpipe - Burkina Faso \u00a9 European Court of Auditors FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY 26. Once handed over, the benefits of water and sanitation projects are only assured if they have sufficient reliable income to cover running costs, including routine maintenance, as well as repairs when necessary. In due course, installations will also need to be replaced or repaired. The Council concluded in 2002 that the pricing of water services should ensure financial sustainability, but added that meeting the basic needs of poor and vulnerable groups requires the design of appropriate tariff structures and collection systems 12 . National and local policies in partner countries vary, and for both practical and political reasons commonly make use of taxes and transfers as well as tariffs 13 . ",
        "17 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 27. Project designs include plans to ensure sustainability after handover, and therefore should analyse the locally available possibilities for ensuring financing, including the risks (e.g. that government funding might not be maintained, or that circumstances will make more subsidy necessary). Practical barriers to tariff-setting and collection can be addressed in the detailed design and, for example, by providing training as part of project implementation. 28. Few financial records for the operation of the systems installed were available, particularly for rural projects. The Court therefore analysed whatever documentation was available (e.g. tariff collection records and bank statements) and, where possible, discussed the financial situation with the entities responsible for operating the systems as well as the project final beneficiaries. 29. In only four of the 23 projects examined were tariffs set at a level to cover running costs. For the others unless transfers and taxes are avail- able, their sustainability is put at risk. As explained in the three following paragraphs, tariffs were influenced by factors such as: (a) perceived ability of the beneficiary population to pay for the service; (b) rejection of water charges on the grounds that government should provide free water; and (c) ineffective billing and fees collection. 30. In two rural projects in Burkina Faso (\u2018Regional solar programme \u2014 Phase II\u2019 and \u2018Auto management of drinking water and sanitation in ru- ral area of four provinces of Burkina Faso\u2019) the price was set by mayors without taking sufficiently into account the need to cover costs. This was also the case in two urban projects examined in Angola where the water price was subsidised. These provide examples where tariffs will be insufficient to cover costs and taxes or transfers will be needed to guarantee sustainability. 31. According to the agency implementing one of the projects audited in Nigeria (\u2018Cross River State rural water supply and sanitation\u2019), the local population considers water as a free social good and are against house- holds or individuals paying for drinking water. For the project \u2018Rural water supply and sanitation in the Northern Region\u2019 in Ghana, according to the final evaluation report, many water and sanitation committees did not collect water charges. ",
        "18 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 32. In eight projects, the Court noted widespread problems in billing and collection (low number of connections and significant proportion of water not billed, combined with a weak metering capacity). For example, for the project \u2018Water supply and sanitation for the suburban areas of Luanda\u2019, Angola, according to its 2010 activity report, EPAL (the public water utility of Luanda) invoiced only 46,5 % of the water produced (31,1 million euro), and only half of that was collected (15,4 million euro). INSTITUTIONAL SUSTAINABILITY 33. As regards institutional sustainability, it is important that local entities such as water user associations and committees should be empowered to manage and operate the installations and that they should have ac- cess to necessary skills and technical expertise. 34. The projects audited ensured that the beneficiaries were involved in the original choices made and generally included development of the necessary local technical knowledge and expertise. 35. However, in seven of the projects audited, the responsible entities were unable to ensure that the installations operated successfully. Among the difficulties found in those cases were the lack of sufficiently developed technical skills and failure to build ownership (see Box 6 ). In practice any of these limitations may mean that equipment is not used. BOX 6 \u2018SMALL TOWNS WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROGRAMME (STWSSP)\u2019, NIGERIA The communities did not have sufficient skills to organise maintenance and repairs of the schemes and had even less capacity to implement behavioural changes. In 2006, the mid-term evaluation report suggested that the water consumer associations would need support long after civil works were finalised. The ex post monitoring report in mid-2010 found that the situation had not changed, as \u2018there was nobody in sight to move developing a community ownership model forward beyond finalisation of the works contracts\u2019. The report concluded that the lack of support to the communities was jeopardising the sustainability of the project. This was confirmed by the Court\u2019s audit. ",
        "19 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARTNER COUNTRIES 36. Where the operation of projects depends on funding, technical support or other action by partner countries' governments and local authorities, their commitment is needed to ensure sustainability. However, in the three projects where formal commitments were made they were not respected (see Box 7 ). In the other 20 projects no formal commitments were made. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 37. In the absence of relevant data and environmental indicators, it is not possible to assess the extent to which the projects audited have con- tributed to improvements in the overall living conditions of the target populations and the conservation of the environment. 38. Nevertheless, although all the projects were intended to focus on the needs of the poor, six cases were found where the poorest and most vulnerable did not have access to drinking water and basic sanitation. 39. Also, despite the wide promotion of hygiene awareness and sensitisa- tion campaigns, the relatively low importance ascribed to the sanitation component and the lack of a clear and effective integration of water, sanitation and hygiene issues significantly reduced the impact of those activities (see Box 8 ). BOX 7 \u2018DRINKING WATER SUPPLY IN THE CITY OF TOMBWA\u2019, ANGOLA The government of Angola did not respect its commitments as established in the financing agreement in terms of works (extension of the water supply system and the electrical power network), adjustment of water tariffs to their real cost and support to the restructuring process of EMAST (the public water utility of Tombwa). The government\u2019s respect of such commitments is of extreme importance to ensure sustainability of interventions. ",

Due to delays in construction of the installations, parts of the training/awareness raising actions regarding hygiene good practices could not take place or took place too early. \u2018AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO GUINEA WORM ERADICATION THROUGH WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION AND HYGIENE IN NORTHERN REGION\u2019, GHANA One out of the four key results of the pro- ject related to hygiene awareness campaigns and included activities aiming at the imple- mentation of improved hygiene behaviour practices. However the results of the activities under- taken in the area of hygiene promotion in schools and in the community were found to be largely ineffective (2009 second per- formance monitoring report and 2010 ROM report). \u2018DRINKING WATER SUPPLY IN THE CITY OF TOMBWA\u2019, ANGOLA The project did not include a sanitation component, although bad sanitation was reported in the prefeasibility studies as a major risk to the health of the population. At the time of the audit, the situation had not changed: open defecation and other poor sanitation practices which increase health hazards were still common.

        "21 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 14 Commission guidelines for water resources development cooperation (1998, updated in 2008) and a set of guidelines for the 10th EDF programming exercise (\u2018The role of water and sanitation in achieving the millennium development goals\u2019). 40. In one project (\u2018Closing the gap: improving water supply and sanitation provision for small towns in Nigeria\u2019, see Box 2 ), the implementation of hygiene awareness campaigns was a success. The communities were visibly free from the problem of open defecation. At the time of the audit, the project was replicated in over 100 small towns. Furthermore, the communities were visited by delegations from Niger (the border is 25 km away) who wanted to learn about the approach adopted so as to apply it in their country. DESPITE COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES, IMPORTANT MATTERS REGARDING SUSTAINABILITY NOT TACKLED 41. In the water sector the mechanism that the Commission most widely uses for delivery of development aid has been the project approach. Projects are not directly implemented by Commission staff, but are de- signed and carried out either by an agency under the auspices of the relevant ministry in the partner country or by an NGO or international organisation. 42. The Commission has established procedures, and provides instructions, guidance and advice on approval and monitoring. Having found that sustainability is frequently at risk (see paragraphs 25 to 40), the Court examined whether these procedures were in principle capable of giving reasonable assurance that projects would be sustainable, and whether in fact they were successfully applied in the projects examined. COMMISSION PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES COVERED SUSTAINABILITY COMPREHENSIVELY 43. The Commission provides internal guidance for each of the main phases of the project cycle: programming, identification, formulation, imple- mentation and evaluation and audit. And there are specific guidelines for water and sanitation 14 . ",
        "22 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 44. The guidelines refer throughout to sustainability and prescribe a range of actions and checks at each stage that taken together provide assur- ance that risks to sustainability are identified and managed. They include ensuring that: (a) at the programming stage, national country programmes are in line with partner country and poverty reduction strategies and consider coordination with other donors; (b) at the identification and formulation stages, satisfactory technical solutions are proposed, the availability of stable funding sources is identified and clear indicators, objectives and targets are defined. In the case of grant contracts funded by the European Commission 15 such as those under the Water Facility, the outcome of the same type of analysis is taken into account in the selection process; (c) at implementation stage, the Commission monitors progress and takes remedial action in good time; (d) in both the implementation and the evaluation and audit phases, the Commission\u2019s results-oriented monitoring (ROM) system 16 in- cludes assessment of potential and actual sustainability of results respectively in the course of and upon completion of project im- plementation; and (e) in the case of final evaluations contracted by the Commission ser- vices, the terms of reference include the need to assess sustain- ability of project results. HOWEVER, IN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CASES THE COMMISSION FAILED TO TACKLE IMPORTANT MATTERS REGARDING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF RESULTS 45. No evidence existed to show that the Commission had identified, or taken action to address, the following project design weaknesses: (a) in nine projects, important aspects of the technical specifications missing or not sufficiently explained; (b) in 11 cases, insufficiently developed economic and financial analysis; (c) in eight projects, no clearly defined objectives and in another 10 no clearly defined indicators, baseline values or targets. 15 According to paragraph 6.1.1 of the \u2018Practical guide to contract procedures for EU external actions\u2019 (January 2012 edition), a grant is a direct financial contribution, by way of a donation, from the EU budget or the EDF, in order to finance: \u2014 either an action intended to help achieve an objective forming part of a European Union policy; \u2014 or the functioning of a body which pursues an aim of general European interest or has an objective forming part of a European Union policy. 16 The results-oriented monitoring (ROM) system of the Commission was established in 2000 in order to provide external, objective and impartial feedback on the performance of aid projects and programmes financed by the EU. ROM is part of the overall quality assurance cycle of EuropeAid, which starts with the design of projects and ends after its implementation. It gives recommendations for actions while projects are ongoing. ",
        "23 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 46. Weaknesses included: (a) insufficiently detailed information on either the technical solu- tions proposed or the mitigating measures to be adopted in cases of known risks to the sustainability of the projects (particularly in cases of adverse hydrogeological conditions for the exploitation of groundwater); (b) cases where the technical solution adopted proved to be inad- equate; and (c) cases of imbalances between the water supply component and the waste water disposal and waste water treatment components of the projects. 47. Economic and financial aspects are of great importance for sustainability. Since tariffs are not usually sufficient to cover running and maintenance costs, it is crucial that stable alternative sources of funding are identified and, wherever feasible, committed before financing of project operations is approved. 48. In only one case \u2014 the \u2018Regional solar programme \u2014 Phase II\u2019 in Burkina Faso \u2014 was financial sustainability extensively discussed in the financ- ing proposal. In 11 other cases, the documents reviewed do not indi- cate how it was planned to fund maintenance and replacement of the infrastructure. 49. Moreover, the particularly difficult context in which the projects operate (low income communities, lack of willingness to pay for water, etc.), and the difficulty of generating sufficient funds to cover their running costs (see paragraph 29), called for analysis at assessment stage of how financ- ing gaps were to be filled, and would have justified making the financing decision dependent on particular commitments in that respect. This was not the case for any of the projects audited. ",
        "24 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 50. The lack of clear definition of project objectives relates mainly to equip- ment planned, its level of operation (quantity and quality) and the target population expected to benefit from project results. The lack of clear and quantified measures significantly hampered the Commission\u2019s ability to monitor progress during implementation and later to measure and check whether the results achieved were sustained over time or not (see Box 9 ). 51. The Commission monitored 18 out of the 23 projects using the ROM procedure. For eight of them, there is no evidence that the Commission acted on the recommendations made in the ROM reports. 52. Final evaluations are, as a rule, launched before or shortly after comple - tion of project activities, and thus are too early to assess sustainability. On the other hand ex-post monitoring or ex post evaluations are carried out well after the end of the project to specifically address the issue of sustainability. Whilst 10 of the 23 projects examined were subject to final evaluation, in only two cases out of 20 that could have been subject to ex post monitoring did this occur 17 . Details can be found in Annex V . 53. Finally, it should be noted that other factors relevant for the sustainability of project results are outside the Commission\u2019s control, for example the reliability of data used to measure the impact of the projects (such as health, education and environment). 17 Ex post monitoring is generally initiated within two years after completion of the project. BOX 9 \u2018REDUCING CHILD MORTALITY AND INCREASING SCHOOL ATTENDANCE BY IMPROVING ACCESS TO WATER AND SANITATION IN RURAL AREAS OF ANGOLA\u2019 The project proposal did not specify the locations for construction of water supply and sanitation infrastructure and it failed to set clear outcomes in terms of water quality. \u2018RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION IN THE NORTHERN REGION\u2019, GHANA There were no consistent data available on the population targeted by the project: whilst the feasibility study carried out in 2000 referred to a total population of 576 000 inhabitants in 865 villages in the three districts con - cerned, the mid-term evaluation report referred to a population of 386 000 inhabitants in 2002 in the same area. \u20186TH MICRO PROJECTS\u2019 PROGRAMME\u2019, GHANA Although the project documents referred to increased access to drinking water, no targets were set in terms of water quantity and quality.

        "25 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries CONCLUSIONS 54. For the projects covered by the Court\u2019s audit, equipment had been in- stalled as planned and was in working order (see paragraphs 17 to 20). However, fewer than half the projects delivered results meeting the ben- eficiaries\u2019 needs (see paragraphs 21 to 23). For a majority of projects, results and benefits will not continue to flow in the medium and long term unless non-tariff revenue is ensured (see paragraphs 24 to 36). 55. The technology used was found to be appropriate (see paragraph 25). 56. However, the tariffs set for water did not cover all the costs, either be- cause they had been set on the basis of the ability to pay, or because of lack of willingness to pay and ineffective billing and collection. The long-term running costs resulting from the projects were therefore de- pendent on other funding (see paragraphs 26 to 32). 57. In seven of the projects, the operators did not have the capacities to fulfil their responsibilities because of lack of sufficiently developed technical skills or failure to build ownership (see paragraphs 33 to 35). In the three projects where formal commitments by partner governments were made they were not respected (see paragraph 36). 58. Although the Court found both good and bad examples of social and environmental impacts, in the absence of relevant data and environmen- tal indicators, it is not possible to assess the projects\u2019 contributions (see paragraphs 37 to 40). 59. Although its project management procedures covered sustainability comprehensively, in the projects examined the Commission failed to tackle important matters regarding the sustainability of results. At pro- ject design stage, the technical solutions proposed (eight projects) and financial viability (11 projects) were not sufficiently analysed. For 18 pro - jects clear objectives, indicators and targets were not defined (see para- graphs 41 to 50). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ",
        "26 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 60. Monitoring, verification and evaluation reports were not fully used, limit- ing the Commission\u2019s capacity to introduce corrective measures. More- over, in most of the completed projects, the absence of ex post monitor- ing or evaluations did not allow a useful assessment of the sustainability of results (see paragraphs 51 to 52). 61. EU support has thus increased access to drinking water and basic sanita- tion in the six sub-Saharan countries audited, using standard technol- ogy and locally available materials, though meeting beneficiaries\u2019 needs in fewer than half of the projects examined. For a majority of projects results and benefits will not continue to flow in the medium and long term unless non-tariff revenue can be ensured. Despite comprehensive management procedures, the Commission did not tackle important mat- ters regarding sustainability. RECOMMENDATIONS 62. To maximise the benefits from EU development expenditure in this area and sector, the Commission should: (a) ensure that its procedures are properly applied, especially concern- ing the following points at project appraisal stage: (i) the definition of explicit project objectives (quantities, type of equipment, location, direct and indirect beneficiaries); (ii) the description of and justification for the technological solu- tions proposed (wherever applicable, with reference to alter- native options); and (iii) establishment of objective verifiable progress indicators, as well as baseline values and quantified targets for project results; (b) carry out sufficient economic and financial analysis to allow easy identification of the expected sources of project funding in the future (including estimated contribution amounts and timing); (c) explicitly consider before project approval whether the conditions for success, including partner country commitments, are likely to be met; (d) ensure that full use is made of the results of monitoring, verifica- tion and evaluation work, and that recommendations made in the reports are considered and carried out.

        "37 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries EXECUTIVE SUMMARY I. The Commission welcomes the report of the Court of Audi- tors on the EU development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa. II. The total EU contribution to the 23 selected projects amounts to 219 million euro while the Commission con- tracted more than 1 billion euro for water and sanitation projects in 46 sub-Saharan African countries from 2001 to 2010. The Court\u2019s audit thus covered 22 % of the amount contracted. The Commission is of the view that care must be taken in drawing any general conclusions from the results of the Court\u2019s examination of these 23 diverse projects. III. Second indent In most projects several needs were identified, of which at least one or more were met. A lot of projects were very ambitious and some needs, mainly secondary ones, were not fulfilled. III. Fifth indent Most of the audited projects were approved before the establishment of quality support groups (QSG) effective as from 2005. IV. The Commission takes note of the recommendation of the Court and will continue to improve the quality of devel- opment cooperation practices and operations and ensure that the existing procedures are fully implemented.

        "REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 38 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries OBSERVATIONS In most projects several needs were identified of which at least one or more were met. A lot of projects were very ambitious and some needs, mainly secondary ones, were not fulfilled. Box 2 \u2014 \u2018Closing the gap\u2019: improving water supply and sanitation provision for small towns in Nigeria \u2014 Second paragraph Following the \u2018Closing the gap\u2019 project in Nigeria, the State government of Jigawa has adopted the strategy of com- munity ownership and management which is now applied throughout the state. Box 2 \u2014 \u2018Cross River State rural water supply and sanitation\u2019, Nigeria In the \u2018Cross River State rural water supply and sanitation\u2019 project in Nigeria, changes were necessary because there were fewer broken down boreholes to be repaired than expected, which is actually a positive sign of the sustain- ability of rural water schemes in Cross River State. The change in sanitation was in line with international development practice whereby subsidies for latrines have been discontinued. Instead the community-led total sani- tation (CLTS) approach was successfully adopted. 19. The Commission takes note that in 17 out of 18 projects for which information was available, the equipment installed was either well maintained and operated or suffered from only minor weaknesses. For the remaining one, the men- tioned weaknesses directly relate to an external factor (very difficult hydrogeological conditions \u2014 see Box 3). Box 3 \u2014 Second paragraph As regards the number of non-functioning boreholes in East Gonja and West Mamprusi in the framework of the \u2018Rural water supply and sanitation\u2019 project in the Northern Region of Ghana, it is worth mentioning that these areas were prone to guinea worm infection and thereby in need of urgent interventions. For that reason and despite the difficult hydrogeological conditions and the risks of low yields or drying schemes during the drought periods, regional and local authori- ties, government line services and the agency in charge of rural water (CWSA) have pushed ahead with drilling several boreholes in these two districts. 20. The Commission takes note that eight out of 10 projects with a sanitation component were found to be successful or to have only minor weaknesses. 21. In most projects several needs were identified, of which at least one or more were met. A lot of projects were very ambitious and some needs, mainly secondary ones, were not fulfilled. Box 4 \u2014 \u2018Small towns water supply and sanitation programme (STWSSP)\u2019, Nigeria In the \u2018Small towns water supply and sanitation\u2019 pro- gramme (STWSSP) in Nigeria, the community development component (community ownership and management) was not completed by the end of the project. Indeed, the EDF funding for the STWSSP was stopped when it was no longer possible to extend the financing agreement for the project. The financing agreement was signed in 2001 but activities did not start until 2003. The population has therefore not been sensitised to the need to cover running costs of the generators. During the successor projects, this issue will be taken up as one of the priorities. Box 4 \u2014 \u2018Water supply programme regional cen- tres phase I\u2019, Tanzania In the water supply programme in Tanzania (Regional cen- tres phase I), the waste water treatment plant was post- poned for economic and administrative reasons. The total amount allocated (co-financed) to the action was insuf- ficient after the procurement of the works (offers higher than engineer estimates) for the water treatment plant. ",
        "39 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 22. The Commission agrees that setting up sustainable water quality control mechanisms is a very important issue that needs to be duly addressed when formulating and imple- menting projects. See also the Commission's reply to Box 5. 23. Ensuring that the water quality meets the minimum stand- ards required for human consumption is a prerequisite before acceptance of the water schemes. In parallel and in order to avoid any contamination, the beneficiaries are sensitised to the correct use of water, water source protec- tion, hygiene promotion and wastewater disposal. However, given the risk of future contamination and the difficulty in organising regular water quality tests, the Commission believes that advising the population to boil the water before using it is the right approach and contrib- utes to building confidence between services which are still weak and the consumers. Box 5 In Angola, the water supply system of Tombwa has a small laboratory. The province of Namibe also has a laboratory, which facilitates the analyses. Regarding the project in the suburban areas of Luanda, besides treatment of water collection, there is also an additional treatment in the distribution centres. Through awareness-raising actions, each user, including those that supply via standpipes, receives instructions on water care and the appropriate treatment to undertake at home. Treatment is not done at each fountain. The lack of suitable equipment on the spot made it diffi- cult to carry out water analyses in remote water catchment areas. The Commission highlights the fact that an on-going project will supply laboratory equipment for some prov- inces (including U\u00edge) suitable for reaching those areas. 27. In order to address financial sustainability issues, the Com- mission recognises the need for capacity building and training at all levels as a major component during project implementation. 28. The rejection of water charges on the ground and the lack of capacity of the responsible entities are even more prom- inent in rural areas. This is the reason why the Commission supports the setting up of local structures to help these entities in the long term. 29. \u2013 30. For the Commission, establishing the water sector on a financially sustainable basis requires establishing the appropriate balance between tariffs, transfers and taxes (3Ts). 29. (a) The ability of the beneficiary population to pay for the service is assessed at the beginning of the projects when socioeconomic surveys are carried out. The results of these surveys are used to evaluate the financial viability of the projects. 29. (b) The rejection of water charges on the ground is a major issue, which needs to be addressed through extensive sen- sitisation campaigns. Behavioral changes usually take more time than project implementation. 29. (c) Capacity building and extensive training are key ele- ments which support the operators with billing and fees collection. ",
        "REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 40 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 31. See the Commission's reply to paragraph 29 (b). In Nigeria, in many parts of the country, water is consid- ered as a free social good by governments, politicians and the general public. Changes will take time but the Com- mission is supporting corresponding reform efforts. In Ghana, the project faced a lot of issues with the techni- cal assistance team and CWSA, the water and sanitation Government's partner, has not fulfilled its contractual obli- gations. The above reasons have led to the implementation of a project with mitigated results. 32. See the Commission's reply to paragraph 29 (c). Urban water, small towns and rural projects have specific operation and maintenance arrangements. Improving bill- ing and collection in urban areas is a project on its own since it entails extensive sensitisation, training and capac- ity building. 33. The Commission fully supports reforms of the water supply and sanitation sector which empower water user associa- tions and communities to own, manage and operate their water supply installations (sometimes with the support of the local authorities or the private sector). 35. The Court's observation highlights the critical importance of undertaking capacity-building and training activities for the entities responsible to successfully operate the installations. This is even more important in remote rural areas in which the literacy and education level of the population is very low. This is the reason why the Commission supports the set- ting up of local structures to help the entities responsible in the long term. See also the Commission's reply to Box 6. Box 6 In the Nigerian \u2018Small towns water supply and sanitation\u2019 project (STWSSP), the EDF funding was stopped when it was no longer possible to extend the financing agreement, which was signed in 2001. It has therefore left the com- munity development aspect of the project insufficiently attended to. Capacity-building and training activities for the communi- ties concerned will be taken up in the successor projects. 36. Respect for partner countries' commitments is a key issue, which is very difficult to tackle. In Ghana, the water sector has been decentralised (financial and managerial respon- sibilities) in order to avoid these problems. The district assemblies (municipalities) are the only entities responsi- ble for supervision and assistance to the water boards. Box 7 In Angola, works are under way for home network reha- bilitation and extension, i.e. smaller diameter pipes, includ- ing the replacement of galvanised iron pipes over 50 years old with polyethylene and the installation of water meters. Also under construction are a few water kiosks, including laundries in the peri-urban zone. The government has restored the power line which sup- plies the city. The conditions have therefore been created for the installation, from this line, of power extensions for each group (collection and distribution). Tariffs will be increased once the works of the network rehabilitation and the installation of the meters are complete. 37. In many countries, the lack of reliable statistical data is a major problem for the establishment of project indica - tors on the environment. ",
        "41 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 38. The choice of the final beneficiaries sometimes depends on the decisions of the local authorities. However, the Commission will make sure that the needs of the poor are duly addressed in future projects. 39. The Commission agrees with the Court that the sanita- tion component has not been sufficiently addressed in the past. The Commission now acknowledges its importance and requests hygiene and sanitation to be duly addressed when submitting proposals for the Water Facility. Box 8 \u2014 \u2018Regional solar programme \u2014 Phase II\u2019, Burkina Faso In Burkina Faso, the sanitation component is now duly taken into account under the 10th EDF. Box 8 \u2014 \u2018An integrated approach to Guinea worm eradication through water supply, sanitation and hygiene in Northern Region\u2019, Ghana In Ghana, at the time the mid-term and the result-oriented evaluations were carried out, all the boreholes (250) in the communities were not already drilled (delayed activity according to schedule). The construction work was com- pleted late in 2010 and 2011 and more improvements on the sanitation aspects were observed. However, the obser- vation remains pertinent. Box 8 \u2014 \u2018Drinking water supply in the city of Tombwa\u2019, Angola In Angola, under the ongoing project, the municipality of Tombwa will benefit from some environmental sanitation improvements, through the community-led total sanitation (CLTS) approach. 40. The Commission is pleased that the Court recognises the fact that the community-led total approach (CLTS) was a success in Nigeria. The same approach is now being implemented in Ghana in rural areas and is enforced as a national policy. \u2018Despite comprehensive management procedures, important matters regarding sustainability not tackled\u2019 In most of the projects audited, the Commission tackled important matters regarding the sustainability of results. Most of the audited projects were approved before the establishment of quality support groups (QSG) effective as from 2005. 41. The Commission wishes to highlight that in most cases, it delegates the responsibility for project implementation to the beneficiary country, which becomes in turn the con- tracting authority (Lom\u00e9 and Cotonou agreements). \u2018However, in a significant number of cases the Commission failed to tackle important matters regarding the sustainability of results\u2019 In most of the projects audited, the Commission tackled important matters regarding the sustainability of results. 45. Most of the audited projects were approved before the establishment of quality support groups (QSG) in 2005. 45. (b) In the QSG mechanism, one of the quality checks required at formulation stage is to make sure that the proposed projects are supported by sound economic and financial analyses. 45. (c) In the QSG mechanism, one of the quality checks required at formulation stage is to make sure that clear objectives, indicators, baseline values and targets are defined. 47. The Commission recognises the key importance of the eco- nomic and financial aspects with regard to sustainability. ",
        "REPLY OF THE COMMISSION 42 Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 48. In the QSG mechanism, established in 2005, one of the quality checks required at formulation stage is to make sure that financial sustainability issues are duly addressed. 49. The financing decision, which is formalised by the signa- ture of a financing agreement with the beneficiary country, includes details of the government's commitment. The Commission agrees that the fulfilment of partner countries' commitments is a key issue that needs to be addressed at the early stages of project implementation. 50. In the QSG mechanism, established in 2005, one of the quality checks required at formulation stage is to make sure that clear objectives, indicators, baseline values and targets are defined. Box 9 \u2014 \u2018Reducing child mortality and increasing school attendance by improving access to water and sanitation in rural areas of Angola\u2019 In many projects in rural areas, there is a self-selection and demand-driven process at the beginning of the project to select the beneficiary communities based on a set of indicators. Box 9 \u2014 \u2018Rural water supply and sanitation in the Northern Region\u2019, Ghana Regarding the lack of available and reliable data in the rural water supply and sanitation project in the Northern Region of Ghana, the Commission agrees that this is a key issue in many projects. Box 9 \u2014 \u20186th micro projects programme\u2019, Ghana For the micro-project in Ghana, the Commission wishes to highlight the fact that the water component of the project represented less than 10 % of the total budget. At the end, 20 boreholes were equipped with hand-pumps. 51. The Court mentions that in eight projects out of the 18 projects that were monitored, there is no evidence that the Commission acted on the recommendations made. Depending on the type of recommendations, the Com- mission may at times only be able to verbally advise those responsible for project implementation. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS CONCLUSIONS 54. In most projects several needs were identified of which at least one or more were met. A lot of projects were very ambitious and some needs, mainly secondary ones, were not fulfilled. 56. For most countries, the cost is to be covered by tariffs, taxes and transfers. This approach is even more relevant to the African context. 57. Despite difficulties, the Commission will continue to work with governments, local authorities and civil society in order to improve ownership and sustainability of projects. Capacity development is one of the most critical dimen- sions of project implementation and its success depends on social and political factors which are often out of the scope of the project. 59. In most of the projects audited, the Commission tackled important matters regarding the sustainability of results. Most of the audited projects were approved before the establishment of quality support groups (QSG) effective as from 2005. ",
        "43 REPLY OF THE COMMISSION Special Report No 13/2012 \u2013 European Union development assistance for drinking water supply and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan countries 61. Most of the audited projects were approved before the establishment of quality support groups (QSG) in 2005. Notwithstanding this, in most of the projects audited, the Commission tackled important matters regarding the sus- tainability of results. In addition, in most projects several needs were identified, of which at least one or more were met. A lot of projects were very ambitious and some needs, mainly secondary ones, were not fulfilled. RECOMMENDATIONS 62. (a) With the establishment of the QSG mechanism in 2005, greatly improved rules are now applied during the identifi- cation and the formulation phases. 62. (a) (i) The Commission agrees with this recommendation. At pre- sent, these issues are examined by the project studies that should be ready before the approval of the project by the Commission. 62. (a) (ii) Following the existing rules, the Commission always tries to adopt technologies adapted to the specific country con- ditions and the capacity of the beneficiary country. 62. (a) (iii) According to the present rules, these indicators should be mentioned in the logframe of each project. 62. (b) The Commission agrees with this recommendation. For all projects including works, these issues are also examined by the project studies before the funding decision of the Commission. 62. (c) The Commission agrees with this recommendation. The partner country policy and the contribution of each pro- ject to the objectives of this policy are currently examined during the formulation phase. 62. (d) The Commission agrees with this recommendation. Les- sons learnt and complementary actions are mentioned at the formulation phase and are now considered before pro- ject approval. ",
