PURPOSE (a) The main purpose of the Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits, referred to throughout this document as the Arrangement, is to provide a framework for the orderly use of officially supported export credits. (b) The Arrangement seeks to foster a level playing field for official support, as defined in Article 5(a), in order to encourage competition among exporters based on quality and price of goods and services exported rather than on the most favourable officially supported financial terms and conditions. 2. STATUS The Arrangement, developed within the OECD framework, initially came into effect in April 1978 and is of indefinite duration. The Arrangement is a Gentlemen's Agreement among the Participants; it is not an OECD Act ( 1 ), although it receives the administrative support of the OECD Secretariat (here \u00ad after: \u2018the Secretariat\u2019). 3. PARTICIPATION The Participants to the Arrangement currently are: Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United States. Other OECD Members and non-members may be invited to become Participants by the current Participants. 4. INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO NON-PARTICIPANTS (a) The Participants undertake to share information with non-Participants on notifications related to official support as set out in Article 5(a). (b) A Participant shall, on the basis of reciprocity, reply to a request from a non-Participant in a competitive situation on the financial terms and conditions offered for its official support, as it would reply to a request from a Participant. 5. SCOPE OF APPLICATION The Arrangement shall apply to all official support provided by or on behalf of a government for export of goods and/or services, including financial leases, which have a repayment term of two years or more. \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) As defined in Article 5 of the OECD Convention.

(2) Official financing support: \u2014 direct credit/financing and refinancing, or \u2014 interest rate support. (3) Any combination of the above. (b) The Arrangement shall apply to tied aid; the procedures set out in Chapter IV shall also apply to trade-related untied aid. (c) The Arrangement does not apply to exports of Military Equipment and Agricultural Commodities. (d) Official support shall not be provided if there is clear evidence that the contract has been structured with a purchaser in a country which is not the final destination of the goods, primarily with the aim of obtaining more favourable repayment terms. 6. SECTOR UNDERSTANDINGS (a) The following Sector Understandings are part of the Arrangement: \u2014 Ships (Annex I) \u2014 Nuclear Power Plants (Annex II) \u2014 Civil Aircraft (Annex III) \u2014 Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation, and Water Projects (Annex IV) \u2014 Rail Infrastructure (Annex V) \u2014 Coal-Fired Electricity Generation Projects (Annex VI). (b) A Participant to either Annex I, II, IV or V may apply the respective provisions for official support for export of goods and/or services covered by the relevant Sector Understandings. Where a Sector Understanding does not include a corresponding provision to that of the Arrangement, a Participant to that Sector Understanding shall apply the provision of the Arrangement. (c) For the export of goods and/or services covered by Annex III, the Participants that are also Participants to that Sector Understanding shall apply the provisions of that Sector Understanding. (d) For the export of goods and/or services covered by Annex VI, the corresponding provisions of that Annex shall be applied in lieu of those of the Arrangement. Where Annex VI does not include a corresponding provision to that of the Arrangement, a Participant to that Sector Under \u00ad standing shall apply the provisions of the Arrangement. 7. PROJECT FINANCE (a) The Participants may apply the terms and conditions set out in Annex VII to the export of goods and/or services for transactions that meet the criteria set out in Appendix 1 of Annex VII. \u25bc M3 ",
        "02011R1233 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.03.2018 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 10 (b) Paragraph (a) above applies to the export of goods and services covered by the Sector Understanding on Export Credits for Nuclear Power Plants, the Sector Understanding on Export Credits for Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation, and Water Projects, the Sector Understanding on Export Credits for Railway Infrastructure, and the Sector Understanding on Export Credits for Coal-Fired Electricity Generation Projects. (c) Paragraph (a) above does not apply to the export of goods and services covered by the Sector Understanding on Export Credits for Civil Aircraft or the Sector Understanding on Export Credits for Ships. 8. WITHDRAWAL A Participant may withdraw by notifying the Secretariat in writing by means of instant communication, e.g. the OECD On-Line Information System (OLIS). The withdrawal takes effect 180 calendar days after receipt of the notification by the Secretariat. 9. MONITORING The Secretariat shall monitor the implementation of the Arrangement. CHAPTER II FINANCIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR EXPORT CREDITS Financial terms and conditions for export credits encompass all the provisions set out in this Chapter which shall be read in conjunction one with the other. The Arrangement sets out limitations on terms and conditions that may be officially supported. The Participants recognise that more restrictive financial terms and conditions than those provided for by the Arrangement traditionally apply to certain trade or industrial sectors. The Participants shall continue to respect such customary financial terms and conditions, in particular the principle by which repayment terms do not exceed the useful life of the goods. 10. DOWN PAYMENT, MAXIMUM OFFICIAL SUPPORT AND LOCAL COSTS (a) The Participants shall require purchasers of goods and services which are the subject of official support to make down payments of a minimum of 15 % of the export contract value at or before the starting point of credit as defined in Annex XV. For the assessment of down payments, the export contract value may be reduced proportionally if the transaction includes goods and services from a third country which are not officially supported. Financing/insurance of 100 % of the premium is permissible. Premium may or may not be included in the export contract value. Retention payments made after the starting point of credit are not regarded as down payment in this context. (b) Official support for such down payments shall only take the form of insurance or guarantee against the usual pre-credit risks. (c) Except as provided for in paragraphs (b) and (d), the Participants shall not provide official support in excess of 85 % of the export contract value, including third country supply but excluding local costs. \u25bc M3 ",

(2) It shall not be provided on terms more favourable/less restrictive than those agreed for the related exports. (3) Where official support for local cost exceeds 15 % of the export contract value, such official support shall be subject to prior notifi \u00ad cation, pursuant to Article 48, specifying the nature of the local costs being supported. 11. CLASSIFICATION OF COUNTRIES FOR MAXIMUM REPAYMENT TERMS (a) Category I countries are High Income ( 1 ) OECD countries. All other countries are in Category II. (b) The following operational criteria and procedures apply when classifying countries: (1) Classification for Arrangement purposes is determined by per capita GNI as calculated by the World Bank for the purposes of the World Bank classification of borrowing countries. (2) In cases where the World Bank does not have enough information to publish per capita GNI data, the World Bank shall be asked to estimate whether the country in question has per capita GNI above or below the current threshold. The country shall be classified according to the estimate unless the Participants decide to act otherwise. (3) If a country is reclassified in accordance with Article 11(a), the reclassification will take effect two weeks after the conclusions drawn from the above-mentioned data from the World Bank have been communicated to all Participants by the Secretariat. (4) In cases where the World Bank revises figures, such revisions shall be disregarded in relation to the Arrangement. Nevertheless, the classification of a country may be changed by way of a Common Line and Participants would favourably consider a change due to errors and omissions in the figures subsequently recognised in the same calendar year in which the figures were first distributed by the Secretariat. (c) A country will change category only after its World Bank category has remained unchanged for two consecutive years. 12. MAXIMUM REPAYMENT TERMS Without prejudice to Article 13, the maximum repayment term varies according to the classification of the country of destination determined by the criteria in Article 11. (a) For Category I countries, the maximum repayment term is five years, with the possibility of agreeing up to eight-and-a-half years when the procedures for prior notification set out in Article 48 are followed. (b) For Category II countries, the maximum repayment term is 10 years. \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) Defined by the World Bank on an annual basis according to per capita GNI. ",

REPAYMENT TERMS FOR NON-NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (a) For non-nuclear power plants not covered by Annex VI, the maximum repayment term shall be 12 years. If a Participant intends to support a repayment term longer than that provided for in Article 12, the Participant shall give prior notification in accordance with the procedure in Article 48. (b) Non-nuclear power plants are complete power stations, or parts thereof, not fuelled by nuclear power; they include all components, equipment, materials and services (including the training of personnel) directly required for the construction and commissioning of such non-nuclear power stations. This does not include items for which the buyer is usually responsible, in particular costs associated with land development, roads, construction villages, power lines, and switchyard and water supply located outside the power plant site boundary, as well as costs arising in the buyer's country from official approval procedures (e.g. site permits, construction permit, fuel loading permits), except: (1) in cases where the buyer of the switchyard is the same as the buyer of the power plant, the maximum repayment term for the original switchyard shall be the same as that for the non-nuclear power plant (i.e. 12 years); and (2) the maximum repayment term for sub-stations, transformers and transmission lines with a minimum voltage threshold of 100 kV shall be the same as that for the non-nuclear power plant. 14. REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND PAYMENT OF INTEREST (a) The principal sum of an export credit shall be repaid in equal instal \u00ad ments. (b) Principal shall be repaid and interest shall be paid no less frequently than every six months and the first instalment of principal and interest shall be made no later than six months after the starting point of credit. (c) For export credits provided in support of lease transactions, equal repayments of principal and interest combined may be applied in lieu of equal repayments of principal as set out in paragraph (a). (d) On an exceptional and duly justified basis, export credits may be provided on terms other than those set out in paragraphs (a) through (c) above. The provision of such support shall be explained by an imbalance in the timing of the funds available to the obligor and the debt service profile available under an equal, semi-annual repayment schedule, and shall comply with the following criteria: (1) No single repayment of principal or series of principal payments within a six-month period shall exceed 25 % of the principal sum of the credit. \u25bc M3 ",
        "02011R1233 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.03.2018 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 13 (2) Principal shall be repaid no less frequently than every 12 months. The first repayment of principal shall be made no later than 12 months after the starting point of credit and no less than 2 % of the principal sum of the credit shall have been repaid 12 months after the starting point of credit. (3) Interest shall be paid no less frequently than every 12 months and the first interest payment shall be made no later than six months after the starting point of credit. (4) The maximum weighted average life of the repayment period shall not exceed: \u2014 For transactions with sovereign buyers (or with a sovereign repayment guarantee), four-and-a-half years for transactions in Category I Countries and five-and-a-quarter years for Category II Countries. \u2014 For transactions with non-sovereign buyers (and with no sovereign repayment guarantee), five years for Category I Countries and six years for Category II Countries. \u2014 Notwithstanding the provisions set out in the two previous tirets , for transactions involving support for non-nuclear power plants according to Article 13, six-and-a-quarter years. (5) The Participant shall give prior notification in accordance with Article 48 that explains the reason for not providing support according to paragraphs (a) through (c) above. (e) Interest due after the starting point of credit shall not be capitalised 15. INTEREST RATES, PREMIUM RATES AND OTHER FEES (a) Interest excludes: (1) any payment by way of premium or other charge for insuring or guaranteeing supplier credits or financial credits; (2) any payment by way of banking fees or commissions relating to the export credit other than annual or semi-annual bank charges that are payable throughout the repayment period; and (3) withholding taxes imposed by the importing country. (b) Where official support is provided by means of direct credits/financing or refinancing, the premium either may be added to the face value of the interest rate or may be a separate charge; both components are to be specified separately to the Participants. 16. VALIDITY PERIOD FOR EXPORT CREDITS Financial terms and conditions for an individual export credit or line of credit, other than the validity period for the Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) set out in Article 21, shall not be fixed for a period exceeding six months prior to final commitment. 17. ACTION TO AVOID OR MINIMISE LOSSES The Arrangement does not prevent export credit authorities or financing institutions from agreeing to less restrictive financial terms and conditions than those provided for by the Arrangement, if such action is taken after the contract award (when the export credit agreement and ancillary documents have already become effective) and is intended solely to avoid or minimise losses from events which could give rise to non-payment or claims. \u25bc M3 ",

MATCHING Taking into account a Participant's international obligations and consistent with the purpose of the Arrangement, a Participant may match, according to the procedures set out in Article 45, financial terms and conditions offered by a Participant or a non-Participant. Financial terms and conditions provided in accordance with this Article are considered to be in conformity with the provisions of Chapters I, II and, when applicable, Annexes I, II, III, IV, V, VI and VII. 19. MINIMUM FIXED INTEREST RATES UNDER OFFICIAL FINANCING SUPPORT (a) The Participants providing official financing support for fixed rate loans shall apply the relevant CIRRs as minimum interest rates. CIRRs are interest rates established according to the following principles: (1) CIRRs should represent final commercial lending interest rates in the domestic market of the currency concerned; (2) CIRRs should closely correspond to the rate for first class domestic borrowers; (3) CIRRs should be based on the funding cost of fixed interest rate finance; (4) CIRRs should not distort domestic competitive conditions; and (5) CIRRs should closely correspond to a rate available to first class foreign borrowers. (b) The provision of official financing support shall not offset or compensate, in part or in full, for the appropriate credit risk premium to be charged for the risk of non-repayment pursuant to the provisions of Article 23. 20. CONSTRUCTION OF CIRRS (a) Each Participant wishing to establish a CIRR shall initially select one of the following two base rate systems for its national currency: (1) three-year government bond yields for a repayment term of up to and including five years; five-year government bond yields for over five and up to and including eight-and-a-half years; and seven-year government bond yields for over eight-and-a-half years; or (2) five-year government bond yields for all maturities. Exceptions to the base rate system shall be agreed by the Participants. (b) CIRRs shall be set at a fixed margin of 100 basis points above each Participant's base rate unless Participants have agreed otherwise. (c) Other Participants shall use the CIRR set for a particular currency should they decide to finance in that currency. (d) A Participant may change its base-rate system after giving six months' advance notice and with the counsel of the Participants. \u25bc M3 ",
        "02011R1233 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.03.2018 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 15 (e) A Participant or a non-Participant may request that a CIRR be estab \u00ad lished for the currency of a non-Participant. In consultation with the interested non-Participant, a Participant or the Secretariat on behalf of that non-Participant may make a proposal for the construction of the CIRR in that currency using Common Line procedures in accordance with Articles 58 to 63. 21. VALIDITY OF CIRRS The interest rate applying to a transaction shall not be fixed for a period longer than 120 days. A margin of 20 basis points shall be added to the relevant CIRR if the terms and conditions of the official financing support are fixed before the contract date. 22. APPLICATION OF CIRRS (a) Where official financing support is provided for floating rate loans, banks and other financing institutions shall not be allowed to offer the option of the lower of either the CIRR (at time of the original contract) or the short-term market rate throughout the life of the loan. (b) In the event of a voluntary, early repayment of a loan of or any portion thereof, the borrower shall compensate the government institution providing official financing support for all costs and losses incurred as a result of such early repayment, including the cost to the government institution of replacing the part of the fixed rate cash inflow interrupted by the early repayment. 23. PREMIUM FOR CREDIT RISK The Participants shall charge premium, in addition to interest charges, to cover the risk of non-repayment of export credits. The premium rates charged by the Participants shall be risk-based, shall converge and shall not be inadequate to cover long-term operating costs and losses. 24. MINIMUM PREMIUM RATES FOR CREDIT RISK The Participants shall charge no less than the applicable Minimum Premium Rate (MPR) for Credit Risk. (a) The applicable MPR is determined according to the following factors: \u2014 the applicable country risk classification, \u2014 the time at risk (i.e. the Horizon of Risk or HOR), \u2014 the selected buyer risk category of the obligor, \u2014 the percentage of political and commercial risk cover and quality of official export credit product provided, \u2014 any country risk mitigation technique applied, and \u2014 any buyer risk credit enhancements that have been applied. (b) MPRs are expressed in percentages of the principal value of the credit as if premium were collected in full at the date of the first drawdown of the credit. An explanation of how to calculate the MPRs, including the mathematical formula, is provided in Annex IX. \u25bc M3 ",

In order to ensure that the premium rates charged for transactions involving obligors, and where appropriate guarantors, in such countries do not undercut private market pricing, the Participants shall adhere to the following procedures, using agreed conventions to translate the relevant benchmark pricing into premium rates: (1) Where a Participant provides official support as part of a syndicated loan package that is structured as either an asset-backed ( 2 ) or project finance ( 3 ) transaction, then: \u2014 the all-in cost of the direct lending portion shall be no less than the all-in cost charged by the commercial market participant(s) in the syndicate, \u2014 the premium charged for pure cover shall be no less than the translated equivalent of that charged by the commercial market participant(s). To qualify as a syndicated loan package, all of the following conditions must be met: \u2014 at least 25 % ( 4 ) of the syndicate is commercial market loan(s)/ guarantee(s), without any bilateral or multilateral support (e.g., ECA, DFI, IFI or MDB) ( 5 ), where all parties to the financing are on pari passu terms on all financial terms and conditions, including security package, and \u2014 the transaction financial terms and conditions are fully compliant with the Arrangement, as modified by these provisions of Market Benchmark pricing in syndicated loans/guarantees transactions. \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) The status of a country in terms of: (1) whether it is a High Income country (as defined by the World Bank on an annual basis according to per capita GNI), (2) membership in the OECD and (3) whether it is part of the Euro Area is reviewed on an annual basis. The designation of a country under Article 25(c) as a High Income OECD country or a High Income Euro Area country as well as the removal of such designation will only come into effect after the country's income classification (High Income or otherwise) has remained unchanged for two consecutive years. A change in a country's designation as a High Income OECD country or a High Income Euro Area country as well as the removal of such designation related to a change in OECD membership or being part of the Euro Area will come into effect immediately at the time of the annual review of countries' status. ( 2 ) To qualify as an asset-backed transaction, there must be a first priority security interest on the asset being financed; and, in the case of a lease structure, assignment and/or a first priority security interest in connection with the lease payments. ( 3 ) To qualify as a project finance transaction, the transaction must meet the Basic Criteria set forth in Appendix 1 to Annex VII of the Arrangement. ( 4 ) Notwithstanding this threshold, for transactions in Market Benchmark countries using terms and conditions provided under Annex V (rail) or Annex VII (project finance), the relevant minimum commercial loan participation rules applicable under those Annexes shall apply. ( 5 ) This portion of the 25 % criterion may be met where the non-cash payment portion of a transaction involving a single bank receiving ECA cover includes an uncovered portion of at least 25 %. Such transactions must meet all of the other criteria of subparagraph 1, including the pari passu provisions of this tiret . ",

A Participant charging a premium rate lower than the corresponding premium determined by the TCMB model, based on the Accredited Credit Rating Agency ( 1 ) (CRA) rating of the Name-Specific market benchmark ( 2 ) shall give prior notification in accordance with Article 48. However, the premium charged may not be less than the corresponding Minimum Actuarial Premium. \u2014 In determining the premium rate, a Participant shall determine a risk rating for the ultimate obligor/guarantor, including whether the obligor/guarantor is rated by an Accredited CRA. A Participant may set a rating one notch better (on the Accredited CRA's scale) than that provided by an Accredited CRA. If there is no Accredited CRA rating, the risk classification may not exceed (be more favourable than) the CRA rating of the sovereign in the obligor/guarantor's domicile by more than two notches. Participants must give prior notification in accordance with Article 48 in the following scenarios: \u2014 where a Participant classifies the obligor/guarantor as better than the best rating from an Accredited CRA, or \u2014 if there is no Accredited CRA rating, where a Participant classifies a transaction as CC2 or better, or a credit rating letter equivalent to AAA to A-, or equal to or more favourable than the best Accredited CRA rating of the sovereign in the obligor's/guarantor's domicile. (d) The \u2018highest risk\u2019 countries in Category 7 shall, in principle, be subject to premium rates in excess of the MPRs established for that Category; these premium rates shall be determined by the Participant providing official support. \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) Where the obligor/guarantor is rated by more than one Accredited CRA, the CRA rating is the best available foreign currency rating on a senior unsecured basis for the obligor (or guarantor). The Secretariat shall compile and maintain a list of such accredited CRAs. ( 2 ) In the event that a relevant Name-Specific market pricing entity is not rated by an Accredited CRA, then the resulting market pricing shall be considered to be below the corresponding TCMB rate and be subject to prior notification in accordance with Article 48.

In the case of a third party guarantee, a Participant may choose to apply the country risk classification of the country in which the guarantor is located and the buyer risk category of the guarantor ( 2 ), or \u2014 a Multilateral or Regional Institution as set out in Article 28 is acting either as borrower or guarantor for the transaction, in which case the applicable Country Risk Classification and buyer risk category may be that of the specific Multilateral or Regional Institution involved. (f) The criteria and conditions relating to the application of a third party guarantee according to the situations described in the first and second tirets of paragraph (e) above are set out in Annex XI. (g) The HOR convention used in the calculation of an MPR is one-half of the disbursement period plus the entire repayment period and assumes a regular export credit repayment profile, i.e. repayment in equal semi- annual instalments of principal plus accrued interest beginning six months after the starting point of credit. For export credits with non- standard repayment profiles, the equivalent repayment period (expressed in terms of equal, semi-annual instalments) is calculated using the following formula: equivalent repayment period = (average weighted life of the repayment period \u2013 0,25)/0,5. (h) The Participant choosing to apply an MPR associated with a third party guarantor located in a country other than that of the obligor shall give prior notification according to Article 47. The Participant choosing to apply a MPR associated with a Multilateral or Regional Institution acting as a guarantor shall give prior notification in accordance with Article 48. 25. COUNTRY RISK CLASSIFICATION With the exception of High Income OECD countries and High Income Euro Area countries, countries shall be classified according to the likelihood of whether they will service their external debts (i.e. country credit risk). (a) The five elements of country credit risk are: \u2014 general moratorium on repayments decreed by the obligor's/guar \u00ad antor's government or by that agency of a country through which repayment is effected, \u2014 political events and/or economic difficulties arising outside the country of the notifying Participant or legislative/administrative measures taken outside the country of the notifying Participant which prevent or delay the transfer of funds paid in respect of the credit, \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) The premium rates charged for transactions with a third party guarantee provided by an obligor in a High Income OECD country or a High Income Euro Area country are subject to the requirements set out in Article 24(c). ( 2 ) In the case of a third party guarantee, the applicable country risk classification and buyer risk category must be related to the same entity, i.e. either the obligor or the guarantor. ",

(b) Countries are classified into one of eight Country Risk Categories (0-7). MPRs have been established for Categories 1 through 7, but not for Category 0, as the level of country risk is considered to be negligible for countries in this Category. The credit risk associated with trans \u00ad actions in Category 0 countries is predominantly related to the risk of the obligor/guarantor. (c) The classification of countries ( 1 ) is achieved through the Country Risk Classification Methodology, which is comprised of: \u2014 The Country Risk Assessment Model (the Model), which produces a quantitative assessment of country credit risk which is based, for each country, on three groups of risk indicators: the payment experience of the Participants, the financial situation and the economic situation. The methodology of the Model consists of different steps including the assessment of the three groups of risk indicators, and the combination and flexible weighting of the risk indicator groups. \u2014 The qualitative assessment of the Model results, considered country- by-country to integrate the political risk and/or other risk factors not taken into account in full or in part by the Model. If appropriate, this may lead to an adjustment to the quantitative Model assessment to reflect the final assessment of the country credit risk. (d) Country Risk Classifications shall be monitored on an on-going basis and reviewed at least annually and changes resulting from the Country Risk Classification Methodology shall be immediately communicated by the Secretariat. When a country is re-classified in a lower or higher Country Risk Category, the Participants shall, no later than five working days after the re-classification has been communicated by the Secretariat, charge premium rates at or above the MPRs associated with the new Country Risk Category. (e) The country risk classifications shall be made public by the Secretariat. 26. SOVEREIGN RISK ASSESSMENT (a) For all countries classified through the Country Risk Classification Methodology according to Article 25 (d), the risk of the sovereign shall be assessed in order to identify, on an exceptional basis, those sovereigns: \u2014 that are not the lowest-risk obligor in the country, and \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) For administrative purposes, some countries that are eligible to be classified into one of the eight Country Risk Categories may not be classified if they do not generally receive officially supported export credits. For such non-classified countries, Participants are free to apply the country risk classification which they deem appropriate. ",

(b) The identification of sovereigns meeting the criteria listed in paragraph (a) above shall be undertaken according to the Sovereign Risk Assessment Methodology that has been developed and agreed by the Participants. (c) The list of sovereigns identified as meeting the criteria listed in paragraph (a) above shall be monitored on an on-going basis and reviewed at least annually and changes resulting from the Sovereign Risk Assessment Methodology shall be immediately communicated by the Secretariat. (d) The list of sovereigns identified under paragraph (b) above shall be made public by the Secretariat. 27. BUYER RISK CLASSIFICATION Obligors and, as appropriate, guarantors in countries classified in Country Risk Categories 1-7 shall be classified into one of the buyer risk categories that have been established in relation to the country of the obligor/guaran \u00ad tor ( 1 ). The matrix of buyer risk categories into which obligors and guar \u00ad antors shall be classified is provided in Annex IX. Qualitative descriptions of the buyer risk categories are provided in Annex XII. (a) Buyer-risk classifications shall be based on the senior unsecured credit rating of the obligor/guarantor as determined by the Participant. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, transactions supported according to the terms and conditions of Annex VII and transactions having a credit value of SDR 5 million or less may be classified on a transaction basis, i.e. after the application of any buyer risk credit enhancements; however, such transactions, regardless of how they are classified, are not eligible for any discounts for the application of buyer risk credit enhancements. (c) Sovereign obligors and guarantors are classified in buyer risk category SOV/CC0. (d) On an exceptional basis, non-sovereign obligors and guarantors may be classified in the \u2018Better than Sovereign\u2019 (SOV+) buyer risk category ( 2 ) if: \u2014 the obligor/guarantor has a foreign currency rating from an Accredited CRA that is better than the foreign currency rating (from the same CRA) of their respective sovereign, or \u2014 the obligor/guarantor's is located in a country in which sovereign risk has been identified as being significantly higher than country risk. (e) The Participants shall give prior notification according to Article 48 for transactions: \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) Rules related to the classification of buyers should be understood to stipulate the most favourable classification that can be applied, e.g. a sovereign buyer may be classified in a less favourable buyer risk classification.

(f) In the event of competition for a specific transaction, whereby the obligor/guarantor has been classified by competing Participants in different buyer risk categories, the competing Participants shall seek to arrive at a common buyer risk classification. If agreement on a common classification is not reached, the Participant(s) having classified the obligor/guarantor in a higher buyer risk classification are not prohibited from applying the lower buyer risk classification. 28. CLASSIFICATION OF MULTILATERAL AND REGIONAL INSTI \u00ad TUTIONS Multilateral and Regional Institutions shall be classified into one of eight Country Risk Categories (0-7) ( 2 ) and reviewed as appropriate; such applicable classifications shall be made public by the Secretariat. 29. PERCENTAGE AND QUALITY OF OFFICIAL EXPORT CREDIT COVER The MPRs are differentiated to take account of the differing quality of export credit products and percentage of cover provided by the Participants as set out in Annex IX. The differentiation is based on the exporter's perspective (i.e. to neutralise the competitive effect arising from the differing qualities of product provided to the exporter/financial institution). (a) The quality of an export credit product is a function of whether the product is insurance, guarantee or direct credit/financing, and for insurance products whether cover of interest during the claims waiting period (i.e. the period between the due date of payment by the obligor and the date that the insurer is liable to reimburse the exporter/financial institution) is provided without a surcharge. (b) All existing export credit products offered by the Participants shall be classified into one of the three product categories which are: \u2014 Below standard product, i.e. insurance without cover of interest during the claims waiting period and insurance with cover of interest during the claims waiting period with an appropriate premium surcharge, \u2014 Standard product, i.e. insurance with cover of interest during the claims waiting period without an appropriate premium surcharge and direct credit/financing, and \u2014 Above standard product, i.e. guarantees. \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) Where the non-sovereign borrower is rated by more than one accredited CRA, notifi \u00ad cation is only required where the buyer risk rating is more favourable than the most favourable of the CRA ratings.

(b) The Participant applying an MPR reflecting the use of country risk mitigation shall give prior notification according to Article 47. (c) No country risk mitigation shall be applied to Market Benchmark trans \u00ad actions. 31. BUYER RISK CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS (a) The Participants may apply the following buyer risk credit enhancements (BRCE) which allow for the application of a Credit Enhancement Factor (CEF) greater than 0: \u2014 Assignment of Contract Proceeds or Receivables \u2014 Asset Based Security \u2014 Fixed Asset Security \u2014 Escrow Account. (b) Definitions of the BRCE and maximum CEF values for both Category 1- 7 obligors as well as Market Benchmark obligors are set out in Annex XIII. (c) BRCEs may be used alone or in combination with the following restric \u00ad tions: \u2014 The maximum CEF that can be achieved through the use of the BRCEs is 0,35 for Category 1-7 transactions, and 0,25 for Market Benchmark transactions. \u2014 \u2018Asset Based Security\u2019 and \u2018Fixed Asset Security\u2019 cannot be used together in one transaction. \u2014 In a Category 1-7 transaction where the applicable country risk clas \u00ad sification has been improved through the use of \u2018Offshore Future Flow Structure Combined with Offshore Escrow Account\u2019, no BRCEs may be applied. (d) The Participants shall give prior notification according to Article 48 for transactions with a non-sovereign obligor/guarantor having a credit of greater than SDR 5 million where BRCEs result in the application of a CEF of greater than 0, or whenever BRCEs are used in a Market Benchmark transaction that result in pricing below the corresponding TCMB MPR. 32. REVIEW OF THE VALIDITY OF THE MINIMUM PREMIUM RATES FOR CREDIT RISK (a) To assess the adequacy of MPRs and to allow, if necessary, for adjust \u00ad ments, either upwards or downwards, Premium Feedback Tools (PFTs), shall be used in parallel to monitor and adjust the MPRs on a regular basis. \u25bc M3 ",

(c) A comprehensive review of all aspects of the premium rules of the Arrangement, with a special emphasis on the Market Benchmark Pricing Rules, shall take place no later than 31 December 2018. CHAPTER III PROVISIONS FOR TIED AID 33. GENERAL PRINCIPLES (a) The Participants have agreed to have complementary policies for export credits and tied aid. Export credit policies should be based on open competition and the free play of market forces. Tied aid policies should provide needed external resources to countries, sectors or projects with little or no access to market financing. Tied aid policies should ensure best value for money, minimise trade distortion, and contribute to developmentally effective use of these resources. (b) The tied aid provisions of the Arrangement do not apply to the aid programmes of multilateral or regional institutions. (c) Principles do not prejudge the views of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) on the quality of tied and untied aid. (d) A Participant may request additional information relevant to the tying status of any form of aid. If there is uncertainty as to whether a certain financing practice falls within the scope of the definition of tied aid set out in Annex XV, the donor country shall furnish evidence in support of any claim to the effect that the aid is in fact \u2018untied\u2019 in accordance with the definition in Annex XV. 34. FORMS OF TIED AID Tied aid can take the form of: (a) Official Development Assistance (ODA) loans as defined in the \u2018DAC Guiding Principles for Associated Financing and Tied and Partially Untied Official Development Assistance (1987)\u2019; (b) ODA grants as defined in the \u2018DAC Guiding Principles for Associated Financing and Tied and Partially Untied Official Development Assistance (1987)\u2019; and (c) Other Official Flows (OOF), which includes grants and loans but excludes officially supported export credits that are in conformity with the Arrangement; or (d) Any association, e.g. mixture, in law or in fact, within the control of the donor, the lender or the borrower involving two or more of the preceding, and/or the following financing components: (1) an export credit that is officially supported by way of direct credit/ financing, refinancing, interest rate support, guarantee or insurance to which the Arrangement applies; and \u25bc M3 ",
        "02011R1233 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.03.2018 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 24 (2) other funds at or near market terms, or down payment from the purchaser. 35. ASSOCIATED FINANCING (a) Associated financing may take various forms including mixed credits, mixed financing, joint financing, parallel financing or single integrated transactions. The main characteristics are that they all feature: \u2014 a concessional component that is linked in law or in fact to the non- concessional component, \u2014 either a single part or all of the financing package that is, in effect, tied aid, and \u2014 concessional funds those are available only if the linked non-conces \u00ad sional component is accepted by the recipient. (b) Association or linkage \u2018in fact\u2019 is determined by such factors as: \u2014 the existence of informal understandings between the recipient and the donor authorities, \u2014 the intention by the donor to facilitate the acceptability of a financing package through the use of ODA, \u2014 the effective tying of the whole financing package to procurement in the donor country, \u2014 the tying status of ODA and the means of tendering for or contracting of each financing transaction, or \u2014 any other practice, identified by the DAC or the Participants in which a de facto liaison exists between two or more financing components. (c) The following practices shall not prevent the determination of an asso \u00ad ciation or linkage \u2018in fact\u2019: \u2014 contract splitting through the separate notification of the component parts of one contract, \u2014 splitting of contracts financed in several stages, \u2014 non-notification of interdependent parts of a contract, and/or \u2014 non-notification because part of the financing package is untied. 36. COUNTRY ELIGIBILITY FOR TIED AID (a) There shall be no tied aid to countries whose per capita GNI, according to the World Bank data, is above the upper limit for lower middle income countries. The World Bank recalculates this threshold on an annual basis ( 1 ). A country will be reclassified only after its World Bank category has been unchanged for two consecutive years. \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) Based on the annual review by the World Bank of its country classification, a per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold will be used for the purpose of tied aid eligi \u00ad bility; such threshold is available on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/trade/ xcred/country-classification.htm). ",
        "02011R1233 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.03.2018 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 25 (b) The following operational criteria and procedures apply when classifying countries: (1) Classification for Arrangement purposes is determined by per capita GNI as calculated by the World Bank for the purposes of the World Bank classification of borrowing countries; this classification shall be made public by the Secretariat. (2) In cases where the World Bank does not have enough information to publish per capita GNI data, the World Bank shall be asked to estimate whether the country in question has per capita GNI above or below the current threshold. The country shall be classified according to the estimate unless the Participants decide to act otherwise. (3) If a country's eligibility for tied aid does change in accordance with paragraph (a) above, the reclassification shall take effect two weeks after the conclusions drawn from the above mentioned World Bank data have been communicated to all Participants by the Secretariat. Before the effective date of reclassification, no tied aid financing for a newly eligible country may be notified; after that date, no tied aid financing for a newly promoted country may be notified, except that individual transactions covered under a prior committed credit line may be notified until the expiry of the credit line (which shall be no more than one year from the effective date). (4) In cases where the World Bank revises figures such revisions shall be disregarded in relation to the Arrangement. Nevertheless, the classification of a country may be changed by way of a Common Line, in accordance with the appropriate procedures in Articles 58 to 63, and the Participants would favourably consider a change due to errors and omissions in the figures subsequently recognised in the same calendar year as the figures that were first distributed by the Secretariat. 37. PROJECT ELIGIBILITY (a) Tied aid shall not be extended to public or private projects that normally should be commercially viable if financed on market or Arrangement terms. (b) The key tests for such aid eligibility are: \u2014 whether the project is financially non-viable, i.e. does the project lack capacity with appropriate pricing determined on market prin \u00ad ciples, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover the project's operating costs and to service the capital employed, i.e. the first key test, or \u2014 whether it is reasonable to conclude, based on communication with other Participants, that it is unlikely that the project can be financed on market or Arrangement terms, i.e. the second key test. In respect of projects larger than SDR 50 million special weight shall be given to the expected availability of financing at market or Arrangement terms when considering the appropriateness of such aid. (c) The key tests under paragraph (b) above are intended to describe how a project should be evaluated to determine whether it should be financed with such aid or with export credits on market or Arrangement terms. Through the consultation process described in Articles 51 to 53, a body \u25bc M3 ",

MINIMUM CONCESSIONALITY LEVEL The Participants shall not provide tied aid that has a concessionality level of less than 35 %, or 50 % if the beneficiary country is a Least Developed Country (LDC), except for the cases set out below, which are also exempt from the notification procedures set out in Articles 49(a) and 50(a): (a) Technical assistance: tied aid where the official development aid component consists solely of technical cooperation that is less than either 3 % of the total value of the transaction or SDR 1 million, whichever is lower; and (b) Small projects: capital projects of less than SDR 1 million that are funded entirely by development assistance grants. 39. EXEMPTIONS FROM COUNTRY OR PROJECT ELIGIBILITY FOR TIED AID (a) The provisions of Articles 36 and 37 do not apply to tied aid where the concessionality level is 80 % or more except for tied aid that forms part of an associated financing package, described in Article 35. (b) The provisions of Article 37 do not apply to tied aid with a value of less than SDR 2 million except for tied aid that forms part of an associated financing package, described in Article 35. (c) Tied aid for LDCs as defined by the United Nations is not subject to the provisions of Articles 36 and 37. (d) The Participants shall give favourable consideration to an acceleration of tied aid procedures in line with the specific circumstances: \u2014 a nuclear or major industrial accident that causes serious trans- frontier pollution, where any affected Participant wishes to provide tied aid to eliminate or mitigate its effects, or \u2014 the existence of a significant risk that such an accident may occur, where any potentially affected Participant wishes to provide tied aid to prevent its occurrence. (e) Notwithstanding Articles 36 and 37, a Participant may, exceptionally, provide support by one of the following means: \u2014 the Common Line procedure as defined in Annex XV and described in Articles 58 to 63, or \u2014 the justification on aid grounds through support by a substantial body of the Participants as described in Articles 51 and 52, or \u2014 a letter to the OECD Secretary-General, in accordance with the procedures in Article 53, which the Participants expect will be unusual and infrequent. \u25bc M3 ",

CALCULATION OF CONCESSIONALITY LEVEL OF TIED AID The concessionality level of tied aid is calculated using the same method as for the grant element used by the DAC, except that: (a) The discount rate used to calculate the concessionality level of a loan in a given currency, i.e. the Differentiated Discount Rate (DDR), is subject to annual change on 15 January and is calculated as follows: \u2014 The average of the CIRR + Margin Margin (M) depends on the repayment term (R) as follows: R M less than 15 years 0,75 from 15 years up to, but not including 20 years 1,00 from 20 years up to but not including 30 years 1,15 from 30 years and above 1,25 \u2014 For all currencies the average of the CIRR is calculated taking an average of the monthly CIRRs valid during the six-month period between 15 August of the previous year and 14 February of the current year. The calculated rate, including the Margin, is rounded to the nearest ten basis points. If there is more than one CIRR for the currency, the CIRR for the longest maturity as set out in Article 20(a), shall be used for this calculation. (b) The base date for the calculation of the concessionality level is the starting point of credit as set out in Annex XV. (c) For the purpose of calculating the overall concessionality level of an associated financing package, the concessionality levels of the following credits, funds and payments are considered to be zero: \u2014 export credits that are in conformity with the Arrangement; \u2014 other funds at or near market rates; \u2014 other official funds with a concessionality level of less than the minimum permitted under Article 38 except in cases of matching; and \u2014 down payment from the purchaser. Payments on or before the starting point of credit that are not considered down payment shall be included in the calculation of the concessionality level. (d) The discount rate in matching: in matching aid, identical matching means matching with an identical concessionality level that is recal \u00ad culated with the discount rate in force at the time of matching. \u25bc M3 ",

(f) The overall concessionality level of a package is determined by multi \u00ad plying the nominal value of each component of the package by the respective concessionality level of each component, adding the results, and dividing this total by the aggregate nominal value of the components. (g) The discount rate for a given aid loan is the rate in effect at the time of notification. However, in cases of prompt notification, the discount rate is the one in effect at the time when the terms and conditions of the aid loan were fixed. A change in the discount rate during the life of a loan does not change its concessionality level. (h) If a change of currency is made before the contract is concluded, the notification shall be revised. The discount rate used to calculate the concessionality level will be the one applicable at the date of revision. A revision is not necessary if the alternative currency and all the necessary information for calculation of the concessionality level are indicated in the original notification. (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (g) above, the discount rate used to calculate the concessionality level of individual transactions initiated under an aid credit line shall be the rate that was originally notified for the credit line. 41. VALIDITY PERIOD FOR TIED AID (a) The Participants shall not fix terms and conditions for tied aid, whether this relates to the financing of individual transactions or to an aid protocol, an aid credit line or to a similar agreement, for more than two years. In the case of an aid protocol, an aid credit line or similar agreement, the validity period shall commence at the date of its signature, to be notified in accordance with Article 50; the extension of a credit line shall be notified as if it were a new transaction with a note explaining that it is an extension and that it is renewed at terms allowed at the time of the notification of the extension. In the case of individual transactions, including those notified under an aid protocol, an aid credit line or similar agreement, the validity period shall commence at the date of notification of the commitment in accordance with Article 49 or 50, as appropriate. (b) When a country has become ineligible for 17-year World Bank Loans for the first time, the validity period of existing and new tied aid protocols and credit lines notified shall be restricted to one year after the date of the potential reclassification in accordance with procedures in Article 36(b). (c) Renewal of such protocols and credit lines is possible only on terms which are in accordance with the provisions of Articles 36 and 37 of the Arrangement following: \u2014 the reclassification of countries, and \u2014 a change in the provisions of the Arrangement. In these circumstances, the existing terms and conditions can be maintained notwithstanding a change in the discount rate set out in Article 40. \u25bc M3 ",

PARTICIPATION The Participants to the Sector Understanding are: Australia, the European Union, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Norway. 2. SCOPE OF APPLICATION This Sector Understanding, which complements the Arrangement, sets out specific guidelines for officially supported export credits relating to export contracts of: (a) Any new sea-going vessel of 100 gt and above used for the transpor \u00ad tation of goods or persons, or for the performance of a specialised service (for example, fishing vessels, fish factory ships, ice breakers and as dredgers, that present in a permanent way by their means of propulsion and direction (steering) all the characteristics of self-naviga \u00ad bility in the high sea), tugs of 365 kw and over and to unfinished shells of ships that are afloat and mobile. The Sector Understanding does not cover military vessels. Floating docks and mobile offshore units are not covered by the Sector Understanding, but should problems arise in connection with export credits for such structures, the Participants to the Sector Understanding (hereinafter the \u2018Participants\u2019), after consider \u00ad ation of substantiated requests by any Participant, may decide that they shall be covered. (b) Any conversion of a ship. Ship conversion means any conversion of sea- going vessels of more than 1 000 gt on condition that conversion oper \u00ad ations entail radical alterations to the cargo plan, the hull or the propulsion system. (c) (1) Although hovercraft-type vessels are not included in the Sector Understanding, Participants are allowed to grant export credits for hovercraft vessels on equivalent conditions to those prevailing in the Sector Understanding. They commit themselves to apply this possi \u00ad bility moderately and not to grant such credit conditions to hovercraft vessels in cases where it is established that no competition is offered under the conditions of the Sector Understanding. (2) In the Sector Understanding, the term \u2018hovercraft\u2019 is defined as follows: an amphibious vehicle of at least 100 tons designed to be supported wholly by air expelled from the vehicle forming a plenum contained within a flexible skirt around the periphery of the vehicle and the ground or water surface beneath the vehicle, and capable of being propelled and controlled by airscrews or ducted air from fans or similar devices. (3) It is understood that the granting of export credits at conditions equivalent to those prevailing in this Sector Understanding should be limited to those hovercraft vessels used on maritime routes and non-land routes, except for reaching terminal facilities standing at a maximum distance of one kilometre from the water. CHAPTER II PROVISIONS FOR EXPORT CREDITS AND TIED AID 3. MAXIMUM REPAYMENT TERM The maximum repayment term, irrespective of country classification, is 12 years after delivery. \u25bc M3 ",

(b) Interest shall be paid no less frequently than every six months and the first payment of interest shall be made no later than six months after the starting point of credit. (c) For export credits provided in support of lease transactions, equal repayments of principal and interest combined may be applied in lieu of equal repayments of principal as set out in paragraph (a). (d) Interest due after the starting point of credit shall not be capitalised. (e) A Participant to this Sector Understanding intending to support a payment of interest on different terms than those set out in paragraph (b) shall give prior notification at least ten calendar days before issuing any commitment, in accordance with Annex VIII of the Arrangement. 6. MINIMUM PREMIUM The provisions of the Arrangement in relation to minimum premium benchmarks shall not be applied until such provisions have been further reviewed by the Participants to this Sector Understanding. 7. PROJECT FINANCE The provisions of Article 7 and of Annex VII to the Arrangement shall not be applied until such provisions have been further reviewed by the Participants to this Sector Understanding. 8. AID Any Participant desiring to provide aid must, in addition to the provisions of the Arrangement, confirm that the ship is not operated under an open registry during the repayment term and that appropriate assurance has been obtained that the ultimate owner resides in the receiving country, is not a non-oper \u00ad ational subsidiary of a foreign interest and has undertaken not to sell the ship without his government's approval. CHAPTER III PROCEDURES 9.

PURPOSE (a) The purpose of this Sector Understanding is to provide a framework for the predictable, consistent and transparent use of officially supported export credits for the sale or lease of aircraft and other goods and services specified in Article 4(a) below. This Sector Understanding seeks to foster a level playing field for such export credits, in order to encourage competition among exporters based on quality and price of goods and services exported rather than on the most favourable officially supported financial terms and conditions. (b) This Sector Understanding sets out the most favourable terms and conditions on which officially supported export credits may be provided. (c) To this aim, this Sector Understanding seeks to establish a balanced equilibrium that, on all markets: (1) Equalises competitive financial conditions between the Participants, (2) Neutralises official support among the Participants as a factor in the choice among competing goods and services specified in Article 4(a) below, and (3) Avoids distortion of competition among the Participants to this Sector Understanding and any other sources of financing. (d) The Participants to this Sector Understanding (the Participants) acknowledge that the provisions included in this Sector Understanding have been developed for the sole purpose of this Sector Understanding and such provisions do not prejudice the other parts of the Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits (the Arrangement) and their evol \u00ad ution. 2. STATUS This Sector Understanding is a Gentlemen's Agreement among its Participants and is Annex III to the Arrangement; it forms an integral part of the Arrangement and it succeeds the Sector Understanding which came into effect in July 2007. 3.

(2) Official financing support: \u2014 direct credit/financing and refinancing, or \u2014 interest rate support. Any combination of the above. (c) This Sector Understanding shall not apply to official support for: (1) The exports of new or used military aircraft and related goods and services listed in paragraph (a) above, including when used for military purposes. (2) New or used flight simulators. 5. INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO NON-PARTICIPANTS A Participant shall, on the basis of reciprocity, reply to a request from a non- Participant in a competitive situation on the financial terms and conditions offered for its official support as it would reply to a request from a Participant. 6. AID SUPPORT The Participants shall not provide aid support, except for humanitarian purposes, through a Common Line procedure. 7. ACTIONS TO AVOID OR MINIMISE LOSSES This Sector Understanding does not prevent its Participants from agreeing to less restrictive financial terms and conditions than those provided for by this Sector Understanding, if such action is taken after the export credit agreement and ancillary documents have already become effective and is intended solely to avoid or minimise losses from events which could give rise to non-payment or claims. A Participant shall notify all other Participants and the OECD Secretariat (the Secretariat), within 20 working days following the Participant's agreement with the buyer/borrower, of the modified financial terms and conditions. The notification shall contain information, including the motivation, on the new financial terms and conditions, using the reporting form set out in Appendix IV. \u25bc M3 ",

In this case, a surcharge of 15 % to the minimum premium rates calculated in accordance with Appendix II shall apply. \u2014 In the case of a floating rate transaction, the principal amortising profile shall be set for the entire term, no more than five business days prior to the disbursement date, based on the floating or swap rate at that time. (2) Repayment of principal shall be made in equal instalments with interest payable on declining balances: \u2014 Instalments shall be made no less frequently than every three months and the first instalment shall be made no later than three months after the starting point of credit. \u25bc M3 ",

A Participant intending to provide such support shall notify all other Participants at least 20 calendar days before final commitment, identifying the borrower. (c) Interest rate excludes any payment by way of premium referred to in Article 11 above, and fees referred to in Article 16 below. 15.

The Participants encourage non-Participants that are developing a manufac \u00ad turing capacity for civil aircraft to apply the disciplines of this Sector Under \u00ad standing. In this context the Participants invite non-Participants to enter into a dialogue with them regarding the conditions of joining the ASU. 2. The Secretariat should ensure that a non-Participant interested in participating in this Sector Understanding is provided with full information on the terms and conditions associated with becoming a Participant to this Sector Under \u00ad standing. 3. The non-Participant would then be invited by the Participants to take part in the activities in pursuance of this Sector Understanding and to attend, as an observer, the relevant meetings. Such an invitation would be for a maximum of two years and could be renewed once for a further two years. During this period the non-Participant shall be invited to provide a review of its export credit system, especially for the export of civil aircraft. 4. At the end of that period, the non-Participant shall indicate whether it wishes to become a Participant in this Sector Understanding and to follow its disci \u00ad plines; in the case of such confirmation, the non-Participant shall contribute, on an annual basis, to the costs associated with the implementation of this Sector Understanding. 5. The interested non-Participant shall be considered a Participant 30 working days after the confirmation referred to in Article 4 of this Appendix. \u25bc M3 ",

Section 1 sets out the risk classification procedures; Section 2 sets out the minimum premium rates to be charged for new and used aircraft, and Section 3 sets out the minimum premium rates to be charged for spare engines, spare parts, conver \u00ad sion/major modification/refurbishing, maintenance and service contracts, and engine kits. SECTION 1 Procedures for risk classification 1. The Participants have agreed on a list of risk classifications (the List) for buyers/borrowers; such risk classifications reflect the senior unsecured credit rating of buyers/borrowers using a common rating scale such as that of one of the credit rating agencies (CRA). 2. The risk classifications will be made by experts nominated by the Participants against the risk categories set out in Table 1 of this Appendix. 3. The List shall be binding at any stage of the transaction (e.g. campaign and delivery), subject to the provisions of Article 15 of this Appendix. I. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LIST OF RISK CLASSIFICATIONS 4. The List shall be developed and agreed among the Participants prior to the entry into force of this Sector Understanding; it shall be maintained by the Secretariat and made available to all the Participants on a confidential basis. 5. Upon request, the Secretariat may, on a confidential basis, inform an aircraft- producing non-Participant of the risk classification of a buyer/borrower; in this case, the Secretariat shall inform all Participants of the request. A non- Participant may, at any time, propose additions to the List to the Secretariat. A non-Participant proposing an addition to the List may participate in the risk-classification procedure as if it were an interested Participant. II. UPDATE OF THE LIST OF RISK CLASSIFICATIONS 6. Subject to the provisions of Article 15 of this Appendix, the List may be updated on an ad hoc basis in the event that either a Participant signals, in any form, its intention to apply another risk classification than that on the List, or a Participant needs a risk classification for a buyer/borrower that is not yet on the List ( 1 ) ( 2 ). 7. Any Participant shall, before any use of an alternative or new risk classifi \u00ad cation, send a request to the Secretariat for updating the List on the basis of an alternative or new risk classification. The Secretariat will circulate this request to all Participants within two working days, without mentioning the identity of the Participant who submitted the request. \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) An explanation shall be provided where the proposed risk-rating of a buyer/borrower exceeds the risk rating of the host sovereign. ( 2 ) For transactions with an export contract value of less than USD 5 million, a Participant not wishing to follow the risk classification procedure set out in Articles 6 to 8 of this Appendix shall apply the risk classification \u20188\u2019 for the buyer/borrower which is the subject of the transaction and shall notify the transaction in accordance with Article 24(a) of this Sector Understanding.

A period of ten ( 1 ) working days is allowed for interested Participants either to agree to or to challenge any proposed change to the List; a failure to respond within this period is considered as an agreement to the proposal. If at the end of the ten-day period, no challenge has been made to the proposal, the proposed change in the List is deemed to have been agreed. The Secre \u00ad tariat will modify the List accordingly and send an OLIS message within five working days; the revised List shall be binding from the date of that message. III. RESOLUTION OF DISAGREEMENTS 9. In the event of a challenge to a proposed risk classification, interested Participants shall, at an expert level, make their best efforts to come to an agreement on the risk classification within a further period of ten working days after notification of a disagreement. All means necessary to resolve the disagreement should be explored, with the assistance of the Secretariat if necessary (e.g. conference calls or face-to-face consultations). If interested Participants agree to a risk classification within this ten working-day period, they shall inform the Secretariat of the outcome upon which the Secretariat will update the List accordingly and send an OLIS message in the following five working days. The adjusted List shall be binding from the date of that message. 10. In case the disagreement is not resolved among the experts within ten working days, the issue will be referred to the Participants for decision on an appropriate risk classification, in a period that shall not exceed five working days. 11. In the absence of a final agreement, a Participant may have recourse to a CRA to determine the risk classification of the buyer/borrower. In such cases, the Chairman of the Participants shall address a communication on behalf of the Participants to the buyer/borrower, within ten working days. The communication shall include the terms of reference for the risk assessment consultation as agreed among the Participants. The resulting risk classification will be registered in the List and become binding immedi \u00ad ately following the Secretariat's OLIS message to finalise the update procedure within five working days. 12. Unless otherwise agreed, the cost of such recourse to a CRA shall be borne by the interested buyer/borrower. 13. During the procedures set out in Articles 9 to 11 of this Appendix, the prevailing risk classification (when available on the List) shall remain applicable. IV. VALIDITY PERIOD OF CLASSIFICATIONS 14. The valid risk classifications are the prevailing risk classifications as recorded in the List maintained by the Secretariat; indications and commitments of premium rates shall only be made in accordance with those risk classifications. 15. Risk classifications have a 12-month maximum validity period from the date recorded in the List by the Secretariat for the purpose of the Participants providing indication and final commitments of premium rates; the validity period for a specific transaction may be extended by an additional 18 months once a commitment or a final commitment has occurred and premium holding fees are charged. Risk classifications may be subject to revision during the 12-month validity period in case of material changes to the risk profile of the buyer/borrower, such as a modification of a rating delivered by a CRA. \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) For transactions with an export contract value of less than USD 5 million, a five working-day period shall apply.

Unless any Participant requests its update, at least 20 working days before the end of the relevant risk classification validity period, the Secretariat shall remove that risk classification from the next succeeding updated List. The Secretariat will circulate this update request to all Participants within two working days, without mentioning the identity of the Participant who submitted the request, and the procedures set out in Articles 9 to 11 of this Appendix shall apply. V. BUYER/BORROWER RISK CLASSIFICATION REQUEST 17. If, at the campaign stage, a buyer/borrower requests an indication of its risk classification and if it is not yet on the List, that buyer/borrower may ask for an indicative risk classification from a CRA at its own expense. This risk classification shall not be included in the List; it may be used by the Participants as a basis for their own risk assessment. SECTION 2 Minimum premium rates for new and used aircraft I. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MINIMUM PREMIUM RATES 18. Articles 19 to 61 of this Appendix set out the minimum premium rates corresponding to the risk classification of a buyer/borrower (or, if a different entity, the primary source of repayment of the transaction). 19. The Participants may provide official support at or above the minimum premium rate provided that all the conditions below are fulfilled: (a) The transaction is asset-backed, meeting all of the following criteria: (1) A first priority security interest on or in connection with the aircraft and engines. (2) In the case of a lease structure, assignment and/or a first priority security interest in connection with the lease payments. (3) Cross default and cross collateralisation of all aircraft and engines owned legally and beneficially by the same parties under the proposed financing, whenever possible under the applicable legal regime. (b) The transaction is structured to include, as a minimum, risk mitigants as set out in Table 1 below: Table 1 Risk Mitigants ASU Risk Category Risk Ratings Risk Mitigants TOTAL Of which at least \u2018A\u2019 1 AAA to BBB- 0 0 2 BB+ and BB 0 0 3 BB- 1 1 4 B+ 2 1 \u25bc M3 ",

For purposes of Article 19 of this Appendix: (a) The Participants may select from the following risk mitigants: \u2018A\u2019 risk mitigants: (1) Reduced advance rate: each reduction of five percentage points from the advance rates referred to in Articles 10(a) and (b) of this Sector Understanding is equivalent to one \u2018A\u2019 risk mitigant. In this case, the Participant shall not provide official support in any form in excess of the reduced advance rate. (2) Straight line amortisation: repayment of principal in equal instalments is equivalent to one risk mitigant. (3) Reduced repayment term: a repayment term which does not exceed 10 years is equivalent to one risk mitigant, irrespective of the maximum repayment term allowed. \u2018B\u2019 risk mitigants: (1) Security deposit: each security deposit in an amount equal to one quarterly instalment of principal and interest is equivalent to one risk mitigant. The security deposit can be in the form of cash or a standby letter of credit. (2) Lease payments in advance: lease payments in an amount equal to one quarterly instalment of principal and interest shall be paid one quarter in advance of each repayment date. (3) Maintenance reserves in a form and amount reflective of market best practices. (b) Subject to a prior notification, up to one of the \u2018A\u2019 risk-mitigants may be replaced by a 15 % surcharge on the applicable minimum premium rate. 21. Minimum premium rates to be applied to a transaction can be set prior to delivery, either at commitment, final commitment or otherwise at the commencement of a premium holding period with a defined duration. Final upfront premium rate, per annum spread, or a combination thereof to be applied to the transaction will comply with the minimum premium rate so established as well as mandatory risk mitigants prescribed in Article 19(b) of this Appendix as of the date on which the minimum premium rates were set. Such terms shall apply for the full length of the premium holding period and may only be revised following the expiry of that period, at which time the minimum premium rates and mandatory risk mitigants prescribed by the ASU then in force will apply and may be set for a subsequent premium holding period. \u25bc M3 ",

Pursuant to Article 11 of this Sector Understanding, the minimum premium rates to be applied are composed of minimum risk-based rates (RBR) to which a market reflective surcharge (MRS) shall be added, in accordance with Articles 23 to 36 below. 23. As of the entry into force of this Sector Understanding, the RBRs are: Table 2 Risk-Based Rates ASU Risk Category Spreads (bps) Upfront (%) 1 89 4,98 2 98 5,49 3 116 6,52 4 133 7,49 5 151 8,53 6 168 9,51 7 185 10,50 8 194 11,03 24. The RBRs rates shall be reset on an annual basis, based on 4-year moving average of the annual Moody's Loss Given Default (LGD). The appropriate LGD for this reset is based on the 1st Lien Senior Secured Bank Loans, and shall be calculated as follows: Table 3 LGD Mapping 4-year Moving Average LGD Considered \u2265 45 % 25 % \u2265 35 % < 45 % 23 % \u2265 30 % < 35 % 21 % < 30 % 19 % 25. A RBR adjustment factor shall be determined as follows: LGD Considered 19 % \u00bc RBR adjustment factor 26. The RBR adjustment factor shall be multiplied by the RBRs set out in Table 2 above, in order to determine the reset RBRs. 27. The first reset process will take place in the first quarter of 2012 and the resulting RBRs will become effective as of 15 April 2012. \u25bc M3 ",

Once the RBRs resulting from the annual reset have been determined, the Secretariat shall inform immediately all Participants of the applicable rates and make them publicly available. 29. For each risk category, a Market Reflective Surcharge shall be calculated as follows: MRS = B * [(0,5 * MCS) \u2013 RBR] where: \u2014 B is a blend coefficient varying from 0,7 to 0,35 according to each risk category as per Table 4 below. \u2014 MCS is a 90-day moving average of Moody's Median Credit Spreads (MCS) with an average life of 7 years. 30. Where risk categories include more than one risk rating, the spreads shall be averaged. In risk category 1, the BBB- spread shall be used. 31. The MCS spreads shall be discounted by 50 % to account for the asset- security. The MCS discounted spreads shall then be adjusted by a blend factor ranging from 70 % to 35 % as per Table 4 below, applied on the difference between the MCS discounted spreads and the RBR. Any negative spreads resulting from the blending shall not be deducted.

The MRS shall be applied only if and when it is positive and exceeds 25 basis points. 34. The increase in minimum premium rates resulting from the MRS update shall not exceed 10 % of the previous quarterly minimum premium rates. The minimum premium rates (which result from adding the risk-based rates and the market reflective surcharge) shall not exceed the risk-based rates by more than 100 %. 35. In order to determine the minimum premium rates: \u2014 The following formula shall be used: Net MPR = MPR * (1 + RTAS) * (1 + RFAS) * (1 + RMRS) * (1 \u2013 CTCD) * (1 + NABS) \u2013 CICD Where: \u2014 RTAS represents the repayment term adjustment surcharge set out in Article 12(b) of this Sector Understanding. \u2014 RFAS represents the repayment frequency adjustment surcharge set out in Articles 13(a)(1) and (2) of this Sector Understanding. \u2014 RMRS represents the risk mitigant replacement surcharge set out in Article 20(b) of this Appendix. \u2014 CTCD represents the Cape Town Convention Discount set out in Article 38 of this Appendix. \u2014 NABS represents the non-asset-backed surcharge set out in Articles 57(a)(4), 57(b) and 59(b) of this Appendix, as applicable. \u2014 CICD represents the conditional insurance coverage discount set out in Article 56(a) of this Appendix. \u2014 Premium may be paid either upfront or, over the life of the facility, as spreads expressed in basis points per annum, or in any combination of upfront rates and spreads. The upfront rates and spreads shall be calculated using the premium rate conversion model (PCM) so that the premium payable for a given transaction has the same NPV whether payable upfront, as a spread over the life of the facility, or a combination thereof.

If so, please describe the process by which this happens ( 2 ), and if not, please provide details. 3.3 Are there any existing gaps in the implementation of the Convention and QDs? If so, please describe ( 3 ). 4. Court and administrative decisions 4.1 Please describe any matters, including judicial, regulatory, or administra \u00ad tive practice which could be expected to result in the courts, authorities or administrative bodies failing to give full force and effect to the Convention and QDs ( 4 ) ( 5 ). 4.2 To your knowledge, has there been any judicial or administrative en \u00ad forcement action taken by a creditor under the Convention? If so, please describe the action and indicate whether it was successful. 4.3 To your knowledge, since ratification/implementation, have the courts in that State refused in any instance to enforce loan obligations of a debtor or guarantor in the State contrary to the Convention and QDs? 4.4 To your knowledge, are there any other matters that may impact whether courts and administrative bodies should be expected to act in a manner consistent with the Convention and QDs? If so, please specify. \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) For the purposes of this questionnaire, \u2018national law\u2019 refers to all national legislation of a State, including but not limited to, the Constitution and its Amendments, any federal, state and district law or regulation.

( 3 ) For example, is there any reason why the rights and remedies granted to creditors under the Convention, including those granted under the QDs, would not (a) be recognised as being effective or (b) be sufficient by themselves, to enable such rights and remedies to be validly exercised in the State? ( 4 ) An example of an administrative action for the purposes of this question might be the failure by the State to put in place any procedures or resources to give effect to a provision of the Convention or a Qualifying Declaration. Another example would be the failure by a State to put in place proper procedures in its aircraft registry for recording IDERAs.

MINIMUM FLOATING INTEREST RATE (a) The minimum floating interest rate shall be, as appropriate, the EURIBOR, the Bank Bill Swap Rate, i.e. BBSY, the London Inter- Bank Offered Rate, i.e. LIBOR, as compiled by the British Bankers' Association (BBA) with the currency and the maturity corresponding to the frequency of interest payment of officially supported export credit, or the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate (CDOR), to which a margin benchmark calculated in accordance with Article 8 of this Appendix, shall be added. (b) The floating interest rate setup mechanism shall vary according to the repayment profile chosen, as follows: (1) When the repayment of principal and the payment of interest are combined in equal instalments, the relevant EURIBOR/BBSY/ LIBOR/CDOR effective two business days prior to the loan drawdown date, according to the relevant currency and payment frequency shall be used to calculate the entire payment schedule, as if it were a fixed rate. The principal payment schedule shall then be fixed as well as the first interest payment. The second interest payment, and so on, shall be calculated based on the relevant EURI \u00ad BOR/BBSY/LIBOR/CDOR effective two business days before the prior payment date over the outstanding principal balance initially established. (2) When the repayment of principal is made in equal instalments, the relevant EURIBOR/BBSY/LIBOR/CDOR, according to the relevant currency and payment frequency, effective two business days before the loan drawdown date and prior to each payment date shall be used to calculate the following interest payment over the outstanding principal balance. (c) Where official financing support is provided for floating rate loans, buyers/borrowers may have the option to switch from a floating rate to a fixed rate provided that the following conditions are fulfilled: (1) The option is restricted to switching to the swap rate only; (2) The option to switch shall only be exercised upon request, only once, and shall be reported accordingly with a reference to the reporting form initially sent to the Secretariat pursuant to Article 24 of this Understanding. 2. MINIMUM FIXED INTEREST RATE The minimum fixed interest rate shall be either: (a) The swap rate, concerning the relevant currency of the officially supported export credit and with a maturity equal to the interpolated rate for the two closest available annual periods to the weighted average life of the loan. The interest rate shall be set two business days prior to each drawdown date. OR (b) The Commercial Interest Reference Rate (CIRR) established according to the provisions set out in Articles 3 to 7 of this Appendix, \u25bc M3 ",

CONSTRUCTION OF CIRR (a) A CIRR is established for any of the eligible currencies set out in Article 9 of this Sector Understanding and calculated by adding a fixed margin of 120 basis points to one of the following three yields (the base rates): (1) Five-year government bond yields for a repayment term up to and including nine years, (2) Seven-year government bond yields for over nine and up to and including 12 years, or (3) Nine-year government bond yields for over 12 and up to and including 15 years. (b) CIRR shall be calculated monthly using data from the previous month and notified to the Secretariat, no later than five days after the end of each month. The Secretariat shall then inform immediately all Participants of the applicable rates and make them publicly available. CIRR shall take effect on the 15th day of each month. (c) A Participant or a non-Participant may request that a CIRR be established for the currency of a non-Participant. In consultation with the non- Participant, a Participant or the Secretariat on behalf of that non- Participant may make a proposal for the construction of the CIRR in that currency using the Common Line procedures set out in Articles 28 to 33 of this Sector Understanding. 4. VALIDITY PERIOD OF CIRR (a) Holding the CIRR: the CIRR applying to a transaction shall not be held for a period longer than six months from its selection (export contract date or any application date thereafter) to the credit agreement date. If the credit agreement is not signed within that limit, and the CIRR is reset for an additional six months, the new CIRR shall be committed at the rate prevailing at the date of reset. (b) After the credit agreement date, the CIRR shall be applied for drawing periods which do not exceed six months. After the first six-month drawing period, the CIRR is reset for the next six months; the new CIRR shall be the one prevailing at the first day of the new six-month period and cannot be lower than the CIRR originally selected (procedure to be replicated for each subsequent six-month period of drawings). 5. APPLICATION OF MINIMUM INTEREST RATES Within the provisions of the credit agreement the borrower shall not be allowed an option to switch from an officially supported floating rate financing to a pre-selected CIRR financing, nor be allowed to switch between a pre-selected CIRR and the short term market rate quoted on any interest payment date throughout the life of the loan. 6. EARLY REPAYMENT OF FIXED INTEREST RATE LOANS In the event of a voluntary, early repayment of a fixed interest rate loan as determined in Article 2 of this Appendix, or any portion thereof or when the CIRR applied under the credit agreement is modified into a floating or a swap rate, the borrower shall compensate the institution providing official financing support for all costs and losses incurred as a result of such actions, including the cost to the government institution of replacing the part of the fixed rate cash inflow interrupted by the early repayment. \u25bc M3 ",

IMMEDIATE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES When market developments require the notification of an amendment to a CIRR during the course of a month, the amended rate shall be implemented ten working days after notification of this amendment has been received by the Secretariat. 8. MARGIN BENCHMARK (a) A three-month LIBOR margin benchmark shall be calculated monthly in accordance with paragraph (b), using data notified to the Secretariat in accordance with paragraph (c), and shall take effect on the 15th day of each month. Once calculated, the margin benchmark shall be notified by the Secretariat to the Participants and shall be made publicly available. (b) The three-month LIBOR margin benchmark shall be a rate equivalent to the average of the lowest 50 % of the margins over: (i) three-month LIBOR charged for floating rate transactions and (ii) three-month LIBOR as interpolated by swapping the fixed rate issuance to a floating rate equivalent charged for fixed rate transactions or capital market issuances. In either case, the margins included in the monthly benchmark reports submitted by relevant Participants shall be those from the three full calendar months preceding the effective date set out in paragraph (a) above. Transactions/issuances that are used in the calcu \u00ad lation of the margin benchmark shall meet the following conditions: (1) 100 % unconditional guarantee transactions denominated in US dollars; and (2) Official support provided in respect of aircraft valued at or above USD 35 million (or its equivalent in any other eligible currency).

To meet the requirement of plant availability, a fossil fuel generating source is required for those periods when power from the renewable energy source is not available or sufficient. The fossil fuel source enables the usage of renewable energy in the hybrid plant, thereby achieving a significant carbon reduction compared with standard fossil fuel plant. Model 1: Two separate generation sources: one Renewable Energy and one fossil fuel. Project shall be designed such that at least 50 % of its projected total annual energy output originates from the plant's renewable energy source.

Pricing on such un-covered portions or non-covered parts should only be used if provided on commercial terms (e.g. this would exclude IFI funded portions). Name-Specific Corporate Bonds Corporate bonds reflect name specific credit risk. Care should be used in matching in terms of the ECA contract characteristics, such as term of maturity, and currency denomination, and any credit enhancements. If primary corporate bonds (i.e. all-in yield upon issuance) or secondary corporate bonds (i.e. the option adjusted spread over the appropriate curve, which is usually the relevant currency swap curve) are used, those for the obligor should be used in the first instance; if not available, primary or secondary corporate bonds from Related Entities may be used. Name-Specific Credit Default Swaps Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are a form of protection against default. The CDS spread is the amount paid per period by the buyer of the CDS as a percentage of notional principal, and is usually expressed in basis points. The CDS buyer effectively buys insurance against default by making payments to the seller of the CDS for the life of the swap, or until the credit event occurs. A CDS curve for the obligor should be used in the first instance; if not available, CDs curves from Related Entities may be used. Loan Benchmarks Primary loan benchmarks (i.e. pricing upon issuance) or secondary loan benchmarks (i.e. the current yield on the loan expected by the financial institution purchasing the loan from another financial institution). All fees must be known for primary loan benchmarks so that the all-in yield can be calculated. If loan benchmarks are used, those for the obligor should be used in the first instance; if not available, those from related entities may be used. Benchmark Market Curves Benchmark market curves reflect the credit risk of a whole sector or class of buyers. This market information may be relevant when name specific information is not available. In general, the quality of the information inherent to these markets depends upon their liquidity. In any case, one should look for market instruments that provide the closest match in terms of the ECA contract char \u00ad acteristics, such as date, credit rating, term of maturity, and currency denomi \u00ad nation. \u25bc M3 ",

It also provides the criteria by which multilateral or regional insti \u00ad tutions should be assessed when determining if an institution should be classified in connection with Article 28 of the Arrangement. APPLICATION Case 1: Guarantee for the Total Amount at Risk When security in the form of a repayment guarantee from an entity is provided for the total amount at risk (i.e. principal and interest), the applicable Country Risk Classification and Buyer Risk Category may be that of the guarantor when the following criteria are met: \u2014 The guarantee covers the entire duration of the credit. \u2014 The guarantee is irrevocable, unconditional and available on-demand. \u2014 The guarantee is legally valid and capable of being enforced in the guarantor country's jurisdiction. \u2014 The guarantor is creditworthy in relation to the size of the guaranteed debt. \u2014 The guarantor is subject to the monetary control and transfer regulations of the country in which it is located. For classified Multilateral or Regional Institutions acting as guarantors, the following criteria apply: \u2014 The guarantee covers the entire duration of the credit. \u2014 The guarantee is irrevocable, unconditional and available on-demand. \u2014 The guarantor is legally committed for the total amount of the credit. \u2014 The repayments are made directly to the creditor. If the guarantor is a subsidiary/parent of the guaranteed entity, Participants shall, on a case-by-case basis, determine whether: (1) in consideration of the rela \u00ad tionship between the subsidiary/parent and the degree of legal commitment of the parent, the subsidiary/parent is legally and financially independent and could fulfil its payment obligations; (2) the subsidiary/parent could be affected by local events/regulations or sovereign intervention; and (3) the Head Office would in the event of a default regard itself as being liable. Case 2: Guarantee Limited in Amount When security in the form of a repayment guarantee from an entity is provided for a limited amount at risk (i.e. principal and interest), the applicable Country Risk Classification and Buyer Risk Category may be that of the guarantor for the portion of the credit subject to the guarantee, providing that all other criteria listed under Case 1 are met. For the unguaranteed portion, the applicable Country Risk Classification and Buyer Risk Category is that of the obligor. \u25bc M3 ",

Such institutions shall be classified in Country Risk Categories 0 through 7 on a case-by-case basis according to an assessment of the risk of each on its own merits and in consideration of whether: \u2014 the institution has statutory and financial independence, \u2014 all of the institution's assets are immune from nationalisation or confiscation, \u2014 the institution has full freedom of transfer and conversion of funds, \u2014 the institution is not subject to government intervention in the country where it is located, \u2014 the institution has tax immunity, and \u2014 there is an obligation of all its Member countries to supply additional capital to meet the institution's obligations. The assessment should also take into consideration the historical payment record in situations of country credit risks default either in the country where it is located or in an obligor's country; and any other factors which may be deemed appropriate in the assessment process. The list of classified multilateral and regional institutions is not closed and a Participant may nominate an institution for review according to the above-listed considerations. The classifications of multilateral and regional institutions shall be made public by the Participants. \u25bc M3 ",

The entity achieving such a classification is one with an exceptionally strong credit profile which could be expected to fulfil its payment obligations during a period of sovereign debt distress or even default. International Credit Rating Agencies issue regular reports listing Corporate and Counterparty Ratings that exceed the Sovereign's Foreign Currency Rating. Except when the risk sovereign has been identified through the Sovereign Risk Assessment Methodology as being significantly higher than country risk, Participants proposing that an entity be classified as better than sovereign shall reference such better than sovereign ratings in support of their recommendation. In order to be classified as better than its host sovereign, an entity would be expected to display several or normally a majority of the following characteristics or equivalents: \u2014 A strong credit profile, \u2014 substantial foreign exchange earnings relative to its currency debt burden, \u2014 production facilities and cash generation ability from subsidiaries or oper \u00ad ations offshore, especially those domiciled in highly rated sovereigns, i.e. multinational enterprises, \u2014 a foreign owner or a strategic partner which could be relied on as a source of financial support in the absence of a formal guarantee, \u2014 a history of preferential treatment of the entity by the sovereign, including exemption from transfer and convertibility constraints and surrender requirements for export proceeds, and favourable tax treatment, \u2014 committed credit lines from highly rated international banks, especially credit lines without a material adverse change (MAC) clause which enable banks to withdraw committed facilities in the event of a sovereign crisis or other risk events, and \u2014 assets held offshore, especially liquid assets, often as a result of rules allowing exporters to trap and maintain cash balances offshore that are available for debt service. Normally the SOV+ buyer risk category is not applicable to: \u2014 Publicly owned entities and utilities, sub-sovereigns as line ministries, regional governments, etc., \u2014 financial institutions domiciled in the sovereign's jurisdiction, and \u2014 entities primarily selling to the domestic market in local currency. Sovereign (SOV) Sovereign obligors/guarantors are entities that are explicitly legally mandated to enter into a debt payment obligation on the behalf of the Sovereign State, typically Ministry of Finance or Central bank ( 1 ). A risk designated as sovereign is one where: \u25bc M3 ( 1 ) Most typically this would be a risk on the central bank or Ministry of Finance. For central government entities other than the finance ministry, due diligence shall be undertaken to affirm that the entity commits the full faith and credit of the sovereign. ",

Equivalent to the Sovereign (CC0): Exceptionally Good Credit Quality The \u2018equivalent to sovereign\u2019 category embraces two basic types of obligors/ guarantors: \u2014 Public entities where due diligence reveals that either the buyer has the implicit full faith and credit/support of the sovereign or that the likelihood of sovereign liquidity and solvency support is very high, both in relation to recovery prospects as well as default risk. Non-sovereign public entities equivalent to the sovereign would also include companies owned by the government with a monopoly or near monopoly on operations in a sector (e.g. power, oil, gas). \u2014 Corporate entities with an exceptionally strong credit profile, displaying features in terms of both default and recovery prospects which indicate that the risk could be seen as being equivalent to sovereign. Candidates could include strong blue chip corporates or very important banks for which the likelihood of sovereign liquidity and solvency support is high. Exceptionally good credit quality implies that the risk of payment interruption is expected to be negligible and that the entity has an exceptionally strong capacity for repayment and this capacity is not likely to be affected by foreseeable events. The credit quality is typically manifested in a combination of some, if not all, of the following characteristics of the entity's business and financial profile: \u2014 exceptionally good to very good cash and income generation \u2014 exceptionally good to very good liquidity levels \u2014 exceptionally low to very low leverage \u2014 excellent to very strong business profile with proven and very strong management abilities The entity is also characterised by a high quality of financial and ownership disclosure, unless there is a very high likelihood of support from a parent (or sovereign) with a buyer risk classification that is equal to or better than what corresponds to this buyer risk category. Depending on the classification of the country in which the obligor/guarantor is domiciled, it is likely that an obligor/guarantor classified in buyer risk category CC0 would be rated between AAA (Country Category 1) and B (Country Category 7) by accredited CRAs. Very Good Credit Quality (CC1) The risk of payment interruption is expected to be low or very low. The obligor/ guarantor has a very strong capacity for repayment and this capacity is not likely to be affected by foreseeable events. The obligor/guarantor has a limited or very limited susceptibility to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. The credit quality is typically manifested in a combination of some, if not all, of the following characteristics of the business and financial profile: \u2014 very good to good cash and income generation \u2014 very good to good liquidity levels \u2014 very low to low leverage \u25bc M3 ",

Moderate Credit Quality, Average (CC3) The risk of payment interruption is expected to be moderate or moderately low. The obligor/guarantor has a moderate or moderately good capacity for repayment. There is a possibility of credit risk developing as the obligor/ guarantor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions which could lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely payments. However, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met. The credit quality is typically manifested in a combination of some, if not all, of the following characteristics of the business and financial profile. \u2014 moderately good to moderate cash and income generation \u2014 moderately good to moderate liquidity levels \u2014 moderately low to moderate leverage \u2014 moderate business profile with proven management abilities The entity is also characterised by an adequate quality of financial and ownership disclosure, unless there is a very high likelihood of support from a parent (or sovereign) with a buyer risk classification that is equal to or better than what corresponds to this buyer risk category.

The obligor/ guarantor has a moderate to moderately weak capacity for repayment. There is a possibility of credit risk developing as the obligor/guarantor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions which could lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely payments.

Weak Credit Quality (CC5) The risk of payment interruption is expected to be high to very high. The obligor/guarantor has a moderately weak to weak capacity for repayment. The obligor/guarantor currently has the capacity to meet repayments but a limited margin of safety remains. However, there is a likelihood of developing payment problems as the capacity for continued payment is contingent upon a sustained, favourable business and economic environment. Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to repay. The credit quality is typically manifested in a combination of some, if not all, of the following characteristics of the business and financial profile: \u2014 moderately weak to weak to very weak cash and income generation \u2014 moderately weak to weak liquidity levels \u2014 moderately high to high leverage \u2014 weak business profile with limited or no track record of management abilities The entity is also characterised by a poor quality of financial and ownership disclosure, unless there is a very high likelihood of support from a parent (or sovereign) with a buyer risk classification that is equal to or better than what corresponds to this buyer risk category.

COUNTRY RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES 1. Offshore Future Flow Structure Combined with Offshore Escrow Account Definition: A written document, such as a deed or a release or trustee arrangement, sealed and delivered to a third party, i.e. a person not party to the instrument, to be held by such third party until the fulfilment of certain conditions and then to be delivered by him to the other party to take effect. If the following criteria are satisfied subject to consideration of the additional factors listed, this technique can reduce or eliminate the transfer risks, mainly in the higher risk country categories. Criteria: \u2014 The escrow account is related to a foreign exchange-earning project and the flows into the escrow account are generated by the project itself and/or by other offshore export receivables. \u2014 The escrow account is held offshore, i.e. located outside of the country of the project where there are very limited, transfer or other country risks (i.e. in a High Income OECD country or High Income Euro Area country). \u2014 The escrow account is located in a first class bank which is not directly or indirectly controlled by interests of the obligor or by the country of the obligor. \u2014 The funding of the account is secured through long-term or other appro \u00ad priate contracts. \u2014 The combination of the sources of revenues (i.e. generated by the project itself and/or the other sources) of the obligor flowing through the account are in hard currency and can reasonably be expected to be collectively sufficient for the service of the debt for the entire duration of the credit, and come from one or more creditworthy foreign customers located in better risk countries than the country in which the project is located (i.e. normally High Income OECD countries or High Income Euro Area coun \u00ad tries). \u2014 The obligor irrevocably instructs the foreign customers to pay directly into the account (i.e. the payments are not forwarded through an account controlled by the obligor or through its country). \u2014 The funds which have to be kept within the account are equal to at least six months of debt service. Where flexible repayment terms are being applied under a project finance structure, an amount equivalent to the actual six months debt service under such flexible terms are to be kept within the account; this amount may vary over time depending on the debt service profile. \u25bc M3 ",
        "02011R1233 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.03.2018 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 129 \u2014 The obligor has restricted access to the account (i.e. only after payment of the debt service under the credit). \u2014 The revenues deposited in the account are assigned to the lender as direct beneficiary, for the entire life of the credit. \u2014 The opening of the account has received all the necessary legal authoris \u00ad ations from the local and any other appropriate authorities. \u2014 The escrow account and contractual arrangements may not be conditional and/or revocable and/or limited in duration. Additional Factors to be taken into Consideration: The technique applies subject to a case-by-case consideration of the above characteristics and, inter alia, with regard to: \u2014 the country, the obligor (i.e. either public or private), the sector, the vulnerability in relation to the commodities or services involved, including their availability for the entire duration of the credit, the customers, \u2014 the legal structures, e.g. whether the mechanism is sufficiently immune against the influence of the obligor or its country, \u2014 the degree to which the technique remains subject to government inter \u00ad ference, renewal or withdrawal, \u2014 whether the account would be sufficiently protected against project-related risks, \u2014 the amount which will flow into the account and the mechanism for the continuation of appropriate provision, \u2014 the situation with regard to the Paris Club (e.g. possible exemption), \u2014 the possible impact of country risks other than the transfer risk, \u2014 the protection against the risks of the country where the account is located, \u2014 the contracts with the customers, including their nature and duration, and \u2014 the global amount of the expected foreign earnings in relation to the total amount of the credit. Impact on the MPR The application of this country risk mitigation technique may result in a one category improvement in the applicable country risk classification for the transaction, except for transactions in Country Risk Category 1. 2. Local Currency Financing Definition: Contract and financing negotiated in convertible and available local, other than hard, currencies and financed locally that eliminates or mitigates the transfer risk. The primary debt obligation in local currency would, in prin \u00ad ciple, not be affected by the occurrence of the first two country credit risks. Criteria: \u2014 The ECA liability and claims payment or the payment to the Direct Lender are expressed/made throughout in local currency. \u2014 The ECA is normally not exposed to the transfer risk. \u25bc M3 ",
        "02011R1233 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.03.2018 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 130 \u2014 In the normal course of events, there will be no requirement for local currency deposits to be converted into hard currency. \u2014 The borrower's repayment in his own currency and in his own country is a valid discharge of the loan obligation. \u2014 If a borrower's income is in local currency the borrower is protected against adverse exchange rate movements. \u2014 Transfer regulations in the borrower's country should not affect the borrower's repayment obligations, which would remain in local currency. Additional Factors to be taken into Consideration: The technique applies on a selective basis in respect of convertible and trans \u00ad ferable currencies, where the underlying economy is sound. The Participant ECA should be in a position to meet its obligations to pay claims expressed in its own currency in the event that the local currency becomes either \u2018non- transferable\u2019 or \u2018non-convertible\u2019 after the ECA takes on liability. (A Direct Lender would however carry this exposure.) Impact on the MPR The application of this risk mitigation technique may result in a discount of no more than 20 % to the country credit risk portion of the MPR (i.e. a local currency factor [LCF] with a value of no more than 0,2). BUYER RISK CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS The following table provides definitions of the buyer risk credit enhancements that may be applied, along with their maximum impact on the applicable MPRs through the CEF in the MPR formula. Credit Enhancement Definition Maximum CEF (Country Risk Category 1-7) Maximum CEF (Market Bench \u00ad mark) Assignment of Contract Proceeds or Receivables In the event a borrower has contracts with strong off-takers, whether offshore or local, a legally enforceable assignment of the contract provides rights to enforce the borrower's contracts and/or make decisions under major contracts in the place of the borrower after a default under the loan. A direct agreement with a third party in a transaction (a local government agency in a mining or energy transaction) allows Lenders to approach a government to seek remedies for expropriation or other violation of contractual obligations related to the transaction. An existing company operating in a difficult market or sector may have receivables related to the sale of production with a company or companies located in a more stable environment. Receivables would generally be in a hard currency but may not be the subject of a specific contractual relationship. Assignment of these receivables could provide asset security in the accounts of the Borrower, giving the Lender a preferential treatment in the cash flow generated by the Borrower. 0,10 N/A \u25bc M3 ",

An asset based security is one that can be reacquired with relative ease such as a locomotive, medical equipment or construction equipment. In valuing such a security, the ECA should take into consideration the legal ease of recovery. In other words, there is more value when the security interest in the asset is perfected under an established legal regime and less value where the legal ability to recover the asset is questionable. The precise value of an asset-based security is set by the market, with the relevant \u2018market\u2019 being deeper than a local market because the asset can be moved to another jurisdiction. NOTE: The application of an asset based security credit enhancement applies to the buyer risk, where the asset based security is held internally within the country in which the transaction is domiciled. 0,25 0,15 Fixed Asset Security A fixed asset security is most typically component equipment which may be constrained by its physicality such as turbine or manufacturing machinery integrated into an assembly line. The intent and value of the fixed asset security is to provide the ECA with more leverage over the use of the asset in recouping losses in the event of default. The value of a fixed asset security varies dependent on economic, legal, market and other factors. 0,15 0,10 Escrow Account Escrow accounts involve debt service reserve accounts held as security for the lenders or other forms of cash receivable accounts held as security for the lenders by a party not controlled or sharing common ownership with the buyer/ obligor. The escrowed amount must be deposited or escrowed in advance. The value of such security is nearly always 100 % of the nominal amount in such cash accounts. Permits greater control over use of cash, ensures that debt is serviced before discretionary spending. NOTE: The appli \u00ad cation of an escrow account credit enhancement applies to the buyer risk, where the escrow account is held internally within the country in which the transaction is domiciled. Cash security significantly diminishes the risk of default for the covered instalments. escrowed amount as % of credit up to a maximum of 0,10 escrowed amount as % of credit up to a maximum of 0,10 \u25bc M3 ",

They are essentially contained in the: \u2014 DAC Principles for Project Appraisal, 1988, \u2014 DAC Guiding Principles for Associated Financing and Tied and Partially Untied Official Development Assistance, 1987, and \u2014 Good Procurement Practices for Official Development Assistance, 1986. CONSISTENCY OF THE PROJECT WITH THE RECIPIENT COUNTRY'S OVERALL INVESTMENT PRIORITIES (PROJECT SELECTION) Is the project part of investment and public expenditure programmes already approved by the central financial and planning authorities of the recipient country? (Specify policy document mentioning the project, e.g. public investment programme of the recipient country.) Is the project being co-financed with an international development finance insti \u00ad tution? Does evidence exist that the project has been considered and rejected by an international development finance institution or another DAC Member on grounds of low developmental priority? In the case of a private sector project, has it been approved by the government of the recipient country? Is the project covered by an intergovernmental agreement providing for a broader range of aid activities by the donor in the recipient country? PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL Has the project been prepared, designed and appraised against a set of standards and criteria broadly consistent with the DAC Principles for Project Appraisal (PPA)? Relevant principles concern project appraisal under: (a) Economic aspects (paragraphs 30 to 38 PPA). (b) Technical aspects (paragraph 22 PPA). (c) Financial aspects (paragraphs 23 to 29 PPA). In the case of a revenue producing project, particularly if it is producing for a competitive market, has the concessionary element of the aid financing been passed on to the end-user of the funds? (paragraph 25 PPA). (a) Institutional assessment (paragraphs 40 to 44 PPA). (b) Social and distributional analysis (paragraphs 47 to 57 PPA). (c) Environmental assessment (paragraphs 55 to 57 PPA). \u25bc M3 ",

(b) Common Line : an understanding between the Participants to agree, for a given transaction or in special circumstances, on specific financial terms and conditions for official support. The rules of an agreed Common Line supersede the rules of the Arrangement only for the transaction or in the circumstances specified in the Common Line. (c) Concessionality Level of Tied Aid : in the case of grants the conces \u00ad sionality level is 100 %. In the case of loans, the concessionality level is the difference between the nominal value of the loan and the discounted present value of the future debt service payments to be made by the borrower. This difference is expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the loan. (d) Decommissioning : closing down or dismantling of a nuclear power plant. (e) Export Contract Value : the total amount to be paid by or on behalf of the purchaser for goods and/or services exported, i.e. excluding local costs as defined hereafter; in the case of a lease, it excludes the portion of the lease payment that is equivalent to interest. (f) Final Commitment : for an export credit transaction (either in the form of a single transaction or a line of credit), a final commitment exists when the Participant commits to precise and complete financial terms and conditions, either through a reciprocal agreement or by a unilateral act. (g) Initial Fuel Load : the initial fuel load shall consist of no more than the initially installed nuclear core plus two subsequent reloads, together consisting of up to two-thirds of a nuclear core. (h) Interest Rate Support : an arrangement between a government and banks or other financial institutions which allows the provision of fixed rate export finance at or above the CIRR. (i) Line of Credit : a framework, in whatever form, for export credits that covers a series of transactions which may or may not be linked to a specific project. (j) Local Costs : expenditure for goods and services in the buyer's country that are necessary either for executing the exporter's contract or for completing the project of which the exporter's contract forms a part. These exclude commission payable to the exporter's agent in the buying country. (k) Market Benchmark Transaction : transaction involving ultimate obligors/ guarantors in Category 0 countries, High Income OECD countries and High Income Euro Area countries. (l) Minimum Actuarial Premium : is the annualised average default rate (derived from cumulative default rates published by the main Accredited CRAs) for a given rating and total term (WAL of the whole transaction) adjusted by an assumed loss given default and a costs loading factor as per agreed conventions by the Participants. \u25bc M3 ",

(n) Pure Cover : official support provided by or on behalf of a government by way of export credit guarantee or insurance only, i.e. which does not benefit from official financing support. (o) Related Entity : Related Entity references are benchmark instruments of a related borrower rather than the exact identical borrower in the supported transaction. In the case where the obligor has no quoted bonds or CDSs, and there exists within the obligor's organisational structure a parent, subsidiary or sister company with Name Specific Bonds or CDSs outstanding in the market, then with regard to Article 24(c), those Name Specific Bonds or CDSs may be used as if they had been issued by the obligor itself if: (1) The parent, subsidiary, or sister company has the same issuer CRA rating as the obligor/guarantor; or (2) All of the following criteria are met: (i) The Participant's internal rating of the obligor/guarantor corresponds with the CRA rating of the related entity. (ii) The obligor/guarantor is the main operating company of the parent/ holding, being a key and integral part of the group's business. (iii) The CRA rating is based on the core business of the group. (iv) The obligor/guarantor provides a significant part of the group's earnings by providing either some of the group's core products/ services to core clients or it owns and operates a major portion of the parent's assets. (v) The sale of the obligor/guarantor from the group is very hard to conceive, and the disposal would significantly alter the overall shape of the group. (vi) A default of the obligor/guarantor would constitute a huge repu \u00ad tational risk to the group, damage its franchise and could threaten its viability. (vii) A high level of management and operational integration exists where capital and funding is typically provided by the parent company or a finance subsidiary via intercompany loans and where parent support is unquestioned. (p) Repayment Term : the period beginning at the starting point of credit, as defined in this Annex, and ending on the contractual date of the final repayment of principal. (q) Starting Point of Credit : (1) Parts or components (intermediate goods) including related services: in the case of parts or components, the starting point of credit is not later than the actual date of acceptance of the goods or the weighted mean date of acceptance of the goods (including services, if applicable) by the buyer or, for services, the date of the submission of the invoices to the client or acceptance of services by the client. \u25bc M3 ",

In the case of a contract for the supply of services where the supplier has responsibility for commissioning, the latest starting point is commissioning. (3) Capital goods and project services \u2014 machinery or equipment of high value intended to be used in an industrial process or for productive or commercial use: \u2014 In the case of a contract for the sale of capital goods consisting of individual items usable in themselves, the latest starting point is the actual date when the buyer takes physical possession of the goods, or the weighted mean date when the buyer takes physical possession of the goods. \u2014 In the case of a contract for the sale of capital equipment for complete plant or factories where the supplier has no responsibility for commissioning, the latest starting point is the date at which the buyer is to take physical possession of the entire equipment (excluding spare parts) supplied under the contract. \u2014 If the exporter has responsibility for commissioning, the latest starting point is at commissioning. \u2014 For services, the latest starting point of credit is the date of the submission of the invoices to the client or acceptance of service by the client.
