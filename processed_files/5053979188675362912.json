        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 8 Abstract This report is part of the study \u2018Analysis of Cross -border obstacles between EU Member States and Enlargement Countries\u2019. It is looking to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of Interreg IPA programmes and supporting border regions in overcoming challenges due to national borders. The study is a comprehensive review of existing external cross-border obstacles and identifies obstacles that can impact the five Policy Objectives and two Interreg Specific Objectives of the 2021-2027 programming period. The study also offers ideas on how Interreg IPA programmes can address these obstacles in the future. The geographic focus of the study is on the borders between EU Member States and candidate and potential candidate countries. The study builds on an extensive literature analysis, a survey of stakeholders and case studies. This report is the result of a joint analysis of these sources and their triangulation. Annex I details the methodological approach of the study. The core data has been integrated in an inventory of obstacles for cross-border cooperation. This report presents the main findings of the study. ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 9 Executive summary The study \u2018Analysis of Cross -border obstacles between European Union (EU) Member States and Enlargement Countries\u2019 aims to comprehensively review existing external cross-border obstacles and identify obstacles that can impact the five Policy Objectives and two Interreg Specific Objectives of the 2021-2027 programming period. The study also provides orientations on how 2021-2027 Interreg Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) programmes can address these obstacles . The geographic focus of the study is on the borders between EU Member States and candidate and potential candidate countries. The study builds on an extensive literature analysis, a survey of stakeholders and case studies. This report is the result of a joint analysis of these sources and their triangulation. The core data has been integrated in an inventory of obstacles for cross- border cooperation which is available upon request. Types of obstacle In this study, the characterisation of obstacles for cross-border cooperation and integration builds on the concept of a \u2018 multi-dimensional border reality \u2019 . This assumes that all land borders have simultaneously a political, a geographical and natural, an economic and a socio-cultural dimension. Each dimension creates specific border effects that can prevent or hinder cross-border relations (closure effects) and enables or further advances cross-border relations (opening effects). Border obstacles are therefore specific closure effects due to these four border dimensions, but the \u2018roots\u2019 and scope of border obstacles differ because these dimensions differ. The inventory developed during the study establishes a basic taxonomy along these four dimensions, differentiating the obstacles by their roots. The inventory includes 222 obstacles but does not claim to be complete since it includes only obstacles that were either sufficiently well documented in literature or reported in the survey. The complementarity of those obstacles identified in literature and through the survey suggest that in terms of variety and relevance, the inventory mirrors the obstacles for cross-border cooperation in a balanced way. In addition to the 222 obstacles in the inventory, literature analysis and the survey hint at further obstacles to cross-border cooperation. Typical cross-cutting or horizontal obstacles that may also affect solutions are: \u2022 lack of financial resources; \u2022 low GDP or high discontinuities; \u2022 low innovation; \u2022 lagging digitalisation; \u2022 gender inequality. About 90% of the obstacles in the inventory directly relate either to the political or geographical/natural dimension of state borders in South-East Europe (SEE). Political obstacles 58% of the obstacles relate to the political dimension of SEE borders. Legal and administrative barriers hamper cross-border cooperation. The inventory differentiates seven causes. Two refer to the interpretation of borders and their official recognition in SEE, two describe legal obstacles resulting from national and EU law and the last three are due to administrative and governance conditions. The complementarity of obstacles found through the literature review and the survey led to a relatively equal representation of the seven roots in the inventory. ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 10 Geographic-natural obstacles 32% of inventory obstacles relate to the geographic-natural dimension of SEE borders due to: \u2022 insufficient transport and border crossing infrastructure ; \u2022 natural barriers (e.g. mountain ranges, rivers, lakes) that affect accessibility and connectivity in border areas; \u2022 inadequate protection and management of natural resources or other barriers negatively affecting cross-border ecological connectivity. Most geographical-natural obstacles in SEE are due to a lack of cross-border (transport) infrastructure to overcome barriers. Many highlight the hampering effects of a lack of efficient infrastructure and equipment at road border crossing points in SEE between EU Member States and enlargement countries. About one third of geographical-natural obstacles in the inventory are due to a lack of coordination of natural resource management. In most cases this affects the management of protected areas, logging in forests or water resources. Root causes of these obstacles can, however, sometimes be linked to a lack of harmonisation in the legal framework. Economic and socio-cultural obstacles The economic dimension may be influenced by socio-economic conditions in neighbouring border regions. Significant socio-economic discontinuities along borders simultaneously represent \u2018 push \u2019 and \u2018 pull \u2019 factors, which may generate both opportunities for cooperation and impediments. The socio-cultural dimension considers perceptions of inhabitants in neighbouring border regions and how they relate to other groups by using specific concepts of collective identification. In view of the many significant socio-cultural dividing lines in SEE, this dimension is particularly important to understand cross-border cooperation in the area. 10% of the obstacles relate to the economic or socio-cultural dimensions of SEE borders. These obstacles stem from pronounced socio-economic discontinuities , mental or language barriers . Mental barriers can be further differentiated as: \u2022 those hampering effective integration of environmental considerations into economic and sector policies ; \u2022 different sense of belonging by people in neighbouring border regions; \u2022 different perception, interpretation and collective or group-specific articulation of the historical legacy and cultural traditions . Geographical relevance of obstacles The geography of obstacles is diverse. Cross-border obstacles may concern the entire length of a border, a smaller segment , or even all border areas and be between EU and non-EU members, or among candidate countries. More specifically, about 40% of the cross-border obstacles concern the entire length of a border between an EU Member State and an IPA country, while 23% concern smaller border segments between an EU Member State and an IPA country. 18% of obstacles are between two candidate countries. Their share is likely to be underestimated, since borders between candidate countries were not in the focus of the study. Most obstacles at smaller border segments between EU and IPA countries are rooted in the geographical and natural dimension. They most often relate to nature conservation and transport links. ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 11 Effects of obstacles Negative direct effects A border obstacle usually causes a negative direct effect with adverse consequences for all kinds of organisations, groups or individuals crossing the border. These consequences may be financial and/or non-financial. Around half the obstacles lead to both. The following can be observed for the most frequently affected policy areas: \u2022 Cross-border obstacles affect economic development with direct effects in terms of loss of time, additional costs and inconvenient cross-border travelling, while the labour market and employment obstacles lead to restrictions in accessing services as well as individual income losses. \u2022 Insufficient cross-border cooperation in health care leads to restrictions to accessing services , loss of time and additional costs. \u2022 Higher transaction costs for business activities, inconvenient cross- border travel and loss of time are frequent effects of transport and mobility obstacles. \u2022 Obstacles affecting environmental protection and natural resources lead to the ineffective provision or use of public infrastructure , additional costs and individual income losses. Adverse secondary effects These can emerge if a negative direct effect is aggravated by other factors or obstacles (\u2018re i nforcement effects\u2019) and/or if the obstacle itself induces other undesirable developments within the cross- border region (\u2018 knock-on effects \u2019). In the inventory, 65% of cases result in knock-on effects with further negative developments . Wider impact The combination of negative direct effects and adverse secondary effects results in a \u2018wider negative impact\u2019 in the cross -border region. Wider impacts differ in nature and thematic orientation. They can hinder socio-economic development in a cross-border region, prevent more functional integration, weaken socio-cultural ties, strengthen existing tensions, harm the environment and lower the quality of life for citizens in this region. The wider negative impact can differ in magnitude and may concern one or more of the above-mentioned themes. Half the obstacles have strong negative impacts . Policy areas and solutions The analysis shows both the potential for Interreg IPA programmes to mitigate cross- border cooperation obstacles and the limits of these programmes to overcome them. Some obstacles need to be solved through national legislation, or programmes, or large- scale investment beyond the capacity of Interreg IPA programmes. These programmes can, however, address negative situations in cross- border areas through \u2018softer\u2019 measures and by involving national representatives may encourage further actions that can resolve obstacles permanently. Relevant policy areas Adequate policy responses can be a stepping stone towards mitigating obstacles and finding solutions across borders. Each obstacle in the inventory is connected with a policy area. More than half the obstacles relate to transport and sustainable mobility, natural resources and environmental protection, or civil protection and public security. Within transport and sustainable mobility, a common issue concerns border crossing points and customs clearance processes, which mostly focus on obstacles at a specific border crossing or segment. About half the natural resources and environmental protection obstacles can be addressed through joint nature management measures and are usually relevant for several border areas. ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 12 In addition, labour market and education policy areas with their indirect effects are among the most important policy areas for cross-border cooperation obstacles. Labour and employment policy differs greatly between SEE countries, which strengthens the need for cross-border cooperation in this field. There are obstacles for cross-border cooperation in SEE in all policy areas, implying that comprehensive measures are needed to overcome these in the medium- to long-term. Interreg IPA programmes can contribute through all Policy Objectives to this process. Geographical relevance All policy areas are relevant for obstacles at the full length or a segment of the border. Some policy areas refer to broader or very local obstacles. This combination of local and wider geographic relevance indicates a need for targeted IPA programmes. Obstacles affecting all or most borders in SEE are linked especially to transport and mobility, natural resources and environmental protection, civil protection and public security as well as climate change action. These policy areas may thus require not only cross-border but also transnational coordination. Stakeholders and solution approaches Stakeholders are affected by obstacles for cross-border cooperation in two ways. Firstly, obstacles affect the well-being of citizens in border areas or the efficient delivery of services, business competitiveness, effective administration, the quality of transboundary eco-systems, etc. In other words, this is about the direct and secondary effects and impacts on living conditions in border areas. Some obstacles affect all citizens, while others have direct effects only for certain groups. Similarly, businesses and administrations in the border regions are affected. Effects for them are even more multi-dimensional since they are often also needed to implement solutions in overcoming obstacles to cross-border cooperation. Any solution aiming to at least mitigate or possibly resolve obstacles needs to involve stakeholders with adequate responsibilities and capacity . Thus, the more approaches that are needed to mitigate an obstacle, the more stakeholders may become involved, though not necessarily during the whole process. The analysis differentiates levels of governance from EU to local level as well as other public and private sector stakeholders, resulting in 14 stakeholder groups. On average, about five to six types of stakeholders per obstacle are relevant or required to implement solutions. National governments are by far the most important and may, indeed, be needed if obstacles are to be completely removed e.g. through legislative action or interstate agreements. Other levels of government are often required for mitigation measures but also to implement national action locally or even induce national authorities to act. In this context, local and regional authorities and cross-border cooperation structures are crucial. These findings illustrate the limitations faced by Interreg IPA programmes to solve obstacles. While they can contribute and may provide essential support to mitigating or solving cross-border obstacles, often national measures are also required. Secondly, various stakeholders are needed to mitigating or solving obstacles. Most actions require multilevel-governance approaches, implying new cooperation as well as capacity and readiness for new methods and tools and often a combination of approaches . A quarter of all solutions require legislation or agreements. More than half need governance (\u2018soft\u2019) approaches . New cross-border cooperation structures and cross-border public services account for about 15% of approaches. For about 90% of obstacles, regional/local governance approaches may be enough to solve an obstacle or can mitigate them and/or facilitate more sustainable solutions, e.g. through interstate agreements or new cooperation structures. Nearly 80% of obstacles require more than one approach. ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 13 Findings for future IPA programmes In some cases, action under different Policy Objectives (POs) may be necessary to address the obstacles in the inventory. Interreg Strategic Objective (ISO) 1 \u2018A better cooperation governance\u2019 is by far the most relevant and may be useful to address nearly half the obstacles. Also important are PO 2 \u2018A greener, low-carbon Europe\u2019 and PO 3 \u2018A more connected Europe\u2019. ISO 1 is highly relevant as it can be frequently combined with other POs to contribute to solving obstacles for cross-border cooperation. The case studies highlight that ISO 1 may provide different and very targeted support to border areas in SEE. In most cases it is about capacity building and establishing cooperation routines. These findings raise the question, as to how far Interreg IPA programmes 2021-2027 plan a priority axis on ISO 1. It seems four of the ten Interreg IPA programmes plan to implement an ISO 1 priority, which would not mirror the need for ISO 1 related measures to mitigate obstacles to cross-border cooperation. The number of insufficiently working cross-border cooperation structures and the relevance of ISO 1 for obstacles across policy areas further support this finding. Conclusions and policy pointers The EC Communication on boosting growth and cohesion in EU border regions has listed ten measures to address the challenges and particularities of border regions. These challenges and particularities are also relevant for border regions between EU Member States and IPA countries. Cross-border cooperation and integration may be even more challenged and varied on these borders. This calls for another type of measure. There is a need for capacity building in border areas and cross-border cooperation . For Interreg IPA programmes the challenges differ, however, from those addressed by Interreg programmes, especially the development of cross-border cooperation structures. SEE border regions need stronger cross-border cooperation structures to facilitate many processes and measures to tackle challenges in border regions. In this context, increasing the engagement of key actors in candidate and potential candidate countries in Interreg IPA programmes is central. In addition, many potential beneficiaries also face a lack of financial resources to pre- and co-finance Interreg IPA actions . This is a cross-cutting obstacle to cooperation on all borders between EU and IPA countries often hampering local stakeholder participation in these programmes. This impacts the intensity of cooperation and the range of initiatives that could alleviate or solve obstacles across borders. National interventions, such as schemes that ensure co-financing and/or interim funding to a ceiling of Interreg IPA participation could also help to mitigate a lack of resources in Member States and neighbouring candidate and potential candidate countries. The EU can and must play a role through the enlargement process and cross-border cooperation programmes in the region (Interreg IPA), since it is a powerful stimulus for action at local and regional level. These and other EU support in SEE should be seen in the wider policy context of the region. A lack of trust and mental barriers may not always be visible at first glance as the main root cause for border obstacles. However, these are often an additional and reinforcing reason hampering cross-border cooperation. Other external influences in the region matter as well. A watchful eye should be kept on these influences to avoid developments that could hamper the EU accession prospects of SEE countries. Past enlargement experience may be useful to illustrate how important it is to implement the requirements of the \u2018 acquis communautaire \u2019 prior to EU accession. At the same time, lengthy processes \u2013 especially in view of other external influences \u2013 may negatively affect the motivation of SEE governments to focus on the \u2018 acquis communautaire \u2019 . Preferential conditions for candidate countries where these pre-requisites are ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 14 fulfilled as well as more financial support may counter-balance external influences and help overcome cross-border cooperation obstacles. Additional financial support could also avoid an increasing gap of resources for regional and territorial development between EU Member States and enlargement countries. Notwithstanding the focus of specific Interreg IPA programmes, future interventions should be more about actions on mitigating obstacles for cross-border cooperation rather than encouraging cooperation more generally. One way forward may be to focus on related Specific Objectives (SOs) across POs that could support one obstacle mitigation measure with another (e.g. ISO 1 together with an SO of a thematic PO). To achieve visible effects, several steps may be needed before overcoming the obstacle. These steps are important to tailor cooperation to find solutions. Interreg IPA programmes can contribute throughout these processes. ",

Chaque dimension cr\u00e9e des effets frontaliers sp\u00e9cifiques qui peuvent emp\u00eacher ou entraver les relations transfrontali\u00e8res (effets de fermeture) et permettre ou faire progresser davantage les relations transfrontali\u00e8res (effets d\u2019ouverture). Les obstacles frontaliers sont donc des effets de fermeture sp\u00e9cifiques dus \u00e0 ces quatre dimensions frontali\u00e8res, mais les origines et la port\u00e9e des obstacles frontaliers diff\u00e8rent parce que ces dimensions diff\u00e8rent.

Les obstacles juridiques et administratifs entravent la coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re. L\u2019inventaire diff\u00e9rencie sept causes. Deux de ces causes se r\u00e9f\u00e8rent au statut politique des fronti\u00e8res et \u00e0 leur reconnaissance officielle en ESE, deux d\u00e9crivent les obstacles juridiques r\u00e9sultant du droit national et/ou du droit de l\u2019UE et les trois derniers sont dus ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 16 aux conditions administratives et de gouvernance. Ces sept causes sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quivalente dans l\u2019inventaire. Obstacles g\u00e9ographiques et naturels 32% des obstacles identifi\u00e9s dans l\u2019inventair e sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 la dimension g\u00e9ographique et naturelle des fronti\u00e8res de l\u2019ESE en raison de: \u2022 l\u2019insuffisance des infrastructures de transport et de passage des fronti\u00e8res ; \u2022 les obstacles naturels (p. ex. cha\u00eenes de montagnes, rivi\u00e8res, lacs) qui nuisent \u00e0 l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la connectivit\u00e9 dans les zones frontali\u00e8res; \u2022 une protection et une gestion d\u00e9faillante des ressources naturelles ou d\u2019autres facteurs ayant une incidence n\u00e9gative sur la connectivit\u00e9 \u00e9cologique transfrontali\u00e8re. La plupart des obstacles g\u00e9ographiques et naturels en ESE sont dus \u00e0 un manque d\u2019infrastructures transfrontali\u00e8res (de transport) pour surmonter les obstacles. Beaucoup de ces obstacles soulignent les effets n\u00e9fastes d\u2019un manque d\u2019infrastructures et d\u2019\u00e9quipements efficaces aux points de passage frontaliers routiers en ESE entre les \u00c9tats membres de l\u2019UE et les pays vis\u00e9s par l\u2019\u00e9largissement. Environ un tiers des obstacles g\u00e9ograp hiques et naturels de l\u2019inventaire sont dus \u00e0 un manque de coordination dans la gestion de ressources naturelles transfrontali\u00e8res. Dans la plupart des cas, cela concerne la gestion des aires prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, l\u2019exploitation foresti\u00e8re ou les ressources en eau. Toutefois, les causes profondes de ces obstacles peuvent parfois \u00eatre li\u00e9es \u00e0 un manque d\u2019harmonisation du cadre juridique. Obstacles \u00e9conomiques et socioculturels La dimension \u00e9conomique de la fronti\u00e8re peut \u00eatre influenc\u00e9e par les conditions socio- \u00e9conomiques dans les r\u00e9gions frontali\u00e8res. Les discontinuit\u00e9s socio-\u00e9conomiques importantes le long des fronti\u00e8res repr\u00e9sentent simultan\u00e9ment des facteurs d\u2019attraction et de r\u00e9pulsion, qui peuvent g\u00e9n\u00e9rer \u00e0 la fois des opportunit\u00e9s et des obstacles \u00e0 la coop\u00e9ration. La dimension socioculturelle consid\u00e8re les repr\u00e9sentations que se font les habitants des r\u00e9gions frontali\u00e8res de leurs voisins au travers de processus d\u2019identification collective. Compte tenu des nombreuses lignes de s\u00e9paration socioculturelle qui traversent l\u2019 ESE, cette dimension est particuli\u00e8rement importante pour comprendre la coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re dans la r\u00e9gion. 10% des obstacles sont li\u00e9s aux dimensions \u00e9conomiques ou socioculturels des fronti\u00e8res de l\u2019ESE. Ces obstacles d\u00e9coulent de discontinuit\u00e9s socio-\u00e9conomiques prononc\u00e9es, et de barri\u00e8res mentales ou linguistiques. Diff\u00e9rentes barri\u00e8res mentales peuvent \u00eatre identifi\u00e9es: \u2022 celles qui emp\u00eachent l\u2019int\u00e9gration de consid\u00e9rations environnementales dans les politiques \u00e9conomiques et sectorielles ; \u2022 des sentiments d\u2019appartenance divergents entre habitants des r\u00e9gions frontali\u00e8res voisines; \u2022 des repr\u00e9sentations diff\u00e9rentes de l\u2019histoire et des traditions culturelles. Caract\u00e9risation g\u00e9ographique des obstacles La g\u00e9ographie des obstacles est diverse. Les obstacles transfrontaliers peuvent concerner toute la longueur d\u2019une fronti\u00e8re, un segment plus petit, voire toutes les zones frontali\u00e8res et se situer entre des membres de l\u2019UE et des pays tiers, ou entre pays candidats. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, environ 40 % des obstacles transfrontaliers concernent la longueur totale d\u2019une fronti\u00e8re entre un \u00c9tat membre de l\u2019UE et un pays de l\u2019IAP , tandis que 23 % concernent des segments frontaliers r\u00e9duit entre un \u00c9tat membre de l\u2019UE et un pays de l\u2019IAP . 18 % des obstacles se situent entre deux pays candidats. Leur part est sans doute sous-estim\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les fronti\u00e8res entre pays candidats ne sont pas a u centre de l\u2019\u00e9tude. ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 17 La plupart des obstacles sur les segments frontaliers plus petits entre les pays de l\u2019UE et les pays de l\u2019IAP sont li\u00e9s dans la dimension g\u00e9ographique et naturelle. Ils concernent le plus souvent la conservation de la nature et les liaisons de transport. Effets des obstacles Effets directs n\u00e9gatifs Un obstacle frontalier provoque g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un effet direct n\u00e9gatif avec des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives pour toutes sortes d\u2019organisations, de groupes ou d\u2019individus qui traversent la fronti\u00e8re. Ces cons\u00e9quences peuvent \u00eatre financi\u00e8res et/ou non financi\u00e8res. Elles sont \u00e0 la fois financi\u00e8res et non-financi\u00e8res dans la moiti\u00e9 des cas. Les observations suivantes peuvent \u00eatre formul\u00e9es pour les domaines d\u2019action les plus fr\u00e9quemment touch\u00e9s: \u2022 Les obstacles transfrontaliers affectent le d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique avec des effets directs en termes de perte de temps, de co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires et de d\u00e9placements transfrontaliers incommode, tandis que les obstacles sur le march\u00e9 du travail m\u00e8nent \u00e0 des restrictions dans l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des pertes de revenus individuels. \u2022 Une coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re insuffisante dans le domaine des soins de sant\u00e9 entra\u00eene des restrictions \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services, des pertes de temps et d\u2019autres co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires. \u2022 Des co\u00fbts de transaction plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s pour les activit\u00e9s commerciales, des d\u00e9placements transfrontaliers peu pratiques et des pertes de temps sont des effets fr\u00e9quents des obstacles au transport et \u00e0 la mobilit\u00e9. \u2022 Les obstacles affectant la protection de l\u2019environnement et des ressources naturelles entra\u00eenent la fourniture ou l\u2019utilisation inefficace des infrastructures publiques, des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires et des pertes de revenus individuels. Effets secondaires ind\u00e9sirables Ceux- ci peuvent appara\u00eetre si un effet direct n\u00e9gatif est aggrav\u00e9 par d\u2019autres facteurs ou obstacles (\u00ab effets de renforcement \u00bb) et/ou si l\u2019obstacle lui-m\u00eame induit d\u2019autres d\u00e9veloppements ind\u00e9sirables dans la r\u00e9gion transfrontali\u00e8re (\u00ab effets d\u2019entra\u00eenem ent \u00bb). Dans l\u2019inventaire, 65% des cas cr\u00e9ent des effets d\u2019entra\u00eenement avec d\u2019autres d\u00e9veloppements n\u00e9gatifs. Un impact plus large La combinaison d\u2019effets directs n\u00e9gatifs et d\u2019effets secondaires n\u00e9gatifs se traduit par un \u00ab impact n\u00e9gatif plus large \u00bb dans la r\u00e9gion transfrontali\u00e8re. Les impacts plus larges diff\u00e8rent par leur nature et leur orientation th\u00e9matique. Ils peuvent entraver le d\u00e9veloppement socio-\u00e9conomique dans une r\u00e9gion transfrontali\u00e8re, emp\u00eacher une int\u00e9gration fonctionnelle, affaiblir les liens socioculturels, renforcer les tensions existantes, nuire \u00e0 l\u2019environnement et r\u00e9duire la qualit\u00e9 de vie des citoyens de cette r\u00e9gion. Pour un obstacle donn\u00e9, les impacts n\u00e9gatifs peuvent varier en ampleur et se combiner. La moiti\u00e9 des obstacles ont de forts impacts n\u00e9gatifs. Domaines d\u2019action et solutions L\u2019analyse montre \u00e0 la fois le potentiel des programmes IAP Interreg pour att\u00e9nuer les obstacles \u00e0 la coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re et les limites de ces programmes pour les surmonter. Certains obstacles doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9solus par le biais d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation ou de programmes nationaux ou d\u2019investissements \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle au -del\u00e0 de la capacit\u00e9 des programmes Interreg IAP. Ces programmes peuvent toutefois rem\u00e9dier aux situations n\u00e9gatives dans les zones transfrontali\u00e8res par des mesures \u00ab douces \u00bb et, en impliquant des repr\u00e9sentants nationaux, encourager de nouvelles actions susceptibles de r\u00e9soudre les obstacles de mani\u00e8re permanente. ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 18 Domaines d\u2019action pertinents Des r\u00e9ponses politiques ad\u00e9 quates peuvent \u00eatre un tremplin vers l\u2019att\u00e9nuation des obstacles et la recherche de solutions au-del\u00e0 des fronti\u00e8res. Chaque obstacle de l\u2019inventaire est li\u00e9 \u00e0 un domaine politique. Plus de la moiti\u00e9 des obstacles concernent les transports et la mobilit\u00e9 durable, les ressources naturelles et la protection de l\u2019environnement, ou la protection civile et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique. Dans le domaine des transports et de la mobilit\u00e9 durable, un probl\u00e8me commun concerne les points de passage frontaliers et les processus de d\u00e9douanement, qui se concentrent principalement sur les obstacles \u00e0 un passage ou \u00e0 un segment frontalier sp\u00e9cifique. Environ la moiti\u00e9 des obstacles en mati\u00e8re de ressources naturelles et de protection de l\u2019environnement peuvent \u00eatre surmont\u00e9s par des mesures conjointes de gestion de la nature et sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pertinents pour plusieurs zones frontali\u00e8res. En outre, les domaines d\u2019action du march\u00e9 du travail et de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, avec leurs effets indirects, sont parmi les domaines d\u2019action les plus im portants pour les obstacles \u00e0 la coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re. Les politiques du travail et de l\u2019emploi diff\u00e8re nt consid\u00e9rablement d\u2019un pays de l\u2019Europe du Sud - Est \u00e0 l\u2019autre, ce qui renforce la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re dans ce domaine. Il existe des obstacles \u00e0 la coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re au sein de l\u2019Europe du Sud -Est dans tous les domaines d\u2019action, ce qui implique que des mesures globales sont n\u00e9cessaires pour les surmonter \u00e0 moyen et \u00e0 long terme. Les programmes Interreg IAP peuvent contribuer, au travers de tous les objectifs strat\u00e9giques, \u00e0 ce processus. Pertinence g\u00e9ographique Tous les domaines d\u2019action sont pertinents quel que soit le caract\u00e8re g\u00e9ographique de l\u2019obstacle (obstacle sur toute la longueur d\u2019une fronti\u00e8re ou sur un segment de la fronti\u00e8re) . Certains domaines d\u2019action sont plus sp\u00e9cifiques aux obstacles plus larges ou tr\u00e8s locaux. Cette combinaison d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat local et g\u00e9ographique plus large invite \u00e0 mettre en place des programmes IAP cibl\u00e9s. Les obstacles qui affectent toutes les fronti\u00e8res de l\u2019Europe du Est ou la plupart d\u2019entre elles sont li\u00e9s en particulier aux transports et \u00e0 la mobilit\u00e9, aux ressources naturelles et \u00e0 la protection de l\u2019environnement, \u00e0 la protection civile et \u00e0 la s\u00e9cur it\u00e9 publique, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019action contre le changement climatique. Ces domaines d\u2019action peuvent donc n\u00e9cessiter non seulement une coordination transfrontali\u00e8re, mais aussi transnationale. Parties prenantes impliqu\u00e9es et diversit\u00e9 des approches Les parties prenantes sont affect\u00e9es par les obstacles \u00e0 la coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re de deux mani\u00e8res. Premi\u00e8rement, les obstacles affectent le bien-\u00eatre des citoyens dans les zones frontali\u00e8res, la fourniture efficace de services, la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 des entreprises, l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration, ou encore la qualit\u00e9 des \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes transfrontaliers, etc. En d\u2019autres termes, il s\u2019agit des effets et impacts directs et secondaires sur les conditions de vie dans les zones frontali\u00e8res. Certains obstacles touchent tous les citoyens, tandis que d\u2019autres n\u2019ont d\u2019effets directs que pour certains groupes. De m\u00eame, les entreprises et les administrations des r\u00e9gions frontali\u00e8res sont touch\u00e9es. Les effets pour eux sont d\u2019autant plus multifacettes qu\u2019ils affectent aussi les conditions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre des solutions permettant de surmonter les obstacles \u00e0 la coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re. Toute solution visant au moins \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer ou \u00e9ventuellement \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les obstacles doit impliquer les parties prenantes ayant des responsabilit\u00e9s et des moyens d\u2019action ad\u00e9quates. Ainsi, plus un obstacle est complexe, plus les parties prenantes \u00e0 impliquer sont nombreuses, mais pas n\u00e9cessairement pendant tout le processus. L\u2019analyse diff\u00e9rencie les niveaux de gouvernance (du niveau communautaire europ\u00e9en au niveau local) ainsi que d\u2019autres parties prenantes des secteurs public et priv\u00e9, soit au total 14 groupes de parties prenantes. En moyenne, environ cinq \u00e0 six types de parties prenantes par obstacle sont pertinents ou n\u00e9cessaires pour mettre en \u0153uvre des solutions. Les gouvernements nationaux sont de loin les plus importants et peuvent, en ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 19 effet, \u00eatre n \u00e9cessaires si l\u2019on veut \u00e9liminer compl\u00e8tement les obstacles, par exemple par des mesures l\u00e9gislatives ou des accords inter\u00e9tatiques. D\u2019autres niveaux de gouvernement sont souvent n\u00e9cessaires pour des mesures d\u2019att\u00e9nuation, mais aussi pour mettre en \u0153uvre une action nationale au niveau local ou m\u00eame pour inciter les autorit\u00e9s nationales \u00e0 agir. Dans ce contexte, les autorit\u00e9s locales et r\u00e9gionales et les structures de coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re sont cruciales. Ces r\u00e9sultats illustrent les limites rencontr\u00e9es par les programmes Interreg IAP pour r\u00e9soudre les obstacles. Bien qu\u2019ils puissent contribuer et fournir un soutien essentiel \u00e0 l\u2019att\u00e9nuation ou \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution des obstacles transfrontaliers, des mesures nationales sont souvent \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaires. Deuxi\u00e8mement, diverses parties prenantes sont n\u00e9cessaires pour att\u00e9nuer ou \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les obstacles. La plupart des actions n\u00e9cessitent des approches de gouvernance \u00e0 plusieurs niveaux, qui impliquent une nouvelle coop\u00e9ration ainsi que l\u2019utilisation de nouvelles m\u00e9thodes et de nouveaux outils et souvent une combinaison d\u2019approches. Un quart de toutes les solutions n\u00e9cessitent une l\u00e9gislation ou des accords. Plus de la moiti\u00e9 implique de repenser la gouvernance. Les nouvelles structures de coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re et les services publics transfrontaliers repr\u00e9sentent environ 15 % des approches. Pour environ 90 % des obstacles, les approches de gouvernance r\u00e9gionale/locale peuvent suffire \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre un obstacle, \u00e0 l\u2019 att\u00e9nuer et/ou \u00e0 faciliter des solutions plus durables, par exemple par le biais d\u2019accords inter\u00e9tatiques ou de nouvelles structures de coop\u00e9ration. Pr\u00e8s de 80 % des obstacles n\u00e9cessitent plus d\u2019une approche. Conclusions pour les futurs programmes IAP Dans certains cas, des actions au titre de diff\u00e9rents objectifs strat\u00e9giques (OS) peuvent \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9liminer les obstacles de l\u2019inventaire. L\u2019objectif strat\u00e9gique Interreg (OSI) 1 \u00ab Une meilleure gouvernance de la coop\u00e9ration \u00bb est de loin le plus pertinent et peut \u00eatre utile pour combler pr\u00e8s de la moiti\u00e9 des obstacles. L \u2019OS 2 \u00ab Une Europe plus verte et \u00e0 faible intensit\u00e9 de carbone \u00bb et l \u2019OS 3 \u00ab Une Europe plus connect\u00e9e \u00bb sont \u00e9galement importants. L\u2019OSI 1 est tr\u00e8s pertinent car il peut souvent \u00eatre combin\u00e9e avec d\u2019autres O S pour contribuer \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les obstacles \u00e0 la coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re. Les \u00e9tudes de cas soulignent qu e l\u2019OSI 1 peut fournir un soutien tr\u00e8s cibl\u00e9 aux zones frontali\u00e8res de l\u2019Europe du Sud -Est. Dans la plupart des cas, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9velopper les comp\u00e9tences et d\u2019\u00e9tablir des routines de coop\u00e9ration. Ces r\u00e9sultats soul\u00e8vent la question de savoir si les programmes IAP Interreg 2021-2027 pr\u00e9voient ou non un axe prioritaire sur l\u2019OSI 1. Il semble que quatre des dix programmes Interreg IAP pr\u00e9voient de mettre en \u0153uvre un axe prioritaire mobilisant l\u2019OSI 1, ce qui ne refl\u00e8te mal la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de mesures li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019OSI 1 pour att\u00e9nuer les obstacles \u00e0 la coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re. Le nombre de structures de coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re qui sont peu actives, et la pertinence de l\u2019OSI 1 pour r\u00e9gler des obstacles au carrefour de plusieurs domaines d\u2019action renforcent encore ce constat. Conclusions et orientations politiques La communication de la Commission europ\u00e9enne sur la stimulation de la croissance et de la coh\u00e9sion dans les r\u00e9gions frontali\u00e8res de l\u2019UE a list\u00e9 dix mesures visant \u00e0 relever les d\u00e9fis et les particularit\u00e9s des r\u00e9gions frontali\u00e8res. Ces d\u00e9fis et particularit\u00e9s sont \u00e9galement pertinents pour les r\u00e9gio ns frontali\u00e8res entre les \u00c9tats membres de l\u2019UE et les pays de l\u2019IAP. La coop\u00e9ration et l\u2019int\u00e9gration transfrontali\u00e8res peuvent \u00eatre encore plus difficiles et vari\u00e9es \u00e0 ces fronti\u00e8res. Cela n\u00e9cessite un autre type de mesures : le renforcement des capacit\u00e9s dans les zones frontali\u00e8res et la coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re. En ce qui concerne les programmes Interreg IAP, les d\u00e9fis diff\u00e8rent toutefois de ceux relev\u00e9s par les programmes Interreg, en particulier le d\u00e9veloppement de structures de coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re. Les r\u00e9gions frontali\u00e8res de l\u2019ESE ont besoin de structures de ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 20 coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re plus solides pour faciliter de nombreux processus et mesures visant \u00e0 relever les d\u00e9fis des r\u00e9gions transfrontali\u00e8res. Dans ce contexte, il est essentiel d\u2019accro\u00eetre l\u2019engagement des acteurs cl\u00e9s des pays candidats et candidats potentiels dans les programmes Interreg IAP. En outre, de nombreux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires potentiels sont \u00e9galement confront\u00e9s \u00e0 un manque de ressources financi\u00e8res pour pr\u00e9financer et cofinancer les actions Interreg IAP. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un obstacle transversal \u00e0 la coop\u00e9ration \u00e0 toutes les fronti\u00e8res entre l\u2019UE et les pays de l\u2019IAP, qui entrave souvent la participation des parties prenantes locales \u00e0 ces programmes. Cela a une incidence sur l\u2019intensit\u00e9 de la coop\u00e9ration et sur l\u2019\u00e9ventail des initiatives prises pour att\u00e9nuer ou r\u00e9soudre les obstacles transfrontaliers. Les interventions nationales, telles que les programmes qui garantissent le cofinancement et/ou le financement interm\u00e9diai re jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un plafond de participation \u00e0 l\u2019IAP Interreg, pourraient \u00e9galement contribuer \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer le manque de ressources dans les \u00c9tats membres et les pays candidats et candidats potentiels voisins. L\u2019UE peut et doit jouer un r\u00f4le \u00e0 travers le processus d\u2019\u00e9largissement et les programmes de coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re dans la r\u00e9gion (Interreg IAP) qui sont de puissants facteurs d\u2019activation de la coop\u00e9ration aux niveaux local et r\u00e9gional.

        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 21 1. Introduction The need for particular attention to border and cross-border regions is widely acknowledged in the European Union (EU). While the focus is most often on internal borders, where about 30% of the EU population lives (European Commission, 2017, p. 2), the need for action is acknowledged at EU external borders. For instance the Territorial Agenda of the EU 2030 (TA2030) points out that \u201cespecially EU external borders have disparities and differences in legal, social and political systems that affect loca l and regional development\u201d (Territorial Agenda, 2020, p. 9). In turn, a lack of integration contributes to exacerbating peripherality and social exclusion. Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) stipulates that \u201cthe Union shall carry out economic, financial and technical cooperation measures, including assistance, in particular financial assistance, with third countries other than developing countries\u201d. This provides the legal basis for the Instrument for Pre -Accession Assistance (IPA) with the ability to address cross-border cooperation challenges through programmes dedicated to this cooperation, i.e. Interreg IPA CBC programmes. The objective is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of these programmes and to support border regions in overcoming challenges based on the existence of national borders. This study encourages border areas to work on these obstacles. Contributing to this objective the present study aims to make a comprehensive review of existing external cross-border obstacles and identify the obstacles that can have an impact on the five Policy Objectives (POs) and two Interreg Specific Objectives (ISOs), as laid down in the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Interreg regulations for the programming period 2021-2027 (European Parliament and European Council, 2021a, Art. 14, 2021b Art. 3) . The recent EC Communication on \u2018EU Border Regions: Living labs of European integration\u2019 highlights the n eed for actions to support cross-border interaction at internal and external borders, which may address obstacles to cross-border cooperation (European Commission, 2021). In view of the new 2021- 2027 programming period, this study also provides orientations on how these obstacles could be addressed by Interreg IPA programmes. This defines the geographic focus of the study on the borders between EU Member States and candidate and potential candidate countries. 1 , 2 This report presents the main findings of the study. Results and findings differentiate the dimensions of the analysis starting with identification of types of obstacles in South- East Europe (SEE) and their root-causes (Chapter 2). Based on this, obstacles are further detailed by geography (Chapter 3), effects (Chapter 4) as well as approaches and solutions to reduce obstacles (Chapter 5). The latter includes findings on policy areas, governance implications and proposals for Interreg IPA programmes 2021-2027. The report closes with conclusions and policy pointers offering further food for thought. The study builds on an extensive literature analysis, a survey of stakeholders and case studies with a joint analysis of these sources and their triangulation. Annex I details the methodological approach of the study. The core data is consolidated in an inventory of obstacles. Being a database, this inventory is not annexed to the final report or other publications of the study. Any obstacle numbers refer to an identification number in the database which is available upon request as an Excel file at DG Regio. The inventory comprises 222 obstacles for cross-border cooperation in the study area, without claiming to be exhaustive, since any identification of obstacles relies on sufficient information and sources. Ten obstacles have been analysed in case studies. Annex II 1 Borders between candidate and potential candidate countries in South-East Europe have not been explicitly excluded but are covered either implicitly (e.g. when referring to the Western Balkans more generally) or through coincidental findings. 2 Relevant EU Member States are Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Romania. Candidate and potential countries are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. ",

        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 23 2. Types of obstacles In this study, the characterisation of obstacles for cross-border cooperation and integration builds on the concept of a \u2018multi - dimensional border reality\u2019. 3 This assumes that all land borders have simultaneously a political dimension, a geographical and natural dimension, an economic dimension and a socio-cultural dimension. Each dimension creates specific border effects that can prevent or hinder cross-border relations (closure effects) or enable and advance cross-border relations (opening effects). Border obstacles are therefore closure effects based on these four border dimensions, but the \u2018roots\u2019 and scope of obstacles differ because border features differ. The inventory establishes a taxonomy for the obstacles along these four dimensions, differentiating them by their roots. The inventory includes 222 obstacles but does not claim to be complete since it covers only obstacles that were well documented in the literature or reported in the survey. The complementarity, variety and relevance of obstacles identified in literature and through the survey suggest the inventory mirrors the obstacles for cross-border cooperation in a balanced way. In addition to the 222 obstacles, both literature analysis and the survey hint at further obstacles that were, however, not included in the inventory for two reasons. Firstly, some obstacles appear to be cross-cutting and may have different roots to the multi-dimensional border realities. Nevertheless, they are often relevant for cross- border cooperation, too. Typical cross-cutting or horizontal obstacles that may affect future solutions in overcoming cross-border cooperation obstacles are: \u2022 lack of financial resources; \u2022 low GDP or high discontinuities; \u2022 low innovation; \u2022 lagging digitalisation; \u2022 gender inequality. Secondly, some obstacles noted by survey respondents were not backed by sufficient information to include them in the inventory. Typical examples are: \u2022 different national legislation and/or administrative structures between certain SEE borders; \u2022 limitations to cross-border commuting and \u2013 more generally \u2013 mobility; \u2022 lack of (transport) infrastructure; \u2022 administrative obstacles hampering cross-border transport; \u2022 lack of cooperation on education (schools, recognition of degrees); \u2022 lack of cross-border health care access or investments in health care; \u2022 lack of joint action on environmental issues and climate change action. Obstacles on similar issues have been included, however, in the inventory and case studies. The other cases may refer to other border areas and thus indicate the wider relevance of many obstacles for the border between an EU Member State and an IPA country. Keeping these findings in mind, the following chapters focus on the obstacles in the inventory and additional insights from case study analyses. About 90% of the 222 obstacles directly relate to the political or geographical/natural dimension of state borders in SEE (see Figure 2-1), with most related to the political dimension. The few economic and socio-cultural obstacles do not imply they are not relevant to cross-border cooperation. On the contrary, a single obstacle can be very important and create significant impacts, as will be shown in Chapter 4. 3 For a description of the concept and its dimensions see e.g. ESPON (2018, pp. 14\u201316). ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 24 Figure 2-1 Share of obstacles by dimension Source: Service provider 2021, based on cross-border obstacles inventory Overall, above findings and observations indicate, that combining obstacle cases from literature review and survey respondents seem to cover all main types of obstacles for cross-border cooperation between EU Member States and candidate countries but their actual number may be even higher than the number of obstacles collected in the inventory. 2.1. Obstacles rooted in the political dimension of SEE borders The obstacle inventory includes 129 cases (58%) related to the political dimension of SEE borders. These obstacles are due to different legal or administrative barriers hampering cross-border cooperation. The inventory differentiates seven causes. Two refer to the interpretation of borderlines and their official recognition in SEE, two are legal obstacles resulting from national and EU law and the last three relate to administrative and governance conditions. Obstacles from the literature review and the survey are complementary leading to a relatively equal representation of the seven roots in the inventory. There are slightly more obstacles related to weakly developed or different governance systems and administrative structures as well as different national laws and regulations than other obstacles within the political dimension (Figure 2-2). The case studies highlight additional insights about different roots within the political border dimension. Illustrations below show particularities resulting from the different international status of borders, different national legal frameworks and weak governance systems. 58% 32% 5% 5% Share of obstacles by dimension (n=222) Political dimension Geographical and natural dimension Economic dimension Socio cultural dimension ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 25 Case study illustrations on roots of obstacles within the political dimension The case study on smuggling at the Greek-Albanian border is an example that illustrates the effects of different international status for borders in the European integration process. The differences in status lead to a need for control at border check points and cooperation. A lack of control and cooperation facilitates smuggling, which is further fed by socio-economic circumstances. Different national laws and regulations or a lack of harmonisation of the legal framework affects cross-border cooperation in many spheres. This can include cooperation in general or for a specific sector. The case studies on a lack of cross- border harmonisation of health legislation, standards and procedures in SEE and on different regulatory investment frameworks illustrate this for health care as well as economic cooperation and trade relations, respectively. The example of transboundary river basin management further illustrates this, also in view of implementation of the \u2018 acquis communautaire \u2019. Finally, obstacles due to administrative and governance systems are illustrated, inter alia, weak governance systems in many SEE cross-border regions. These hamper cooperation between different levels in a wider geographic area as illustrated by the multilateral Adriatic Ionian Euroregion as well as smaller geographic areas such as the Danube-Drava-Sava Euroregion . Different administrative systems may also affect sector specific cooperation as described in the example of limited cross- border labour mobility , resulting from different formal requirements for foreign citizens.

        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 26 2.2. Obstacles rooted in the geographical-natural dimension of SEE borders The obstacle inventory includes 72 cases (32%) related to the geographic-natural dimension of SEE borders. They have three root causes: \u2022 insufficient transport and border crossing point infrastructure ; \u2022 natural barriers (e.g. mountain ranges, rivers, lakes) that affect accessibility and connectivity of border areas; \u2022 inadequate protection and management of natural resources in border areas or other barriers negatively affecting cross-border ecological connectivity. Most geographical-natural obstacles in SEE (45 cases) are rooted in the lack of cross- border (transport) infrastructure to overcome barriers caused by rivers, mountains, etc. Many are at border crossings between EU Member States and enlargement countries indicating the effects of a lack of efficient infrastructure and equipment at these border crossing points. The case study on the geographical-natural dimension of the border is an example of poor transport infrastructure. Case study illustration: Lack of infrastructure and connection between North Macedonia and Bulgaria and Greece The main transport connections between North Macedonia and Bulgaria and North Macedonia and Greece continuously lack quality transport infrastructure, hampering the mobility of goods and people between North Macedonia and the two EU Member States. While many border crossings suffer from inefficient border crossing point infrastructure, the transport links in this case study connect the Orient / East-Med TEN-T core network and require further development to ensure sufficient transport capacity. The source of the problem lies on the natural areas of the border crossings and the lack of, or damaged, road and rail infrastructure affecting economic and tourist operators. About one third of geographical-natural obstacles in the inventory (24 cases) have their roots in a lack of coordination of natural resources. In most cases this affects the management of protected areas, logging of forests or the conditions of water resources. Root causes of these obstacles can, however, also be linked to a lack of harmonisation in the legal framework. This is illustrated by the case study on limited cross-border cooperation on climate change adaptation for water resources. It shows how different causes may be linked and contribute to a specific cross-border obstacle. Case study illustration: Shared climate change challenges for water resources lacking sufficient cross-border cooperation on climate change adaptation in SEE Owing to climatic conditions as well as topography, the Western Balkans is one of the richest in Europe in terms of water resources. Transboundary water resources are an important common asset in SEE. Most countries share one or more transboundary river basins, making this an important area for regional cooperation and effort. Environmental rules and legislation are subject to Chapter 27 of the acquis communautaire 4 and require transposition of EU rules into the national legislation of candidate countries, contributing to harmonised environmental legislation. A lack of such harmonisation affects the ability to develop transboundary and cooperative river 4 The acquis comprises over 200 major legal acts covering horizontal legislation, water and air quality, waste management, nature protection, industrial pollution control and risk management, chemicals and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), noise and forestry (https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/conditions- membership/chapters-of-the-acquis_en) (accessed on 07 June 2021). ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 27 basin management. In particular, applying EU environmental legislation requires efficient and adequate administration at different levels. At the same time, a lack of river basin management is an example of a lack of coordination for natural resources, which could also be induced by a lack of harmonised legislation. Despite the mountain ranges and river basins in SEE only few obstacles in the inventory are directly and primarily rooted in natural barriers. Some of these refer to several locations in SEE with the same obstacle. Obstacles stemming from natural barriers refer to sometimes to exclaves affecting transport and mobility. Other obstacles due to a lack of transport infrastructure can also be related to mountain ranges or rivers, which make infrastructure investments more complex and expensive. However, in these cases mountains or rivers do not impede transport infrastructure investments. 2.3. Obstacles rooted in the economic and socio-cultural dimensions of SEE borders The economic dimension refers to cross-border economic relations and how these may be influenced by socio-economic development conditions in neighbouring border regions. Significant socio-economic discontinuities along borders simultaneously represent \u2018 push \u2019 and \u2018 pull \u2019 factors, which may generate opportunities for cooperation and impediments. The socio-cultural dimension considers perceptions of inhabitants in neighbouring border regions and how they relate to other groups using specific concepts of collective identification (e.g. nationality, ethnicity, regional/local identity, religion or interculturalism). In view of many significant socio-cultural dividing lines in SEE, this dimension is particularly important to understand cross-border cooperation in the area. The obstacle inventory includes 21 cases (10%) related to the economic or socio-cultural dimensions of SEE borders. These obstacles stem from pronounced socio-economic discontinuities , mental barriers and language barriers . Mental barriers can be further differentiated: barriers hampering effective integration of environmental considerations into economic and sector policies ; different perception of the sense of belonging by people in neighbouring border regions; different perception, interpretation and collective or group-specific articulation of the historical legacy and cultural traditions . Mental barriers related to different perceptions due to historical legacy and cultural traditions as well as economic discontinuities tend to be the most frequent obstacles in SEE to cross-border cooperation. Two case studies on the economic and socio-cultural dimensions illustrate typical examples of obstacles to cross-border cooperation in SEE, although the details of the causes and effects differ from case to case. Further insights reveal that cross-border cooperation in some areas of the Western Balkans is still sensitive due to tensions linked to war legacies and different interpretations of recent history. This is perpetuated in younger generations and is an underlying issue for cross-border cooperation in the area. Case study illustrations on obstacles related to the economic or socio- cultural dimension of borders Economic discontinuities along many borders in SEE are not only between EU Member States and enlargement countries. They are visible in GDP, GDP per capita, employment and unemployment, wages, poverty etc. The case study on economic ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 28 disparities between Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia illustrates this through effects on employment and labour market. The variety of adverse economic structures shows this is one example of a root-cause relationship but there are others in relation to skills, capacities, funding opportunities for businesses and infrastructure, innovation, etc. The case study on the bilateral dispute on the role and status of the Greek minority in Albania and the Albanian minority in Greece considers two related obstacles. This is an example of a cross-border cooperation obstacle that is not widely relevant but complements other obstacles in SEE in view of the area\u2019s historical legacy and cultural traditions. Most of these obstacles are due to a lack of political willingness for reconciliation and related disputes. 3. Geography of obstacles The inventory shows that the geography of obstacles is diverse. Cross-border obstacles may concern the entire length of a border, a smaller segment, or even all border areas between EU and non-EU members, or among candidate countries. More specifically, about 40% of the cross-border obstacles from the literature and the survey concern the entire length of a border between an EU Member State and an IPA country, while 23% concern smaller border segments between an EU Member State and an IPA country (Figure 3-1). Obstacles in specific parts of borders between two candidate countries make up 18% while 7% of such obstacles are along all borders of a (potential) candidate country. Cross-border obstacles along all borders between EU Member States and IPA countries, including Turkey, make up 6%, while excluding Turkey they are 5% of all obstacles. The varying geographical dimension of obstacles for cross-border cooperation depends also largely on the type of obstacle. However, most obstacles regard specific borders and especially the entire length of a border. Although the study focuses on cross-border obstacles between EU and IPA countries the analysis has also identified cross-border obstacles between IPA countries as indicated in the figure. These should not be neglected since they may be similar or even induce spillover effects for broader obstacles. Overall, there are 38 obstacles (18%) concerning the border between two candidate countries, i.e. between Montenegro-Albania, Montenegro-Kosovo*, 5 Montenegro - Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia-Albania and North Macedonia-Kosovo*, Serbia-Kosovo*, Serbia-Montenegro, Serbia-Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia-North Macedonia and Albania-Kosovo*. Most cases are between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro and North Macedonia and Albania. 5 The designation Kosovo* is without prejudice to positions on status and in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence and used this way throughout the report.

These concern the socio-cultural, political, economic and geographic and natural dimensions. Three case studies concern smaller border segments between an EU Member State and an IPA country, all of which are due to the political dimension and are mostly due to governance and administration issues. The remaining three cases concern all borders between EU Member States and IPA countries, partially including and partially excluding Turkey. All of these have a root cause in the political dimension, especially legal obstacles from different national laws and difficulties in introducing the acquis communautaire . The case studies illustrate the different relevance of the geographic dimension and vary largely in their type within the political dimension. The literature has also shown that the more specific the border segment focus, the more specific the obstacle . However, this is not entirely visible in the case studies, as the combination of obstacle type and its root and dimension have shown that even specific borders may reflect larger roots and challenges, as described in the box below. Case study illustrations on border types and their links to obstacles The number of obstacles and their effects does not always depict how much a cross- border relationship is affected by its obstacles. This means that some obstacles are more evident and have a deeper cause than others even in a cross-border area with few obstacles. In short, a few or limited obstacles can significantly affect a territory . Some case studies suggest that specific border segments do not always reflect specific obstacles . This is particularly relevant for obstacles linked to the political dimension. The case study on smuggling at the Greek-Albanian border and the case study on cross-border mobility difficulties of workers at the Romanian- Serbian border both review a specific border segment and the political dimension. Although at first sight the obstacles look specific, they are both associated with larger 40% 23% 18% 7% 6% 5% Geographic relevance of obstacles (n=222) Specific border between an EU Member State and an IPA country entire length Smaller border segment between an EU Member State and an IPA country Specific border between two candidate countries in the Western Balkans All borders of an IPA country / candidate country / potential candidate country All borders between EU Member States and IPA countries (incl.

        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 30 and deeper issues. The smuggling case between Greece and Albania is indirectly linked to bigger socio-economic challenges, such as organised crime and low living standards. However, the obstacle on cross-border mobility between Romania and Serbia is rooted in a lack of adequate bilateral agreements at national level due to adverse administrative structures. However, the case studies confirm the tentative finding that obstacles at many SEE borders often represent broader obstacles . Examples are the case study on shared climate change challenges for water resources, which covers the whole border between EU and IPA countries, including Turkey and the case study on lacking cross-border harmonisation for health legislations and standards . In both cases the obstacles are broad with solutions that concern larger territories. 3.1. Obstacles by bilateral border However, without considering obstacles between IPA countries, the dominance of border obstacles between specific EU and IPA countries is even more apparent. These may regard specific parts of most bilateral borders in the analysis or the entire length of a border, as indicated in Figure 3-2 Figure . Overall, the number of obstacles for an individual border between an EU Member State and an IPA country is highest between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is followed by Bulgaria-Turkey, Romania- Serbia, Bulgaria-Serbia, Greece-Albania, Croatia-Serbia and Greece-North Macedonia, all with more than ten obstacles. These refer partially to the whole length of the border or a specific border segment, with the majority being along their entire length. Thus, in addition to some widely relevant obstacles, IPA CBC programmes may also have to touch on obstacles specific to a border area . Figure 3-2 Number of geographically specific obstacles by bilateral border area Source: Service provider 2021, based on cross-border obstacles inventory Map 3-1 depicts the geographical density of cross-border obstacles between EU and IPA countries, as well as between IPA countries.

However, again specific borders between IPA countries should not be neglected, as the numbers are sometimes considerable, such as between Bosnia and Herzegovina-Serbia, Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina-Montenegro.

Geography of different types of obstacles The nature or type of cross-border obstacles also differs per geographical dimension. Most obstacles are either political or geographical and natural and were identified for all geographic dimensions. No cross-border obstacles related to language barriers were found, but there are obstacles from the recognition of linguistic minorities living on the other side of a border. There are few economic and socio-cultural obstacles at the Croatia-Bosnia and Herzegovina border, while the Greece-Albania border has the most cases for socio-cultural obstacles (see (4.1) and (4.2) in Figure 3-3). Case study illustrations on socio-cultural obstacles The majority of border specific socio-cultural obstacles are at the Greek-Albanian border, mainly as a result of mental barriers that have developed between the two countries. Although the roots are political, treating minorities and improving their quality of life remains a key social inclusion issue. The Greek-Albanian case study on minority rights highlights, that different perceptions and interpretation of the historic legacy, the cultural traditions, and biases towards people living across borders may have led to mental barriers with a direct effect on the social inclusion of specific groups, as well as on overall political and cultural exchanges between the countries. Effects are linked in particular to biases and negative perceptions, e.g. influencing the perceptions and attitudes of people on either side of the border, thus impacting cooperation across-borders. Most obstacles at smaller border segments between EU and IPA countries are due to the geographical and natural dimension. They refer most often to nature conservation and transport links. Examples of these are the Croatia \u2013 Bosnia and Herzegovina border region around the Neum corridor, nature and biodiversity conservation obstacles between Greece and Albania, insufficient waste management and marine litter between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, untapped potential for external accessibility and intermodal transport in the Bulgaria - Serbia border area, as well as a lack of cooperation for protected area management across the borders between the EU and non-EU countries. Most other obstacles at this geographical level are political, regarding limited cooperation and border disputes, as well as illegal activities like smuggling. Obstacles between IPA countries are similarly political, mainly regarding border disputes and diplomatic tensions from the recognition of Kosovo* by neighbouring countries to Serbia. Further obstacles regard differences in legislative issues, lack of exchanges and difficulties in the introduction of the EU acquis . Socio-cultural obstacles along specific borders between an EU Member State and IPA country mainly regard minorities in one or the other country. Most obstacles along all borders between EU Member States and IPA countries have a political dimension. They refer to topics such as healthcare, migration routes, human trafficking, natural disaster risk management as well as infrastructure barriers. Finally, a comparison of the two border relations with the most obstacles shows also structural differences. The 31 obstacles identified for Croatia-Bosnia and Herzegovina (Figure 3-2) address thirty sources nearly exclusively due to political or geographical and natural conditions. For Greece-Albania only 13 specific obstacles were identified, rooted in three of the four dimensions (i.e. all except the economic dimension). Four obstacles are socio-cultural, the majority of obstacles in this dimension. ",

        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 34 Last but not least, obstacles of political relevance seem to prevail across SEE, from local to transnational levels and are likely to influence other topics for cooperation. This means that substantial efforts are needed, so obstacles of other dimensions can be more easily eliminated. 4. Effects of obstacles The obstacles in the inventory were assessed for their relationship between the obstacle- source, the border obstacle(s) and induced adverse effects. Two-thirds of the obstacles have a \u2018straightforward source -problem- effect relationship\u2019, while the remain der have a \u2018complex source -problem- effect relationship\u2019. This suggests that for two -thirds of the obstacles solutions can be more easily identified and implemented to at least alleviate the adverse effects and wider negative impact they cause. Solutions may nevertheless require several measures and approaches (see Chapter 5). The case studies helped to further investigate and get in-depth information about the negative direct effects of the obstacles. Furthermore, they highlight how the effects of obstacles do not stop at the direct effects. These can be worsened by other contextual factors or can themselves trigger secondary adverse effects within the cross-border region. In turn, the combination of direct and secondary effects produces wider socio- economic, environmental and socio-cultural impacts on the cross-border area. In other words, an obstacle to cross- border cooperation can often cause a \u2018domino\u2019 (or vicious circle) of direct and indirect effects and impacts with potentially strong long-term repercussions and costs beyond those immediately observable. The following paragraphs provide examples. 4.1. Negative direct effects A border obstacle usually causes a negative direct effect with adverse consequences for all kinds of organisations, groups or individuals with border-crossing activities. These adverse consequences may be monetary and/or non-monetary. Around half of the obstacles lead to both monetary and non-monetary costs, in particular those in the geographical and natural dimension and in the political dimension, while one third of the obstacles have exclusively non-monetary direct effects.

        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 35 The information from the survey and case studies show how the direct effects vary according to the policy area. The most frequently affected policy areas (according to the literature review and survey) highlight that: cross-border obstacles affecting economic development generate direct effects mostly in loss of time, additional costs for services and procedures and inconvenient cross-border travel, while those affecting labour market and employment mostly entail restrictions in accessing services and individual income losses; for health care, insufficient cross-border cooperation leads to restrictions in accessing services, loss of time and additional costs for services and procedures; higher transaction costs for business activities, inconvenient cross-border travel and loss of time are the most frequent direct consequences of obstacles related to transport and mobility; obstacles affecting environmental protection and natural resources lead to the ineffective provision or use of public infrastructure, additional costs for services and procedures and individual income losses. The case studies help to better illustrate these aspects and provide details on the actual effects and concrete examples. In most cases, the obstacles have both monetary and non-monetary direct effects, and these are usually closely linked. Furthermore, these illustrations show that multiple direct effects often occur in parallel, which aggravates the overall relevance of the obstacles and frequently comes with secondary effects as outlined in the next section. Case study illustrations on the monetary and non-monetary direct effects of obstacles The limited cross-border cooperation on climate change adaptation for transboundary river basins causes direct monetary losses e.g. when floods occur. These events have a strong impact on the affected economies (businesses and people), whereas any potential impact on hydropower can create income losses and affect the energy sector as well as other sectors that depend on this renewable source of energy. At the same time, weak transboundary water cooperation, low political prioritisation, insufficient institutional capacity, weak information exchange and a lack of joint monitoring directly reduce the possibilities of dealing with climate-change induced water challenges at present. The working hours and transit restrictions at the Nakovo-Lunga border crossing between Romania and Serbia have clear monetary effects such as individual income losses, administrative burden for companies or citizens and non-monetary direct effects such as loss of time and inconvenient cross-border travel. For instance, the need to access a more distant border crossing (driving 78 km instead of 38 km each way) increases the costs in fuel consumption and air pollution for companies which use trucks between factories on both sides of the border, and for cross-border workers. At the same time, the increased time spent commuting worsens the quality of life for cross-border workers, who spend up to 12 hours a day away from home because of the additional journey to reach the workplace. Smuggling at the Greek-Albanian border strongly affects the economic sector, in particular businesses which lose from counterfeits of their products. Consumers and their health are also affected. At a broader scale, national economies are impacted as the smuggled products deny tax revenues, which are in turn not available for other investments. The lack of coordination of health care systems across borders creates additional costs for services and procedures, often forcing cross-border patients to seek help in private clinics. This not only increases the costs of services for patients, but also ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 36 means that only a limited part of the population can afford better quality treatment across the border, excluding the vast majority. 4.2. Adverse secondary effects The negative effects of obstacles do not stop at the direct effects outlined above. Adverse secondary effects can emerge if the negative direct effect of an obstacle is aggravated by other contextual factors or obstacles (i.e. \u2018re - enforcement effects\u2019) and/or if the obstacle itself induces other undesirable developments within the cross- border region (i.e. \u2018knock - on effects\u2019). Analysis of the 222 cases in the inventory highlighted different secondary effects. In 65% of cases, negative knock-on effects have been identified (secondary effects). Case study illustrations of secondary adverse effects Information from the case studies and their cross-analysis provides further insights. For knock-on effects, these can often be interpreted as impacts of the obstacles in the medium-long term and are less easily quantifiable. Knock-on effects An inactive cross-border cooperation structure (such as a Euroregion existing only on paper) directly affects the effectiveness of cooperation, which in turn prevents joint projects or strategic development initiatives from being planned, agreed on and implemented for the benefit of local people in the border regions. Weak transboundary water cooperation directly reduces the possibilities to deal with climate-change induced water problems at present and induces further undesirable developments within the cross-border region. Weak transboundary water cooperation tends to increase the magnitude of climate change related risks in the medium and long term: significant economic and livelihood losses; lower productivity and economic losses for agriculture due to rising temperatures; loss of crop yields and livestock due to water scarcity and droughts; displaced population; increased mortality and morbidity; decreased public safety; impaired ecosystem functioning and loss of species. Transit restrictions at border crossings directly limit economic development in the cross-border area in various respects. This hinders a more integrated economic development strategy which cross-border businesses, workers and the general public would benefit from in the medium term. The obstacle related to the governance of macro-regional strategies (MRS) involving non-EU countries hinders a key underlying objective of MRS, which is to support the European integration of candidate and potential candidate countries participating in the strategy. Accessing a strategic platform on an \u2018equal footing\u2019 is essential for non-EU members as this should be a catalyst for integration. However, if the equal footing principle is not followed by a clear effort to bridge the gap in terms of capacity of non-EU countries to actively participate in the process, there is a risk of seeing the discrepancies with EU Member States increase. The low economic development and high unemployment in cross-border rural areas in the Western Balkans , in particular those further from urban centres, result in very strong emigration and a brain drain towards bigger cities in EU countries. This results in the further depopulation of sparsely populated areas and their marginalisation in socio-economic terms. ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 37 Reinforcement effects Other factors hamper access to health care across borders and reinforce the existing obstacle. For instance, crossing the border from an IPA country to a country in the Schengen area (and vice versa) is very time-consuming. The restrictive official counting in the 1989 Albanian census has also affected education policies. With the exception of the officially recognised Greek minority zones, where teaching is in both the Greek and Albanian, in all other areas of Albania lessons are taught only in Albanian. It should be noted that for 21 obstacles, no secondary effects were found, while for 29 obstacles found in the survey no answer was provided. This hampers the assessment of potential secondary effects of the obstacles collected through the survey. Thus, the number of obstacles without any secondary effects could be even lower. 4.3. The wider negative impact on cross-border regions The combination of negative direct and adverse secondary effects of an obstacle results in a \u2018wider negative impact\u2019 in the cross -border region. Wider impacts can differ by nature and thematic orientation. For instance, they can: \u2022 hinder socio-economic development in a cross-border region; \u2022 prevent stronger functional integration; \u2022 weaken socio-cultural ties or strengthen existing tensions; \u2022 harm the environment; \u2022 lower the quality of life for citizens in the region. The wider negative impact can have different levels of magnitude and may concern one or more of the above-mentioned themes. Analysing all cases in the inventory for the magnitude and thematic orientation of their negative impacts shows the following picture. Figure 4-2 Thematic orientation and magnitude of wider negative impacts (n=222) Source: Service provider 2021, based on cross-border obstacles inventory 1 4 6 3 2 54 39 9 10 28 64 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Environmental impact Socio-cultural impact Socio-economic impact Multiple impacts or other impact Low overall negative impact Moderate overall negative impact Strong overall negative impact ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 38 Half the obstacles have strong negative impacts across all thematic orientations. For socio-cultural impacts, these are strong in all but two cases and there is a similar trend in environmental impacts. Wider socio-economic impacts tend to be mostly moderate. Looking at the thematic orientation of wider impacts, more than half encompass more than one dimension (e.g. the overall impact is socio-economic, but also socio-cultural, or socio-economic and environmental, or all three). Some examples from the case studies shed light on how wider impacts can include these different dimensions. Case study illustration on wider negative impacts in cross-border regions The absence of effective cross-border governance between local/regional actors in neighbouring border regions, such as a Euroregion, may: \u2013 reduce the intensity of all kinds of everyday cross-border exchange relations (socio-economic impact); \u2013 foster negative perceptions and attitudes among people living on either side of a border (socio-cultural impact); \u2013 harm the quality of shared natural resources (i.e. air, water, soil, plants etc.) and reduce the effectiveness of natural disaster management and prevention in a region prone to flood risks (environmental impact). Weak economic development and low salaries in rural and peripheral cross- border areas and general stagnation of the economy push young educated people to look for better opportunities in bigger urban centres in EU countries. This creates a domino effect through further depopulation, a consequent lack of investment, lower economic dynamism and the difficulty to maintain businesses. In a vicious circle, this leads to further outmigration. Weak transboundary water cooperation, low political prioritisation, insufficient institutional capacity, weak information exchange and a lack of joint monitoring directly reduce the possibilities to deal with climate change-induced water problems at present, increasing the risks for long-term socio-economic and environmental development with further reinforcing effects. The lack of harmonisation for the provision of cross-border health care services might also accentuate social exclusion of particularly vulnerable groups, especially when treatment can be sought across the border only by accessing private clinics. 4.4. Overview of effects and impacts of cross-border obstacles The sub-sections above provide insights on each type of effect of an obstacle, i.e. negative direct effects, adverse secondary effects and wider negative impacts. It is necessary, however, to provide a more comprehensive overview of the causal links between obstacles and their effects to better illustrate the repercussions cross-border obstacles can have in the longer term and on a wider range of policy areas, i.e. beyond what is immediately observable. The paragraphs and infographics below provide examples based on the inventory and the case studies. For instance, the weakness of cross-border governance structures (e.g. Euroregions) in many border areas between EU Member States and enlargement countries leads to the obvious consequence of low efficiency and effectiveness of the structure and the inability to jointly develop projects and strategic development initiatives in the cross-border area. As a result, the interests of the local community are not sufficiently represented. If we also consider, as a re-enforcement factor in countries from former Yugoslavia (e.g. Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia), persistent tensions between border communities due to the wars in the 1990s mean the resulting wider impacts can be ",

In the long term, these lead to a reduced quality of life \u2013 or to missed opportunities for its improvement. Figure 4-3 \u2018Weak Euroregional structures\u2019: link of obstacle to effects and impacts Source: Service provider 2021 Obstacles related to the poor functioning of border crossing points, rooted in the lack of appropriate road, rail and border crossing infrastructure, links and management, have the direct effect of extending travel time to cross the border and can bring about increased costs, e.g. due to the need to take longer routes to farther but better functioning crossing points. The lack of smooth cross-border transit has the indirect (secondary) adverse effect of reducing incentives for the border population and businesses to engage in activities in the neighbouring border region, as well as weakening the opportunities to elaborate integrated cross-border economic W E A E U E A L U U E a o f a p p r o p r i a t e f i n a n i a l s o i a l a n d p o l i t i a l s u p p o r t e . g . l a o f f i n a n i a l a n d h u m a n r e s o u r e s l i n g u i s t i d e m a r a t i o n s h i s t o r i a n d e t h n i i n f l u e n e s l e a d i n g t o a p o o r s y s t e m o f r o s s o r d e r g o e r n a n e .

In the long term, this reduces sound socio-economic development of the cross-border area and the quality of life for its population. Figure 4-4 \u2018Poor functioning of `border crossing points \u2019 : link of obstacle to effects and impacts Source: Service provider 2021 As mentioned in the previous section, the links between an obstacle, its direct and indirect effects and wider impacts can also create vicious circles, where the wider impacts further re- enforce and \u2018feed\u2019 the initial obstacle. For instance, weak economic development in rural and sparsely populated cross-border areas directly affects opportunities to create and maintain employment. The lack of administrative capacity at local level to manage additional funds (such as IPA funds) which could foster economic development and job creation in specific areas, further re- enforces the obstacle. As a result, the population, in particular educated youth and skilled workers, emigrate and seek employment in urban centres within their countries or abroad in EU Member States. As a wider impact, these effects further increase economic decline/stagnation (through lack of investment) and depopulation.

Policy areas and solutions to mitigate obstacles Building on the cross-analysis of the previous chapters, this chapter establishes the link towards possible interventions of Interreg IPA programmes in the 2021-2027 programming period. As a note of caution, the analysis shows both the potential for Interreg IPA programmes to mitigate cross-border cooperation obstacles and the limits of these programmes to overcome them. In other words, Interreg IPA programmes are not suitable to addressing all cross-border obstacles. Some obstacles need to be solved through national legislative action or programmes, or large-scale investments generally not feasible under Interreg IPA programmes. However, Interreg IPA programmes can improve negative situations in cross- border areas through \u2018softer\u2019 measures and by involving national representatives may connect to further actions to solve obstacles permanently.

        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 42 Case study illustration on the link between national policy making and Interreg IPA programme interventions Cross-border harmonisation of health legislation, standards and procedures in SEE can be only implemented through national actors, such as governments and national health insurance companies. At the same time, improving cross-border access to health care services also requires local action, which can be facilitated by Interreg IPA programmes. These activities aim to increase cooperation taking into account the specific health care situation in a certain border area or Euroregion. This also facilitates raising awareness among national authorities on the importance for cross-border health care access. To mitigate the bilateral minority disputes between Albania and Greece , decisions are subject to national political decision making and diplomatic relations. However, Interreg IPA interventions can support the better inclusion of the Greek minority through PO 4 \u2018A more social Europe\u2019 and ISO 1 \u2018A bett er cooperation governance\u2019, to engage the minority groups in exchange and dialogue. Projects and interventions in the tourism sector can offer people more job opportunities and improve their well-being also mitigating living conditions for the minority in the region. Thus, Interreg IPA interventions would not be able to overcome the obstacle itself but could mitigate its effects on people. To provide the grounds for potential Interreg IPA programmes activities, this chapter first considers the main policy areas, their differences across SEE and the affected stakeholders before closing with a cross-analysis of findings for Interreg IPA programmes. 5.1. Policy areas and interventions fields Adequate policy responses can be a stepping stone towards mitigating obstacles and finding solutions across borders. Each cross-border obstacle in the inventory has been related to a policy area. Most obstacles relate to transport and sustainable mobility policy, natural resources and environmental protection and civil protection and public security as well as to other policy areas (Figure 5-1). The three policy areas (without \u2018Other\u2019) account for more than half of the obstacles. 14% are subject to \u2018Other\u2019 policy areas. Most obstacles in this group are either relevant for several policy areas and thus concern cross-border cooperation in general (14 obstacles) or are subject to foreign affairs (13 obstacles). Few others refer to the border regime or taxation. Case studies give further insights into most policy areas for which obstacles have been identified. They also show that while one policy area may prevail, other policy areas may still be relevant to some extent or may be affected indirectly. Case study illustrations on the relevance of policy areas The case study on different regulatory investment frameworks is immediately relevant for spatial and sector policy planning. Not least because of the cross-sectoral relevance of spatial planning, economic development, R&D and innovation are highly affected as well as many other policy areas. This mirrors the relation between economic development and national budget spending, which in turn matters for economic investments. The case study on shared climate change challenges for water resources is directly linked to climate change adaptation policy but has a clear environmental policy relevance, too. Climate change challenges water availability, quality and management and leads to higher risks in terms of floods and droughts and bears risks for impaired ecosystem functioning and loss of species. Finally, hydropower from river basins is also directly linked to regional energy policies. Civil protection and public security policy is a key policy area affected in the case study on smuggling at the Greek-Albanian border . However, policies enabling ",

Figure 5-1 Policy area share of obstacles Source: Service provider 2021, based on cross-border obstacles inventory Further analysis of obstacles in the three most relevant policy areas shows that usually one intervention field is more relevant to overcome obstacles in the respective policy area ( Fehler! Ung\u00fcltiger Eigenverweis auf Textmarke. Figure 5-2). For example, within transport and sustainable mobility the most required intervention is about the availability and quality of border crossing points and customs clearance processes, which focus on obstacles at a specific border crossing or segment. The next most important field of intervention is cross-border transport. Obstacles affecting this are mostly a lack of sufficient transport infrastructure beyond the border crossing. About half the obstacles in the area of natural resources and environmental protection can be addressed through joint nature management measures and are usually relevant for several border areas. Other important fields for joint intervention are the reduction of pollution, waste and wastewater. No obstacle has been identified that may be primarily addressed through low-carbon or resource efficiency interventions. ",

These obstacles occur at certain bilateral borders, e.g. when addressing a specific management capacity, and at a more general level at 14 6 4 36 2 Transport & sustainable mobility (62 obstacles) Cross-border transport of passengers and goods Cross-border rail freight and rail passenger transport Cross-border local public transport by bus, rail / light rail / metro or ferry services Availability and quality of border crossing points and efficiency of customs clearance processes Overall border regime 20 3 8 7 10 Natural resources & environmental protection (39 obstacles) Joint management of nature parks, landscape parks and natural reserves Joint establishment of \u201cgreen\u201d cross -border infrastructures Joint treatment of solid waste and / or municipal sewage water Joint reduction of pollution sources Joint water abstraction and cross-border provision of drinking water Joint measures promoting low-carbon and more resource efficiency 19 1 00 2 2 3 Civil protection & public security (27 obstacles) Mutual assistance in case of major accidents, disasters or fires and cooperation among the competent authorities Joint measures or services increasing the preparedness for / mitigating the effects of hazards Joint medical emergency services and other rescue services Cross-border functioning of the common emergency telephone number 112 Police cooperation and cooperation for cross-border crime prevention and investigation Cooperation between customs administrations Cooperation for ensuring the security at external EU-borders ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 45 many or all border areas in SEE. Possibly surprisingly, the number of obstacles primarily relevant for cooperation on security at external EU borders is very low, which may be because the few identified cases describe obstacles that are of wider geographic relevance. In addition, police and customs cooperation also address security issues at external borders. Two case studies with a primary effect for labour market and employment policies show how different roots of obstacles may link to the same policy area notwithstanding different implications for labour market and employment policies. Case study illustrations for labour market and employment policy The case study on obstacles for the cross-border mobility of workers between Timis County in Romania and the Serbian Banat region highlights different governance systems and administrative structures on both sides of the border. The root cause is the difficulty of reaching a bilateral national agreement regarding the full opening of a specific border crossing that could facilitate cross-border mobility for workers. Such an agreement is a priority at national and local level in Serbia, but only at local (county) level in Romania. The case study on economic disparities between Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia has its roots in the economic dimension of the border. This wider border area is generally characterised by poor economic development. Cross-border labour market access is crucial for workers in these border areas. The lack of companies, their low competitiveness, lack of infrastructure and low application of ICT all negatively affect employers and employees. In particular, educated youth and skilled workers leave the area and look for better opportunities in more developed urban areas in EU countries, leading to brain drain in the cross- border area and the loss of qualified workers. Complementing these findings, other case studies illustrated the link between labour and employment policies and education and training in the region. These are policy areas and fields of intervention in which Interreg IPA programmes may offer \u2018soft\u2019 support even if national policies have to take additional action to eliminate the obstacles. Considering labour market and education policy areas jointly and with their indirect affectedness makes them among the most important policy areas affected by cross- border cooperation obstacles (Figure 5-1). As identified in a recent study by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNTACD) on SEE, skills issues exist across SEE hampering economic development (UNTACD, 2017) and thus they also affect cross- border cooperation. This is closely linked to capacity issues seen in many obstacles. As labour and employment policy differs greatly between SEE countries, this further strengthens the need for cross-border cooperation to overcome various cooperation obstacles. Case study illustrations of labour market, skills and capacity needs in SEE The solution to the lack of cross-border harmonisation of health legislation, standards and procedures in SEE not only requires investments in health care systems but in related human capital through training, capacity and institution building. Climate change related issues in the Western Balkan (WB) region require particular knowledge and human resources (Vukovi\u010d Ana, 2018) . Not least a lack of coordinated planning and implementation of integrated regional strategies in general or for transboundary river basin management illustrates this. Overcoming these obstacles requires more intense exchanges of knowledge and expertise at regional level by strengthening regional intra- and inter- disciplinary communication. ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 46 Overall, analyses illustrate how there are obstacles to cross-border cooperation in SEE in all policy areas, implying that comprehensive measures will be needed to overcome these obstacles in the medium- to long-term. Interreg IPA programmes can thus contribute through all POs to this process as outlined below. 5.2. Policy areas in relation to geographic relevance and types of obstacles Further analyses on the relation between affected policy areas, geographic relevance of obstacles and their roots allows for further insights into potential orientations of Interreg IPA programmes to mitigate obstacles. Some policy areas may be widely relevant whereas others may be primarily relevant for very local and specific obstacles. Figure 5-3 sheds light on this geographic relevance. All policy areas are relevant for obstacles at a specific border, be it the full length or a segment of the border. Some policy areas are affected by obstacles with wider geographic relevance and by very local obstacles. This combination of local obstacles and those with a wider geographic relevance indicates a need for targeted IPA programmes . Obstacles that are relevant for all or most borders in SEE are linked especially to transport and mobility, natural resources and environmental protection, civil protection and public security as well as climate change action. These policy areas may thus require not only cross-border coordination but coordination beyond bilateral programmes in a transnational context .

However, they are not evenly distributed as indicated in Figure 5-4. Nevertheless, the analysis shows that all policy areas face obstacles rooted in the political dimension, whether legal and/or administrative. 5.3. Stakeholders and solution approaches Stakeholders are affected by obstacles for cross-border cooperation in two ways: \u2022 Obstacles affect the well-being of citizens in border areas or the efficient delivery of services, competitiveness of businesses, effective functioning of administration, quality of transboundary eco-systems, etc. In other words, this is about the effects and impacts on overall living conditions in border areas as outlined in Chapter 4 with regard to direct and secondary effects and wider impacts of obstacles. By focusing on the implications for citizens and stakeholders the following takes an actor-centred perspective adding to the thematic perspective of Chapter 4. \u2022 Various stakeholders are also affected in the approach to mitigating or solving obstacles. Most approaches require multilevel governance, implying not only new cooperation but capacity and readiness for new methods and tools and often the combination of different approaches. 5.3.1. Impacts on stakeholders How obstacles affect citizens and economic players in border regions can be best illustrated by using case study analyses. The box below illustrates how differently citizens in the border areas are affected by different obstacles . Some of these affect all citizens, while others have direct effects only for certain groups. Nevertheless, all of them can be related to border area citizen well-being.

Case study illustrations on the affectedness of border area citizens due to obstacles: \u2022 A lack of cross-border health care access negatively affects the health of citizens lacking adequate alternative health care services. \u2022 Economic disparities in border areas affect local citizens in terms of jobs and income , especially if commuting across borders is restricted or otherwise limited (e.g. due to a lack of adequate job alternatives in the cross-border area). \u2022 Limited accessibility of a border crossing point affects cross-border commuters in terms of travel time and costs and limits the cross-border mobility of other citizens. \u2022 The minority dispute between Albania and Greece affects the Greek minority negatively in terms of citizen rights, education and property rights . \u2022 The lack of transboundary river basin management in support of climate change adaptation can have multiple effects on the local population , including income and job losses and displacement due to flood events. Case study illustrations on the affectedness of other stakeholders for other direct and secondary effects (see Chapter 4) : \u2022 Health care service providers may face lower cost-efficiency depending on their capacity. \u2022 A governance weakness of EUSAIR affects the capacity of the public stakeholders in IPA countries to contribute to change . As this is driven by a lack of their own capacities, they are trapped in a vicious circle . \u2022 Smuggling at the Greek-Albanian border affects local authorities since they have to take additional security actions for local citizens while at the same time smuggling implies forgone tax revenues limiting public financial resources. \u2022 Due to a lack of cross-border governance structures local communities (e.g. municipalities) are not effectively represented at higher levels of government with respect to their border specificities. Any solution aiming to at least mitigate or possibly resolve obstacles needs to involve stakeholders with adequate responsibilities and capacities . Thus generally, the more approaches needed to mitigate an obstacle, the more stakeholders may become involved, though not necessarily all are required during the whole process. The analysis differentiates governance from EU to local level and thematic stakeholders from the public and private sectors, with a total of 14 groups of stakeholders. On average, about five to six types of stakeholders per obstacle are relevant or even required to implement solutions. National governments are by far the most important (Figure 5-5) and may be needed in most cases if obstacles are to be completely removed e.g. through legislative action or interstate agreements. Specific thematic agencies supporting national governments are often needed in the same context. Other levels of government are often required for mitigation measures but also to support national action through local implementation or even to induce action by national authorities. In this context, local and regional authorities and cross-border cooperation structures are crucial. Theme- specific stakeholders are needed especially for obstacles or effects related to them. For instance, national park management or environmental protection authorities are typically required for cross-thematic obstacles that affect environmental concerns as well as obstacles directly related to environmental protection and climate change.

Figure 5-7 illustrates the differences in required stakeholder involvement with four examples. In these, the number and type of stakeholders differ. This refers to the different administrative levels as well as to stakeholders other than public administration and policy makers. In addition to local and/or regional stakeholders (light grey in Figure 5-7) often the national (dark grey) or the EU level (blue) may also be required, though not necessarily involving all levels of administration. These findings illustrate the limitations faced by Interreg IPA programmes to solve obstacles. While they can contribute and may provide essential support to mitigating or solving cross-border obstacles, national measures are also often required. This is the case if legislative action or interstate agreements are essential for the problem-solving approaches. Cross-border institutions are listed only in a few cases as being essential. However, if well established, experience in the EU shows that these institutions (e.g. Euroregions) can facilitate multi-level governance in support of cross-border issues. Nevertheless, most cross-border structures in SEE are not functioning well and thus are not an effective \u2018problem -solving- level\u2019 in their current status (CESCI, 2016). Regarding other stakeholders, the variety to be involved in overcoming an obstacle depends on the thematic specificity of the obstacle. As a rule of thumb, the broader the thematic relevance, the more specific public, semi-public or private actors need to be included . For most obstacles, however, action from four to six types of stakeholders tends to be sufficient. These may require joint and cooperative action or simply imply that stakeholders have taken action individually targeting a specific obstacle. ",

Establishing new cross-border cooperation structures and cross-border public services account for about 15% of approaches. For about 90% of obstacles regional/local governance approaches may be sufficient to solving obstacles or can mitigate them and/or facilitate further steps towards more sustainable solutions, e.g. through interstate agreements or new cooperation structures. Obstacles related to national disputes on borders and pending agreements may not significantly benefit from additional \u2018soft\u2019 measures but can be solved solely through formal actions.

Case study illustrations on the variety of approaches to solving an obstacle The lack of harmonised cross-border health care frameworks is an example of a complex source-effect relationship that needs many complementary approaches to overcome the obstacles. Among them are: \u2022 legislative actions and bilateral agreements facilitating the formal access of citizens to health care services across the border; and \u2022 a variety of \u2018softer\u2019 measures such as better cross -border policy coordination, regular exchanges, joint knowledge bases, new cooperation structures, pragmatic approaches to solving challenges on the ground as well as service provision across the border. Overcoming a lack of transport infrastructure to connect major transport routes requires only a few approaches to cross-border cooperation that should complement infrastructure investments. These may focus on transport policy coordination in support of timely implementation of planned investments, which can also be fostered through regular cross-border exchanges and a joint development plan. Finally, combining the findings from the analysis of stakeholders and solutions shows that the two most relevant groups of stakeholders, i.e. national authorities and specialised thematic agencies, are among the most frequently needed stakeholders for all approaches (Figure 5-10). Thus, national authorities should be frequently involved also when designing and implementing \u2018soft\u2019 measures, which may mirror to some extent the often centralised decision-making structures in SEE compared to the very limited responsibilities and more limited capacities at lower levels of government. In other cases, their inclusion may be seen as the link between \u2018soft\u2019 and formal measures. The role of local and regional authorities is, however, not to be neglected and among the most important for all \u2018soft\u2019 measures. or national legislative actions and interstate agreements they may have a role in representing and transposing border region perspectives and needs into national actions. The potential relevance of very different stakeholders from local to EU level across the variety of approaches highlights that any action towards mitigating and solving obstacles should consider the broader picture by connecting different approaches and keeping the objective of removing an obstacle in mind.

Findings for future Interreg IPA programmes The above analyses provide insights from different angles allowing for conclusions on the potential thematic focus of 2021-2027 Interreg IPA programmes suitable to address obstacles to cross-border cooperation. The following gives general tendencies rather than insights to individual Interreg IPA programmes although illustrations from case studies may be linked to a certain Interreg IPA programme. 7 In the inventory of obstacles, 291 POs have been identified as access points to address the 222 obstacles (Figure 5-11). In some cases, actions under different POs may be necessary, whereas in other cases, POs may be alternative access points to address an obstacle. ISO 1 \u2018A better cooperation governance\u2019 is by far the most relevant PO and may be useful to address nearly every other obstacle. Other important POs are PO 2 \u2018A greener, low- carbon Europe\u2019 and PO 3 \u2018A more connected Europe\u2019. The outstanding frequency of ISO 1 is because this objective may be frequently combined with other POs to contribute to solving obstacles for cross-border cooperation and it mirrors the lack of capacity identified in several case studies. 7 More programme specific conclusions have been elaborated for Member State specific \u2018Issues Papers\u2019 outlined in separate documents (see Annex I, Section 7.3). 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 National-level legislative action Conclusion of a bilateral interstate agreement Stronger cross-border coordination of policies More regular cross-border exchanges Joint elaboration of a cross border territorial\u2026 Up-building of a joint knowledge base A pragmatic \u201cbridging\u201d of shared problems Establishment of new cooperation structures Establishment of cross-border public services No. of obstacles Solution approaches by selected types of stakeholders Thematically specialised national or regional agencies Local or regional authorities and their administrations Existing permanent cross-border cooperation structures National governments and their administrations EU-level institutions or organisations Specific European integration formats ",

For example, the obstacles to cooperation on climate change adaptation through transboundary river basin management clearly lacks cooperation between national administrations in SEE. Thus, ISO 1 is a means to enhance and support this cooperation. At the same time, transboundary river basin management may also benefit at local and regional level from actions under PO 2 \u2018A greener, low -carbon Europe\u2019 through which implementation of transboundary strategies could be financed. The example of a lack of transport infrastructure connections at TEN-T corridors between North Macedonia and Bulgaria and Greece shows there are also obstacles that may be addressed through thematic policy interventions, i.e. in this case under PO 3 \u2018A more connected Europe\u2019. The case studies highlight that ISO 1 may provide different and very targeted support to border areas in SEE. In most cases it is about capacity building and establishing cooperation routines, etc. but one case study also highlighted the need for trust building measures explicitly, where people-to-people actions may be relevant. Since the obstacle is not limited to this case study but seen more widely in SEE, these actions may be of wider relevance. Case study illustration from the Danube-Drava-Sava Euroregion on the need for trust building measures ollowing Croatia\u2019s EU accession, cooperation in the Danube -Drava-Sava Euroregion with members from Hungary, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina has weakened and basically disappeared after 2010. Apart from differences and weaknesses in the governance structures, there is a persistent lack of trust and mental barriers hindering cooperation between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Solutions that would help to overcome the obstacle should address the root cause through the encouragement of grassroot initiatives and new forms of informal cooperation across borders, concentrating the efforts on networking at local level and on younger generations. 17 51 59 33 16 106 9 PO 1 - \u201cA smarter Europe\u201d PO 2 - \u201cA greener, low- carbon Europe\u201d PO 3 - \u201cA more connected Europe\u201d PO 4 - \u201cA more social Europe\u201d PO 5 \u201cA Europe closer to citizens\u201d ISO 1 - \u201cA better cooperation governance\u201d ISO 2 - \u201cA safer and more secure European Union\u201d Number of obstacles by Policy Objective (n=291) ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 57 These findings raise the question of how far Interreg IPA 2021-2027 programmes plan a priority axis on ISO 1. According to tentative information, only four of the ten Interreg IPA programmes plan to implement an ISO 1 priority (Figure 5-12). This does not seem to mirror the need for ISO 1 related measures to mitigate obstacles to cross-border cooperation. The identification of insufficient cross-border cooperation structures for several borders in these countries and the relevance of ISO 1 for obstacles across policy areas (Figure 5-13 ) further support this finding. Overall, this may limit the programmes\u2019 ability to improve conditions in view of governance related obstacles. The other two POs important to solving obstacles are considered to different extents by these programmes. PO 2 may be implemented in all but one programme often including SOs on climate change challenges and environmental protection, both of are suitable to tackle numerous obstacles in these policy areas (Figure 5-13). Transport and sustainable mobility obstacles may be mostly addressed through PO 3, which seems to be selected by only four Interreg IPA programmes, notwithstanding the geographically wide relevance of the related obstacles. Tentative information on PO and ISO selection suggests that four of the ten programmes do not plan to implement PO 3 or ISO 1, which may hamper efforts to address transport and mobility-related obstacles.

In addition, socio-cultural obstacles, e.g. related to PO 4, may be addressed through P 5 \u2018A Europe closer to citizens\u2019 . However, for most obstacles where PO1, PO4 or PO5 have been identified as useful to providing solutions, there are also access points in ISO 1, PO 2, or PO 3 that could address most obstacles. Obstacles where ISO 2 could be an adequate access point refer mostly to illegal activities across borders (see e.g. the case study on smuggling). Depending on the approach, these could be considered as safety issue or as a matter for better cooperation governance. The second perspective means they could be addressed under ISO 1. The role of local and regional governance and the potential thematic coverage of POs and ISOs support the potential role of Interreg IPA programmes in addressing obstacles to cross-border cooperation. Differences in approaches to solve a cross-border cooperation obstacle and their relation to potential programme priorities are also visible in the case studies.

Without this action, regional mitigation measures will have very limited impact. However, social measures and integrated local development (PO 4 and PO 5) may facilitate first steps towards legal action. In contrast to this example, cooperation hampered by the incomplete peace and trust building process in the border areas between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina can be revived through \u2018soft\u2019 initiatives at local level rather than legislative action. This includes, in particular, ISO 1 measures. Addressing climate change challenges for water resources is an example where \u2018soft\u2019 and legal measures are equally required. These challenges frequently need bi - or trilateral national agreements, which should be elaborated and implemented through \u2018soft\u2019 measures ranging from a better knowledge base, with cross-border coordination and exchange to joint planning. Most of these measures could be addressed under PO 2 but may also benefit from ISO 1, when focusing more generally on cooperation and governance structures. 6. Conclusions and policy pointers Borders are still very important in the region, both between IPA countries and EU Member States and among IPA countries. This gives rise to additional conclusions complementing the thematic focus of Interreg IPA 2021-2027 programmes. The following offers findings for other design and implementation aspects of Interreg IPA programmes and general policy pointers. All conclusions focus on obstacles to cross- border cooperation and integration rather than on general development obstacles or cross-border cooperation interests. Based on the findings in case studies, \u2018 issues papers \u2019 and this report, border areas are encouraged to work on these obstacles . The EC Communication on boosting growth and cohesion in EU border regions (European Commission, 2017) has listed ten measures that are considered crucial to addressing the challenges and particularities of border regions. The analysis shows that these challenges and particularities are also relevant for border regions between EU Member States and IPA countries. Particularities challenging cross-border cooperation and integration may be even stronger and be more varied at these borders. Thus, these border regions may also benefit from all the measures proposed in the EC Communication. Actions to alleviate or solve obstacles to cross-border cooperation in the area are numerous and may require even further actions and possibly a different focus compared to internal EU border obstacles. This links to the finding that borders between EU Member States and IPA countries are \u2018hard\u2019 borders in many respects as they separate different systems. This not only regards travel times at border crossing points as the borders separate people and communities mentally. In consequence, cross-border cooperation in SEE is still a sensitive matter at least in some border areas due to enduring tensions linked to war legacies and different interpretations of recent history. To make matters worse, along some borders this is often perpetuated to post-war generations through the educational system. The path towards improved cross-border cooperation can therefore not ignore these underlying issues, which ask for open dialogue among institutions at all levels and among local communities as well as concrete trust building activities that differ to that ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 60 envisaged under the first EC Communication measure \u2018Deepening cooperation and exchanges\u2019. This links to another type of measure not suggested in the EC Communication due to its focus on internal EU borders: the need for capacity building in border areas and for cross-border cooperation . Interreg Specific O bjective ISO 1 \u2018Better Interreg governance\u2019 can address corresponding obstacles, even if not listed as a measure in the EC Communication. This has been recently acknowledged in refocusing actions, including \u2018Resilience through deeper institutional cooperation\u2019 (European Commission, 2021). For Interreg IPA programmes the needs to be addressed differ, however, from those addressed by Interreg programmes when it comes to the development of cross- border cooperation structures. SEE border regions need stronger cross-border cooperation structures to enable many cooperation processes and initiate measures to tackle border specific challenges on behalf of their members. In this context, increasing the engagement of key actors in candidate and potential candidate countries in Interreg IPA programmes is central. The analyses illustrates the frequent need for improving capacity to benefit from and implement Interreg IPA measures and projects. But there is also a need to raise awareness about the opportunity of Interreg IPA programmes. Small municipalities and other small key actors, not least due to their restricted resources in terms of finance, staff and technical expertise and their peripheral location, lack knowledge of these funding opportunities while facing a lack of alternative sources of funding. Apart from this lack of alternative funding sources, many potential beneficiaries also face a lack of financial resources for pre- and co-financing Interreg IPA actions . This is a cross-cutting obstacle to cross-border cooperation along all borders between EU and IPA countries. This hampers the participation of many local stakeholders in these programmes. In turn, this impacts the intensity of cooperation and the range of initiatives that could be taken to alleviate or solve obstacles across borders. Although the relevance of this issue varies depending on the type of beneficiary and the country/region concerned, tackling obstacles to cross-border cooperation would benefit from a wider availability of co-financing. This can be alleviated by national interventions, e.g. through national schemes that ensure co-financing and/or interim funding up to a ceiling for Interreg IPA participation. 8 Such schemes could also help to mitigate differences in co-financing resources between EU Member States and neighbouring candidate and potential candidate countries. Some measures in the EC Communication suggest a thematic focus on employment, multilingualism, accessibility and health care. For SEE border regions additional cooperation themes need considerable effort. This especially concerns actions supporting cross-border environmental protection and climate change action as well as support to cross-border civil protection and disaster management. For these additional themes many obstacles were identified with wider effects on development in these border regions. The recent EC Communication on the progress of border region actions also acknowledges some of these themes when suggesting a refocus towards \u2018Border regions for the European Green Deal\u2019 (European Commission, 2021, p. 5). The EU can and must play a crucial role in these areas through the enlargement process and cross-border cooperation programmes in the region (Interreg IPA) since they are a powerful stimulus for action at local and regional level. These and other EU support in SEE should be seen in the wider policy context of the region. A lack of trust and mental barriers may not always be visible at first glance as the main cause of border obstacles. However, they are additional and reinforcing reasons hampering cross-border cooperation, as mentioned above in relation to war legacies. Other external influences in the region e.g. Chinese investments in infrastructure (Academy for Spatial Research 8 For instance, Italy has installed a revolving fund to implement national policies that provides co-financing for local and regional authorities wishing to participate in Interreg projects. For more information see https://www.agenziacoesione.gov.it/lacoesione/le-politiche-di-coesione-in-italia-2014-2020/the-actors/igrue/?lang=en and https://www.rgs.mef.gov.it/VERSIONE- I/attivita_istituzionali/monitoraggio/rapporti_finanziari_ue/i_decreti_di_cofinanziamento/ ",

A watchful eye should be kept on these external influences to avoid developments that could hamper the EU accession prospects of SEE countries. To overcome these barriers to European integration, mitigation of cross-border cooperation obstacles supported by the EU is imperative. This raises questions of how to enhance the integration of SEE countries in view of prospective EU enlargement. Past enlargement experience may be useful to illustrate how important it is to implement the acquis communautaire prior to EU accession. At the same time, lengthy processes \u2013 especially in view of other external influences \u2013 may negatively affect the motivation of SEE governments to focus on achieving the acquis communautaire . Preferential conditions for candidate countries where these pre-requisites are fulfilled as well as more intensive (financial) support may counter-balance other external influences and help overcome cross-border cooperation obstacles. Additional financial support for Interreg IPA and especially IPA countries should also be envisaged to avoid an increasing gap of resources for regional and territorial development between EU Member States and enlargement countries in SEE. However, this should come with better and more targeted visibility of the benefits of EU resources . Not least the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted transport routes and value chains, provides further arguments in favour of closer cooperation with neighbouring countries in SEE. The analysis highlights potential thematic foci of Interreg IPA 2021-2027 programmes. However, obstacles refer to all policies and themes targeted by the objectives of the Common Provision Regulation for 2021-2027 and even go beyond this, as illustrated by obstacles that require attention from foreign affairs. Notwithstanding the individual focus of specific Interreg IPA programmes future interventions should be more about actions to mitigate obstacles for cross-border cooperation rather than encouraging cooperation more generally. One way forward may be to focus on related SOs (across POs) that could support one obstacle mitigation measure with another (e.g. ISO 1 together with an SO of one of the thematic POs). To achieve visible effects, defining realistic milestones and stepwise approaches towards a defined goal are central. EU internal experience shows that solving obstacles to cross- border cooperation and integration most often needs time, realistic objectives and the acceptance of stakeholders and citizens . Often several steps need to be taken before overcoming the obstacle. These steps are important to tailor cooperation towards solutions. Examples of such preparatory steps are: \u25aa creating an adequate knowledge base through needs assessments, monitoring etc.; \u25aa specifying the needs for cooperation on a particular obstacle and its benefits for the affected population, including citizen dialogue across the regions; \u25aa identifying initiators and important stakeholders to address the obstacle; \u25aa working on the legal framework to get further support from higher administrative levels on local challenges (see e.g. Hermannek, 2015). Interreg IPA programmes can contribute throughout these processes. Most programmes involve two neighbouring countries. However, not all obstacles can be tackled bilaterally by these programmes: 1) Bilateral programmes do not sufficiently consider functional areas . In some cases, trilateral programmes would be better for functional economic or environmental areas. Alternatively, territorial flexibility in bilateral programmes could be promoted to involve stakeholders from outside the programme area including from neighbouring countries, when beneficial to a project and justified by functional links. 2) Interreg IPA cannot solve all obstacles. They are not sufficient in volume or competences. To alleviate obstacles to cross-border cooperation, sound coordination with national IPA programmes and other policy action is often also ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 62 required. Interreg IPA is one important piece in the puzzle rather than the only means when addressing obstacles to cross-border cooperation and integration. Last but not least, interviews hinted at a potential lack of awareness outside Interreg IPA programme territories . Project partners in other parts of the countries (in both, IPA countries and their neighbouring EU Member States) can be a game changer when offering new capacity for the benefit of border areas. At least partially, there seems to be either a lack of awareness among stakeholders or restrictions imposed by programmes that hamper the participation of key players outside the programme area. Given that the new Interreg regulation (EU Regulation 2021/1059) does not impose such restrictions, Interreg IPA 2021-2027 programmes may avoid unnecessary limitations and misunderstandings regarding the potential involvement of stakeholders outside the programme area if their involvement can benefit border areas.

Annex I \u2013 Methodological approach The following two figures detail the approach and roadmap of the study in terms of (a) links between the study tasks and (b) the relation between obstacles and recommendations for Interreg IPA programmes. Figure 7-1 Links between study tasks The study was conducted along five tasks as detailed in Figure 7-1. This shows that task 1 developed the methodological basis for all following tasks. At the core of the study are tasks 2, 3 and 4, which present different perspectives of the analysis. Figure 7-2 adds an additional content perspective to the roadmap. It shows the type of information used to develop recommendations for Interreg IPA programmes to reduce identified obstacles. This considers past experience of these programmes, insights from the inventory and the case studies in view of the causes and solutions for obstacles in the corresponding geographical context (i.e. related to specific Member States and border relations). While the final report generalises the study findings and identifies the most relevant obstacles across the countries, the issues papers aim for focused and practical recommendations and proposals.

Inventory of obstacles The inventory of obstacles is the central database of the study and has three levels: \u25aa The first level of the Excel database consists of 7 \u2018 main themes \u2019 , which address and further specify the analytical elements mentioned in the technical specifications for this study. \u25aa The second level consists of 19 \u2018 sub-themes \u2019 , each of which addresses specific aspects mentioned in the titles of the seven main themes. For nearly all sub- themes, dropdown menus with pre-defined \u2018 assessment topics \u2019 enable filtering within the inventory. For a limited number of sub-themes, however, fields for comments allow short but specific descriptions of each obstacle. \u25aa The third level consists of the individual obstacles (i.e. database entries), each of which is described under the main themes / sub-themes by either selecting the pre-elaborated assessment topics from the dropdown menus or, where required, by short texts in the comments fields. Each obstacle is identified by a short title and an ID number. Obstacle s with ID numbers starting with \u2018S\u2019 were collected through a survey (see further below). The inventory has been set up in an Excel file that arranges the main themes and sub- themes as well as the related dropdown menus with assessment topics or the fields for comments horizontally as described below.

Obstacles were identified by reviewing literature and documents as well as through a survey of national, regional and local stakeholder organisations in the study area potentially with information on existing border obstacles. Two columns at the beginning of the horizontal order identify the obstacles , namely \u2018ID\u2019 number and \u2018Short name of the obstacle\u2019. All IDs starting with \u2018S\u2019 were collected through the survey. Literature and document review During the inception phase and analysis, general and specific sources with potential information on border obstacles in different fields were gathered. They are included in the list of references above. These sources are scientific works or thematic studies from applied science and reports or policy documents focusing on SEE countries that are the focus of this study. These documents were screened by the experts to find information on potential border obstacles that could be used to elaborate obstacle cases for the inventory. Information collection via survey A survey of stakeholders working on border integration, cross-border cooperation and border projects complemented the literature review. This collected primary data on a) border obstacles and specificities of the borders with IPA countries, and b) potential case studies and good practice examples. This approach helped identify obstacles that ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 77 were not or not well covered by literature. Thus, the survey provided additional insights complementing the obstacle database and inventory. 7.2. Case studies Case study analysis aims to offer additional insights that cannot be offered by general analysis covering a large number of cases, i.e. border obstacles. To maximise the benefit of the case studies, their selection had to be well founded and a comparative approach implemented that allowed for cross-analysis. The following paragraphs detail the steps to implement the cross-border case studies. Determining the case study sample The data sources to detect potential cases for case studies were: \u25aa literature and reports and analyses of border obstacles at EU level and at EU external borders; \u25aa local, regional, national and EU stakeholders (contacted through the survey under Task 2); \u25aa European experts for border obstacles (AEBR, AER, b-solutions network, etc.); \u25aa Interreg IPA programme documents, programme evaluations and socio- economic analyses. Following the development of the inventory of obstacles under Task 2, a proposal with a list of potential case studies was presented to DG REGIO for validation or further selection. Case studies should fulfil several objectives, which were the selection criteria: 1) The border obstacles should have a significant impact on the border area(s). 2) The sample should cover different obstacle types. 3) Each case should be related to at least one of the five POs and the two Interreg Specific Objectives outlined for the 2021-2027 programming period and to a respective Interreg IPA Programme. If possible, case studies should cover more than one of the five POs or the two ISOs. 4) Different types of territories were to be considered, e.g. border cities, transboundary river basins, larger cross-border regions sharing the same obstacle and possibly be relevant for other EU border regions or for similar territories in neighbouring enlargement countries. 5) The cases should cover different border regions to achieve a balanced geographical coverage for the six Member States and across the ten Interreg IPA programmes. 6) Whenever possible, case studies should also include good practices or \u2018solutions\u2019 which address the border obstacles and could be used more widely. There are ten case studies, allowing for a detailed analysis of each and the elaboration of concrete conclusions and recommendations. Factsheets Each case study consists of a short report and a factsheet. The latter identifies the main features with the information collected for the inventory and more in-depth details of the case, also in the form of an infographic. The content-related structure follows the inventory structure. These factsheets facilitate the use of the case studies as part of the toolbox for stakeholders and organisations responsible for Interreg IPA programmes, as well as project planning and implementation. 7.3. Issues papers Separate issues papers files complement the final report. To develop recommendations for Member States, a border and country specific analysis was conducted. Since some ",
        "ANALYSIS OF CROSS-BORDER OBSTACLES BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES AND ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES 78 Member States implement Interreg IPA programmes with more than one enlargement country the recommendations differentiate between these programmes and borders. The horizontal organisation of themes together with the identification of relevant regions and borders allows obstacles and solutions to be grouped by Member States and borders. This way, the most significant obstacles and policy areas per cross-border area were identified to focus conclusions and recommendations by Member State and programme, including tentative information on 2021-2027 programme priorities. Issues papers target all levels of government and legislation in the Member State and may also be of interest for the enlargement countries. Above all, these papers inform Member State (and enlargement country) authorities and give advice for planning and implementation of their Interreg IPA programmes in view of their post-2020 orientation. Future programmes are expected to address border obstacles and tap into potential to facilitate cooperation and socio-economic development in these external border areas. By doing so, functional cross-border relations shall be established and/or enhanced. Due to the timing of the study, issues papers have been drafted when Interreg IPA programmes made a tentative selection of POs and SOs. Thus, recommendations above all address issues that may be feasible to implement in view of the tentative programme outline. Recommendations address different time horizons. 7.4. Infographics Visualisation of findings is increasingly important to support memorability. To support communication of the study findings, infographics describing different findings are provided as separate files: \u25aa each case study is summarised in an infographic style; \u25aa infographics on a selection of typical obstacles to cross-border cooperation o roots, impacts and policy options for cross-border obstacles due to weak Euroregions ; o roots, impacts and policy options for cross-border obstacles due to weak transport links ; o roots, impacts and policy options for cross-border obstacles related to environmental protection ; \u25aa Finding the best policy mix for IPA 2021-2027 programmes.

Annex II \u2013 Overview of case studies The following table presents the list of case studies on cross-border obstacles between EU Member States and candidate countries identified in the inventory from the literature review and survey responses. The selection of case studies was based on criteria outlined in the Report on structure and methodology, i.e.: 1) The border obstacles should have a significant impact on the border area(s). 2) The sample should cover different obstacle types. 3) Each case should be related to at least one of the five Policy Objectives (POs) and the two Interreg Specific Objectives (ISOs) outlined for the 2021-2027 programming period and to a respective Interreg IPA Programme. If possible, case studies should cover more than one of the five POs or the two ISOs. 4) Different types of territories were to be considered, e.g. border cities, transboundary river basins, larger cross-border regions sharing the same obstacle and possibly be relevant for other EU border regions or for similar territories in neighbouring enlargement countries. 5) The cases should cover different border regions to achieve a balanced geographical coverage for the six Member States and across the ten Interreg IPA programmes. 6) henever possible, case studies should also include good practices or \u2018solutions\u2019 which address the border obstacles and could be used more widely. In addition to these criteria, priority was given to: \u2022 For obstacles emerging from the literature review, a solid basis of material (i.e. documents, strategies etc.), which facilitates assessment of interesting cases. \u2022 For obstacles emerging from the survey, the detail of information and availability of respondents to be contacted in the future. 10 case studies were conducted 9 . 9 Two of the proposed case studies were replaced due to insufficient information and the unavailability of interviewees.
