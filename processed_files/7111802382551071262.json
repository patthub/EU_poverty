Fishing vessels may not conduct directed fisheries for spe- cies for which by catch limits apply. A directed fishery for a species is conducted when that species comprises the largest percentage by weight of the catch in any one haul . 1. Fishing vessels shall limit their by-catch to a maximum of 2 500 kg or 10 %, whichever is the greater, for each species listed in Annex I for which no quota has been allocated in that Division to the Community .

By-catches of the species for which no quotas have been fixed by the Community for a part of the NAFO Regulatory Area and taken in that part when fishing directly for any species may not exceed for each species 2 500 kg or 10 % by weight of the total catch retained on board, whichever is the greater. However, in a part of the NAFO Regulatory Area where directed fishing of certain species is banned or an \u2018 others \u2019 quota has been fully utilised, by-catches of each of such species may not exceed 1 250 kg or 5 % respectively . 2. In cases where a ban on fishing is in force or an \u2018 others \u2019 quota has been fully utilised, the by-catch of the species con- cerned may not exceed 1 250 kg or 5 %, whichever is the greater . 3. Whenever the total amounts of species subject to by- catch limits in any haul exceed the limits laid down in para- graph 2, whichever is applicable, vessels shall immediately move a minimum of five nautical miles away from the pre- vious haul position. Whenever the total amounts of species subject to by-catch limits in any future haul exceed those lim- its, vessels shall again immediately move a minimum of five nautical miles away from the previous haul position and shall not return to the Area for at least 48 hours . 3. The percentages in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be calcu- lated as the percentage, by weight, for each species of the total catch retained on board. Catches of shrimp shall not be included in the calculation of by-catch levels of groundfish species . 4. In the event that total by catches of all species in any haul exceed 5 % by weight in Division 3M and 2.5 % in Divi- sion 3L, vessels fishing for shrimp (Pandalus borealis), shall immediately move a minimum of 5 nautical miles from the position of the previous haul. 5. Catches of shrimp shall not be used in the calculation of by-catch level of groundfish species. Amendment 2 Article 4a (new) Article 4(a) By-catch in any one haul 1. If the percentages of by-catches in any one haul exceed the percentages laid down in Article 4(1) and (2) the vessel shall immediately move a minimum of 5 nautical miles from any position of the previous tow and throughout the next tow keep a minimum distance of 10 nautical miles from any posi- tion of the previous tow.

ANNEX Joint statement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on Article 26 relating to operational management The European Parliament and the Council invite the Commission to present, following an impact assessment that provides a substantive analysis of alternatives from a financial, operational and organisational perspec- tive, the necessary legislative proposals entrusting an agency with the long-term operational management of the VIS. The impact assessment could form part of the impact assessment which the Commission undertook to carry out with regard to the SIS II. The Commission commits itself to presenting, within two years of the entry into force of this Regulation, the necessary legislative proposals to entrust an agency with the long-term operational management of the VIS. Such proposals shall include the modifications required to adapt the Regulation concerning the VIS and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas. The European Parliament and the Council commit themselves to dealing with these proposals as quickly as possible and to have them adopted in time to allow the agency to take up fully its activities before the end of a five-year period following the entry into force of this Regulation. Joint statement by the European Parliament and the Council concerning the misuse of visas and invitations The European Parliament and the Council underline the need to tackle the phenomenon of visa misuse in a comprehensive manner and believe that the treatment of cases of misuse which emerge or come to light after the expiry of the validity of a visa should be carefully considered in the context of the Visa Code proposal. Following an agreement on the Visa Code, they invite the Commission to propose, if necessary, appropriate amendments to the VIS Regulation. Furthermore, the European Parliament and the Council invite the Commission to report not later than three years after the start of operations of the VIS on the situation as regards misuse by persons issuing invita- tions, and to present, if necessary, suitable proposals for amendments. Statement by the Council concerning the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals The Council recognises the importance of adopting without delay a Return Directive which shall contribute to the establishment of an effective removal and repatriation policy based on common standards for persons to be returned in a humane manner and with full respect for their human rights and dignity, as required by the Hague Programme.

The information contained in the VIS may be necessary for the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism and serious crimes and should therefore be available , subject to the conditions set out in this Decision, for consultation by the designated authorities \u2590 . (4) Moreover, the European Council has stated that Europol has a key role with respect to cooperation between Member States' authorities in the field of cross-border crime investigation in supporting Union-wide crime prevention, analyses and investigation. Consequently, Europol should also have access to VIS data within the framework of its tasks and in accordance with the Convention of 26 July 1995 on the Establishment of a European Police Office ( 2 ). (5) This Decision complements the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas 2005/XX/EC ( 3 ) (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018 VIS Regulation \u2019 ) insofar as it provides for a legal base under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union authorizing the access to the VIS for designated authorities \u2590 and by Europol. (6) It is necessary to designate the competent Member States' authorities as well as the central access points through which access is done and to keep a list of the operating units within the designated authorities that are authorised to access the VIS \u2590 for the specific purposes of the prevention, detec- tion and investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences as referred to in the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States ( 4 ). It is essential to ensure that the duly empowered staff with a right to access the VIS is limited to those who 'have a need to know' and possess appropriate knowledge about data security and data protection rules. Requests for access to the VIS should be made by the operating units within the designated autho- rities to the central access points. These central access points should then process the requests to the VIS following a verification whether all conditions for access are fulfilled. In an exceptional case of urgency the central access points shall process the request immediately and only do the verification afterwards. (7) For the purposes of protection of personal data, and in particular to exclude routine access, the processing of VIS data should only be on a case-by-case basis. Such a specific case exists in par- ticular when the access for consultation is connected to a specific event or to a danger associated with serious crime, or to (a) specific person(s) in respect of whom there are serious grounds for believing that the person(s) will commit or has (have) committed terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences or that the person(s) has (have) a relevant connection with such (a) person(s). The designated authorities and Europol should thus only search data contained in the VIS when they have reasonable grounds to believe that such a search will provide information that will substantially assist them in preventing, detecting or investigating serious crime.

        "Once the proposed Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the frame- work of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters ( 1 ) has entered into force it should apply to the personal data which are processed pursuant to this Decision. However, until the rules set out in the Framework Decision are applicable and in order to supplement them, adequate provisions have to be provided for to ensure the necessary data protection. Each Member should ensure an adequate data protection level in its national law which at least corresponds to that resulting from the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data and the corresponding case law pursuant to Article 8 of the ECHR and, for those Member States which have ratified it, the Additional Protocol of 8 November 2001 to that Convention, and shall take into account Recommendation No R (87) 15 of 17 September 1987 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe Regulating the Use of Personal Data in the Police Sector . (8) The effective monitoring of the application of this Decision should be evaluated at regular intervals. (9) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely the creation of obligations and conditions for access for consultation of VIS data by Member States' designated authorities \u2590 and by Europol cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at the level of the European Union, the Council may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, referred to in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union and defined in Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (10) In accordance with Article 47 of the Treaty on the European Union, this \u2590 Decision does not affect the competences of the European Community, in particular as exercised in the VIS Regulation and in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( 2 ). (11) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom doe s not take part \u2590 in accordance with \u2590 Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000, concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis ( 3 ); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application. (12) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis ( 4 ); Ireland is there- fore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application. (13) However, in accordance with Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA ( 5 ), information contained in the VIS can be provided to the United Kingdom and Ireland by the competent authorities of the Mem- ber States whose designated authorities have access to the VIS pursuant to this Decision and information held in the national visa registers of the United Kingdom and Ireland can be provided to the competent law enforcement authorities of the other Member States. Any form of direct access for central authorities of the United Kingdom and Ireland to the VIS would, under the present state of their participation in the Schengen acquis, require an Agreement between the Community and those Member States, possibly to be supplemented by other rules specifying the conditions and procedures for such access.

        "(14) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes , with the exception of Article 7, a develop- ment of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis ( 1 ), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 ( 2 ) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement \u2590 . (15) As regards Switzerland, this Decision constitutes , with the exception of Article 7, a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed by the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunc- tion with Article 4 (1) of the Council Decision 2004/849/EC of 25 October 2004 ( 3 ) on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and on the provisional application of certain provisions of that Agreement. (15a) This Decision, save its Article 6, constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession and Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession.

        "ANNEX Council Declaration concerning the Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data pro- cessed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters The Council recognises the importance of the existence of a comprehensive and coherent set of rules at the level of the European Union concerning the high level of protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, as a part of the Union's ever increasing regulatory set of instruments on such cooperation. These rules will constitute an important development of the minimum data protection principles set by the Convention of 28 January 1981 for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data, and in Recommendation (87)15 regulating the use of personal data in the police sector, both adopted in the framework of the Council of Europe. Therefore, the Council continues to give priority to the examination of the proposal for a Council Frame- work Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial coop- eration in criminal matters, and intends to reach a political agreement on the proposal as soon as possible and at the latest by the end of 2007. Council Declaration concerning the right of access to the VIS by the United Kingdom and Ireland in the Council Decision The Council recognises that the shared security of Member States will be strengthened by the reciprocal access of the United Kingdom and Ireland to the Visa Information System and emphasizes the importance of the United Kingdom and Ireland access for law enforcement purposes to the Visa Information System. The Council will therefore keep the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland under review, including in relation to relevant jurisprudence and will in the light of the outcome of the Court Decisions adopt such provisions as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the United Kingdom and Ireland to have access to the Visa Information System on the same footing as the other Member States.

Amendment 2 RECITAL 5 (5) The scope of this Regulation should be products covered by the common market organisations of the markets in fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables. However, the provisions on producer organisations and interbranch organisations and agreements only apply to products covered by the common market organisation for fruit and vegetables and this distinction should be maintained. The scope of the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables should also be extended to certain culinary herbs to allow them to benefit from the regime.

In order bet- ter to assist farmers and operators in translating the high quality of their products into higher revenue, the Commission should further investigate the possible introduction of a Euro- pean quality label. Amendment 4 RECITAL 8 (8) Producer organisations are the basic elements in the fruit and vegetables regime, the decentralised operation of which they ensure at their level. In the face of ever greater concentration of demand, the grouping of supply through these organisations continues to be an economic necessity in order to strengthen the position of producers in the market. Such grouping must be effected on a voluntary basis and must prove its utility by the scope and efficiency of the services offered by producer organisations to their members.

In the face of ever greater concentration of demand, the grouping of supply through these organisations continues to be an eco- nomic necessity in order to strengthen the position of produ- cers in the market. However, securing a genuine improvement in the position of producers vis-\u00e0-vis retail networks and large processing concerns will require other, political, action to be taken at Community level. Such grouping must be effected on a voluntary basis and must prove its utility by the scope and efficiency of the services offered by producer organisations to their members. Amendment 5 RECITAL 9 (9) Experience shows that producer organisations are the cor- rect tool for grouping supply. However, the spread of producer organisations in different Member States has been uneven. In order to further improve the attractiveness of producer organi- sations, provision should be made for more flexibility in their operation wherever possible. Such flexibility should concern in particular the product range of a producer organisation, the extent of direct sales permitted and the extension of rules to non-members as well as permitting the delegation of powers or functions of producer organisations to associations of produ- cer organisations, subject to necessary conditions, and the dele- gation of functions to subsidiaries. (9) Experience shows that producer organisations are the cor- rect tool for concentration of supply. However, the spread of producer organisations in different Member States has been uneven. In order to further improve the attractiveness of produ- cer organisations, provision should be made for more flexibility in their operation wherever possible , as well as to prevent their being excessively concentrated in areas where the production and marketing conditions are more homogeneous, which would indirectly lead to overall supply being dispersed . Such flexibility should concern in particular the product range of a producer organisation, the extent of direct sales permitted and the extension of rules to non-members as well as permitting the delegation of powers or functions of producer organisations to associations of producer organisations, subject to conditions available to ensure their efficient operation , and the delegation of functions to subsidiaries. Amendment 6 RECITAL 11 (11) Producer groups in Member States which have acceded to the Community in 2004 or thereafter and wishing to acquire the status of producer organisations in accordance with this Regulation should be allowed the benefit of a transitional period during which national and Community financial support can be given against certain commitments by the group. (11) Producer groups in Member States which have acceded to the Community in 2004 or thereafter and wishing to acquire the status of producer organisations in accordance with this Regulation should be allowed , insofar as the degree of concen- tration of supply is still inadequate, the benefit of a transitional period during which national and Community financial support can be given against certain commitments by the group.

(14) In order to simplify and reduce the cost of the scheme it could be helpful to align, where possible, the procedures and rules for the eligibility of expenditure under operational funds with those of rural development programmes by permitting Member States to establish a national strategy for operational programmes. In this national strategy, as well as in the national strategic plan and in the rural development pro- grammes, the measures adopted by the Member States to pre- vent the dual financing of the measures should be specified. In addition, in the interests of greater legal certainty and of mak- ing the operational fund measures more effective, Member States should be allowed to draw up negative lists of eligibil- ity. Amendment 9 RECITAL 16 (16) A number of heterogeneous aid schemes for certain fruit and vegetables have been set out in Regulations (EC) No 2200/96, (EC) No 2201/96 and (EC) No 2202/96. The number and variety of those schemes have made them complex to administer. Whilst they have been targeted at some specific fruits and vegetables, they have not been able to fully take into account regional conditions of production, and have not cov- ered all fruit and vegetables. It is therefore appropriate to seek a different tool for supporting fruit and vegetable producers. (16) A number of heterogeneous aid schemes for certain fruit and vegetables have been set out in Regulations (EC) No 2200/96, (EC) No 2201/96 and (EC) No 2202/96. The number and variety of those schemes have made them complex to administer and may create legal uncertainty . Whilst they have been targeted at some specific fruits and vegetables, they have not been able to fully take into account the species brought in by the new Member States or the regional condi- tions of production, and have not covered all fruit and vegeta- bles. It is therefore appropriate to seek a different tool for sup- porting fruit and vegetable producers. Amendment 10 RECITAL 18 (18) In the interests of a more targeted but flexible system of support for the fruit and vegetables sector and in the interests of simplification, it is therefore appropriate to abolish the exist- ing aid schemes and include fruit and vegetables fully into the scheme established by Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. To this end it is necessary to provide that farmers who produced fruit and vegetables in the reference period should be eligible for the single payment scheme. Provision should also be made for the establishment by Member States of reference amounts and (18) In the interests of a more targeted but flexible system of support for the fruit and vegetables sector and in the interests of simplification, it is therefore appropriate to abolish the exist- ing aid schemes and include fruit and vegetables at least par- tially into the scheme established by Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.

Areas planted with fruit and vegetables, including permanent fruits and vegetables should be eligible to the single payment scheme. National ceilings should be amended appropriately , with reference to the new fruit and vegetable market situation resulting from the accession of the new Member States . Provi- sion should also be made for the Commission to adopt detailed rules and any necessary transitional measures. Amendment 11 RECITAL 18A (new) (18a) Areas planted with fruit and vegetables should be excluded from the single payment scheme, in order to ensure that they cannot be destined for any other agricultural activ- ity, until their potential effects on structures and on fruit and vegetable markets are known, thereby respecting the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities ( 1 ) which demands the submission of detailed impact studies to justify substantial legislative changes. The report that the Commis- sion is to submit to the Council on the regional application of the single payment scheme, referred to in Article 60(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, should, on the one hand, analyse the impact of the scheme on areas planted with fruit and vegetables that already enjoy freedom of production and, on the other, incorporate a specific analysis of the potential effects of the liberalisation on the whole sector of fruit and vegetables and potatoes in the Community. ( 1 ) Judgment of 7 September 2006 in Case C-310/04 Spain v Council [2006] ECR I-7285. Amendment 12 RECITAL 18B (new) (18b) Because of the enlargement of 2004, cherries and berries (strawberries, raspberries and redcurrants) have become products of great social and economic importance for the Union, but they are nevertheless undergoing a great struc- tural crisis and require specific support measures. Area-based Community aid is therefore provided for these crops under conditions that ensure the viability of holdings and promote structural improvement, in particular concentration of supply. Amendment 13 RECITAL 19 (19) The production of fruit and vegetables is unpredictable and the products are perishable. Surplus on the market, even if it is not too great, can strongly disturb the market. Some schemes for market withdrawals have been operated but have proved somewhat complex to administer.

Integration of all such measures into the operational programmes of producer organisations appears the best approach in these circumstances, and should also provide for increased attractiveness of producer organisa- tions for producers. instability, and in the event of price collapses the current sys- tem of market withdrawals is of limited effectiveness as a safety net for farmers' incomes, owing to insufficient pay- ments, excessive bureaucracy, shortcomings in organisation in the production regions, failure to recognise the production potential in order to ensure correct market management, the effect of imports from third countries and the lack of genuine outlets for the products withdrawn. More effective, horizontal measures for crisis management , applicable to all farmers from all market sectors, should be introduced, in a manner as easy to apply as possible. Integration of all such measures into a secur- ity fund financed separately from the operational programmes of producer organisations appears the best approach in these circumstances, and should also provide for increased attractive- ness of producer organisations for producers. The Member States are allowed to devise management measures to tackle serious national and/or regional crises. Those measures should be defined in the context of the national strategy and, if the Member States deem it appropriate, should be financed by part of the national reserve of payment entitlements referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. Amendment 14 RECITAL 19A (new) (19a) In common organisations of the market which are very open to markets, such as that for fruit and vegetables, interbranch organisations play an extremely important part in initial marketing and in the quality of products. They make it possible not only to improve the competitiveness of the sector but also to combat market fluctuations. Their func- tioning therefore considerably limits major market disruptions and protects producers against crises. Amendment 15 RECITAL 20A (new) (20a) In the event of a substantial change to the existing system, the areas earmarked for production of cultivated mushrooms may be eligible for the single payment system pro- vided for by Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. Amendment 16 RECITAL 20B (new) (20b) Average consumption of fruit and vegetables is still below the levels recommended by the World Health Organiza- tion and nutrition experts for their importance in achieving a balanced diet and their substantial role in the prevention of chronic illnesses. In some Member States, moreover, consump- tion is gradually falling. In order to counter this trend the role and resources of producer organisations as regards promotion should be stepped up and funding should be increased for the information campaigns and measures to promote the con- sumption of fruit and vegetables referred to in Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000 for all sections of the population, 22.5.2008 EN C 125 E/185 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 June 2007 TEXT PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION AMENDMENTS BY PARLIAMENT ",
        "especially the under-18s. In addition, it would be appropriate to improve the conditions for free distribution of fruit and vegetables within the EU and, as far as possible, also in third countries near the Community. Amendment 17 RECITAL 23 (23) The creation of a single Community market involves the introduction of a trading system at the external borders of the Community. That trading system should include import duties and should, in principle, stabilise the Community market. The trading system should be based on the undertakings accepted under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.

That trading system should include import duties and should, in principle, stabilise the Community market. The trading system should be based on the undertakings accepted under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which should entail the elimination of the export refunds granted to the sector in the past and the reconversion of the amounts allocated to this into internal measures compatible with the multilateral framework. In addition, it is necessary to step up information and promotion measures on fruit and vegetable products in third countries in the context of Council Regulation (EC) No 2702/1999 of 14 December 1999 on measures to provide information on, and to promote, agricul- tural products in third countries ( 1 ).

Regulation as last amended by Reg- ulation (EC) No 2060/2004 (OJ L 357, 2.12.2004, p. 3). Amendment 18 RECITAL 25 (25) Monitoring the volume in trade in agricultural products with third countries may, in respect of certain products, require the introduction of licensing systems for imports and exports including the lodging of a security to ensure that the transac- tions for which such licences are issued are actually carried out. The Commission should, therefore, be empowered to introduce licensing systems in respect of such products.

The Commission should, therefore, be empowered to introduce licensing systems in respect of such products. In order to pro- tect consumer health and prevent the pollution of crops by alien harmful organisms, it is necessary to complement the certification systems with new provisions, different from those of the present Regulation, with a view to strengthening the plant health control and quality systems at the borders. In this connection, it would be desirable to create a European quality control agency for fruit and vegetable products from third countries, under the supervision of the European Food Safety Agency. Amendment 19 RECITAL 28A (new) (28a) The process of coordinating, at Community level, the negotiation of plant health protocols with third countries for the export of fruit and vegetables should be supported.

        "Amendment 21 RECITAL 30 (30) Since the common markets in agricultural products are continuously evolving , the Member States and the Commission should keep each other informed of relevant developments. (30) The dynamism of the fruit and vegetable sector, sub- ject to structural changes in production or commerce that alter the operation of markets, requires that the Member States and the Commission should keep each other informed of the most relevant developments ascertained. It would also be appropri- ate to establish a price observatory capable of providing detailed and objective information on markets and thus facil- itate the triggering of action by the Commission in the event of serious crises. In addition, progress should be made in creating a European authority to ensure the transparency of commercial transactions and strict compliance with the rules on competition, in particular by large-scale retailers . Amendment 22 RECITAL 31 (31) The fruit and vegetables regime provides for certain obligations to be respected. To guarantee compliance with these obligations, there is a need for controls and the applica- tion of penalties in case of non-compliance with such obliga- tions. The power should, therefore, be conferred on the Com- mission to set up the corresponding rules including those con- cerning the recovery of undue payments and on the reporting obligations of the Member States. The special corps of inspec- tors in the fruit and vegetable sector will no longer be necess- ary under the new regime and may be abolished.

Emphasises that two thirds of the Member States have already ratified the Constitutional Treaty and that four others have clearly expressed their commitment to the provisions it contains, as demonstrated by the recent meeting held in Madrid at the initiative of the governments of Spain and Luxembourg; 3. Notes the concerns expressed by the people of France and of the Netherlands and the debate which has taken place in both of those countries; 4.

Recalls the political responsibility of those Member States who have signed but not ratified the Con- stitutional Treaty; 6. Reaffirms its commitment to achieving a settlement of the ongoing constitutional process of the European Union that is based on the content of the Constitutional Treaty, possibly under a different pre- sentation, but takes into account the difficulties that have arisen in some Member States; 7. Supports, in light of this, the efforts of the German Presidency to obtain from the European Council of June 2007 a commitment to calling an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), and the definition of a roadmap containing a procedure, a clear mandate and the objective of reaching an agreement before the end of this year; 8. Recalls the need to guarantee the decision-making capacity of the European Union, the effectiveness of its policies, and their full democratic legitimacy, towards which the Constitutional Treaty makes undeniable progress in terms of scrutiny, legislative and budgetary procedures, as well as the need to strengthen the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the role of the European Union in the world in order to allow it to influence the definition and the implementation of the responses to the pressing challenges which humanity is facing; 9. Insists on the preservation of all basic principles as contained in Part I of the Constitutional Treaty, including the dual nature of the European Union as a union of States and of citizens, the primacy of the European law, the new typology of acts and procedures, the hierarchy of norms, and the legal personality of the European Union;stresses that the Constitutional Treaty also brings about other important improvements in matters such as consolidation of the existing Treaties and the merging of pillars, the express recognition of the values on which the European Union is based and of the legally binding force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as well as enhancing the participation of citizens in the political life of the European Union, clarification of the respective competencies of the European Union and of the Member States, respect for the principle of subsidiarity and the specific role of national parliaments in this matter, without jeopardising the institutional balance of the European Union, as enshrined in the protocol on subsidiarity, and respect for the role of regional and local authorities; 10. Stresses that any proposal for modification of the Constitutional Treaty needs to secure the same level of support as was obtained at an earlier date by the provision it seeks to replace; 11. States that it will reject any outcome of the negotiations which, if compared with the Constitutional Treaty, would lead to a diminution of the protection of the rights of citizens (insists, in particular, on maintaining the Charter of Fundamental Rights, especially its legally binding force) as well as to less democ- racy, transparency and efficiency in the functioning of the Union; C 125 E/218 EN 22.5.2008 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 June 2007 ",

Recognises, in this context, the need to take into account major issues that have been raised during the reflection period and the insight that the abovementioned issues can be properly addressed only by a stronger rather than a weaker Europe, and to clarify other issues that have already been addressed in the Constitutional Treaty, such as: \u2014 sustainable development, in particular the struggle against climate change, \u2014 European solidarity in the field of energy, \u2014 a coherent migration policy, \u2014 the European Social Model in the context of demographic change and globalisation, \u2014 terrorism, \u2014 the dialogue between civilisations, \u2014 effective common mechanisms for the coordination of economic policies in the euro-zone, while safe- guarding the role of the European Central Bank in monetary policy in accordance with the Treaties, \u2014 the Union's criteria and procedures for enlargement; 13. Believes that, in view of the success of the Convention method in preparing the draft Treaty, it is necessary to retain, in any solution to the constitutional process, the basic principles of parliamentary participation, association of civil society and full transparency; 14. Recalls that Parliament, as the only institution of the European Union directly elected by the citizens, must be fully involved in the IGC at all levels, and to a greater extent than during the 2003-2004 IGC; 15. Calls, furthermore, for the setting up, in parallel with the active participation of the representatives of the European Parliament in the IGC, of an interinstitutional conference, in order to keep the European Parliament informed and to bring an important contribution to building a cross-party and transnational consensus in the IGC; 16. Reiterates its commitment to the Convention mechanism should the Heads of State or Government decide to embark on a substantial revision of the existing texts; 17. Calls on the Commission to fully play its role in the upcoming negotiations and to prepare proposals for adapting the Constitutional Treaty with respect to the topics set out in paragraph 12; 18. Emphasises the importance of dialogue between national parliaments and their respective govern- ments through the IGC and expresses its willingness to maintain close contact with the national parliaments during the forthcoming negotiation phase, as well as with the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, with the European Social Partners, with religious communities and with civil society; 19. Calls for the conclusion of the ratification process of the new Treaty by the end of 2008, in order to allow the next Parliament, which will be elected in 2009, to start its mandate under the provisions of the new Treaty; 20. Demands that all Member States coordinate their ratification procedures, in order to allow for the ratification process to be completed simultaneously; 22.5.2008 EN C 125 E/219 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 June 2007 ",

Takes note of the results of the first year of the UNHRC's work; welcomes the ambitious programme the UNHRC set itself, which included the review of its procedures and working methods, in particular the development and implementation of the UPR and the review of Special Procedures; 2. Welcomes the organisation of special sessions to respond to urgent crises; is concerned, however, at the failure of the UNHRC to take action to address many of the world's most urgent human rights situations; 3. Regrets in particular the weakness of the UNHRC resolution on Darfur, as well as the decision taken under the confidential procedure to discontinue consideration of complaints of human rights abuses by Iran and Uzbekistan under the \u2018 1503 \u2019 procedure; notes that the confidentiality of the \u2018 1503 \u2019 procedure has not triggered delivery of the expected results in terms of better cooperation from the authorities concerned; asks for the introduction of more transparent procedures; 4. Welcomes the signing of the Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappear- ance, just one year after its adoption by the UN General Assembly; calls on all UN States to ratify the convention and reaffirms its strong support for the signature and ratification campaign; 5. Notes the results of the UN General Assembly election on 17 May 2007 of 14 new members of the UNHRC; 6. Welcomes, in view of the condemnation of Belarus four months earlier by the UN General Assembly for human rights abuses and its lack of cooperation with Special Procedures, the fact that Belarus has not been elected to the UNHRC; 7. Calls for competitive elections to be held in all regions in order to provide real choice among UN Member States; regrets that some countries with problematic human rights records have been elected, owing to slates having been wiped clean; 8. Reaffirms the need for UNHRC members to comply with their obligation to cooperate fully with Special Procedures so as to highlight their role in preserving the universality of human rights; 9. Encourages the EU to continue to press for the establishment of membership criteria for election to the UNHRC, as well as for monitoring of the actual implementation of the UN Member States' election pledges; 22.5.2008 EN C 125 E/221 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 June 2007 ",

Stresses that the credibility and effectiveness of the UNHRC in the protection of human rights rests on cooperation with Special Procedures and their full implementation, as well as on the adoption of reforms and mechanisms in such a way as to strengthen its ability to address human rights violations around the world; The review of procedures and mechanisms 11. Regards the UPR mechanism as a potential means of improving the universality of the monitoring of human rights commitments and practices throughout the world by subjecting all UN Member States to equal treatment and scrutiny; 12. Stresses that this objective can be achieved only if the review involves independent expertise at all stages of the review process and an effective, result-oriented follow-up mechanism; expresses its deep con- cern at the current trend with regard to this issue; 13. Calls, therefore, on all UN Member States to ensure that the review is based on objective and reliable information, as well as on common standards for review such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other obligations and commitments, including election pledges; 14. Calls for the inclusion in the review process of provisions for follow-up, requiring reviewed States to report back to the UNHRC on the implementation of the recommendations; 15. Underlines the importance of the transparency of the process to all participants and stakeholders, as well as of effective participation by NGOs throughout this process; 16. Stresses that Special Procedures are at the core of the UN human rights machinery, playing a critical role in the protection and promotion of human rights; 17. Consequently, urges all UN Member States to preserve the independence of these Special Procedures from political influence by governments and to ensure that the recommendations resulting from their interventions, and from the findings made in the course of such interventions, are maintained as an essential element in the quality of the expertise; 18. Is greatly concerned in this connection by the draft Code of Conduct on Special Procedures pre- sented on behalf of the African Group, which considerably weakens the mechanisms and their protective capacity; 19. Underlines that, should a Code of Conduct be adopted, it should be limited to professional ethics and principles of mandate holders and should specify the obligations of States to cooperate with the Special Procedures, namely by respecting their independence and facilitating their work; 20. Calls for continuous support for Special Procedures in terms of finance and staff; 21. Stresses that the review of mandates of Special Procedures should be carried out in consultation with various mandate holders in order to avoid weakening the protective capacity of the system of procedures; stresses in particular that the UPR, together with special sessions, should be an additional mechanism for addressing human rights abuses and should not replace Special Procedures with country mandates; 22. Notes that the agenda of the UNHRC should combine predictability and flexibility in order to address emerging human rights crises; EU involvement 23. Recognises the active involvement of the EU and its Member States in the first year of work of the UNHRC and looks forward to a successful Presidency of the UNHRC by Romania; C 125 E/222 EN 22.5.2008 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 June 2007 ",

Calls on the EU to reaffirm and consolidate its firm position regarding the concerns raised above, especially regarding the UPR and the review of Special Procedures, which are crucial for the effective future functioning of the UNHRC; calls on the EU to reject any compromise that would put at risk the capacity of the UNHRC fully to play its role of protecting and promoting human rights throughout the world; 25. Once again calls on the EU to make more effective use of its aid and political support for third countries, so as to give them an incentive to cooperate with the UNHRC; 26. Considers that the EU Member States should act coherently and in a coordinated way in order to contribute to the success of the UNHRC; 27. Looks forward to receiving the studies commissioned by the Subcommittee on Human Rights con- cerning the human rights records of the members of the UNHRC and the effectiveness of the role played by the EU Member States in the UNHRC; 28. Calls on the countries which have entered into agreements with the EU that include human rights clauses to cooperate with the EU in increasing the UNHRC's potential to enhance human rights around the world; calls on the European Parliament's interparliamentary delegations and assemblies to examine this aspect at their meetings; 29.

Moreover, calls on the Member States to give particular attention to the recognition at Community level of diplomas and other qualifications issued by all European conservatoires, arts academies and other official schools for the performing arts enabling their holders to work and study in all Member States, in accordance with the Bologna Process; in this connection urges the Member States to promote formal arts studies providing high-quality personal and vocational training enabling students to develop their artistic talents and at the same time a good general education opening up prospects in other professional fields; stresses also the importance of proposing measures at European level to facilitate the recognition in the European Union of diplomas and other qualifications issued by national conservatoires and arts academies in third countries so as to facilitate the mobility of artists seeking to enter a Member State; 16. Calls on the Commission to adopt a European charter concerning artistic creation and the conditions for engaging therein, on the basis of an initiative such as that adopted by Unesco, so as to reaffirm the importance of professional artistic activity and facilitate European integration; 17. Calls on the Member States to eliminate all types of restriction regarding access to the employment market for artists from the new Member States; 18. Calls on the Member States, which have not already done so, to organise effectively, in accordance with Directive 2006/115/EC and Directive 2001/29/EC, the payment of all equitable compensation in respect of reproduction rights and equitable remuneration owing to holders of copyrights and associated rights; 19. Urges the Commission to carry out a survey analysing measures by the Member States to effectively ensure that holders of copyrights and associated rights receive equitable compensation owing for the legal exceptions applied by the Member States in accordance with Directive 2001/29/EC and for the legal exploi- tation of their rights under Directive 2006/115/EC; 20. Urges the Commission to carry out a survey analysing measures by the Member States to earmark some of the revenue generated by the payment of equitable compensation owing to the holders of copy- rights and associated rights as aid towards creative activity and the social and financial protection of artists and to analyse the legal instruments and tools which could be used to provide funding for the protection of living European artists; 21. Believes that it would be appropriate for Member States to consider possibly providing artists with assistance over and above what they currently receive, providing for a levy on the commercial exploitation of original works and their performance free of copyright; Visas: mobility and employment of third-country nationals 22. Stresses the need to take account of the difficulties currently being encountered by a number of European and third-country artists as a result of visa requirements with a view to obtaining work permits and the attendant uncertainties; 23. Points out that artists with short-term employment contracts currently find it difficult to fulfil the conditions for obtaining visas and work permits; 24. Calls on the Commission to reflect on current visa and work permit arrangements applicable to artists and to begin drawing up Community rules in this area which could lead to the introduction of a specific temporary visa for European and third-country artists, such as that which already exists in some Member States; Lifelong training and retraining 25.

Observes, in this respect, that time spent by artists on rehearsals is to all intents and purposes effective working time and that it is essential to take into consideration all such periods of activity in establishing their career histories both during periods of unemployment and for pension purposes; 29.

        "P6_TA(2007)0237 Estimates of the European Parliament for 2008 European Parliament resolution of 7 June 2007 on Parliament's estimates of revenue and expendi- ture for the financial year 2008 (2007/2018(BUD)) The European Parliament , \u2014 having regard to Article 272(2) of the EC Treaty, \u2014 having regard to Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities ( 1 ), and in particular Article 31 thereof, \u2014 having regard to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management ( 2 ), \u2014 having regard to its resolution of 29 March 2007 on the guidelines for the 2008 budget procedure \u2014 Sections II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX \u2014 and on the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates (Section I) for the 2008 budget procedure ( 3 ), \u2014 having regard to the Secretary-General's report to the Bureau on drawing up Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for the financial year 2008, \u2014 having regard to the preliminary draft estimates drawn up by the Bureau on 28 March 2007 pursuant to Rules 22(6) and 73 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure, \u2014 having regard to Rule 73 of its Rules of Procedure, \u2014 having regard to the report of the Committee on Budgets (A6-0202/2007), A. whereas the rate of increase of heading 5 (administrative costs) of the multiannual framework for 2008 is 4,8 %, a figure higher than the inflation rate of 2 %, B. whereas the 2008 budget should be aimed at the budgetary level of 2007, increased by the inflation rate of 2 %, unless there are specific grounds to the contrary, C. whereas 2008 is the last full year before the next elections to the European Parliament, D. whereas the political priorities for 2008 are the provision of efficient services to Members to enable better law-making, enhancement of the effectiveness of the communication tools of the European Par- liament and its political groups and improvement of the budget allocation, E. whereas the estimated costs of a number of new projects adopted by the Bureau on 28 March 2007 will remain unknown until the presentation of the amending letter in September; Financial aspects 1. Recalls that the 2008 budget should be a \u2018 budget for the EU tax-payer \u2019 , aimed at responsible budgetary behaviour on the part of all actors involved in the process, with decisions on financial resources based on solid reasoning; ( 1 ) OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1. Regulation as amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1995/2006 (OJ L 390, 13.12.2006, p. 1). ( 2 ) OJ C 139, 14.6.2006, p. 1.

        "2. Recalls that the recommendation for 2008 as adopted in its abovementioned resolution of 29 March 2007 is, on the one hand, to set the budget at the level which allows the most effective work to be provided by the institution within a rational level of financial resources, on the basis of justified and real budgetary needs, and, on the other hand, to limit the increase in the European Parliament's budget to the adjustment of current prices; 3. In this connection, highlights that the process of purchasing the European Parliament's premises in its three places of work should, in the long term, lead to substantial savings for the EU tax-payer; is ready to consider using the necessary part of the margin between the inflation rate and the rate of increase provided for in the multiannual framework, depending on the financial needs arising from the specific situation of ownership of Parliament's premises; 4. Recalls that in its abovementioned guidelines resolution, it was agreed that all budgetary requests should be based on justified needs; notes that the budgetary authority has not been provided with suffi- ciently detailed and precise information on all budgetary allocations; points out that the preliminary draft estimates give an amount of EUR 55 000 000 in Chapter 10 6 ( \u2018 Reserve for priority projects under development \u2019 ) and EUR 10 300 000 for the pre-election campaign without providing any detailed justification for those amounts; recalls that the guidelines emphasised that unless there is justification based on real needs, Parlia- ment's budget for 2008 should be set at the level of 2007 taking into consideration adjustments to current prices, ensuring in the process that the effective operation of the institution is not impaired; reiterates that the 20 % level of Heading 5 should constitute the upper limit of the budget; is disappointed that the Bureau set the level of the budget at EUR 1 491 400 000 which represents the full 20 % of Heading 5; 5. Emphasises the fact that the 2008 draft estimates include an increase of 6,7 % over the 2007 budget despite savings made from ceasing to translate the verbatim reports of proceedings (EUR 9 000 000) and the transfer of the management of costs related to termination-of-service allowances to the Commission; 6. Will examine in detail the proposals for the projects provided for under Chapter 10 6 ( \u2018 Reserve for priority projects under development \u2019 ); insists that the information explaining them be communicated in due time to its relevant committee; prefers, at this stage, to leave a token entry ( \u2018 pm \u2019 ) in Chapter 10 4 ( \u2018 Reserve for information and communication policy \u2019 ) and Chapter 10 6 ( \u2018 Reserve for priority projects under development \u2019 ) , which will set the budget at EUR 1 436 400 000, representing an increase of 2,8 % over the 2007 budget; is will- ing to decide on the amount to be allocated to these projects once the concrete information is presented; 7. Is concerned by the high level of mopping-up transfers in the last few years which shot up to EUR 124 144 556 in 2005 and EUR 105 871 425 in 2006; recalls the fact that the numerous transfer requests made throughout the year change the allocation decided by the budgetary authority; invites the administration to estimate appropriations more accurately; 8. Notes that in 2008 the Belgian State will reimburse to the European Parliament an advance payment of EUR 22 700 000 made when the decision on the construction of the current premises in Brussels was taken; notes, moreover, that this appropriation will be placed in assigned revenue and will be used only to finance expenditure on buildings; Information policy 9. Takes note of the proposals to allocate an overall budget of EUR 41 800 000 to information policy, which will include EUR 10 300 000 for an awareness campaign in view of the 2009 European elections, EUR 9 000 000 for implementation of the Parliamentary Television Channel (WebTV), EUR 15 700 000 for the Audiovisual Centre and EUR 6 800 000 to complete the construction of the Visitors' Centre; 10. Welcomes the initiative taken by the Bureau to propose an information campaign relating to the next European elections; deplores, however, the fact that the actions proposed in the context of this campaign will not be defined before the end of 2007; requests the administration to present a proposal before the first reading of the budget and insists on the inclusion of relevant proposals supporting direct communication with citizens; has decided, pending the submission of more detailed information on the utilisation of these funds, to place the amount of EUR 10 300 000 entered for election purposes in Chapter 10 0 ( \u2018 Provisional Appropriation \u2019 ) and to reduce the corresponding budget lines accordingly; C 125 E/230 EN 22.5.2008 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 June 2007 ",
        "11. Considers that the development of a specific programme, similar to that for Visitors' groups, which focuses on small and local media would be of interest to Members as one of the most efficient means of raising Union citizens' awareness of the European Parliament's activities; invites the Quaestors to examine the feasibility of providing each Member with proper means for inviting local journalists to come to the European Parliament; 12. Notes that the WebTV project is being substantially delayed to the autumn 2007; emphasises that the appropriations allocated and entered in Chapter 10 4 ( \u2018 Reserve for information \u2019 ) in the 2007 budget will not be used as initially anticipated; considers that this amount may be carried forward to 2008, subject to final approval of the prototype, and consequently could cover the needs of the year; therefore considers that the EUR 9 000 000 requested for 2008 should be placed in Chapter 10 1 ( \u2018 Contingency reserve \u2019 ) pending a more precise estimation of the cost of the project if approved, and further information as to the capacity of absorption of such an amount; 13. Acknowledges that the budget allocations requested for completing the construction of the Visitors' Centre and the Audiovisual Centre are in line with initial estimates; emphasises the fact that their imple- mentation is highly dependent on the delivery dates of the D4 and D5 buildings, which may be slightly delayed, according to the information given by the Secretary General to the Bureau on 12 March 2007; asks the administration, therefore, to keep its relevant committee informed in order to allow it to make the necessary adjustments in the 2008 budget; Multilingualism 14. Is willing to consider a proposal for restructuring the interpretation service, while insisting that the administration enforce more actively the code of conduct on multilingualism, in order to ensure suitable and efficient linguistic support for Members above all at official meetings of Parliament bodies and prevent any shortcomings, irresponsible use or misuse of this service; is willing to consider within this framework the possible extension of this service to more personal linguistic assistance; recalls that all Members should be treated fairly, irrespective of their native language; 15. Points out that any recommendation for the interpretation service should take account of the report of the Court of Auditors and be based on a comprehensive quality control system including qualitative indicators; 16. Is highly concerned by the fact that translations of documents are frequently not available in all languages for debates in committees, a situation which has a negative impact on the committees' proceed- ings and leads to an inefficient use of available resources (in particular given the multiplication of extra- ordinary meetings); insists that it is vital to take the necessary measures to have an efficient translation system in order to ensure the equal treatment of all Members and the orderly development of parliamentary business; urges the administration to make all the necessary efforts to provide the appropriate means and ensure an adequate organisation of the translation service in order to prevent any shortcomings and the consequent increase of costs, in particular when deadlines for decisions are fixed in the Treaty; Buildings 17. Is surprised by the substantial increase in Item 2000 ( \u2018 Rent \u2019 ) of EUR 5 131 200, which absorbs half of the savings resulting from the purchase of the Strasbourg buildings; understands that the increase of 19,85 % is based on developments in the real estate market and the need to rent an additional building in Luxembourg during the work on the extension of the KAD building; recommends that the administration bear these factors in mind before proposing further purchases of external offices that cannot be considered a priority with regard to the three places of work; 18. Takes note of the delay in the construction of the extension of the KAD building, mainly due to the decision of the Luxembourg State to abandon the creation of a shopping area; acknowledges that this decision will ease the management of the building in particular in terms of security; regrets, however, that 22.5.2008 EN C 125 E/231 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 June 2007 ",
        "construction work cannot start on time, which will postpone the occupancy of the extension to the end of 2012 and necessitate a longer rental of the temporary buildings; asks, therefore, to be kept informed of further developments with this project; 19. Points out that Item 2007 ( \u2018 Fitting out premises \u2019 ) has increased by 72,24 % compared to the 2007 budget to an amount of EUR 30 008 000; decides to put the amount of EUR 3 000 000 foreseen for the Sports Centre under sub-item 2007/03 ( \u2018 Fitting-out, Brussels \u2019 ) in reserve until Parliament's competent bodies have taken a final decision on the project and its financing; awaits the report on building needs and main- tenance costs scheduled for 30 April 2007; 20. Is strongly of the view that a global approach must be taken when deciding on renting, purchasing or fitting-out buildings; considers that every decision concerning buildings policy must take into account the longer-term financial consequences; will assess the information provided on the overall costs of its buildings policy before allocating the appropriations requested; asks the administration to provide detailed informa- tion on the fitting-out works, especially those foreseen in Brussels and the newly acquired buildings in Strasbourg; Informatics 21. Notes that the increase in IT expenditure over the last four years has reached 28 %; considers that the current strategy was useful in modernising the European Parliament's IT systems, enhancing the services provided to users and developing a new internet website; stresses, nevertheless, that it has multiplied the number of projects to 477 and has left some key functions in the hands of external staff; emphasises that, given that the administration must justify its financial requests, the Directorate on Information Technologies (DIT) should make proposals to rationalise its costs in the context of the amending letter; 22. Notes that the estimate for telecommunications charges is approximately the same as the estimate for 2005, whereas the actual costs have been falling annually since 2004 owing to the use of new technologies and general price reductions in the sector, and in 2006 were EUR 2 100 000 below the estimates; calls on the Secretary-General to report to the Committee on Budgets on the use of current VOIP technologies to reduce telephone costs; Staff 23. Acknowledges the fact that the Bureau's request for new posts extends, at this stage, to 16 posts (7 AST3 and 9 AD5); regrets that only 10 posts are proposed from the redeployment exercise; calls on the administration to provide detailed information on the impact in terms of post reductions and redeploy- ment due to the implementation of the new streamline software and on other short and medium-term strategies regarding redeployment possibilities as mentioned in the guidelines; considers an annual target of 1 % as a minimum; confirms its willingness to receive a global overview and justification of the requests before taking its final decision; proposes, consequently, to place the appropriations relating to the requested posts in reserve for the time being; 24. Recalls the request to meet the full level of recruitment of staff from the EU-10 as well as Romania and Bulgaria; considers this an important element for the provision of effective support to Members, espe- cially for linguistic services; while recognising this as the primary goal, requests the administration to pre- sent the appropriate measures for the long-term sustainability of these services; 25. Emphasises that a number of uncertainties still remain regarding staffing needs following recent Bureau decisions, for example the impact of the new Codex on the activity of the medical centre; reminds the administration that it should provide by March and September of each year an updated report on the recruitment situation related to enlargement and expects to receive detailed information to justify any new requests by the first reading; 26. Takes note of the proposals concerning the upgrading of permanent and temporary posts, the con- version of posts and possible ad personam promotions in the European Parliament's Secretariat; decides to defer them until the first reading and place the related appropriations in reserve; C 125 E/232 EN 22.5.2008 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 June 2007 ",
        "27. Notes that the proposals concerning the upgrading of staff from the political groups will be commu- nicated at a later date; is willing to consider them in the first reading; 28. Considers that efforts can be made to limit the number of staff missions to Strasbourg and, where possible, to make better use of new technologies such as video conferencing; decides to limit the appropria- tion allocated to Article 300 ( \u2018 Staff mission allowances \u2019 ) to the level of the 2007 budget and to enter the increase of EUR 1 490 000, requested for 2008, in Chapter 10 0 ( \u2018 Provisional appropriation \u2019 ); Miscellaneous 29. Reiterates that the rapid implementation of the new badge system will greatly improve security in the buildings; is surprised by the increase in Item 214 ( \u2018 Technical equipment and installations \u2019 ) and in particular by the increase in its sub-item on security of 36,8 % compared to last year's budget due to a substantial increase in the maintenance costs of the security infrastructure and to certain investments, such as the new radio system; insists on the fact that the security of the European Parliament's premises, its Members and staff, is an important issue that nevertheless calls for a prudent approach as regards its possible financial impact; invites the administration to re-examine its request bearing in mind the points expressed above and to present a new proposal by the time of the amending letter; decides, consequently, to enter EUR 2 000 000, allocated to new projects, in Chapter 10 0 ( \u2018 Provisional appropriation \u2019 ) ; 30. Reminds the Secretary-General that, in its resolutions of 1 June 2006 on Parliament's estimates and of 26 October 2006 on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007 \u2014 Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII ( 1 ), it was requested that by 15 December 2006 the administration should embark on an information strategy to address the issue that Members are often not fully aware of the available support services and that until now no proposal has been presented to its relevant committee; 31. Requests the administration to update its estimates on the appropriations needed in relation to EMAS; 32. Notes the proposed modifications of the nomenclature; recalls that a report on the financing of expenditure relating to delegations and Assemblies is awaited; decides at this stage not to agree to the changes in the nomenclature in Article 214 ( \u2018 Technical equipment and installations \u2019 ) and in Items 3244 ( \u2018 Orga- nisation and reception of groups of visitors, Euroscola programme and invitations to opinion multipliers from third countries \u2019 ), 3245 ( \u2018 Organisation of seminars, symposia and cultural activities \u2019 ), 3246 ( \u2018 Parliamentary television chan- nel \u2019 ), 3249 ( \u2018 Information exchanges with national parliaments \u2019 ) and the proposed new Item 3047 ( \u2018 Miscellaneous expenditure on the organisation of Eurolat Parliamentary Assembly meetings \u2019 ); 33. Is convinced of the need to reinforce the relationship between Members of the European Parliament and Members of EU national parliaments and democratically elected national parliaments of third countries; is willing to support the programme for information exchanges with national parliaments (Item 3249) once it has received further detailed information; * * * 34. Adopts the estimates for the financial year 2008; 35. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the Kingdom of Belgium.
