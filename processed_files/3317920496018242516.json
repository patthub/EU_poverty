        "I (Resolutions, recommendations and opinions) RECOMMENDATIONS COUNCIL COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION of 12 March 2021 on Roma equality, inclusion and participation (2021/C 93/01) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 292, in conjunction with Article 19(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, Whereas: (1) Council Directive 2000/43/EC ( 1 ) lays down a framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin throughout the Union in relation to employment, education, social protection, including social security and healthcare, social advantages and access to and the supply of goods and services, including housing. One purpose of this Recommendation is to contribute to the effective implementation of that Directive, without prejudice to the competences of the Member States. (2) Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA ( 2 ) obliges Member States to criminalise public incitement to violence or hatred on the grounds of race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin and to ensure that racist and xenophobic motivation is considered an aggravating circumstance or, alternatively, that it may be taken into consideration by national courts in the determination of the penalties. This Recommendation is designed to strengthen the measures taken against hate speech, hate crime and violence directed against Roma people. In line with Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ), this Recommendation also aims to promote support to Roma victims of such crimes. (3) The European Pillar of Social Rights expresses principles and rights which aim to support and increase social fairness, irrespective of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Universal measures complemented by targeted measures to protect and support groups at high risk of discrimination or social exclusion such as those set out in this Recommendation are key for the implementation of the Social Pillar ( 1 ) Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22). ( 2 ) Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of 28 November 2008 on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law (OJ L 328, 6.12.2008, p. 55). ( 3 ) Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 57). EN Official Journal of the European Union 19.3.2021 C 93/1 ",
        "principles. Delivering on the Pillar is a shared political commitment and responsibility. It should be implemented both at Union and at Member State level in line with the respective competences, taking due account of different socio-economic environments and the diversity of national systems, including the role of the social partners, while fully respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. (4) This Recommendation also contributes to the sustained development of equal and inclusive democratic societies in line with the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals. (5) The Commission has submitted proposals to the European Parliament and the Council for the Common Provisions Regulation for 2021-2027, the European Social Fund Plus for 2021-2027 (\u2018ESF+ for 2021-2027\u2019), and the European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund for 2021-2027. Those proposals refer to equality and non-discrimination as horizontal principles that should be adhered to in the implementation of those Funds. The proposal for the ESF+ for 2021-2027 specifically calls on Member States and the Commission to ensure equality and non-discrimination in the implementation of Union programmes and refers to the promotion of the socio- economic integration of third country nationals and the inclusion of marginalised communities such as the Roma, which is linked to the enabling condition of a national Roma strategic framework. Pending adoption of those proposals, this Recommendation contributes to their effective future implementation. (6) The Commission Communication of 3 March 2010, entitled \u2018Europe 2020: a strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\u2019 (the \u2018Europe 2020 strategy\u2019), has given significant impetus to the fight against poverty and social exclusion by setting common European targets to reduce poverty and social exclusion and raise school attainment and employment levels. Those targets cannot be achieved without improving equality, inclusion and participation of Roma, on which this Recommendation offers specific guidance. (7) The Commission Communication of 5 April 2011, entitled \u2018An EU framework for national Roma integration strategies up to 2020\u2019, which encourages Member States to comprehensively advance the social and economic inclusion of Roma and establishes goals in the fields of education, employment, healthcare and housing, was endorsed by the Council on 19 May 2011. Despite limitations in the initial design, the EU framework had an important added value on which the current Recommendation further builds, inter alia by integrating the lessons learned from the framework\u2019s implementation. (8) Council Recommendation of 9 December 2013 ( 4 ) was designed to step up national Roma integration measures. In it, the Council called on the Member States to inform the Commission annually of any measures taken in line with the Recommendation and any progress with implementing their national Roma integration strategies (NRIS). This Recommendation builds on that experience, and reviews and expands the measures to be taken. (9) In its conclusions of 8 December 2016 on \u2018Accelerating the Process of Roma Integration\u2019 the Council called on the Commission to carry out a mid-term evaluation of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies for 2020 (\u2018in-depth evaluation\u2019) and to propose, on that basis, a post-2020 initiative. While the in-depth evaluation undertaken acknowledges the added value of the framework, it notes that Roma people in Europe continue to face discrimination and social and economic exclusion. (10) The in-depth evaluation and the conclusions drawn from it by the Council, the European Parliament and several Europe-wide and national civil society organisations show the need for a renewed and stronger commitment to Roma equality and inclusion. That commitment should ensure a specific focus on non-discrimination, including by tackling antigypsyism \u2013 a specific form of racism against Roma people \u2013 and focusing on the four socioeconomic inclusion areas of education, employment, health and housing. It should also reflect the needs of specific groups ( 4 ) Council Recommendation of 9 December 2013 on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States (OJ C 378, 24.12.2013, p. 1). EN Official Journal of the European Union C 93/2 19.3.2021 ",
        "and the diversity of the Roma population; involve Roma in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Roma equality and inclusion strategies; improve target setting, data collection, monitoring and reporting; and make mainstream policies more sensitive to Roma equality and inclusion. When designing measures, special attention should be paid to the gender perspective. (11) This Recommendation also builds on various findings previously set out in the relevant European Parliament resolutions of 15 April 2015 and 12 February 2019, in the Council conclusions of 8 December 2016 and in the Commission\u2019s annual reports since 2013. (12) Following the \u2018EU framework for national Roma integration strategies up to 2020\u2019, on 7 October 2020 the Commission adopted a package comprising the proposal for this Recommendation and the Communication \u2018A Union of Equality: EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation\u2019 (\u2018the Communication of 7 October 2020\u2019). The Communication of 7 October 2020 sets EU-level objectives and, where relevant, targets and minimum commitments for all Member States, possibly complemented by additional national efforts and Union support depending on the national context and size of the Roma population. Recent data show that six out of ten Europeans still believe that discrimination against Roma people is widespread in their country, while more than six out of ten Europeans agree that society could benefit if the Roma were integrated better ( 5 ). The overarching objective of this Recommendation is to help promote equality and combat the exclusion of Roma, with their active involvement. (13) During the COVID-19 pandemic, excluded and disadvantaged Roma communities have been exposed to severe negative health and socioeconomic impacts, which risks further aggravating existing inequalities and the risk of poverty and social exclusion. This Recommendation advocates reducing structural inequalities faced by Roma by tackling, where relevant, limited access by Roma to clean water, sanitary infrastructure and healthcare services, including vaccination services, and the lack of facilities and digital skills that would enable Roma to actively participate in society, including in distance education, as well as by eliminating the high levels of economic precariousness, overcrowded households, segregated settlements or camps. (14) In the context of rising populism and racism within the Union ( 6 ), there is a need to focus on combating and preventing discrimination, including by tackling antigypsyism, which is a root cause of and exacerbates discrimination and exclusion. The EU anti-racism action plan 2020-2025 of 18 September 2020 therefore sets out a range of concrete actions to combat racism. Antigypsyism is an unusually prevalent ( 7 ) form of racism, which has its origins in how mainstream society views and treats those considered as \u2018gypsies\u2019 in a process of historical \u2018othering\u2019 ( 8 ), which builds on stereotypes and negative attitudes that may sometimes be unintentional or unconscious ( 9 ). Since 2005, the European Parliament has been using the term antigypsyism in its reports and resolutions of 28 April 2005, 15 April 2015, 25 October 2017 and 12 February 2019. Several international and civil society organisations have recognised the phenomenon, also known as anti-Roma racism, romaphobia and antiziganism. In its conclusions of 8 December 2016, the Council acknowledged the need to \u2018fight all forms of racism against Roma, ( 5 ) Special Eurobarometer 493. Discrimination in the EU (first results released in September 2019). ( 6 ) Widespread racism continues to plague Europe.

        "sometimes referred to as anti-Gypsyism, as it is a root cause of their social exclusion and discrimination\u2019. On 8 October 2020, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopted a non-legally binding definition ( 10 ) of antigypsyism/anti-Roma discrimination. (15) When targeting the Roma population, it is important to acknowledge the specific needs or vulnerabilities of certain groups ( 11 ), including Roma women, young Roma, Roma children, LGBTI Roma, elderly Roma, Roma persons with disabilities, those who are third country nationals or stateless, and EU mobile Roma. This Recommendation therefore takes account of the importance of addressing multiple discrimination ( 12 ). It proposes measures to better protect and include Roma children, who are particularly exposed to discrimination and segregation. In line with the Council conclusions of 8 December 2016, it also looks at creating opportunities and using the untapped potential of young Roma people by increasing their active participation in programmes and measures targeting the young such as those referred to in the Commission Communication of 1 July 2020, entitled \u2018Youth Employment Support: a Bridge to Jobs for the Next Generation\u2019. (16) Acknowledging the diversity that exists among Roma, the term \u2018Roma\u2019 is used as an umbrella term to refer to a number of different groups of Romani origin such as Roma, Sinti, Kale, Gypsies, Romanichels and Boyash/Rudari. It also encompasses groups such as Ashkali, Egyptians, Eastern groups (including Dom, Lom, Rom, and Abdal), as well as traveller populations, including ethnic Travellers, Yenish or those designated under the administrative term \u2018Gens du voyage\u2019, and people who identify themselves as Gypsies, Tsiganes or Tziganes, without denying the specific characteristics of those groups. (17) In the context of intra-Union mobility, it is necessary to respect the right to free movement of the citizens of the Union and the conditions for its exercise. Those conditions include the possession of sufficient resources and a comprehensive sickness insurance cover, in accordance with Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and the Council ( 13 ). At the same time, it is necessary to seek to improve the living conditions of Roma and to pursue measures to promote their economic and social inclusion in their Member States of origin as well as in their Member States of residence. (18) While acknowledging that Member States should choose their own monitoring methods, including appropriate methods for data collection and taking into account the fact that collecting information related to ethnicity is a sensitive matter and not possible in certain Member States, this Recommendation highlights the importance of collecting data as necessary background for the design of measures that effectively improve the situation of the Roma population, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 14 ) and the 2018 Guidelines on improving the collection and use of equality data published by the subgroup on equality ( 10 ) https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antigypsyism-anti-roma- discrimination ( 11 ) Pertaining to various contexts, for example, concerning trafficking in human beings, whose victims are mainly Roma women and children. ( 12 ) The term \u2018multiple discrimination\u2019 is used as an overarching notion for all instances of discrimination on several grounds of discrimination and manifesting itself in two possible ways. These can take the form of \u2018additive discrimination\u2019, where discrimination takes place based on several grounds of discrimination operating separately, and that of \u2018intersectional discrimination\u2019, where two or more discrimination grounds operate and interact with each other in such a way that they are inseparable or inextricable.

The Communication of 7 October 2020 explains that Member States are able to choose indicators from a portfolio of indicators for measuring Roma equality, inclusion and participation, put together jointly by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, the Commission and the Member States. (19) This Recommendation explicitly focuses on measures to promote the equality, inclusion and participation of Roma without aiming to exclude other disadvantaged groups. Those measures should be based on the same principles in comparable situations. In this respect, the common basic principles for Roma inclusion remain relevant ( 16 ). Measures should also mainstream Roma equality, inclusion and participation in both Union and national policy initiatives, paying special attention to intersectionality and the gender dimension. The Communication of 7 October 2020 provides further guidelines on planning and implementing national Roma strategic frameworks. (20) One of the purposes of this Recommendation is to confirm a long-term commitment to the shared objectives on Roma equality, inclusion and participation and to provide renewed and strengthened guidance by setting out measures that Member States may adopt towards those objectives. (21) This Recommendation fully respects the principle of subsidiarity and Member States\u2019 primary responsibility in this area. It is without prejudice to principles of national procedural law and the legal traditions of the Member States. A common, but differentiated approach should be applied with due regard to national circumstances, such as the number and share of Roma people in the total population, the general economic context, the specific characteristics of the target populations within each Member State and the possibility to establish policies targeting a specific ethnic group. National approaches and relevant measures to promote Roma inclusion, equality and participation should be tailored and selected in accordance with the specific circumstances and needs on the ground, which include the need to address disadvantaged groups, such as Roma, in a broader context. Mainstream measures should be designed to ensure that Roma people are reached effectively. (22) A national Roma strategic framework refers to national Roma strategies and/or integrated sets of policy measures within a broader socio-economic context, which are relevant for Roma equality, inclusion and participation, HEREBY RECOMMENDS AS FOLLOWS: 1. Member States should adopt national Roma strategic frameworks within their broader social inclusion policies improving the situation of Roma, and communicate them to the European Commission, preferably by September 2021. In accordance with national and Union law, available resources and national circumstances, Member States should, as appropriate, consider the relevance to the national context of the measures set out in this Recommendation and implement them, in a proportionate and selective manner, in close cooperation with all relevant stakeholders. When assessing that relevance, Member States are encouraged to be guided by voluntary minimum commitments and, depending on the national context, by possible additional efforts, as provided for in the Communication.

        "Horizontal objectives: equality, inclusion and participation 2. Member States should consolidate efforts to adopt and implement measures to promote equality and effectively prevent and combat discrimination, antigypsyism, and social and economic exclusion, as well as their root causes. Those efforts should include measures such as the following: (a) measures to effectively fight direct and indirect discrimination, including by tackling harassment, antigypsyism, stereotyping, anti-Roma rhetoric, hate speech, hate crime and violence against Roma, including incitement thereto, both online and offline, in particular in the context of the transposition, implementation and enforcement of Directive 2000/43/EC, Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA and Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 17 ); (b) measures to develop and promote a comprehensive system of support for victims, in line with Directive 2012/29/EU, and to deliver assistance to Roma victims of hate crimes and discrimination; (c) measures to fight multiple and structural ( 18 ) discrimination against Roma and, in particular, against Roma women, young Roma, Roma children, LGBTI Roma, elderly Roma, Roma with disabilities, stateless Roma and EU mobile Roma ( 19 ); (d) measures to raise awareness of the fact that efforts to combat discriminatory practices are interwoven with efforts to tackle antigypsyism and social and economic exclusion, as part of a common drive to promote the broader objective of equality; (e) measures to analyse and acknowledge the existence of antigypsyism and discrimination against Roma and raise awareness of those phenomena, the forms they take and their harmful consequences, through the media, school curricula and by other means, and for example by raising awareness among civil servants and other stakeholders of the need to identify and tackle them; (f) measures to promote multi-cultural awareness-raising activities and campaigns in schools; (g) measures to promote awareness of Roma cultures, language and history, including the memory of the Roma Holocaust and reconciliation processes in society, inter alia through action providing relevant training for teachers and designing appropriate school curricula, since this awareness is vital for reducing prejudice and antigypsyism as important causes of discrimination; (h) measures to foster positive narratives about Roma and Roma role models, and a better understanding of the challenges that Roma face, including by means of support for inter-community encounters and inter-cultural learning. 3. Member States should combat the extremely high at-risk-of-poverty rate and material and social deprivation among the Roma population, in order to provide effective support for Roma equality, inclusion and participation. Where relevant, Member States should pursue an integrated approach which focuses on all relevant policy fields. Those efforts could be attained by means of measures such as the following: (a) measures to ensure adequate investment in human capital, infrastructure development and housing, as well as social cohesion policies, and to improve the targeting of such investment; (b) measures to ensure access to adequate social protection schemes, including both income support and in kind benefits and service provision, for disadvantaged Roma; ( 17 ) Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive) (OJ L 95, 15.4.2010, p. 1).

Member States should, as appropriate, step up meaningful participation by and consultation of Roma people, including women, children, young people, elderly people, and persons with disabilities, in order to provide effective support for Roma equality and non-discrimination. This should include measures such as the following: (a) measures to support active citizenship by promoting social, economic, political, cultural and civic participation, particularly for Roma women and young people; (b) measures to promote capacity building and leadership in Roma civil society to enable Roma people to participate in all stages of the policy cycle and public life in general; (c) measures to promote employment of Roma in public and private institutions in order to support diversity and expertise within the policy process and in order to provide role models; (d) measures to raise awareness of human rights and citizens\u2019 rights and responsibilities among the members of disadvantaged Roma communities; (e) measures to coordinate resources, networks and expertise across sectors to increase the involvement of young Roma people in decision-making processes and help amplify their leadership. Sectoral objectives Access to quality inclusive mainstream education 5. Member States should ensure that all Roma have effective equal access to and are able to participate in all forms and stages of education, from early childhood education and childcare to tertiary education, including second chance education, adult education, and lifelong learning. 6. Member States should improve equal access to quality and inclusive education of Roma pupils, including by means of measures such as the following: (a) measures to prevent and eliminate any form of segregation in education and to ensure that the potential of all pupils is supported; (b) measures to prevent and eliminate misdiagnosis leading to inappropriate placement of Roma pupils in special needs education and to ensure that the allocation of special needs education is based on a transparent and lawful procedure; (c) measures to provide effective methods for recognition and reparation of past injustices in the field of education, including segregation, the inappropriate placement of Roma pupils in special schools and unequal treatment; (d) measures to promote equity, inclusiveness and diversity in the education system and the classroom, for example, through professional development programmes, mentoring and peer learning activities; (e) measures to encourage effective parental involvement in the education of Roma pupils and foster links between the schools and local communities, including through mediators and teaching assistants; (f) measures to support the equal participation and active engagement of all pupils, including children with disabilities, in mainstream educational activities and processes; EN Official Journal of the European Union 19.3.2021 C 93/7 ",

Member States should work towards overcoming all discrimination, inequality and disadvantages in terms of educational opportunities, outcomes and attainment, including where relevant by means of measures such as the following: (a) measures to ensure access to quality early childhood education and care with special focus on early inclusion of Roma children, including disadvantaged Roma children; (b) measures to provide individualised support and mediation to compensate for linguistic, cognitive and educational gaps, in close cooperation with the families of Roma pupils, and encourage second chance and adult education; (c) measures to prevent early school leaving and drop out at all levels of education, including with a specific focus on Roma girls, ( 20 ) for example through cooperation between schools, mediators and social protection services; (d) measures to acknowledge the vulnerability of children of parents who have gone abroad and to provide priority access to after-school programmes and individualised support; (e) measures to increase Roma social mobility, for example through positive action, dedicated scholarships in vocational, secondary and higher education and in teacher training, and career guidance; (f) measures to ensure a smooth transition between educational levels and promote upper-secondary and tertiary education completion, including through career guidance, counselling, mentoring and financial support schemes; (g) measures to support participation in non-formal learning and extracurricular activities, including youth, sport and cultural activities within the framework of health and civic education, and other activities that enhance self- development, psychological resilience and well-being; (h) measures to promote, where relevant, the acquisition of digital skills, broadband access, adequate digital infrastructure and the provision of teaching material equipped for distance learning both in formal and non- formal educational settings, so as to prevent the digital exclusion of socioeconomically disadvantaged pupils, their teachers and parents, and ensure outreach to Roma pupils, including those living in rural or segregated areas. Access to quality and sustainable employment 8. Member States should promote effective equal access for Roma, in particular young Roma, to quality and sustainable employment, including, where relevant, by means of measures such as the following: (a) measures to reach out to young Roma ( 21 ) in order to raise their awareness of the available, preferably integrated, employment and social services, as well as to link them to those services; (b) measures to address the needs of young Roma who are unemployed and inactive Roma by tailoring individualised, holistic action plans for them, that take into account their preferences and motivation, barriers and disadvantages, and reasons for being unemployed or inactive; ( 20 ) Roma women in nine EU Member States (2019), a report by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, describes the challenges faced by Roma women and girls.
