        "Macroeconomic relevance of energy IMPORTANCE OF THE ENERGY SECTOR The macroeconomic importance of the energy sector is particularly strong in the Czech Republic where it accounts for a higher share of value added and employment than in the EU as a whole. The share of the sector in the gross value added has increased further since 2005, whereas the share of employment in the energy sector in total employment has decreased. Source: EUROSTAT \u2013 National Accounts According to EurObserv'ER, in 2013, the share of direct and indirect renewable energy related employment in total employment of the economy in the Czech Republic was at about 0.3%, below the EU average of 0.53%.

        "2 Towards an Energy Union \u2013 Czech Republic TRADE BALANCE OF ENERGY PRODUCTS Despite being a net exporter of coal and electricity, the Czech Republic has a negative trade balance of energy products, mainly driven by imports of oil, and, more recently, gas. This energy trade deficit is higher than the EU average and in the past contributed to the overall current account balance deficit (which turned into surplus in 2014). Source: EUROSTAT Note: Current account balance for EU28 from European Commission (AMECO) 1. Energy Security, solidarity and trust ENERGY MIX The energy mix of the Czech Republic has substantially changed in the last 20 years and is now more diversified. It differs from the EU-28 notably in its higher reliance on coal and nuclear and lower share of petroleum and products and gases. Compared to 1995, the share of renewable energy and nuclear increased more than EU average (from 3% to 7.5% and from 8 to 18% of the gross inland energy consumption respectively), while the share of gases remained at the same level. The main decrease concerns the use of solid fuels (by 14 percentage points).

        "3 Towards an Energy Union \u2013 Czech Republic Based on Eurostat data, in 2013, 99.9% of imports of gas came, either directly or indirectly via other EU Member States, from Russia. 1 The combination of a relatively low overall import dependency, but of high concentration of imports from a limited set of countries translates into a country-specific supplier concentration index above EU average. The Czech Republic experiences a significant energy trade deficit, expressed in percentage of GDP. Source: European Commission, based on EUROSTAT 2.

However, the increasing share of renewables in the energy mix calls for an ambitious investment in energy infrastructure. Five Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) in the electricity sector aim to increase capacity at the country's North-Western and Southern borders and would address the issues of power flows between Germany, Czech Republic, Austria and Slovakia. Following the implementation of reverse flow projects, security of supply has substantially improved in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 1 Top non-EU suppliers table is based on EUROSTAT data. The share of imports from non-EU countries is calculated as the ratio between volumes of imports from that specific non-EU supplier and total imports (from EU and non-EU countries).

        "4 Towards an Energy Union \u2013 Czech Republic ELECTRICITY AND GAS MARKETS Market concentration index for power generation (left) and gas supply (right) (2013) (Herfindahl index \u2013 10000 means monopoly) Sources: European Commission based on ESTAT, CEER and Platts Power Vision Sources:ESTAT and European Commission Calculations The concentration of power generation, in terms of generation capacity, is at the EU average while the market concentration on gas is significantly higher than the EU average. Wholesale electricity and gas prices in the Czech Republic are slightly below the EU average. In September 2012, the market coupling of the Czech, Slovak and Hungarian day-ahead electricity markets was successfully launched (Romania joined in 2014). Electricity prices for all users decreased slightly between 2008 and 2012. Increases in network costs (especially due to incorporation of renewable energy subsidies) were offset by declining supply generation costs. In the same period, gas prices for households rose, driven by increases in energy and supply costs, while between 2012 and 2014 they experienced a slight decrease. A moderate decreasing trend was recorded between 2008 and 2014 also in the case of gas prices for industrial consumers. In a context of decreasing retail market concentration the switching rates for electricity and especially for gas consumers (the latter above the EU average) are relatively high. Czech consumers no longer only switch from vertically integrated incumbents to new suppliers, but also between alternative suppliers to obtain the lowest price. Consumer satisfaction 2 is below EU average for the gas retail market and trust in gas providers is the 4th lowest in the EU. The government has approved the National Action Plan for Smart Grids (NAP SG) as a roadmap for further implementation of smart grid technologies in the Czech Republic. According to this Plan, a selective and voluntary roll-out of smart meters is envisaged from 2015 to 2019. CONTRIBUTION OF ENERGY TO CONSUMER PRICE EVOLUTION Energy prices have contributed positively to inflation until recently. However, since 2013, falling oil prices drive energy prices and consequently also consumer prices downwards. This trend is observed in both the Czech Republic and the rest of the European Union . 2 10th Consumer Markets Scoreboard (June 2014), http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumer_evidence/consumer_scoreboards/10_edition/index_en.htm ",

They show that while relevant, the problem is less stringent in the Czech Republic than on average in the EU. However the Czech Republic still has to define the concept of \"vulnerable customers\". This is a prerequisite for identifying this group and to adopting targeted measures to protect them, in particular through targeted social policies. 3. Energy Efficiency and moderation of energy demand ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGET 2020 (39.6 Mtoe primary energy and 24.4 Mtoe final energy) Source: European Commission, based on EUROSTAT and on national energy efficiency targets as notified by the MS under the EED The Czech 2020 energy efficiency target is 39.6 Mtoe expressed in primary energy consumption (24.4 Mtoe expressed in final energy consumption). If the Czech Republic would keep the same trend in primary and final energy consumption as observed in 2005-2013 up to 2020, it will meet its indicative national targets for energy efficiency. ENERGY INTENSITY Primary energy intensity in the Czech Republic has decreased at relatively fast pace, although in absolute terms it remains well above the EU average (more than the double).

        "6 Towards an Energy Union \u2013 Czech Republic significantly higher than the average reduction in the EU28. This is due to a number of factors, such as the significant role of industry in the Czech Republic, including heavy industry, and the fact that the Czech economy is still very carbon intensive, with a predominance of solid fuels in the energy mix. With respect to industry, improvements in energy efficiency (especially in manufacturing) were to a large extent due to shifts towards less energy-intensive sectors.

Post-2020 Energy and Climate Policy Strategy \u2013 Czech Republic COMPREHENSIVE MEDIUM TO LONG-TERM STRATEGY (post-2020) FOR CLIMATE AND ENERGY \uf0b7 The Czech Republic has prepared a new long-term comprehensive energy strategy \u2013 State Energy Policy - that was approved by the Government on May 18 th 2015. The strategic time span of the State Energy Policy is till 2040, with accompanying analytical and modelling documents till 2045. Regular evaluation and possible updates are foreseen at least every five years, based on the legally binding provisions. \uf0b7 According to the State Energy Policy, the Czech Republic plans to gradually decrease in a substantial manner the share of coal in electricity generation and substitute it primarily with energy savings and secondarily with low-carbon energy sources (renewables and nuclear) in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner. The share of nuclear energy in the domestic energy mix is expected to reach 25-33% (and 46 \u2013 58 % on electricity generation) by 2040. On the contrary, the share of solid fuels on energy would drop from 40% to 32% by 2020 and 11-17% by 2040 (11 \u2013 21 % on electricity generation). \uf0b7 The Czech Republic is also preparing a draft Climate Protection Policy as a new Low Carbon Development Strategy which should be presented to the Government in the beginning of 2016.

        "11 Towards an Energy Union \u2013 Czech Republic 7. Regional cooperation Czech Republic is involved in cooperation with Visegrad Group countries (CZ, HU, PL and SK) in the field of energy policy, including gas market integration as well as research activities in the field of nuclear power (Gen IV rectors). The Czech, Slovak and Hungarian day-ahead electricity wholesale markets have been coupled since September 2012, which Romania joined in November 2014. The price convergence between these countries reached 76% after the launch of the market coupling. Cross-border capacity allocation for power transmission for German, Polish and Austrian takes place through Central Allocation Office GmbH. Capacity allocation with Slovakia is based on long-term nominations. To bring more benefits to the customers, prompt implementation of electricity day-ahead market coupling between the two relevant market areas, e.g. North-West Europe and Czech, Slovak, Hungarian and Romanian market coupling project should be pursued. 8. Cohesion policy contribution The EU Cohesion policy provides for important investment possibilities to implement energy policy objectives in the Czech Republic which will be complemented by national public and private co- financing, aiming at optimal leverage. It also ensures integrated territorial solutions to challenges by supporting capacity building, technical assistance and territorial cooperation, including the Danube Region macro-regional strategy in which the Czech Republic takes part. Internal energy market: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 200 million in smart energy storage and transmission systems for electricity at high voltage, as well as around EUR 37 million in smart electricity distribution grids in the Czech Republic. Energy efficiency: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest around EUR 2 060 million in energy efficiency improvements in public and residential buildings and in enterprises, as well as in high- efficiency cogeneration and district heating in the Czech Republic. A further estimated EUR 3 040 million will be invested in supporting the move towards an energy-efficient, decarbonised transport sector. These investments are expected to contribute to around 75 000 households with improved energy consumption classification and a decrease of around 26 862 000 kWh per year of decreased primary energy consumption of public buildings, as well as to around 100 km of reconstructed or upgraded railway lines and 10 km of new or improved tram and metro lines. Decarbonisation: Overall, the EU Cohesion Policy investments in the Czech Republic over 2014-2020 are expected to contribute to an estimated annual decrease of GHG of around 1 105 000 tonnes of CO2eq. Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 53 million in renewable energy in the Czech Republic. These investments are expected to contribute to around 100 MW of additional capacity of renewable energy production. Research, Innovation and Competitiveness: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest significantly in R&I and in SME competitiveness in the Czech Republic. This will be based on the national strategy for smart specialisation. For the Czech Republic, the draft strategy includes a focus on sustainable and safe production and distribution of electricity. At this stage, at least EUR 153 million is foreseen for investments in R&I and adoption of low-carbon technologies in the Czech Republic, but this might increase further in line with the evolving content of the smart specialisation strategy.
