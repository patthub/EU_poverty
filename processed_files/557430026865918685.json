Underlines that the global landscape has changed in recent years, including shifts in the global economic and political balance, and that although some developing and emerging economies have experienced relevant economic growth, they still face high and increasing levels of inequality; considers that a new approach is needed that embraces global governance, with a strong focus on policy coherence for development and the provision of global public goods; 2. Recalls that while having the advantage of being straightforward, the MDGs did not address underlying structural factors that lead to poverty and inequality; stresses that the global sustainable development framework after 2015 should be transformative by addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality and thus deliver on the unfinished business of the current MDGs; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/9 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ",
        "3. Stresses that the MDGs defined in 2000 had many successes in middle-income countries and developing countries, but that progress has been unequal, both within and between countries, therefore these results must be correctly analysed and lessons learnt while shaping the global development framework after 2015; 4. Recalls that, although the MDGs have made a profound difference in people\u2019s lives, key issues such as human rights violations, inequalities, including gender inequality, armed conflicts and terrorism, climate change, food insecurity, lack of property rights, lack of land rights, migration, limited access to healthcare services and education, demographic changes, resource constraints, the loss of biodiversity, corruption, tax fraud and tax avoidance, unsustainable growth, unemployment, and financial and economic crises still pose extremely complex and interrelated challenges for the next decades, prompting the need to find new development pathways that could lead to inclusive and sustainable development for all; 5. Emphasises that environmental sustainability is an overriding challenge, where failure is likely to threaten all dimensions of human development; in particular, recalls that environmental degradation represents a huge impediment to fulfilling the objective of eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; recalls, for instance, that persistent inequalities and struggles over scarce resources are among the key drivers of conflict, hunger, insecurity and violence, which in turn are key factors that hold back human development and efforts to achieve sustainable development; 6. Stresses that the new framework should respond effectively to these challenges and tackle important issues such as respect for the dignity of every human being, justice, equality, good governance, democracy, the rule of law, peace and security, climate change, disaster risk reduction and building resilience, preservation of biodiversity, inclusive and sustainable development, property rights, land rights, health and social protection, education, research and innovation, and the rights of women, children, young people and minorities; 7. Underlines the fact that the new development framework must be universal in its nature and applicable in all countries, including EU Member States, and hence needs to be relevant and fair for both developed and developing countries, while taking into account different national circumstances, capacities, policies and priorities; stresses that the new responsibilities and burdens generated need to be equally but justly shared between all countries; calls for the EU to indicate which concrete actions and commitments it can suggest to respond domestically and internationally to the principle of universality; 8. Stresses that mutual accountability and transparency at all levels should be the axis of the new development framework, and that it is important that national governments and other actors, including the private sector, are held accountable for the implementation of the framework; 9. Calls for the EU to actively lead the process towards the definition of a single, comprehensive and integrated global development framework after 2015 and welcomes the consensus that the new global development agenda needs to strengthen the means of implementation and renew the global partnership for sustainable development; II. The need for a renewed global partnership and a strong and cohesive EU position 10.

        "12. Endorses the conclusions of the UN OWG; considers, nonetheless, that the framework identified in its conclusions could eventually be clustered, while maintaining the balance between poverty eradication, fighting inequalities and the three dimensions of sustainable development, and not at the expense of the rights-based approach, nor at the expense of the more ambitious and innovative goals; 13. Stresses that the new global framework should include the appropriate institutional architecture, addressing the main goals of poverty eradication, fighting inequalities and promotion of sustainable development, with clear guidelines for supervision of its implementation, and that this architecture should also address the complexities and the inter-linkages between the different parts of the future framework; 14. Believes that policy coherence for sustainable development (PCD) is a key tool for the implementation of the post- 2015 framework; to this end, calls for the EU to ensure that the necessary guidelines, impact assessments and monitoring and reporting mechanisms make PCD a reality in the framework; 15. Underlines that the universality of the global development agenda after 2015 implies more demanding commitments for the EU and its Member States; stresses that the new sustainable development goals (SDGs) under the global framework will have to be reflected in both the EU\u2019s external and internal policies; III. Priority areas 16. Recalls that poverty eradication must remain the main priority of the global development agenda after 2015, along with addressing the intertwining pillars of economic, ecological and social sustainability, and a strengthened global partnership; Poverty eradication, fighting inequalities and sustainable development 17. Stresses that ending poverty and fighting inequalities, together with sustainable development, should be the underlying theme of the global development framework after 2015; underlines the need for the framework to be people- centred and address the lack of justice by applying a rights-based approach, with the aim of reducing inequalities, within and between countries, as one of the key priorities in the new framework; 18. Considers that inequality hampers development and poverty reduction efforts; reiterates that poverty eradication, equality and sustainable development are only possible if all vulnerable groups are taken into account and if equitable access, sustainable use of resources and good governance is promoted; calls on the EU and its Member States to support SDG 10, as proposed by the UN OWG, as a stand-alone goal in the new framework; 19. Underlines the need for a target on ending extreme poverty at the level of USD 2 a day, if the framework is to be truly transformational; 20. Underlines the fact that the future framework should address the multi-dimensional aspects of poverty and inequality, which go beyond a lack of income but which involve human beings in their dignity and in all their dimensions, including social dimensions; stresses that poverty should not be assessed in accordance with income alone, but also in relation to indicators of well-being, and not just GDP; 21. Recommends that support be given to state-building by means of increased general and/or sector-specific aid conditional on good governance criteria; 22. Underlines that in a largely globalised economy, labour\u2019s bargaining power has been reduced through liberalisation, which jeopardises in return fulfilment of the rights listed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Decent Work Agenda; accordingly, urges the EU to frame its trade policy strategy in such a way as to maintain and protect high social and environmental standards, while discouraging any forms of social and environmental dumping; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/11 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ",

Stresses the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights of all people, without discrimination on any grounds, starting with the fundamental right to dignity of all human beings, with particular attention to the human rights of women and girls, including the promotion of universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, as well as the protection and respect of the rights of migrants and minorities, including LGBTI people and people living with HIV; underlines the importance of respecting and promoting the rights of disabled people in the new framework; 29. Calls for the EU to emphasise the importance of prioritising within the post-2015 agenda the adoption and implementation of an appropriate legal framework and the fact that national and local policies should fight corruption and impunity, ensuring access to judicial institutions that are impartial and independent and effective remedies for violations of human rights, particularly of marginalised groups, as well as the protection of human rights defenders; stresses that the post-2015 global development framework needs to ensure good governance, democracy and the rule of law; 30. Calls on the EU to redouble efforts aimed at ensuring, in the upcoming inter-governmental negotiations, that the human rights-based approach (HRBA) and the right to development become the underpinning concepts of the post-2015 global development framework, and, therefore, that the key HRBA pillars of universality and indivisibility, non- discrimination and equality, accountability and rule of law, participation and inclusion are included in the design, implementation and monitoring of the post-2015 development framework; stresses the importance of keeping SDG 16, proposed by the UN OWG, as a stand-alone goal in the new framework; Conflict prevention, post-conflict recovery, peace-building and promotion of lasting peace 31. Considers that the global development framework after 2015 should duly reflect the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States and the peace-building and state-building goals agreed in Busan; highlights that special attention is required with regard to fragile states in the new framework; welcomes the fact that the promotion of peaceful societies is one of the priorities of the EU and that it is evolving as an important element of the new framework; also considers that it is imperative to engage in structural, intensive and long-term partnerships that prioritise security sector reform and the establishment of the rule of law and democratic institutions; C 289/12 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ",

Stresses that the new framework needs to address the underlying drivers of conflict and fragility; calls for the European institutions to put in place more responsive procedures in post-conflict situations and adopt a strategy enabling development aid to serve security objectives as effectively as possible; 33. Strongly condemns the lack of prosecution and punishment in conflicted areas, especially when it comes to sexual violence aimed at women and girls; stresses the need to redouble the efforts towards the protection of civilians affected by armed conflicts, to improve access to psychological support, particularly for women and children, and to strengthen the link between relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD) in the new global framework; 34.

Underlines that the mainstreaming process should not lead to the diversion of official development assistance (ODA) to climate policies that do not achieve direct poverty alleviation; 37. Considers that many poor communities are already facing the consequences of climate change while bearing the least responsibility for it; reiterates the urgent need to take action on reducing emissions, with a focus on carbon-free strategies; stresses that moving towards an energy-efficient and renewable-based economy can lead to gains in poverty eradication; believes that the EU should support universal access to renewable, reliable and affordable energy services; 38.

        "E. whereas the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion has increased by 10 million since 2008 to over 122,6 million, with one in four citizens affected; whereas differences between Member States are also growing; whereas the average at-risk-of poverty rate in the EU is 24,8 %, while the equivalent figure for children (aged up to 18) stands at 28 %, and whereas these figures have risen since the Europe 2020 strategy was put in place in 2010; F. whereas for people with disabilities the rate of poverty is 70 % higher than the average, partly owing to limited access to employment; G. whereas an additional 16 million citizens in employment are required in order to meet the 75 % employment rate target in 2020; H. whereas, according to the latest Commission forecasts, the EU unemployment rate is expected to decrease by only a very negligible amount, to 10,4 %, in 2015; I. whereas high unemployment rates in the EU are correlated with its shrinking industrial and manufacturing productive base; J. whereas reforms must continue in order to meet citizens\u2019 demands in the employment and social sphere; K. whereas divergences in employment rates are growing between Member States and across regions, leading to a polarisation of the EU between core and periphery and thus risking the creation of increased social imbalances in the long term; L. whereas Article 174 TFEU states that the EU is to develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion, including in regions that suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic challenges; M. whereas, to tackle the crisis, certain Member States have made severe cuts in public expenditure at the same time as demand for social protection has increased in response to the rise in unemployment; whereas national budget allocations for social security cover have been further stretched as contributions have fallen in the wake of large-scale job losses or wage cuts, thus seriously jeopardising the European social model; N. whereas regions that suffer from severe natural or demographic challenges are often characterised by lower employment levels and greater difficulties in accessing public services such as education and healthcare; O. whereas youth unemployment levels remain an issue of growing concern, having reached the alarming level of 23,3 % (EU average in 2013), while more than 40 % of young people are on temporary contracts and nearly 25 % are working part-time; P. whereas unemployment and youth unemployment are also linked to the absence of effective measures to stimulate public investment in the fields of innovation, research and development, professional qualification and skills, which are drivers of economic growth and triggers for economies of scale; Q. whereas in February 2013 the Commission adopted the Social Investment Package; R. whereas in the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy, country-specific recommendations aimed at promoting female employment have been addressed to 13 Member States; S. whereas the increase in the employment rate for women is in certain Member States mainly due to the increase in part- time work; whereas in full-time equivalent terms only 53,5 % of the female workforce is employed in the EU; whereas in 2012 the part-time employment rate for women was 32,9 % as compared to 8,4 % for men; C 289/20 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ",
        "T. whereas the European Social Fund supports efforts to achieve the Europe 2020 targets through actions aimed at fighting unemployment with a special focus on youth; whereas the EUR 300 billion investment package promised by Jean-Claude Juncker should be used to achieve the Europe 2020 targets; whereas particular attention should be paid to poverty reduction and the creation of quality jobs; U. whereas the European Council, in its conclusions of 27 June 2014, stressed that the current unemployment level in the EU is unacceptably high and therefore agreed on a Strategic Agenda with a strong focus on jobs, growth and competitiveness; V. whereas whilst the EU is on target to reach its early school-leaving targets, there are still large discrepancies between dropout rates in the Member States; whereas reducing school dropout rates will increase the employability of young people; W. whereas income inequalities have risen, with the top 20 % earning 5,1 times as much as the bottom 20 % in 2012, this being another indicator of the increasing social divergences within and between Member States; whereas such a rise in inequality risks destabilising societies in Europe and as such has to be tackled by adopting growth-inducing measures in the field of employment and access to public knowledge and through the creation of quality employment; X. whereas specific attention should be paid to gender mainstreaming and policies targeted at women in order to achieve the employment and poverty reduction headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy and close the persisting gender gaps in terms of unemployment and poverty; Y. whereas demographic challenges and ageing populations will continue to have an impact on Member States\u2019 ability to achieve the Europe 2020 targets; Z. whereas the Commission points to the presence of macroeconomic imbalances and disparities between the labour market performances of Member States, particularly with regard to youth unemployment; AA. whereas an increase in economic growth does not, of itself, guarantee more decent jobs, a reduction in poverty or a reduction in social inequality, but requires appropriate policy choices for meeting such goals; AB. whereas whilst social, employment, fiscal and economic policies are closely interrelated, the Social Protection (SPC), Employment (EMCO), Economic Policy (EPC) and Economic and Financial (EFC) Committees still deal with these issues in relative isolation, thus hindering integrated policy-making; 1. Expresses regret that current policies remain focused solely on economic growth without acknowledging the need for an inclusive, rights-based and sustainable approach; stresses that the benefits of growth need to be spread throughout society for it to become sustainable; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/21 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ",
        "2. Expresses regret that the Annual Growth Surveys and Country-Specific Recommendations (CSRs) adopted so far as part of the annual European Semester cycles have not been sufficiently aligned with the Europe 2020 employment, poverty reduction and education targets; regrets that the importance of social security systems as key instruments for stabilising the economy, as well as society, and reducing poverty is not taken sufficiently into account; calls for more determined efforts to guide and coordinate EU policies, so as to help strengthen the Single Market with a view to tackling obstacles to its performance and reaping its potential to boost smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and create jobs; calls on the Commission to ensure that the future CSRs make the achievement of the Europe 2020 targets a priority; 3. Acknowledges the ongoing work on \u2018Beyond Growth\u2019, as exemplified by the efforts of the Italian Presidency, and considers that this should contribute to the review of the Europe 2020 strategy; recalls the position expressed in its resolution of 8 June 2011 on \u2018GDP and beyond \u2014 measuring progress in a changing world\u2019 ( 1 ); 4. Calls for an obligatory principle in the Europe 2020 strategy of bench-learning in the policies of the Member States, especially concerning the European labour market; this would mean implementing efficient monitoring and recording of best-practice models and methods in Europe, focusing on reducing unemployment rates, especially among young people; this should result in benchmarking and ranking of relevant national examples, leading to concrete political consequences being derived from these findings by all Member States; 5. Calls on the Member States to apply a more ambitious and concrete approach when translating EU targets into their own targets at national level; in particular, calls for employment, poverty reduction and education targets to be broken down by age and gender in order to facilitate benchmarking; 6. Considers that the achievement of reindustrialisation targets is paramount for the competitiveness of the EU and that the relaunch of a genuine European industrial policy could foster growth and create new high-quality jobs; 7. Calls for the introduction of a system of dual education, to operate at national or regional level in flexible form, and for the creation of an efficient Employment Service with close links to the European network; calls, furthermore, for the application of genuine lifelong learning (LLL) concepts and measurements on the labour market with a view to boosting the qualification levels of older workers; 8. Recalls the importance of the social partners when it comes to labour market policies, and stresses that consultation with them should be an integral part of the process; calls, therefore, on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to increase the involvement of the social partners in order to ensure the successful implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy; 9. Calls for a platform of social partners to combine the interests of employers and employees; 10. Urges the Commission and the Member States to ensure that any increase in the employment rate is the result of adding to the number of quality jobs within the European economy; 11. Regrets the fact that the increases in employment rates have partly been the result of precarious forms of employment such as zero-hour contracts, bogus self-employment and involuntary part-time work; is concerned that such jobs do not provide workers with a decent living and adequate labour rights; 12. Stresses that job quality is important for bringing more people into employment and making it possible for them to work longer, and is therefore a crucial factor for reaching the employment target of the Europe 2020 strategy; considers, therefore, that employment indicators should focus not only on the number of people finding employment, but also on the quality of work, in order to provide a thorough picture of national labour markets; C 289/22 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ( 1 ) OJ C 380 E, 11.12.2012, p. 81. ",
        "13. Considers that all Member States should submit National Reports on their annual progress towards the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy goals; calls on the Commission, in addition, to provide an annual Progress Report on the implementation of Europe 2020 and all headline targets; 14. Welcomes the first use of the scoreboard of key employment and social indicators in this year\u2019s cycle; calls for the inclusion of additional indicators such as child poverty levels, access to healthcare and homelessness; asks for an additional analysis of the characteristics of Member States\u2019 subpopulations living in poverty in order to make the policy efforts more concentrated; calls on the Member States and the EU to use the scoreboard as an early-warning mechanism with a view to developing suitable policies; 15. Calls for a rebalancing within the Strategy of financial and economic priorities with strong social priorities, in order to ensure that social policies are enabled; stresses that employment and social considerations should be put on a par with macroeconomic ones in the procedure of the European Semester; calls, furthermore, for the organisation of joint meetings between the EPSCO and ECOFIN Councils in order to achieve a coherent position; 16. Considers that the objective of creating quality employment and quality jobs, as well as resource efficiency, must be made more effective and visible in the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives, especially in the Resource-efficient Europe, Innovation Union, Digital Agenda and Industrial Policy initiatives, inter alia through the inclusion of quantifiable employment indicators in the relevant scoreboards; 17. Considers it important, furthermore, that in future exercises the key employment and social indicators included in the scoreboard should systematically differentiate between men and women; 18. Calls on the European Council, as a matter of urgency, to complete the reform of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), in particular through ex-ante coordination of future major economic reform plans, social impact assessment and associated solidarity mechanisms; calls for such coordination to be supported by a comprehensive ex-ante and ex-post social and gender impact assessment; 19. Recalls that, according to Eurofound, the cost of NEETs (in lost income, lost tax revenue and increased spending on welfare transfers) in the EU rose from 153 billion in 2011 to 162 billion in 2012 and that, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), a total of EUR 21 billion is needed to contribute to resolving the problem of youth unemployment in the euro area; considers, therefore, that increased EU funding is needed in order to attain the Europe 2020 strategy target of 75 % employment; stresses that frontloading is not fresh money and involves the risk of funding being concentrated at the beginning when take-up is low and running out at times of high take-up, which makes the work of the project beneficiaries on the ground more difficult and unpredictable; considers, furthermore, that there is a need for comprehensive and precise guidelines from the Commission for the Member States and their Public Employment Services on the eligibility of their programmes under the Youth Employment Initiative; 20. Believes that Member States must be more responsive to labour market needs, notably by ensuring strong links between the world of education and the world of work; 21. Calls on the Commission to closely align the European Social Fund and other European Structural and Investment Funds to the policy priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy in order to reinforce their role as financial pillars of the strategy; 22. Stresses that the implementation of the Youth Guarantee needs to be monitored so as to hold Member States responsible for what they signed up for in the Youth Guarantee recommendation; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/23 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ",
        "23. Encourages Member States, in order to reach the 75 % employment targets, to improve leadership, management and entrepreneurial skills among young people in order to enable new businesses and start-ups to take advantage of new markets and thus realise their growth potential so that young people can become employers and not just employees; 24. Welcomes the adoption of the Youth Employment Initiative programmes of some Member States; stresses that the sum of EUR 6 billion is not sufficient to deal with the problem of youth unemployment in the EU; calls on the Commission, therefore, to resolve the question of funding after the 2014-2015 period; 25. Welcomes the announcement by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker concerning a comprehensive investment programme to fight unemployment; stresses the need for increased investments (in infrastructure, research and development, green jobs, innovation and the completion of the internal digital market) that are targeted at keeping and creating jobs in keeping with the Europe 2020 strategy investments and look beyond inputs alone in order also to take account of real policy outcomes; stresses that such investment could, with a view to longer-term benefits, be targeted at high-quality formal and non-formal education infrastructures and at eliminating barriers in order to improve equality of access; encourages linking these investments to concrete employment and poverty-related goals, given that investment in areas such as high-quality public services is also important to meet the goals of an inclusive society; 26. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take special account of the outermost regions, whose natural handicaps, including their remoteness, geographical fragmentation, fragile economies and natural constraints, lead to heightened inequalities as regards access to job opportunities, work placements and training for their populations; stresses that these regions therefore require specific enhanced mechanisms to implement investment programmes in order to meet the Europe 2020 strategy targets and unlock their potential in terms of economic and social development; 27. Calls on the Member States to focus on sectors with high growth and job creation potential such as the green sector, the white sector and ICT; 28. Recommends, in the context of a new investment programme dedicated to the fight against unemployment, focusing on combating youth unemployment, which is today one of the most serious problems in the EU; to this end, more funding should be allocated to Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs, in order to more efficiently support youth entrepreneurship and youth mobility as an effective means of fighting youth unemployment, poverty and social exclusion; 29. Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to incorporate a gender pillar into the Europe 2020 framework so as to measure progress on reducing the gender employment gap and enable the policy measures in the Annual Growth Survey to be reflected in the country-specific recommendations; 30. Reiterates its call for the implementation of the Social Investment Package, including the following: the communication on \u2018Social Investment for Growth and Cohesion\u2019; the recommendation \u2018Investing in Children \u2014 breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u2019; the staff working documents on \u2018Evidence on Demographic and Social Trends\u2019, \u2018Active Inclusion of People Excluded from the Labour Market\u2019, \u2018Social Services of General Interest\u2019, \u2018Long-term care in ageing societies\u2019, \u2018Confronting Homelessness in the European Union\u2019, \u2018Investing in Health\u2019 and \u2018Social investment through the European Social Fund\u2019; 31. Notes that the timetable and procedures of the European Semester have evolved in a way which does not grant Parliament a formal role in the cycle and therefore does not allow it sufficient time for deliberation prior to the Spring European Council; C 289/24 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ",
        "32. Calls on the Member States to eliminate unnecessary administrative burdens and bureaucracy for the self-employed, micro-enterprises and SMEs, and to facilitate the conditions for start-up businesses; 33. Stresses the need to shift the tax burden away from labour towards other forms of sustainable taxation in order to promote growth and job creation; 34. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to promote and improve labour mobility mechanisms, in particular the European Job Mobility Portal EURES and the Public Employment Services, in order to boost employment and youth employment; 35. Notes that the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy are yet to be achieved, and believes that, with a view to achieving these objectives, stronger measures should be put in place to bridge the present gap; calls on the Commission, therefore, to open a public consultation procedure for the review of the European Semester in order to improve its effectiveness and legitimacy, as part of the mid-term review, given that the Semester process should assist in the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy; 36. Expresses regrets that the European Council did not deliberate on the poverty reduction headline target in its preliminary discussion on the assessment of the Europe 2020 strategy on 20 and 21 March 2014; 37. Calls on the Commission to develop a strategy that would support Member States in tackling homelessness though integrated policies and appropriate social investments; 38. Stresses that an increase in inequality, as experienced in the EU and documented by the country reporting in the Semester, involves major democratic risks; points to the warnings by the IMF and the ILO that a further rise in inequalities in the EU could destabilise our societies; reiterates its call for more ambitious targets and more precise and objective forms of measurement with a view to reducing inequality, poverty and social exclusion, both within and between Member States, especially in light of the growing social divergences in some Member States; 39. Calls on the Member States to take urgent measures to reverse the trend of increasing rates of at-risk-of-poverty and social exclusion in order to meet the Europe 2020 headline target of lifting at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty or social exclusion; 40. Calls on the Member States to guarantee access to the labour market and adequate social security for the most vulnerable members of society; 41. Calls on the Commission to take new concrete measures in the fields of education and innovation policies in order to strengthen the complementarity between growth and fighting inequality; 42. Calls for a sub-target for reducing child poverty to be set in the Europe 2020 mid-term review; 43. Calls, therefore, for objective indicators of \u2018poverty\u2019 to be used for the measurement of Member States\u2019 poverty rates so as to help identify those at risk of exclusion; 44. Recalls, however, that a poverty indicator provides no direct evidence of the experience of social exclusion, and therefore calls for improved measurement of perceived social exclusion in order to reach a better understanding of the reasons for social exclusion and of which groups are particularly affected; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/25 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ",
        "45. Recognises that Member States are responsible for achieving the Europe 2020 targets, in line with the subsidiarity principle, with the EU supporting them in their actions; considers that the process has the potential, through peer review and the sharing of best practice, to support Member States in carrying out necessary structural reforms, increasing labour market flexibility and putting in place conditions for businesses to create jobs; stresses, however, the importance of timely Member State action, since non-action would have serious consequences across the EU; calls for the involvement of national parliaments and local and regional authorities in the design and implementation of the National Reform Programmes, including through multi-level governance arrangements; 46. Regrets the fact that the Multiannual Financial Framework adopted for 2014-2020, with a budgetary allocation of EUR 960 billion, represented the first ever net reduction in the EU budget; considers that the MFF is not sufficient to help achieve the employment and social targets of the Europe 2020 strategy; considers, therefore, the mid-term review of the MFF to be of paramount importance for reshaping the strategic orientation of the EU\u2019s expenditure towards a job-rich economic recovery; 47. Recalls the role of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in monitoring effective spending of the European Social Fund (ESF), not least the 20 % available for social inclusion, and how Member States have made effective use of this investment resource for meeting the Europe 2020 targets; 48. Stresses the need for employment, poverty reduction and education targets to be more precisely monitored and for the more timely production of comparable statistics; calls, therefore, for real-time unemployment figures and \u2018at risk of poverty or social exclusion\u2019 indicators, especially at NUTS 3 level, with a view to assessing the actual situation on national labour markets; 49. Calls on the Commission to establish a specific youth employment target and/or a specific integrated guideline on youth employment on the occasion of the mid-term-review of the Europe 2020 strategy; 50. Calls for meaningful consultations with civil society, in addition to the social partners, to become a systematic element of the Europe 2020 strategy at all stages of the process; calls on the Commission to produce guidelines for such a procedure; 51. Stresses that genuine consultation with civil society stakeholders would not only boost the democratic legitimacy of the process and the chances of reforms being acceptable to citizens and successful in their implementation, but could also strengthen the evidence base for the evaluation of reforms; believes that, to this end, the Annual Convention against Poverty and Social Exclusion should be more closely aligned with the European Semester; 52. Calls on the Commission to take into account the outcome of the ongoing public consultation before publishing concrete proposals for the mid-term review of the strategy; insists equally that Parliament must be consulted on the final decisions before they are adopted; 53. Calls for a strong ambition to achieve the climate change and energy sustainability targets, as these are integral to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth; 54. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the national parliaments and the European Council.

        "H. whereas the EU had decreased its emissions by 19 % by 2012 compared to 1990, within the scope of the Kyoto Protocol, while increasing its GDP by more than 45 %, and as a result, almost halved its average emission intensity between 1990 and 2012 and reduced its per capita emissions by 25 %, down to 9 tCO 2e (including all gases and all emission sources, but excluding sinks); whereas this should be taken into account both in the discussions about pre- 2020 climate ambition and in the preparation of ambitious targets for 2030; I. whereas many countries are taking steps towards greening the economy in the industry and energy sectors, for various reasons including climate protection, resource scarcity and efficiency, energy security, innovation and competitiveness; whereas, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global CO 2 emissions nevertheless rose to a record high in 2012 and, according to the IPCC, global mean surface temperatures and sea levels continue to rise; J. whereas according to the International Energy Outlook 2014, global energy demand is projected to increase by 56 % between 2010 and 2040 ( 1 ), and meeting this demand would result in a significant increase of CO 2 emissions; whereas the major part of this incremental demand and increase in emissions will occur in emerging economies; whereas there have been fossil fuel subsidies of a value of USD 1,9 trillion worldwide according to IMF figures, with the US, China and Russia as top subsidisers accounting for around half of these subsidies ( 2 ); K. whereas total anthropogenic GHG emissions continued to increase from 1970 to 2010, with larger absolute decadal increases towards the end of this period; whereas CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78 % of the total GHG emission increase from 1970 to 2010, with a similar percentage contribution for the period 2000-2010; L. whereas the world\u2019s two biggest GHG emitters, China and the USA, have recently stepped up their climate policies and initiated discussions related to phasing out of fossil fuels; whereas the EU has committed to a roadmap that would lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 80 % by 2050; M. whereas the crucial role of fossil fuel subsidy reform (FFSR) is not yet acknowledged in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in spite of the important climate benefits of the removal of these subsidies in terms of lowering the global cost of stabilising GHG concentrations and shifting economies away from carbon- intensive activities; whereas this could also bring substantial environmental and health benefits, such as reductions in local air pollution, traffic congestion, accidents and road damage, and provide further incentives for investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy, and sustainable resource management; N. whereas according to the World Bank ( 3 ), fighting climate change would lead to additional GDP growth of up to USD 2,6 trillion (EUR 1,9 trillion) per year until 2030; whereas applying climate-related innovations in the energy and industry sectors, particularly in the field of energy efficiency, would be an advantage for Europe as an early mover in the growing global market for energy-related goods and services, creating jobs, stimulating economic growth, increasing energy independence and ensuring affordable energy prices for all, whilst tackling energy poverty and mitigating climate change, and progressing towards a sustainable economy; O. whereas the contribution that the re-use and recycling of materials can make to reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) also contributes to a competitive circular economy; C 289/30 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Wednesday 26 November 2014 ( 1 ) http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/?src=Analysis-b2 ( 2 ) http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2013/int032713a.htm ( 3 ) http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/06/19703432/climate-smart-development-adding-up-benefits-actions-help- build-prosperity-end-poverty-combat-climate-change-vol-1-2-main-report ",
        "P. whereas the goals of climate change policies can only be reached by turning the general course of development towards ecological sustainability in both the developed and the developing countries; Q. whereas support to developing countries to enable their adaptation and mitigation efforts must be part of the global effort; R. whereas the climate finance challenge is inextricable from the wider challenges of financing sustainable global development; S. whereas major results in tackling the climate challenge are essential for the pursuit of a great number of objectives in the EU\u2019s environmental, development, humanitarian aid and disaster risk reduction, economic, foreign, security and human rights policies, and also for the longer-term prospects for manageable migration flows towards the EU; T. whereas the post-2015 development agenda focuses on sustainability to help tackle global concerns such as poverty, inequality, health, and food and water security; U. whereas climate change over the 21st century is projected to increase displacement of people; whereas displacement risk increases when populations lack land, primary food or housing; whereas the impacts of climate change on the critical infrastructure and territorial integrity of many states are expected to influence the national security policies and territorial integrity of small island states and states with extensive coastlines; whereas displacements due to climate change can indirectly increase the risks of violent conflicts in the form of civil war and inter-group violence; V. whereas throughout the 21st century, climate-change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security, and prolong existing poverty traps and create new ones; whereas climate-change impacts are expected to exacerbate poverty in most developing countries and create new poverty pockets in countries with increasing inequality, in both developed and developing countries; W. whereas the world must urgently rise to the huge and complex challenge posed by climate change by effecting a step change in mitigation and adaptation efforts, including: \u2014 agreement, at the climate conference in Paris in December 2015 (COP 21), on an ambitious, legally binding international agreement for post-2020 climate action which is commensurate with the 2 o C objective, while respecting the right to equitable and sustainable development; \u2014 urgent strengthening and broadening of the measures in place to limit GHG emissions until 2020 and beyond; and \u2014 scaling up of developed countries\u2019 funding for mitigation, adaptation, technology development and transfer and capacity building in developing countries, in line with the creation of the Green Climate Fund and the commitment to provide new and additional such funding amounting to USD 100 billion per year by 2020, while increasing official development aid in order to reach the long-since-pledged level of 0,7 % of gross national income; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/31 Wednesday 26 November 2014 ",
        "Urgent need to act 1. Recognises the extraordinary scale and seriousness of the threats induced by climate change and expresses profound concern about the continued weakness of the international response to the challenge it poses; is extremely concerned that the world is severely off track with regard to limiting global warming to an increase of below 2 o C and calls on governments to take, without delay, concrete measures against climate change and towards a global agreement in Paris 2015 to deliver this target; 2. Notes that, in line with the IPCC AR5 findings, the global carbon budget available after 2011, if there is to be a likely chance of keeping the rise in global average temperature below 2 o C, is 1 010 Gton of CO 2 ; emphasises that all countries need to contribute and that delaying action will increase costs and reduce options; 3. Notes with concern the latest scientific findings of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, which show that CO 2 emissions are set to reach a new 40 billion tonne (per year) record high in 2014 and that total future CO 2 emissions cannot exceed 1 200 billion tonnes if there is to be a likely 66 % chance of keeping average global warming under 2 o C; 4. Stresses that the 2015 agreement needs to meet the goal of reducing global emissions to a level compatible with the 2 o C carbon budget, and should aim at phasing out global carbon emissions by 2050; 5. Recalls that the UNFCCC process will consider strengthening the long-term goal in relation to temperature rises to 1,5 o C; 6. Underlines the findings of the New Climate Economy report \u201b Better Growth, Better Climate\u2019 that countries of all income levels have the opportunity to build lasting economic growth at the same time as reducing the immense risks of climate change; 7. Expects the new Commission to assume a proactive role in addressing the global climate crisis, including in terms of additional climate financing; calls on the Commission to make it clear that the climate challenge is one of its top strategic priorities and to organise itself in a way which reflects this, at all levels and across all sectors in domestic and external policies and actions, inter alia by investing in sustainable agriculture, in line with the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, and in sustainable transport; 8. Emphasises that global climate change policies are based on the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) and that they are an integral part of the global efforts to promote sustainable development all over the world; stresses that the climate change policies must be seen in this wider context and linked with the follow-up on the Rio Conference, the Millennium Development Goals and the post-2015 agenda; Advancing the Durban Platform 9. Recalls the UN Secretary-General\u2019s summary of the UN climate summit highlighting that many leaders, from all regions and all levels of economic development, advocated a peak in greenhouse gas emissions before 2020, dramatically reduced emissions thereafter, and climate neutrality in the second half of the century; 10. Expects the EU and its Member States to play major constructive roles at the COP 20 in Lima in order to create the necessary conditions for a successful global binding climate agreement in Paris in 2015; underlines that the governments of the world have a collective responsibility, including towards future generations, to take adequate climate action; C 289/32 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Wednesday 26 November 2014 ",
        "11. Recalls that all Parties agreed in Warsaw to UNFCCC decision 1/CP.19, which invites all Parties to initiate or intensify domestic preparations for their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), and to communicate them well in advance of the COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do so) in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the INDCs and allows for their quantification; calls on the Parties to ensure that their INDCs are in line with the limited 2 o C carbon budget and that a global emission peak will be reached as soon as possible; 12. Calls on the Lima Conference to agree up-front information requirements so that INDCs are transparent, quantifiable and comparable \u2014 and differentiated according to the type of contribution; further calls on the Lima Conference to agree on an assessment phase in advance of the Paris COP to consider whether the INDCs presented are collectively sufficient in light of the \u2018below 2 o C\u2019 objective, and individually fair; 13. Emphasises that the countries that have already committed to an economy-wide emission reduction target should continue to make deeper emission cuts, and that others, in particular major emitters and those with the greatest responsibilities and capabilities, should also take on economy-wide targets that set emissions caps and reduce GHG intensity; 14. Calls for general reinvigoration of the EU\u2019s climate policy and for rapid agreement on ambitious, binding targets for emission reduction, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources, except socially and environmentally harmful biofuels, by 2030, which would help build momentum in international climate discussions and are in line with the EU\u2019s commitment to reduce its GHG emissions to 80 %-95 % below 1990 levels by 2050; 15. Reiterates that an ambitious 2030 climate and energy framework will allow the EU to keep its first-mover position and could encourage international partners to raise their ambitions accordingly; 16. Highlights that Parliament has called on the Commission and the Member States to set a binding EU 2030 target of reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 % compared with 1990 levels, a binding EU 2030 energy efficiency target of 40 %, in line with research on cost-effective energy saving potential, and a binding EU 2030 target of producing at least 30 % of total final energy consumption from renewable energy sources; urges Member States to take these targets into account in their ongoing discussions; Elements of the 2015 Agreement 17. Emphasises that the 2015 Agreement must be ambitious from the outset when adopted in Paris, so as to keep the world on track for the \u2018below 2 o C\u2019 objective, and calls for the EU to work with its international partners to that end; 18. Is of the view that the Lima Conference should set out the main elements of the 2015 Agreement, building on the progress accomplished throughout 2014 under the Durban Platform, and reiterates that mitigation, adaptation, climate finance and means of implementation will all be essential parts of the 2015 Agreement; 19. Calls on the EU to include all parties in its work towards an ambitious and fair 2015 Agreement which is both in line with the latest science and responsive to new scientific findings and changing circumstances, so that it remains fit for purpose and sustainable for many years beyond 2020; stresses, therefore, the need for a mechanism that allows for a regular review of the mitigation commitments, which will enable Parties to adjust their pledges upwards in light of the \u2018below 2 o C\u2019 objective, without the need for the Agreement to be reopened; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/33 Wednesday 26 November 2014 ",
        "20. Underlines the need for an effective compliance regime applicable to all Parties under the 2015 Agreement; emphasises that the 2015 Agreement must promote transparency and accountability through a common rules-based regime including accounting rules and monitoring, reporting and verification arrangements; highlights that rules should be differentiated on the basis of the type of commitment Parties decide to choose, drawing on the lessons learnt from the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol; 21. Believes that effort-sharing should be based on equity principles, focusing in particular on current and accumulated past GHG emissions and on capabilities, assessed, for example, with the help of GDP per capita figures, human development and poverty indexes and data that give a picture of the level of difficulty with which emissions can be reduced or limited; notes the importance of progress on climate funding for overall progress towards a new climate agreement; Pre-2020 ambition and the Kyoto Protocol 22. Places particular emphasis on the urgent need for progress in closing the gigatonne gap which exists between scientific findings and the current Parties\u2019 pledges for the period up to 2020; calls for those Parties who have not yet made a commitment to do so; emphasises the important role of other policy measures, including energy efficiency, substantial energy savings, renewable energy, resource efficiency and the phase-down of HFCs, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and strengthening the role of widespread pricing of carbon, in contributing to closing the gigatonne gap; 23. Calls on all Parties, international organisations, sub-national actors and non-governmental organisations to urgently develop, scale up and implement domestic policies and international cooperation initiatives to close the gigatonne gap, building in particular on the initiatives profiled at the UNSG Climate Summit (such as the Clean Air and Climate Coalition) and on the policy dialogues identifying high-impact opportunities for climate, development and growth conducted at technical and political levels in the UNFCCC framework; 24. Taking note of the significant surplus of Kyoto Protocol compliance units (AAUs, CERs and ERUs) to be transferred to EU and Member State accounts for the second Kyoto Protocol commitment period, calls for the EU and the Member States, pursuant to Decision 1/CMP.8 requiring Parties to revisit by 2014 their reduction commitments for the second commitment period, to cancel a number of units to align with projected real emissions and with a cost-effective domestic emission trajectory towards the EU\u2019s 2050 climate target; 25. Looks forward to the EU and several of its Member States, as well as other Parties, undergoing a multilateral assessment of progress on their reduction targets for 2020 at the Lima Conference, as part of the International Assessment and Review (IAR) process; believes that such transparency is necessary to help understand mutual efforts and build trust among all Parties; 26. Notes that the EU is on track to achieve emissions reductions well beyond the current 20 % target, and reiterates that the EU has offered to increase its emissions reduction target to 30 % by 2020 if other major emitting countries commit to comparable reduction targets; 27. Clarifies that, although the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol will be limited in its extent, it should be seen as a very important interim step, and therefore calls on Parties, including EU Member States, to ratify the second commitment period rapidly; 28. Underlines the contribution that re-use and recycling can make to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as the use of raw materials is a significant source of GHG production; reiterates the importance of moving to a circular economy with increased recycling rates; C 289/34 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Wednesday 26 November 2014 ",
        "29. Notes that the EU must fulfil its vital role in reducing emissions through policies that halt the development of highly greenhouse-gas-intensive unconventional fossil fuels such as tar sands; 30. Notes that many countries are already leading by example, showing that low-carbon development strategies and economic growth go hand in hand; emphasises that a strong international agreement will encourage further ambitious domestic action; Climate finance 31. Recalls the EU\u2019s commitment, and that of its Member States, to scaling up the mobilisation of climate finance, in order to contribute their share to the Copenhagen Accord commitment to capitalise the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and jointly mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance; calls on other donor countries to play their part in order to foster further mobilisation of climate finance; 32. Requests that the EU agree on a roadmap for scaling up predictable, new and additional finance, in line with existing commitments, towards its fair share of the USD 100 billion a year by 2020, and that it establish a mechanism to facilitate accountability and monitoring; welcomes recent pledges made to contribute finance to the Green Climate Fund, and urges other countries to contribute their fair share, with developed countries providing USD 15 billion of grants for the Green Climate Fund in the next three years; 33. Calls on Member States to make their financial contributions well ahead of the conferences and to better coordinate their announcements concerning climate finance with the EU, in order to facilitate communication with third parties on the overall EU contribution and to make the most positive impact possible on the negotiations; underlines the fact that financial pledges made at the Ban Ki-moon Summit were a good sign and had a positive impact on the image of the EU ahead of the Lima negotiations; 34. Recalls that innovative financial sources might be needed in order to ensure that the target of USD 100 billion per year will be reached by 2020 and beyond, and calls on nations to look into options in Lima; 35. Reiterates the call for dedicating revenues from market-based instruments to reduce global aviation and shipping emissions to post-2020 international climate finance and the Green Climate Fund; considers that the EU should make proposals for adequate and predictable international climate finance for the 2015 agreement; 36. Urges Member States to use part of the revenues raised through carbon markets for climate financing and development aid in developing countries; points out, however, that this mechanism faces major problems as the revenues have collapsed alongside the global price for carbon; in this context, considers that measures need to be taken to make the EU\u2019s Emissions Trading System (ETS) a much more efficient instrument to align it with projected real emissions and with a cost-effective domestic emission trajectory towards the EU\u2019s 2050 climate target, which can then generate substantial resources that should help to finance developing countries\u2019 mitigation and adaptation measures; 37. Calls on the EU and its Member States to clearly define the role of private finance in the context of additional leverage of funding, while recognising that this cannot replace the need for public finance, in particular for adaptation, to emphasise the need for transparent reporting and accountability of such finance and to ensure the implementation of relevant social and environmental safeguards; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/35 Wednesday 26 November 2014 ",
        "Adaptation; loss and damage 38. Calls on major developed economies to harness their existing advanced infrastructure to promote, enhance and develop sustainable growth and to commit to supporting developing countries in building up their own capacity to ensure future economic growth in all parts of the world is achieved at no further cost to the environment; 39. Emphasises that adaptation action is an inevitable necessity and needs to play a central role in the new agreement; underlines that acting now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be less expensive for global and national economies and would make adaptation actions less costly; urges all countries to take appropriate measures to plan, adapt and respond to the impacts of climate change in order to protect their people, societies, economies and environment, and to achieve sustainable climate-resilient development; notes that responding to climate-related risks involves decision making in a changing world, with continuing uncertainty about the severity and timing of climate-change impacts and with limits to the effectiveness of adaptation; 40. Recalls that developing countries, in particular Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, have contributed the least to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but are the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and have the least capacity to adapt; calls on all countries in a position to do so to support those countries that are the most vulnerable in their efforts to adapt and respond to the impacts of climate change in order to achieve climate-resilient sustainable development and to seek agreements on strengthening national adaptation planning processes, climate financing, technology transfer and capacity building; 41. Acknowledges the focus placed at the last two COPs on the need to address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts in developing and least developed countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change; notes the need to fully implement the decisions taken in Warsaw and further address this in Lima; 42. Stresses the need to ensure predictability of climate finance for developing countries to assist them in their efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change; in this context, underlines that countries contributing to the Green Climate Fund will need to clarify what sources of finance will be used and how they will raise this money, as this information would ensure predictability of revenues for developing countries; 43. Recognises the difficulties of separating climate and development actions and their many synergies at country level, but insists that credible and transparent assessments of how additionality is respected remain possible; 44. Deplores the fact that although spending on mitigation and adaptation activities is increasing, it is dwarfed by the fact that most governments, including governments of developed countries, still actively subsidise the production and consumption of fossil fuels; 45. Stresses the need to base climate actions on gender-equitable, participatory and rights-based approaches and to tackle climate impacts with a view in particular to supporting poor and marginalised people and communities; Land sector 46. Stresses that in line with the IPCC\u2019s findings, land use (agricultural, forest and other land uses) is amongst the most exposed and vulnerable segments of our economies, while simultaneously having significant cost-effective potential for mitigation and enhancing resilience; notes the importance for all Parties to include a land component in their national contribution, with appropriate common metrics to monitor, report and verify quantifiable progress towards several interrelated objectives (i.e. mitigation, productivity and resilience); highlights the fact that the agreement should set out a comprehensive accounting framework for emissions and removals from land; C 289/36 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Wednesday 26 November 2014 ",

Stresses that particular attention must be paid to ensuring food and nutrition security for vulnerable populations in the face of climate change; International aviation and maritime transport 48. Reiterates the importance of maritime and air transport in terms of GHG emission reductions, and the need for swift progress and ambition in reaching satisfactory and timely outcomes on the part of both the International Maritime Organisation and the International Civil Aviation Organisation, in line with the scale and urgency of the climate challenge; Climate diplomacy 49. Stresses, in this context, the importance of the EU as a major player, speaking with \u2018one voice\u2019 at the Conference in seeking progress towards an international agreement and staying united in that regard; calls on the Member States to effectively coordinate their positions with that of the EU; underlines that the EU must put pressure on Parties that are not on a trajectory compliant with the 2 o C objective; calls upon the EU delegation to stress those commitments made by other governments in signing the Kyoto Protocol; 50. Calls on Member States to engage in intensive diplomatic outreach to our partner countries to further EU negotiating positions, coordinating with the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Commission, including through the Green Diplomacy Network; 51. Welcomes the UN SG Climate Summit held in New York on 23 September 2014 to discuss climate change for the first time since Copenhagen, which brought together over 130 heads of state and government and numerous civil society and business actors; welcomes in particular leaders\u2019 announcements of concrete actions to reduce emissions, invest in clean energy and low carbon growth, support pricing of carbon and contribute to climate finance; underlines that the follow-up on leaders\u2019 commitments made in New York will be critical for maintaining the momentum in the run-up to the Lima and Paris Conferences; 52. Considers that the EU\u2019s credibility in the context of climate negotiations depends on the ambition of its domestic action; 53. Stresses that the overarching post-2015 agenda should reinforce the international community\u2019s commitment to sustainable development and should also be supportive of international commitments and targets, including on climate change; 54. Emphasises that COP 21 is a unique opportunity to tackle climate change and to make the link with UN work on the post-2015 development agenda and with the preparations for the March 2015 conference on the Hyogo Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction; calls for more active EU climate diplomacy to link these processes, pursuing the objectives of sustainable development in a coherent and ambitious way; Industry and competitiveness 55. Is concerned about the global CO 2 emissions increase in 2013, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) data, despite falling emissions in Europe and the United States; suggests, therefore, considering differentiated responsibilities so that each country contributes to the global efforts in the field of industrial and energy policy; calls for a better use of technologies such as space satellites for accurate collection of emissions and temperature data, and for transparent cooperation and information-sharing between countries; 56. Underlines that Europe should further increase the market penetration of environmentally friendly technologies, including in the fields of ICT, renewable energies, innovative and efficient low-emission technologies, and in particular energy efficiency technologies; stresses that a stable international legal framework would encourage investments in carbon reduction, energy efficiency and renewable energy, and provide opportunities for leading EU businesses in these sectors; notes that innovative sustainable investments can create growth and jobs; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/37 Wednesday 26 November 2014 ",
        "57. Believes that an ambitious and legally binding international agreement would help to address the carbon leakage and competitiveness concerns of the relevant sectors, in particular the energy-intensive sector; Research and innovation 58. Stresses that the development and deployment of sustainable breakthrough technologies hold the key to fighting climate change and, at the same time, to convincing the EU\u2019s partners worldwide that emissions reductions are feasible while increasing competitiveness and jobs; 59. Calls for an international commitment to increase research and development (R&D) investment in sustainable breakthrough technologies in the relevant sectors; considers it essential that the EU lead by example by channelling research expenditure into the demonstration of innovative climate-friendly and energy-efficient technologies, and that the EU develop close scientific cooperation in this field with international partners, such as the BRIC countries and the USA; Energy policy 60. Welcomes recent signals from the US and Chinese governments regarding climate action and their willingness to play a more significant role in global efforts to address climate change; regrets the fact that some developed countries continue to increase their emissions per capita; 61. Notes that the prices of different energy sources play a major role in determining the behaviour of market actors, including industry and consumers, and notes that the inability of the current international policy framework to fully internalise external costs perpetuates unsustainable consumption patterns; further reiterates that a global carbon market with a sufficiently high trading price would be a sound basis for achieving both substantial emission abatements and a level playing field for industry; calls on the EU and its partners to find, in the immediate future, the most effective way of promoting links between the EU ETS and other trading schemes aiming for a global carbon market, ensuring greater diversity of abatement options, improved market size and liquidity, transparency and, ultimately, more efficient allocation of resources for the energy sector and industry; 62. Calls for closer coordination between the Council, the Commission and the EEAS so as to enable the EU to speak with a coordinated voice vis-\u00e0-vis international organisations such as the IEA, the International Renewable Energy Agency, the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation and the International Atomic Energy Agency, and thus play a more active and influential role, particularly in pushing for policies fostering sustainable energy, energy efficiency and energy safety; 63. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to adopt without delay concrete measures for progressively phasing out all environmentally harmful subsidies by 2020, including subsidies on fossil fuels, guided by the Commission, using an action-based approach and monitoring via the European Semester; calls, in addition, for the internationally coordinated implementation of the Pittsburgh G-20 Summit objective of phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, which, according to the IEA, accounted for USD 544 billion worldwide in 2012, as this would significantly reduce CO 2 emissions and would also help to cut public deficit in many countries; welcomes the Saint Petersburg G-20 intention to set up a peer-review system on the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies; deplores the lack of progress regarding concrete measures towards the implementation of this objective; calls for a review of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), with particular emphasis on preventing adverse impacts of CDM projects on human rights, food security and the environment; C 289/38 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Wednesday 26 November 2014 ",
        "64. Considers it regrettable that energy savings potential is not adequately tackled internationally and in the EU; underlines the fact that energy savings allow for job creation, economic savings and energy security, and increase competitiveness and emission cuts, and that they are key in decoupling emissions from economic growth; calls on the EU to push for more attention and action regarding energy savings in international negotiations, be it when discussing technology transfer, development plans for developing countries or financial assistance; highlights that in order to be credible, the EU and its Member States must set and meet ambitious energy efficiency targets; stresses the importance of reducing energy wastage in the construction and transport industries and in domestic electrical systems and appliances, in order to maximise energy savings and energy efficiency; 65. Stresses the need to introduce low-energy-consumption and hydrogen-fuelled transport systems; HFCs and the Montreal Protocol 66. Invites the Parties to look at the voting and decision mechanisms of the successful Montreal Protocol, its different approach to responsibilities, and its enforcement and sanction mechanisms and financing, as an example which might also be used under the UNFCCC; calls for the EU to step up efforts to regulate a global HFC phase-down under the Montreal Protocol; 67. Recalls that the EU has adopted ambitious legislation to phase down HFCs by 79 % by 2030, as climate-friendly alternatives are widely available and their potential should be fully exploited; notes that phasing down the use of HFCs represents a low-hanging fruit for mitigating actions in and outside the EU, and calls on the EU to be actively engaged in facilitating global action on HFCs; 68. Welcomes the EU discussion paper submitted to the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on enabling a global HFC phase-down and, in this context, calls on the Commission and the Member States to submit a formal proposal for amendment for consideration at the 27th meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, to be held in 2015; European Parliament delegation 69. Believes that the EU delegation plays a vital role in the climate change negotiations, and therefore finds it unacceptable that Members of the European Parliament have been unable to attend the EU coordination meetings at previous Conferences of the Parties; expects at least the Chair of the European Parliament delegation to be allowed to attend EU coordination meetings in Lima; o o o 70.

Expresses its deep concern that the controversial blasphemy laws are open to misuse that can affect people of all faiths in Pakistan; expresses its particular concern that the blasphemy laws, which were publicly opposed by the late Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, the late Governor Salman Taseer and Rashid Rehman, who were killed for their stance in favour of religious tolerance, are increasingly used to target vulnerable minority groups, including Ahmedis and Christians, in Pakistan; 5. Calls on the Government of Pakistan to carry out a thorough review of the blasphemy laws and their current application, in particular Sections 295 B and C of the Penal Code, which prescribe mandatory life sentences (295 B and C) or even the death penalty (295 C) for alleged acts of blasphemy, with a view to repealing the laws; calls on the Government of Pakistan to abolish the death penalty, including for blasphemy or apostasy, and to put in place safeguards to prevent abuse of legal provisions on blasphemy or apostasy; 6. Calls on the Pakistani authorities to guarantee the independence of the courts, the rule of law and due process in line with international standards on judicial proceedings, including by taking into account the recent recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers; calls, furthermore, on the Pakistani authorities to provide sufficient protection to all those involved in blasphemy cases, including by shielding judges from outside pressure, protecting the accused and their families and communities from mob violence and providing solutions for those who are acquitted but cannot go back to their places of origin; C 289/42 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Thursday 27 November 2014 ",

Condemns in the strongest possible terms the systematic human rights violations and abuses and violations of international humanitarian law resulting from the acts committed by IS and associated terrorist groups, which amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity; strongly condemns in particular all violence against persons based on their religious and ethnic affiliation, and violence against women and children; 2. Strongly condemns the numerous atrocities committed by IS, targeting specifically women, which amount to crimes against humanity, such as abductions, rape and other forms of sexual violence, enslavement, and forced marriages and conversions; stresses the need for those responsible for such violations of human rights and international humanitarian law to be held to account; 3. Emphasises that children should be immediately reunited with their families, forced marriages and sexual abuse brought to an end, and all civilian detainees, notably women, held by IS released immediately; 4.

        "E. whereas there is a clear delay in the programming process, with only a limited number of Operational Programmes (just over 100) expected to be adopted by the end of 2014; F. whereas, at the request of the Member States, the Commission has prepared a non-paper on the treatment of 2014 commitments under programmes co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund which are not adopted by the Commission by 31 December 2014; G. whereas two scenarios are envisaged for the adoption of Operational Programmes, both implying further delays as regards the start of implementation, namely: (i) the carry-over procedure for those programmes considered \u2018ready for adoption\u2019 by 31 December 2014, and (ii) the rebudgeting of the unused 2014 allocation for the European Structural and Investment Funds \u2014 entailing a technical revision of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) \u2014 for those considered \u2018not ready for adoption\u2019 by the end of 2014; H. whereas, according to the timeline presented by the Commission, Operational Programmes could be adopted between 15 February and 31 March 2015 under the carry-over procedure, and after 1 May 2015 under the rebudgeting procedure; I. whereas in addition to the delay in implementation for the 2014-2020 programming period, cohesion policy also faces a backlog in payments amounting to some EUR 23 billion for the 2007-2013 programming period, further undermining its credibility, effectiveness and sustainability; J. whereas the President of the Commission has indicated that he intends to launch a EUR 315 billion investment package; 1. Expresses its serious concern as regards the significant delay in the implementation of cohesion policy for the 2014- 2020 period, while recognising the importance of adopting high-quality Operational Programmes at the start of the programming period in order to avoid reprogramming at a later stage; 2. Stresses that the current delays are challenging national, regional and local authorities\u2019 capacity to plan effectively and implement the European Structural and Investment Funds for the 2014-2020 period; 3. Recalls that cohesion policy, together with the co-financing ensured by the Member States, provides for a major proportion of the growth-related public expenditure in the EU; stresses that it is therefore imperative to start the implementation of the new programmes as soon as possible in order to maximise the results of the investments, boost job creation and raise productivity growth; 4. Urges the Commission and the Member States to show responsibility and do their utmost to speed up the adoption of a maximum number of Operational Programmes in 2014, and to ensure that as many programmes as possible are \u2018ready for adoption\u2019 by 31 December 2014 so that they can benefit from the carry-over procedure in accordance with Article 13 (2)(a) of the Financial Regulation and Article 4 of its Rules of Application; 5. Demands that the Commission \u2014 while keeping a high focus on quality and the need to keep up the fight against fraud \u2014 to analyse all possible ways of streamlining its internal procedures in order to ensure that Operational Programmes resubmitted after the deadline of 24 November 2014 are also taken into consideration in order to conclude the inter-service consultation by the end of the year, being treated as ready for adoption if they fulfil the quality requirements; 6. Is aware that the second of the aforementioned scenarios, applicable to those Operational Programmes not ready for adoption by the end of 2014, namely the rebudgeting of uncommitted amounts from 2014 in 2015 in accordance with Article 19 of the MFF, implies a revision of the MFF by 1 May 2015 which, albeit technical, must comply with the multiannual budget procedure; invites the Commission, therefore, to engage as soon as possible in discussions with Parliament and the Council in order to lay out a credible roadmap that ensures the adoption of the MFF revision as early as possible in 2015; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/51 Thursday 27 November 2014 ",
        "7. Stresses, moreover, that in order to have the Operational Programmes adopted, a corresponding draft amending budget covering the respective commitment appropriations for 2015 also needs to be approved, and that this implies, in the best-case scenario, a delay in the effective start of the implementation of those programmes until mid-2015; 8. Asks the Commission, in view of the above, to present to Parliament the measures it envisages taking to facilitate, as soon as possible, the implementation of the Operational Programmes, together with the timeline it envisages; 9. Is alarmed about the status of the payments backlog under cohesion policy for the 2007-2013 Operational Programmes; stresses the importance and the urgency of reaching an agreement on the subject, on the basis of new proposals from the Commission, by the end of 2014; 10. Calls on the Commission to explain the impact of this delay in payments on the start of implementation of the new Operational Programmes, and to put forward solutions for limiting the damage as far as possible; demands, furthermore, that the Commission, in the context of the report on the outcome of the negotiations provided for in Article 16(3) of the Common Provisions Regulation, analyse the possible impact of the belated start-up of the 2014-2020 cohesion policy on growth and jobs, and to make recommendations based on the lessons learnt; 11. Requests that the EUR 315 billion investment package to be announced by the Commission be fully complementary with the 2014-2020 cohesion policy; 12. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and the other relevant institutions.

",
        "G. whereas the current IA guidelines provide for specific guidance in the form of an SME test, including for possible mitigation measures; whereas the draft revised guidelines do not include any provisions on the SME test; H. whereas a proper assessment of Parliament\u2019s substantive amendments to the initial Commission proposal shows considerable added value to support Parliament\u2019s position in trilogue negotiations; Scope 1. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s commitment to regularly reviewing the IA guidelines with a view to improving the IA procedures; 2. Underlines the fact that the Commission should ensure that economic, social, administrative and environmental aspects are assessed in equal depth; 3. Is concerned, however, that the draft revised guidelines are much less specific than the existing guidelines in terms of the scope for IAs and that they leave significantly more room for interpretation by the directorate-general responsible as regards the decision on whether or not an IA is required; believes that the existing practices involving the IAB in the decision-making process should be retained; 4. Believes that the Commission should maintain its existing approach of submitting an IA for all initiatives meeting at least one of the following criteria: (a) legislative proposals included in the Commission\u2019s Legislative and Work Programme (CLWP); (b) non-CLWP legislative proposals with clearly identifiable economic, administrative, social and environmental impacts; (c) non-legislative initiatives which define future policies (e.g. white papers, action plans, expenditure programmes and negotiating guidelines for international agreements); (d) delegated or implementing acts introduced by the Commission \u2014 and its agencies where relevant \u2014 which are likely to have significant identifiable economic, social, environmental and administrative-burden impacts; 5. Notes that the assessment of the impact must be rigorous, comprehensive and based on the most accurate, objective and complete information available, with an analysis which is proportionate and focuses on the proposal\u2019s aim and objective, so as to allow a well-informed political decision; 6. Is convinced that IAs are an important means of supporting decision-making in all EU institutions and an important part of the better regulation process; recognises, nevertheless, that IAs cannot be substitutes for political evaluation and decisions; 7. Highlights the importance of consulting all relevant stakeholders at an early stage in the IA process so that their input can be taken into consideration when IAs are being prepared, and before they are published; 8. Notes that the scope of an IA may not correspond to the proposals adopted where these are altered once submitted for approval by the College of Commissioners; requests that the draft revised guidelines state that the IA should be updated to ensure continuity between matters considered in it and any proposal finally adopted by the Commission; C 289/54 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Thursday 27 November 2014 ",
        "Impact Assessment Board (IAB) 9. Expresses serious concern at the fact that the role of the IAB in the IA process is not more clearly defined in the draft revised guidelines; strongly insists that the Commission reconsider this omission and set out procedures relating to the IAB more clearly in a new set of draft revised guidelines when responding to this resolution adopted by Parliament; 10. Considers that such new procedures should establish in a clear, understandable and transparent manner the process for submission, revision and ultimate approval of IAs presented to the IAB; 11. Reiterates the view that proposals should not be adopted by the Commission unless accompanied by an opinion cleared by the IAB; 12. Reminds the Commission, further, of Parliament\u2019s request that the independence of the IAB be strengthened, and in particular that members of the IAB not be subject to political control; considers that the IAB should be composed only of highly qualified people who are competent to assess the analysis presented as regards economic, social and environmental impacts; 13. Looks forward to a clarification by the new Commission as to how it intends to proceed on aspects raised in this resolution, so that it can take this approach more fully into account when preparing its position on the Commission\u2019s recent REFIT communication, without prejudice to Parliament\u2019s position in this context; SME test 14. Recalls that in its 2011 review of the Small Business Act the Commission considered it regrettable that only eight Member States had integrated the SME test into their national decision-making processes; asks the Commission to work with the Member States to better disseminate the principles of the SME test in the context of national procedures, in support of SME policy; 15. Welcomes the clear commitment by the Commission in that review to further strengthening the SME test; deplores, however, the fact that, contrary to these announcements, the SME test is not even mentioned in the draft revised IA guidelines; 16. Recalls that the Commission, in the Small Business Act, made a commitment to implementing the \u2018think small first\u2019 principle in its policymaking, and that this includes the SME test to assess the impact of forthcoming legislation and administrative initiatives on SMEs; stresses that it is vital to make sure that this test is done properly, and considers that there is a significant margin of progress still to be completed; 17. Insists that the SME test, as laid down in Annex 8 to the guidelines, should be maintained in order to avoid SMEs being disproportionately affected or disadvantaged by Commission initiatives compared with large companies; 18. Stresses that in such cases the IA should include options covering alternative mechanisms and/or flexibilities in order to help SMEs comply with the initiative (as provided for in Annex 8.4); welcomes, in this connection, the exclusion of micro-enterprises from the scope of a legislative proposal as a policy option stated in the draft revised guidelines; believes, however, that exempting micro-enterprises by default may not always be the best approach, and that this must therefore be assessed on a case-by-case basis for each proposal in order to reflect the policy of reversing the burden of proof, i.e. that micro-enterprises should remain outside the scope of proposals unless it is demonstrated that they should be included; supports the consideration of adapted solutions and lighter regimes for SMEs in IAs where this does not inappropriately limit the effectiveness of legislation; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/55 Thursday 27 November 2014 ",
        "Application and monitoring 19. Notes that the final form of a legislative act may differ significantly from the proposal adopted by the Commission; believes that it would be useful for a summary of the estimated benefits and costs to be prepared for adopted legislative acts, and updated to reflect changes from the analysis contained in the IA as a result of amendments made during the legislative process; considers that the monitoring and assessment of a proposal\u2019s impact would be simplified by such an exercise; Establishing a Better Regulation Advisory Body 20. Acknowledges the work of, and the final report submitted by, the High-Level Group on Administrative Burdens, as mandated by the Commission; recalls the Commission\u2019s intention, as stated in its latest communication on REFIT (June 2014), to establish a new high-level group on better regulation, consisting of stakeholder representatives and national experts; 21. Proposes that the Commission establish this group as a high-level Better Regulation Advisory Body involving both stakeholder expertise and national experts as soon as possible; proposes a strong and independent advisory mandate for this body, which should complement the Commission\u2019s work on IAs; believes that such a body\u2019s expertise, including as regards subsidiarity and proportionality, could provide added value for the IA procedure and for other initiatives relating to better regulation; asks that Parliament and the Council be involved in the expert nomination procedure; suggests that the best practices and experience of existing better regulation bodies (such as those in Sweden, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Germany) be taken into account; 22. Calls on the Commission to submit new draft revised IA guidelines, taking into consideration the points stressed by this resolution and the newly introduced structure of the Commission, in particular the role of the new Vice-President in charge of Better Regulation; Impact assessments in Parliament 23. Calls for Commission IAs to be examined systematically and as early as possible by Parliament, and in particular at committee level; 24. Recalls its resolution of 8 June 2011 on guaranteeing independent impact assessments, which called for more consistent use to be made of the parliamentary IA, an instrument that is already available; recalls that a specific budget line and dedicated services are available to cover the carrying-out of IAs; considers recourse to a parliamentary IA to be particularly necessary when substantive changes to the initial Commission proposal have been introduced; Impact assessments in the European Council 25.

Calls on the Member States and the Commission, through sustained efforts of implementation of existing rules and enforcement of these rules, as part of an overarching strategy, to address all existing barriers that are hindering the development of the digital single market, while making sure that measures are impact-assessed, future-proof and fit for the digital age; believes that these efforts need to be at the heart of the EU\u2019s efforts to generate economic growth and employment and strengthen its competitiveness and resilience within the global economy; 2. Stresses that any legislative proposal related to the digital single market must comply with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, so that rights enshrined therein are fully protected in the digital domain; 3. Highlights, in particular, the potential of e-commerce, which, it is estimated, could save consumers more than EUR 11,7 billion a year if they could choose from the full range of EU goods and services when shopping online; 4. While welcoming the growth of e-commerce, notes the dominant position in some Member States of only a few actors in the direct sale of physical goods or as a market-based platform for others to sell physical goods; stresses the need at European level to monitor and prevent the abuse of such dominant positions in terms of the availability of goods to consumers and the charges required of SMEs for using such market-based platforms; 5. Stresses the need to tackle and combat the digital divide in order to fully grasp the potential of the digital single market and to enable the inclusion of all citizens, regardless of their income, social situation, geographical location, health or age, in society in the digital era; 6. Notes, in particular, the need to address the obstacles which remain for consumers and businesses regarding e commerce, including online services, access to digital content, fraud prevention, website registrations, sales promotions and labelling; 7. Calls on the Commission to ensure the swift implementation of the single market for services and to ensure the implementation and enforcement of rules such as the Consumer Rights Directive, alternative dispute resolution and online dispute resolution, while ensuring the reduction of administrative burdens; 8. Calls for the swift adoption of the new modernised Data Protection Package in order to provide an appropriate balance between a high level of protection of personal data, user safety and control over one\u2019s personal data and a stable, predictable legislative environment in which businesses can flourish in an enhanced single market for the benefit of end- users, a level playing field fostering investment, and an environment contributing to the attractiveness of the EU as a destination for businesses; calls on the Commission and the Member States to allocate the necessary resources to fight cybercrime by means of legislative measures and law enforcement cooperation, at both national and EU level; C 289/68 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Thursday 27 November 2014 ",
        "9. Stresses the need to ensure a level playing field for companies operating in the digital single market in order for them to be able to compete; calls, therefore, on the Commission to properly enforce EU competition rules in order to prevent excessive market concentration and abuse of dominant position and to monitor competition with regard to bundled content and services; 10. Notes that a level playing field for companies in the digital single market must be ensured in order to guarantee a vibrant digital economy in the EU; stresses that a thorough enforcement of EU competition rules in the digital single market will be determinant for the growth of the market, consumer access and choice and competitiveness in the long term; highlights the importance of affording consumers the same protection online as they enjoy in their traditional markets; 11. Urges the Council to make swift progress and open negotiations with Parliament on the proposal for a regulation laying down measures concerning the European single market for electronic communications and to achieve a Connected Continent, as this would, concretely, put an end to roaming charges inside the EU, provide more legal certainty as regards net neutrality, and improve consumer protection inside the digital single market; believes that this regulation could constitute a crucial step towards realising a single European mobile market; 12. Considers that the Commission should act to create and ensure a legislative and legally certain environment conducive to encouraging creativity and innovation for start-ups, micro-enterprises and SMEs; 13. Asks the Commission to put forward an initiative for digital entrepreneurship, since this is critical for the creation of new jobs and innovative ideas, including measures to improve access to finance for new digital entrepreneurs (for instance through crowdsourcing) and encourage second chances for failed entrepreneurs; 14. Stresses that all internet traffic should be treated equally, without discrimination, restriction or interference, irrespective of its sender, receiver, type, content, device, service or application; 15. Notes that the online search market is of particular importance in ensuring competitive conditions within the digital single market, given the potential development of search engines into gatekeepers and the possibility they have of commercialising secondary exploitation of information obtained; calls, therefore, on the Commission to enforce EU competition rules decisively, based on input from all relevant stakeholders and taking into account the entire structure of the digital single market in order to ensure remedies that truly benefit consumers, internet users and online businesses; calls, furthermore, on the Commission to consider proposals aimed at unbundling search engines from other commercial services as one potential long-term means of achieving the aforementioned aims; 16. Furthermore calls on the Commission to act quickly to consider potential solutions tending towards a balanced, fair and open internet search structure; 17. Stresses that, when operating search engines for users, the search process and results should be unbiased in order to keep internet searches non-discriminatory, to ensure more competition and choice for users and consumers and to maintain the diversity of sources of information; notes, therefore, that indexation, evaluation, presentation and ranking by search engines must be unbiased and transparent; calls on the Commission to prevent any abuse in the marketing of interlinked services by search engine operators; 18. Welcomes the announcement of further investigations by the Commission into search engine practices and the digital market in general; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/69 Thursday 27 November 2014 ",
        "19. Stresses the importance of ensuring an efficient and balanced framework for the protection of copyright and intellectual property rights, geared to the reality of the digital economy; 20. Encourages swift adoption and enactment of international provisions facilitating access of disabled users to digital content and to printed works through their digitisation; 21. Welcomes the conclusion of the Marrakesh Treaty to facilitate access for the visually impaired to books, and encourages all signatories to ratify the Treaty; believes that the Marrakesh Treaty represents a good step forward, but that much work remains to be done in order to open up access to content for people with disabilities, in addition to those affected by visual impairment; highlights the importance of further enhancing accessibility across a broad spectrum of areas, from copyright and search engines to telecommunications operators; 22. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to further develop and implement EU and national regulatory frameworks in order to allow an integrated and secure online and mobile payments market, while ensuring the protection of consumers and customer data; underlines, in this connection, the need for clear and predictable rules, set out in legislation; 23. Recalls that cloud computing can become a powerful instrument for the development of the digital single market, and can offer economic benefits, particularly for SMEs, by reducing IT infrastructure and other costs; highlights in this connection the fact that, if cloud services are provided only by a limited number of large providers, an increasing amount of information will be aggregated in the hands of those providers; recalls, furthermore, that cloud computing also entails risks for users, in particular as regards sensitive data; calls for proper implementation of the European strategy to guarantee competitive and secure cloud computing; 24. Calls on the Commission to take the lead in promoting international standards and specifications for cloud computing, which enable privacy-friendly, reliable, accessible, highly interoperable, secure and energy-efficient cloud services as an integral part of a future Union industrial policy; stresses that reliability, security and protection of data are needed for consumer confidence and competitiveness; 25. Underlines the need to ensure internet safety online, in particular for children, and to prevent child exploitation by ensuring that means are in place to detect and eradicate illegal child abuse images on the internet and by enabling means to prevent children and adolescents accessing age-restricted content; 26.

        "H. whereas, owing to the effects of climate change on agricultural production and hence on nutrition, the number of undernourished children is expected to increase; I. whereas one important cause of hunger in developing countries is massive rural and urban poverty, exacerbated by rural migration, which is triggered by the fact that for many people small-scale farming is not a viable option; J. whereas 25 years after the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, some of the States Parties have not been able to create an enabling environment in which children\u2019s access to adequate food can be secured; K. whereas at the 1996 World Food Summit governments reaffirmed the right to food and committed themselves to halving the number of hungry and malnourished people from 840 million to 420 million by 2015; whereas, however, the number of hungry and malnourished people, especially children, has increased in recent years, primarily as a result of the food crises of 2008 and 2011; L. whereas various international legal instruments link the right to food to other human rights, including the rights to life, livelihood, health, property, education and water; M. whereas the right of all to food and good nutrition is paramount to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); whereas nutrition is linked to most, if not all, of the MDGs, which are themselves closely interrelated; N. whereas international organisations confirm that there is sufficient food production to feed the whole of the world\u2019s population and that child undernutrition is linked to food insecurity and poverty of households, exclusion, inadequate care and feeding practices, unhealthy household environments and inadequate health services; O. whereas the right to food and good nutrition is essential in order to build resilient families and communities and enhance their ability to reduce long recovery periods after an emergency, in a context characterised by an increase in the number and scale of disasters; P. whereas optimal nutritional status results when children have access to affordable, diverse, nutrient-rich food, and also to appropriate maternal and childcare practices, adequate health services and a healthy environment, including safe water, sanitation and good hygiene practices; 1. Points out that the causes of child undernutrition are numerous, and that most of them are man-made and therefore avoidable, including inefficient economic structures, unequal distribution and/or unsustainable use of resources, poor governance, over-reliance on individual crops and monocultural cropping practices, discrimination against women and children, and ill-health caused by deficient health systems, together with lack of education, especially for mothers; 2. Insists that public authorities must guarantee the three dimensions of the right to food and good nutrition: availability, meaning that it is possible either to feed oneself directly from productive land or other natural resources, or to establish well-functioning distribution, processing and market systems; accessibility, meaning that both economic and physical access to food is guaranteed; and adequacy, meaning that food must be safe and satisfy the dietary needs of every individual, taking into account age, living conditions, health, occupation, sex, culture and religion; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/73 Thursday 27 November 2014 ",
        "3. Underlines the fact that, from a life-cycle perspective, the most crucial time to meet a child\u2019s nutritional requirements is in the first 1 000 days of life, including the period of pregnancy, as this is when the child has increased nutritional needs in order to support rapid growth and development, is more susceptible to infections and is totally dependent on others for nutrition, care and social interaction; 4. Reaffirms that addressing child and maternal undernutrition requires an integrated approach and coordinated action in a number of sectors which influence undernutrition, such as health, education, agriculture, water, energy access and sanitation, together with the responsible involvement of all stakeholders, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to adopt consistent long-term development strategies and to make efforts to reduce undernutrition, including in the context of emergency situations and humanitarian intervention; 5. Calls for the EU to increase the support provided by its development aid programmes for sustainable smallholder, peasant and medium-scale agriculture production for \u2014 primarily \u2014 local consumption, and to invest in participatory, nationally led plans, which should be implemented at a local level in cooperation with farmers and their representatives, local and regional authorities and civil society organisations; 6. Commends the improvements made over the last few years in the fight against child undernutrition, as demonstrated by the indicators of progress in achieving MDG1; considers, however, that the number of children dying or suffering from undernutrition remains unacceptably high and contributes to maintaining the vicious circle of poverty and hunger; 7. Stresses, therefore, that the fight against child undernutrition and the provision of universal access to adequate nutritious food should remain one of the most important targets of the post-2015 agenda under the goal of ending hunger, with a specific call to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030 and to achieve, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under the age of five; 8. Considers that the reduction of funds for agriculture under the 10th European Development Fund (EFD) as compared with the 9th EDF was a mistake; exhorts the Council, therefore, to reflect on this and to take corrective action with a view to the 11th EDF; 9. Stresses the importance of political will in addressing undernutrition; welcomes the Road Map for Scaling-Up Nutrition (SUN) developed by the UN Standing Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN) to accelerate nutrition improvement, particularly in high-burden countries, with the participation of various stakeholders, including those UN agencies with a mandate in the area of nutrition; calls on the Commission and the Member States to implement the principles outlined in the SUN road map; urges the Commission to encourage and orchestrate participation in the SUN initiative by civil society and grassroots organisations with direct links to small farmers and their families; 10. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s commitment to investing EUR 3,5 billion between 2014 and 2020 in improving nutrition in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, and calls on the Commission to scale up its commitments as regards nutrition-specific interventions in order to meet its objective of reducing by 7 million the number of stunted children under the age of five by 2025; 11. Stresses that women play a crucial role in child nutrition and food security by breastfeeding, by producing, buying, preparing and distributing family food, by caring for children and the sick, and by ensuring proper hygiene; points out that although 60 % of chronic hunger affects women and girls, women produce 60-80 % of the food in developing countries; C 289/74 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Thursday 27 November 2014 ",
        "12. Underlines the fact that women, although responsible for approximately 80 % of farming in Africa, formally own as little as 2 % of the land; further points out that recent programmes in India, Kenya, Honduras, Ghana, Nicaragua and Nepal have found that female-headed households have greater food security, better health care and a stronger focus on education than male-headed households; 13. Stresses that there is a close correlation between a woman\u2019s level of education and the nutritional status of her family; urges, therefore, that the gender barriers to education and literacy be removed in order to give women greater access to education; 14. Calls, therefore, for inclusion of the gender dimension and promotion of women\u2019s empowerment in all policies aimed at fighting child undernutrition; 15. Stresses that undernutrition among pregnant women has devastating effects on newborns, which are likely to irreversibly handicap the child\u2019s future development; calls, therefore, for particular attention to be paid to the protection of women\u2019s health and rights and for nutritional training to be an integral part of education programmes and school curricula for girls; 16. Reaffirms the importance of literacy as a powerful tool for fighting poverty and enhancing economic development; stresses, therefore, the importance of supporting girls\u2019 education, as investing in girls improves the chances for both them and their future children to lead healthier and more productive lives; 17. Stresses that child undernutrition is found mostly in developing countries, not only among rural populations but also in urban settings; takes the view, therefore, that one of the key vectors for the eradication of child hunger lies in agricultural policies and reforms aimed at enabling small-scale farmers to produce more effectively and sustainably in order to ensure sufficient food for themselves and their families; 18. Emphasises that failure to address child undernutrition in a timely manner in both development cooperation and humanitarian intervention is likely to threaten all dimensions of human development, to undermine national education programmes, to burden national health expenditure and to hamper the socioeconomic development of developing countries, causing them economic losses that have been estimated at 2-8 % of their GDP; 19. Recalls that micronutrient deficiencies, which account for approximately 7 % of the global disease burden, have grave consequences for physical and cognitive development in infants and young children; highlights the fact that in the 20 countries with the highest Hidden Hunger Index scores (18 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa and two \u2014 India and Afghanistan \u2014 in Asia), stunting, iron-deficiency anaemia and vitamin A deficiency are highly prevalent among preschool children; 20. Points out that child undernutrition originates not only from shortage of food and lack of infrastructure but also from problems of food distribution, inadequate access to food and lack of purchasing power, particularly in the face of high food prices exacerbated by speculation on commodities; notes that lack of purchasing power particularly affects the urban poor, who are unable to produce their own food; stresses, in this connection, the importance of protecting small farmers and traditional farming methods; 21. Calls on the Commission to involve the Member States that have acceded to Expo 2015 to launch a joint initiative taking as its point of departure \u2018Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life\u2019, with a view to securing commitments and binding targets for combating hunger and undernutrition, alongside diversified strategies in areas ranging from agriculture to cooperation; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/75 Thursday 27 November 2014 ",
        "22. Recognises that improvements in child and maternal nutrition, and in food security in general, will require effective and coordinated action in respect of a number of policies and sectors, including: effective and sustainable rural development, land- and water-use policies; appropriate health, safe water and sanitation services; appropriate maternal and childcare practices; the protection of marine life and other ecosystems and biodiversity; deforestation and climate change mitigation; adaptation and disaster-risk reduction; sustainable production and consumption; sustainable and secure access to energy; trade; fisheries; social inclusion; and decent employment; 23. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to mainstream nutrition, food safety and sustainable agriculture in all their development policies with a view to protecting and promoting nutrition and ensuring a holistic approach from the local to the global level; invites the Council and the Commission, as appropriate, to prioritise nutrition as a key development goal in development cooperation instruments, notably the 11th EDF and the new Development Cooperation Instrument; 24. Stresses that, in order to be more effective, development and emergency programmes need to be closely linked so as to anticipate and prevent food crises, help reduce the damage caused and facilitate recovery; 25. Calls on the governments of developing countries to create an enabling environment for better child nutrition through improved policies, coordination between national plans and strategies relating to nutrition and donors\u2019 programmes, governance, and accountability to their citizens; encourages greater transparency in developing countries\u2019 budgets, for example via budget tracking, so as to be able to better assess the number and quality of projects addressing malnutrition; 26. Highlights the need for improved and coordinated data on undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency in order to better assist intervention programmes and to provide targeted and informed support to the countries concerned; 27. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to mobilise long-term financial investments and resources for nutrition in cooperation with actors including UN agencies, the G8/G20, emerging countries, international and non- governmental organisations, academic institutions, civil society organisations and the private sector, and to identify nutrition as a priority for innovative financing; 28.

        "C. whereas the adoption of the EGF Regulation reflects the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council to reintroduce the crisis mobilisation criterion, to increase Union financial contribution to 60 % of the total estimated cost of the proposed measures, to increase efficiency for the treatment of EGF applications in the Commission and by the Parliament and the Council by shortening the time for assessment and approval, to widen the range of eligible actions and beneficiaries by introducing self-employed persons and young people and to finance incentives for setting up own businesses, D. whereas the Finnish authorities submitted application EGF/2014/008 FI/STX Rauma on 27 May 2014 following the dismissal of 577 workers in STX Finland Oy, an enterprise which operated in the economic sector classified under NACE Rev. 2 division 30 (\u2018Manufacture of other transport equipment\u2019), E. whereas the application fulfils the eligibility criteria laid down in the EGF Regulation, 1. Notes that the Finnish authorities submitted the application under the intervention criterion of Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500 workers being made redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing, over a reference period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing in its suppliers and downstream producers; 2. Notes that the Finnish authorities submitted the application for EGF financial contribution on 27 May 2014, and that its assessment was made available by the Commission on 14 October 2014; welcomes the speedy evaluation period of less than five months; 3. Notes that the Finnish authorities argue that the global maritime industry has changed dramatically in recent years and that, in this global context, the EU market share in shipbuilding ( 1 ) has plummeted from 13 % in 2007 to 5 % in the first three quarters of 2013, while the equivalent share of China, South Korea and Japan combined increased from 77 % in 2007 to 86 % in the first three quarters of 2013; notes that, in addition to this significant expansion by Asia in the shipbuilding market, reduced orders resulting from the economic crisis pushed the European sector into global overcapacity leading to tough competition; 4. Agrees that these factors are linked to major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation and that the intervention criteria set out in Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation are met and that, therefore, Finland is entitled to a financial contribution under that Regulation; 5. Notes that, to date, the shipbuilding sector in broad terms has been the subject of six EGF applications, with one based on trade related globalisation and the other five on the global financial and economic crisis; considers that restructuring in the sector may alleviate the difficulties and that the shipbuilding industry in the different Member States could be supported by guidelines from a European perspective; 6. Notes that these redundancies will further aggravate the unemployment situation in Southwest Finland, as most of the dismissed workers have a poor standard of education in combination with relatively advanced age, which is likely to increase the risk of prolonged unemployment; is all the more concerned about the effects of this closure on the region as the shipyard and metal industry constitute core economic activities and have historic tradition, making the transition to new economic activities all the more difficult; 7. Notes that in addition to the 577 redundancies within the reference period, 57 workers dismissed after the reference period of four months are also included in the number of eligible beneficiaries, which amounts in total to 634 persons; of which the number of targeted beneficiaries of the EGF measures is 565; 8. Notes that the estimated total costs amount to EUR 2 378 000, of which EUR 113 000 is dedicated to implementation, and that the financial contribution of the EGF amounts to EUR 1 426 800, which represents 60 % of the total costs; C 289/80 EN Official Journal of the European Union 9.8.2016 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ( 1 ) measured by production volume.

        "9. Welcomes the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the Finnish authorities decided to initiate the implementation of the personalised services to the affected workers on 15 January 2014, ahead of the final decision on granting the EGF support for the proposed coordinated package and even of the application for a financial contribution from the EGF; 10. Notes that the Finnish authorities have indicated that the coordinated package of personalised services has been drawn up in consultation with the social partners concerned as well as various other stakeholders and welcomes that consultations continue in the form of a working group convened by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy specifically to address the redundancies at STX Finland; 11. Notes that the personalised services which are to be provided consist of the following three types of measures for the redundant workers covered by this application: (i) helping them transfer to a new job, (ii) helping them start their own business, and (iii) providing training or education; 12. Welcomes the establishment of Service Points amongst the proposed actions; appreciates that these points are expected to provide an even more personal and in-depth service than the public employment office; 13. Notes that a high proportion (41,42 %) of the dismissed workers are between the age of 55 and 64 years; further notes that this age group is at a higher risk of prolonged unemployment and exclusion from the labour market; considers therefore that these workers may have specific needs when it comes to providing them with personalised services; 14. Welcomes especially the measure entitled \"Enterprise survey\", by which a survey of jobs in the Rauma region is to be carried out together with businesses and industries in Rauma, so as to produce up-to-date information on enterprises' personnel needs and to steer the targeted workers in the right direction and provide them with the necessary training; 15. Welcomes the idea that those planning to start a business can experience what it is like to be an entrepreneur by means of a placement in an existing enterprise; notes the potential added value of starting a business after being made redundant for the persons in question and for society as a whole; 16. Notes that the purpose of the pay subsidies is to ensure that targeted workers hired by new employers do not lose out in the first period of their new employment; considers that such measure could serve as an incentive to searching and engaging in a broader spectrum of new and unfamiliar jobs for the workers; 17. Recalls that, in line with Article 7 of the EGF Regulation, the design of the coordinated package of personalised services should anticipate future labour market perspectives and required skills and should be compatible with the shift towards a resource-efficient and sustainable economy; 18. Calls for the European Social Fund (ESF) measures planned within the new ESF programming period to complement the measures proposed and to facilitate the worker's reintegration in future-oriented and sustainable economic sectors; 19. Recalls that employability depends also on the level of integration in society and therefore calls for special attention to be put on the older and less qualified workers' social accompaniment; 20. Welcomes that the principles of equality of treatment and non-discrimination will be respected in the access to the proposed actions and their implementation; 9.8.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 289/81 Tuesday 25 November 2014 ",

Notes that the French authorities submitted the application under the intervention criterion set out in Article 4(1)(a) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500 workers being made redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing, over a reference period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant or self-employed persons' activity ceasing in its suppliers and downstream producers; 2.

Notes that the French authorities argue that GAD, as an abattoir and meat processing enterprise, was caught in the vice between two sets of price pressures, that of farmers struggling to cope with the increased price of feed and that of consumers struggling to cope with reduced income; 5. Agrees that reduced pig meat consumption in the wake of increased prices and lower purchasing power of consumers is linked to the global financial and economic crisis addressed in Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 ( 1 ); 6. Takes the view that the increase of prices for pig feed, which the Union mostly imports from other continents recently plagued by droughts, could be attributed to globalisation; 7.

Notes that, to date, the \u2018Manufacture of food products\u2019 sector has been the subject of one other EGF application ( 1 ), also based on the global financial and economic crisis; 11. Notes that these redundancies will aggravate the unemployment situation in Bretagne, as employment in this region is dependent on the agro-agricultural sector to a higher extent than the average in France (11 % in Bretagne as opposed to 5 % on average in France); 12. Notes that, in addition to the 744 redundancies within the reference period, 16 workers dismissed after the reference period of four months are also included in the number of eligible beneficiaries, which amounts in total to 760 persons, the number of targeted beneficiaries of the EGF measures also being 760; 13. Notes that the estimated total costs amount to EUR 1 530 000, out of which EUR 30 000 is dedicated to implementation, and that the financial contribution from the EGF amounts to EUR 918 000, which represents 60 % of the total costs; 14. Welcomes the fact that, in order to provide workers with speedy assistance, the French authorities decided to initiate the implementation of the personalised services to the affected workers on 3 January 2014, ahead of the final decision on granting the EGF support for the proposed coordinated package and even of the application for a financial contribution from the EGF; 15. Notes that the French authorities have indicated that the coordinated package of personalised services has been drawn up after the Central Enterprise Committee of GAD had been informed on 28 June 2013 that it was planned to cut 889 jobs in the enterprise; 16. Regrets, however, the insufficient involvement of local political authorities and trade unions; suggests, in the framework of a future review of the EGF Regulation, the inclusion of a formal consultation with the local political authorities and trade unions in the file containing the mobilisation request submitted by national authorities to the Commission; deems it necessary to better integrate the EGF to the reconversion programmes and processes of local economic fabrics; 17. Welcomes that the workers are already being supported with various measures helping them to find new jobs, and that, by 20 May 2014, 108 of them had already found contracts for more than six months and another 66 for less than six months, while three had started their own businesses and almost all of them had opted to remain within the region; 18. Regrets that the personalised services which are to be provided consist of only one action, to be implemented by a one-stop-shop (Cellule de reclassement) which is run by two contracting agencies; notes that France requests only the funding of this one-stop-shop from the EGF; expresses its concerns with regard to the low amount of funds per worker (approximately EUR 1 200); calls on the French authorities to propose a more ambitious programme including a wider range of measures, such as a reception centre and casework, external experts guidance, thematic workshops, training, training allowances and grants for business creation, in its programmed EGF application for the remaining closing sites of GAD; 19.

Recalls that the funds have to help the workers and not, in any case, support the agencies; 22. Welcomes that the contracted agencies are paid according to a scale defined on the basis of the results achieved; 23. Notes that 17,50 % of the dismissed workers are aged between 55 and 64 years; notes furthermore that this age group is at a higher risk of prolonged unemployment and exclusion from the labour market; considers, therefore, that these workers may have specific needs when it comes to providing them with personalised services; 24. Welcomes that the principles of equality of treatment and non-discrimination will be respected in the access to the proposed actions and their implementation; 25.

In this regard, the ECB should act with a view to preventing a comparative advantage that promotes unfair competition. Amendment 3 Draft regulation Recital 9 Draft of the European Central Bank Amendment (9) Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 lays down the principle of separation, whereby the ECB carries out the tasks conferred on it by Regulation (EU) No 1024/ 2013 without prejudice to and separately from its tasks relating to monetary policy and any other tasks. In order to bolster this principle of separation, a Supervisory Board has been established pursuant to Article 26, which, inter alia, is responsible for preparing draft decisions for the Governing Council of the ECB in the supervisory field. In addition, the decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB are, under the conditions laid down in Article 24 thereof, subject to review by the Adminis- trative Board of Review. Taking account of the principle of separation and the establishment of the Supervisory Board and the Administrative Board of Review, two distinct procedures should apply: (a) where the ECB contemplates the imposition of administrative penalties in the exercise of its supervisory tasks, decisions to this effect are taken by the Governing Council of the ECB based on a complete draft decision from the Supervisory Board and subject to review by the Administrative Board of Review; and (b) where the ECB contemplates the imposition of sanctions in the exercise of its non- supervisory tasks, decisions to this effect are taken by the Executive Board of the ECB and subject to review by the Governing Council of the ECB.

In order to avoid conflicts of interest, this principle is to be followed without restriction in all tasks carried out by the ECB.
