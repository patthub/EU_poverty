        "1 IRELAND INTRODUCTION The Constitution of Ireland, as originally worded, only mentioned local government in passing, with no specific provision being made 1 . The Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, approved by referendum on 23 June 1999, accorded constitutional recognition to local government. The new Article 28A introduced into the 1937 text not only enshrines the democratic and representative role of local government, but also requires local elections to be held every five years. Local government comprises 114 authorities (29 County Councils, five City Councils, five Borough Councils and 75 Town Councils) which, as well as serving as centres of decision-making at local level, are responsible for providing the main public services in a specific range of sectors: housing; transport and road safety; water supply and sewerage; development incentives and controls; environmental protection; recreation facilities and amenities; agriculture, education, health and welfare; and other services. The Local Government Act of 1998 brought substantial changes to the machinery of local government financing, which is now channelled through a centralised system based on a combination of two separate sources: a central fund, and the proceeds of motor vehicle taxes. 1 As for example in the provisions of the Constitution regarding the nomination of candidates for the Presidency of Ireland. Article 12(4) stipulates that \u201cEvery candidate for election [to the office of President] (\u2026) must be nominated (\u2026) by not less than twenty persons, each of whom is at the time a member of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or by the Councils of not less than four administrative Countries (including County Boroughs) as defined by law\u201d. ",
        "2 Although until the first half of the 1990s the role of local government had been significantly eroded by a series of initiatives and the growth of local bodies, a programme of renewal launched by the Government sought to redress the democratic deficit by giving local government a new position within the system. The publication in 1996 of a Government White Paper on Better Local Government marked the beginning of an overhaul of local government by identifying a series of specific targets such as strengthening democracy at local level, providing adequate resources, boosting forms of cooperation with local communities and representatives of various sectoral interests, and ensuring greater efficiency in the supply and delivery of services. The Local Government Act of 2001 marked an important stage in the reform process, reorganising the Irish system of local government to make it more efficient and more democratic. The 240 sections comprising the Act redefine the role and functions of local authorities, giving a more important role to local elected bodies, laying down rules on the holding of local elections, and involving society more closely in local institutions by setting up and recognising channels for democratic participation. Within the system, the role of the regional authorities set up under the Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993 is recognised. These authorities, which began operating on 1 January 1994, are charged with coordinating the availability and delivery of public services between the various counties and towns they cover. In the light of the above, the system of local government in Ireland may fairly be described as being marked by strong central government control. Local authorities are seen as executive agents of government departments, responsible for implementing central government policy. ",
        "3 The Local Government Act 2003 banned public representatives from holding a dual mandate as a member of parliament and as a local councillor with effect from the 2004 local elections. This represents a further step forward in the reform process launched in the mid-1990s, as it reinforces the separate responsibility of local government as granted by the Constitution. I. THE EVOLUTION OF FEDERAL/REGIONAL DYNAMICS. THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 1.1 Organisation of the State in the last thirty years. Historical profile Described by contemporary historians as \u201ca small country with a big history\u201d, all of Ireland was long under British domination; the adoption by the Westminster Parliament of the Act of Union in 1801 made Ireland an integral part of the United Kingdom, represented by 100 Irish MPs in the House of Commons and 28 life peers in the House of Lords. The possibility of a gradual loosening of the nation\u2019s bonds began to emerge towards the end of the 19th century, reflected in the 1886 and 1893 Home Rule Bills. These bills, supported by the Liberal leader Gladstone, were rejected by the British Parliament and so failed to become law. A third Home Rule Bill providing for the establishment of a twin-chamber Parliament in Dublin with legislative powers in the domestic sphere, and for the appointment of an autonomous Irish executive, was adopted by the House of Commons in the teeth of fierce opposition from the House of Lords; Home Rule was to come into force in 1914 but was postponed by the outbreak of the First World War. ",
        "4 The First World War period was decisive for Irish independence, with the emergence of the Sinn F\u00e9in Party 2 , led by Eamon De Valera. The party, with its openly republican ideology, made increasingly vociferous demands for full independence from Great Britain. The first significant step in this direction came in July 1921 after a series of bloody uprisings (1916-1920), when the British government signed a peace treaty with a Sinn F\u00e9in delegation sent to London by De Valera. Under the treaty, the country was partitioned into two territories; six counties of the northern province of Ulster, with their own government answerable to a local parliament in accordance with the Government of Ireland Act 1920, were separated from the rest of the island and remained under British control. The remaining 26 counties secured limited independence and formed the new Irish Free State which, under its 1922 Constitution, was a British dominion and a member of the Commonwealth, with the British monarch as Head of State. The compromise enshrined in the treaty inevitably prompted Republicans, led by De Valera, to launch a fresh process of reform; on gaining power in the Free State, De Valera introduced a new Constitution in 1937, which officially came into force after a popular referendum on 1 July of that year and was followed by a declaration of independence 3 . The lack of any reference in the Constitution to the fact that Ireland was a republic probably reflected De Valera\u2019s hope that agreement could be reached with the British parliament to recover the six Ulster counties; references to the 2 Sinn F\u00e9in was in fact founded in 1905 by the journalist Arthur Griffith. Its poor electoral performance in the early years gave no hint of how it would grow in the years immediately before the First World War. 3 The entry into force of the 1937 Constitution marked the replacement of the \u201cIrish Free State\u201d by \u201c\u00c9ire\u201d. Legal ties with the Commonwealth were only finally cut in 1949 with the Republic of Ireland Act, which laid down that the country\u2019s external relations were to be conducted by the President in agreement with the government, and that the \u201cdescription of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland\u201d. ",
        "5 republican nature of the system were therefore contained in ordinary legislation, which it was necessary to invoke when John Costello\u2019s coalition government formally declared a Republic in 1949. The Irish Constitution of 1937 has changed significantly over the years. Its twenty six amendments represent the efforts of successive governments to smooth out the discrepancies which have arisen over time between some of the Constitution\u2019s articles, and reflect the values of a society going through rapid social, political and economic change. Government structures in Ireland clearly reflect their British origins, particularly the way in which the workings of Parliamentary government has been adopted 4 . The bicameral structure of the Oireachtas (National Parliament), laid down in the 1922 Free State Constitution, is based on the neighbouring British model with its lower house, the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, elected directly by voters, and an upper house, the Seanad \u00c9ireann, representing socio-occupational interest groups. Article 28 of the Constitution stipulates that the Government, comprising the Taoiseach (Prime Minister), who is appointed by the President on the nomination of the lower house, and the ministers, also appointed by the Head of State at the suggestion of the Prime Minister, shall be responsible to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. The Constitution provides that, in the event that relations between Parliament and Government break down, either the Taoiseach and the members of his Government shall resign, or the President, at the express request of the Taoiseach, shall dissolve the D\u00e1il. 4 Casey, J. (1987); Chubb, B. (1996); Dooney, S., O' Toole, J. (1998); Farrel, B., The Government, in Coakley, J., Gallagher, M. (1996); Gallagher, M, Parliamen t, in Coakley, J., Gallagher, M. (1996).; Kelly, J.M., Hogan, G.W., White, G. (1994). ",
        "6 The President of the Republic is entrusted with a specific role within the workings of government, as set out in the first articles of the Constitution. Article 12 provides that the President \u201cshall take precedence over all other persons in the State\u201d, and establishes two distinct mechanisms for election to the post, depending on whether or not there is agreement between the political forces represented in Parliament. In the event of a single candidate for the presidency, no ballot is required. When, however, there are at least two candidates and no agreement is reached between the contending parties, a direct election, using the single transferable vote proportional representation system is held. The second scenario, which was borne out in practice in the presidential elections in 1997, has led some authors to reconsider their view of the Irish constitutional system and to describe it as a semi-presidential form of government. Analysis of Ireland\u2019s practical experience, however, would suggest, that as in Austria and Iceland, the Head of State, although elected by universal suffrage and enjoying independent powers, does not have full discretion in the exercise of his/her powers. In spite of the attempt made during the presidential election campaign of October 1990 to extend the powers of the Presidency beyond those expressly laid down by the Constitution by means of ordinary legislation, Article 13.9 explicitly states that \u201cthe powers and functions conferred on the President by this Constitution shall be exercisable and performable by him only on the advice of the Government [\u2026] or after consultation with or in relation to the Council of State, on the advice or nomination of, or on receipt of any other communication from, any other person or body\". ",
        "7 Although direct election of the Head of State is usually an attempt to move closer to a presidential form of government, in the Irish case it is more of an anomaly within a parliamentary-type system. 1.1.1 The evolution of regionalisation/federalisation procedures and decentralisation processes. The most recent institutional developments Local government first emerged in Ireland in the Middle Ages, when County Sheriffs wielded delegated administrative powers, assisted for practical purposes by the Grand Juries. Over time, local government was vested in a number of ad hoc bodies (Town commissioners; Poor Law Guardians; Health Boards; Boards of governors of hospitals and asylums, etc.) set up to meet the requirements of on-going economic and social development. These arrangements lasted until 1898 when the Local Government (Ireland) Act thoroughly reformed the system, setting up County Councils, Urban District Councils and Rural District Councils (subsequently abolished in 1925), clearly based on the centralised British model of democracy and efficiency. Irish sub-national institutions are still centralised, and the structure\u2019s functional efficiency remains the strong point of a system which, for this very reason, may be somewhat lacking in terms of democracy. A need emerged in the late 1980s for reform of the Irish local government system, and this was in part met by the creation in 1990 of the Advisory Expert Committee on ",
        "8 Local Government Reorganisation and Reform chaired by Tom Barrington; its report, published following a year\u2019s work, looked in particular at how to restructure and reinforce local government with a view to making it \u201ca valid partner in the process of government\u201d. The Government\u2019s rather unconvincing response to the Barrington committee\u2019s requests was to set up eight regional authorities with effect from 1 January 1994 to promote coordination of public services at regional level and to monitor the use of funds allocated to local authorities by the European Union. A more significant step in the process of overhauling the system of local government was the adoption on 23 June 1999 of the Twentieth Amendment of the Constitution. The insertion into the 1937 text of a new Article 28A stands out as a watershed in Irish local government arrangements, since not only does it stipulate that local elections are to be held every five years, but also, and for the first time, gives institutional status to the role of local government as a forum for the democratic representation of local communities. The 1999 constitutional amendment was followed by the Local Government Act 2001, which marks the final phase of reform, recasting the Irish local government system in more efficient and democratic form. The 240 sections of the 2001 act redefine the role and functions of local authorities, giving a more important role to local elected bodies, laying down rules on the holding of local elections, and involving society more closely in local institutions by setting up and recognising channels for democratic participation. The way local government is organised has also been modernised through new forms of financing. The position of Cathaoirleach (chairperson) \u2013 which may be in the future receive the title of mayor \u2013 has been introduced. From 2004 onwards, this will be a full-time elected post for a five-year term. ",
        "9 One of the most significant changes brought in by the 2001 act was the reorganisation \u2013 albeit nominal \u2013 of the various tiers of Irish local government. Prior to the reform, local authorities in the Republic were made up of County Councils (29), County Borough Corporations (5), Borough Corporations (5), Urban District Councils (49) and Town Commissioners (26); since 2002 the Borough Corporations have been known as Borough Councils, the County Borough Corporations have become City Councils and the Urban District Councils and Town Commissioners have been renamed Town Councils. As a result of these changes, the Republic's local government system operates on three separate levels: regional, county and sub-county. For the first of these levels, Section 43 of the Local Government Act, 1991 made the Minister for Local Government responsible for establishing regional authorities, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Under the Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Established) Order 1993, eight regional authorities were established 5 and began operating on 1 January 1994. The area covered by each regional authority consists of a number of Administrative Counties and Cities. The function of the regions is to coordinate public services in the relevant area and to monitor the use of EU structural funds. The role of the regional authorities was broadened considerably by Sections 21 and 27 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. The act enables regional authorities, after consultation with the local authorities in the specified area, to draw-up long-term strategic planning guidelines for development of the regional authority itself. 5 The eight regions are: Border, Dublin, Mid-East, Midland, Mid-West, South-East, South- West, and West. ",
        "10 The 29 County Councils are the principal organisational bodies and the main providers of local services (there are 26 geographical counties but 29 administrative counties, with County Tipperary being divided into two administrative counties and County Dublin into three) and five City Councils for the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick; at sub-county level the administrative model is more uniform than in the past, comprising five Borough Councils and 75 Town Councils, bringing together the earlier Town Commissioners (committees of senior public officials represent the 26 smaller towns). The regionalisation plan launched by the Irish authorities also led to the creation in July 1999 of two regional assemblies, one for the Border, Midland and Western Region, and the other for the Southern and Eastern Region, intended to promote the coordination of public services in their respective areas, to launch new regional development programmes as part of the Community support structure, and to monitor the overall impact of Community assistance programmes financed by the structural funds. The 2001 act lays down a single set of rules for all local authorities, replacing a jumble of laws dating from the end of the 19th century. An independent commission was set up to decide on any changes to electoral boundaries; it also has powers in respect of local electoral laws. The 2001 act also emphasises the role of elected councils as bodies for determining policy options, while providing a wide range of instruments for supervising and monitoring their implementation. In addition, it introduces the Strategic Policy Committee (SPC) concept to City and County Councils, providing for representation of major interests groups from local communities. Moreover, local communities have been given major consultative powers by the legislative amendments concerning the County/City Development Boards (CDB) ",
        "11 recently set up (2000); the CDBs bring together actors at local level (the State, local government, the social partners) to devise a long-term economic, social and cultural development plan for the area in question. The reform of local institutions took a further step forward with the introduction in April 2003 of the Local Government Act 2003 which, in three brief sections, abolishes dual mandates, making the office of member of the D\u00e1il and that of local councillor incompatible with effect from the 2004 local elections, and also provides for direct election of the Cathaoirleach (Chair) of all local bodies. 1.1.2 Relations between central government and the regional/local levels of government Ireland is described as a unitary State with a highly centralised system of local government. Viewed against the theoretical model opposing fused and dual systems, Irish local government is considered as a typical example of a two-tier unitary system with a formal separation between central and local government; thus the lower tier must always operate within centrally-defined parameters. Relations between local and central Government are regulated through the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which exercises administrative, financial and technical controls over the basic local units. Central Government control over local institutions means that local authorities are the executive agents of government departments and are responsible for implementing central Government policy. The effect of central Government reluctance to delegate powers to sub-national levels has been to trigger the emergence and growth of numerous State Sponsored Bodies and agencies, together with the widespread development of Community Groups . ",
        "12 The 1999 constitutional amendment and the 2001 Local Government Act do however leave the door open to further devolution of powers from the central State to local government. The first step in this direction came with the creation of the Strategic Policy Committees (SPC), bodies made up of elected officials and representatives of local interest groups, with the task of helping to formulate policy in the area covered by the local authority in question. 1.1.3 Local authority cooperation and associations Local associations are particularly well-developed in Ireland. The General Council of County Councils (GCCC), set up in 1899, is one such association of local authorities recognised by law (although membership is voluntary), representing County Councils and County Borough Councils. The Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland ( AMAI) represents urban local authorities. It too is a voluntary association, recognised by law. It represents 82 councils (5 County Boroughs, 5 Borough Councils, 49 Urban District Councils and 23 Town Commissioners). Each member council sends two delegates to the association. The Local Authority Members Association (LAMA) was set up in 1980 and represents the elected members of the main local councils 6 . 6 In connection with forms of cooperation, see also points 1.1.1. and 1.1.2. ",
        "13 1.1.4 The evolution of the metropolitan government model: the role of the metropolitan cities In the Republic, the metropolitan government model is represented by five cities 7 : Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. Renamed under the Local Government Act 2001, since 2002 each city has had a City Council. City Councils, responsible for local government in the areas they cover, act independently of the county authority, with their own management boards and managers. The number of members on each City Council (52 for Dublin, 31 for Cork, 17 for Limerick and 15 each for Galway and Waterford) is laid down in Section 7 of the 2001 Act. Dublin City Council, for example, delivers services to a population of 500,000 covering an area of 115 square kilometres. More particularly, the Council provides essential services such as water, sewerage, waste disposal and libraries: the country\u2019s economic boom during the 1990s had a major impact in driving up the cost of housing and increasing traffic. Counties contain further local government areas, towns. Some 13% of the country\u2019s entire population live in towns. Residents of these areas elect the County Council and the Town Council, either at the same time or in separate elections. 7 The Local Government Act , 2001, renamed the County Boroughs \u2013 introduced by the Local Government Act of 1898, as Cities. ",
        "14 Prior to the Local Government Act 2001, local authority in towns consisted of five Borough Corporations, 49 Urban District Councils (UDCs) and 26 Town Commissioners. The Town Councils have taken over the functions formerly exercised by the Borough Corporations, UDCs and Town Commissioners prior to the reform in the areas of housing, roads and planning, except for water services which were transferred to County Council level on 1 January 2004. 1.2 The political and social players in the regionalisation/federalisation processes. The role of political parties and of other forms of associations There is a wide range of parties on the Irish political scene although the main rivals in the political arena are Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael. The practice of majority government, established as far back as the Irish Free State period under the Cosgrave government, has been a continuous feature in Irish politics, with only rare interruptions. The trend which saw Fianna F\u00e1il as the party of government for a virtually unbroken 32-year stretch, apart from brief bouts of coalition government, has undergone substantial change since 1986, with the entry into the Irish political arena of new party groupings such as the Progressive Democrats, a conservative faction, and the Workers\u2019 Party on the left. Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s 1989 decision to go into a coalition with the Progressive Democrats signalled a significant change in the pattern of contest which had shaped the post-war ",
        "15 period in terms of \u201cFianna F\u00e1il versus the rest\u201d. Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s new tactic was to have a considerable impact. The breakdown of the traditional line-up triggered a serious crisis in the party founded by De Valera: in the 1992 elections, support for Fianna F\u00e1il fell to a level unprecedented since the entry into force of the 1937 Constitution. A party which had long been the only one capable of ensuring stability and continuity by forming single-party governments now found itself on the same footing as other political organisations. However, Fianna F\u00e1il continue to occupy a central position in elections; the increasing fragmentation among parties in the early 1990s was in itself enough to guarantee that no coalition could be formed without its support. In the wake of its 1992 gains, for example, the Labour Party opted to go into government with Fianna F\u00e1il, bringing to an end the system of competition which had marked the previous fifty years. General elections in 1997 and again in 2002 saw Fianna F\u00e1il obliged to form a coalition government with the Progressive Democrats, a liberal-minded party set up in 1985 with the aim of providing a real alternative to the \u201ccivil war parties\u201d which had previously dominated the political arena. 1.2.1 Regional organisation of political parties and movements The Irish party system is marked by a highly decentralised organisation, with local branches enjoying considerable levels of independence from central structures. The same spread of electoral opinion can therefore be found at local level as at national level, as shown by the 1999 local elections: ",
        "16 Political parties Local elections 1999 Total seats: 817 D\u00e1il elections 2002 Total seats: 166 Fianna F\u00e1il 352 80 Fine Gael 258 31 Labour Party 78 21 Sinn F\u00e9in 20 5 Progressive Democrats 21 8 Green Party 7 6 Others/Independents 81 15 1.3 The importance of cooperation and social dialogue In view of its success at national level, the social partnership model was extended to the local level as part of an attempt to respond to the problems caused by unemployment and social exclusion in various parts of the country. Social partnership was first recognised at level in 1991 when twelve area-based partnership companies were set up under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP). The number of locally-based partnerships rose to 38 between 1994 and 1999 under the National Development Plan. Established as limited liability companies subject to the Companies Acts, each of the area-based partnership companies has a board of management comprising representatives of the local community (groups working in fields such as social services, tenants\u2019 rights and crime prevention) and voluntary organisations, the social partners (trade unions, farmers, business or industry associations, etc.), the local authorities and agencies established by law. Up to 1999 local partnerships were partly financed by the Structural Funds, but since 2000 they have been entirely funded by the national Treasury. In 2002 the responsibility for local partnerships was transferred from the Department of Tourism, Sport and ",
        "17 Recreation to the newly-created Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The specific function of the partnership companies is to draw up local development plans designed to help their reference areas to overcome their disadvantages, and to implement these plans with funding provided by Area Management Ltd., a national body which acts as an intermediary for administering the programme. II. DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AT REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL 2.1 Voting in national and regional/local elections On 11 June 1999, some eight years after the last local elections, Irish voters went to the polls for simultaneous European and local authority elections. The local elections were used by the political parties not only as an indicator for the general elections in 2002, but principally as an opportunity to recruit potential candidates for the national elections (incompatibility between the post of \"Teachta D\u00e1la (member of parliament) and of a local authority having been abolished by the Local Government Act 2003, with effect from the 2004 local elections). With a few variations, the support gained by the individual parties in the local council elections mirrored the results of the previous ballot in 1991. As can be seen in table 2.1, Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s results in the county and borough council elections were the result of two opposing trends: on the one hand, a rise \u2013 albeit modest \u2013 in support, rising from 37.9% in the 1991 elections to 39%; and on the other, the failure once again to break through the 40% barrier, a disappointing result for a party which had governed the country during an era of unprecedented economic ",
        "18 recovery. For its part, Fine Gael secured an increase of 1.7%, its electoral support rising from 26.4% in 1991 to 28.1%, a result which was however offset by the serious reverse suffered by the party\u2019s deputy leader, Nora Owen, in the Dublin North constituency. In spite of the merger with the Democratic Left in 1999, the Labour Party lost 16 of the 101 local authority seats it had won in the previous election. Although its level of support rose by 0.2% to 10.8%, this result was 3.4% lower than the overall vote obtained by the parties before their merger. Sinn F\u00e9in was the major winner of the 1999 local elections, tripling the number of its representatives on local councils. The capture of four seats in the Dublin area in particular represented an important result and a significant pointer to the party\u2019s break-through in the 2002 general elections.

        "19 The general elections to the D\u00e1il on 17 May 2002 produced no major changes in the make-up of the government majority, which remained virtually unchanged from the 1997 general elections. Bertie Ahern, T.D., was elected Taoiseach of a Fianna F\u00e1il/Progressive Democrats coalition government for the second time on 6 June of that year by 93 votes to 68 in the D\u00e1il. The real change to emerge from the parliamentary elections occurred on the opposition side. Although retaining the same overall number of seats, there was a dramatic slump in Fine Gael\u2019s vote, while small parties and independent candidates made significant gains, winning 15 seats.

This trend, already present in the 1997 presidential elections, led to the historically low turnout of 49.5% for the local elections. The high level of abstentionism can probably be traced to the financial and economic scandals involving leading political figures. ",
        "20 2.2 Forms and instruments of direct democracy The rules governing the direct involvement of the people in political life are set out in Article 27 of the Constitution providing for referendums on legislation, and in Articles 46 and 47 regarding compulsory referendums on changes to the Constitution. Under the first of these referendum scenarios, the President may, upon receipt of a request of one-third of the members of the D\u00e1il and a majority of the Seanad, accompanied by a statement of grounds, decline to promulgate as law a bill passed by both houses, if he or she considers it a matter of such importance that the will of the people should be ascertained. However, the strong government control over appointments to the Seanad, and its homogeneous majorities reflecting those in the D\u00e1il, provide a clear explanation of why this constitutional instrument has remained unused. In contrast, the Constitutional referendums referred to in Articles 46 and 47 are a mandatory stage in the revision process of the Constitution, and have been put into practice on many occasions. For the purposes of the present study, the most relevant of the 27 referendums held between 1937 and the present day is that on the Twentieth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1999; this amendment which was supported by 77.8% of votes, gives recognition and institutional standing to the role of local authorities in the new Article 28A of the Constitution. 2.3 Community identification with regional and local government Local government is the governmental tier most accessible to citizens and offers the best opportunity for their involvement in the management of public affairs. In the ",
        "21 Irish setting, the importance of local government as part of the national system of democracy has often been overlooked. This can probably be traced to the political culture inherited from a strongly centralised Britain. Local government\u2019s importance therefore stems from its functional ability and efficiency as a service provider rather than as an instrument of local democracy. The importance of local government in Ireland received a boost in the early 1990s with the launch of a radical reform process. This process, together with globalisation, which has dominated the political agenda and made it important for communities to preserve a sense of their own identity, has expanded and rekindled the Irish population\u2019s feeling of local level community involvement. In Ireland, this feeling has traditionally been nearly as strong as that of national identity. In a survey published in 2002 9 , 96 % described their feeling of belonging to the nation as high or quite high; at the same time, 95% said their feeling of belonging to their own town or village was high or quite high, 94% were highly or quite highly attached to their county and region. III. REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 3.1 The constitutional framework (economic and financial aspects) Article 10 of the Irish Constitution states that all natural resources, including the air and all forms of potential energy and all royalties and franchises within the Irish jurisdiction, belong to the State, subject to all estates and interests lawfully vested in any person or body. 9 In Callanan, M., Keogan, J. F. (2003), 3, note 1. ",
        "22 The right to private ownership is set out in part in Articles 40(3) and 43 of the Constitution. In the former, the State guarantees by its law to respect and, as far as practicable, to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen, including property rights, while Article 43 enshrines man\u2019s natural right to private ownership of goods and stipulates that its exercise in Irish civil society must be regulated by the principles of social justice. In consequence that State may, but only as occasion requires, delimit by law the exercise of said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good. Under the terms of Article 45(3), the State favours and, if necessary, supplements private initiative in industry and commerce, and endeavours to secure that private enterprise is so conducted as to ensure reasonable efficiency and the production and distribution of goods and as to protect the public against unjust exploitation. Article 11 of the Constitution, dating from 1937, lays down that all revenues of the State from whatever source, are to form one fund and are to be appropriated for the purposes and in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities determined and imposed by law. The Central Fund, established by section 6 of the Constitution (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937, is subject to the examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General who, in accordance with Article 33 of the Constitution, checks on behalf of the State all disbursements and audits all accounts of moneys administered by the Oireachtas. Article 28(4) stipulates that the Government must prepare estimates of receipts and expenditure of the State for each financial year and present them to the D\u00e1il for consideration. ",
        "23 The D\u00e1il is required to consider the estimates of receipts and expenditure of the State for each financial year as soon as possible after they are presented to it. As mentioned above, all revenues of the State, from whatever source, are channelled into the Central Fund, and under the terms of Article 17(2) of the Constitution, the D\u00e1il cannot pass any resolution or law for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation is forwarded to it by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach. Once the estimates have been discussed and the package passed, a Money Bill is presented, which details appropriations for each item. Under Article 21 of the Constitution, once passed, Money Bills \u2013 which can only be initiated in the D\u00e1il \u2013 must be sent to the Seanad (upper house) for its recommendations. The upper house must, within 21 days, return the bill to the D\u00e1il, which may accept or reject all or any of the recommendations. If the bill is not returned within this period or if the D\u00e1il decides not to accept the recommendations, it is deemed to have been passed by both houses. The power to refer bills to the Supreme Court for a decision on their constitutionality, vested in the President by Article 27 of the Constitution, is restricted in the case of Money Bills, which can only be referred after they have been enacted.

        "24 3.2 Privatisation and economic regulation Whereas in the United Kingdom an extensive and far-reaching process of privatisation was launched in the 1980s, privatisation in Ireland only began to get under way in the early 1990s, with the privatisation of the telecommunications services operator, Telecom \u00c9ireann 10 . 3.3 The budget of regional and local authorities: the local authority share of national tax revenue Local government funding was thoroughly overhauled in the late 1990s. The Local Government Act 1998, which came in the wake of the New deal for Local Government initiative launched in January 1998, led to significant innovations in the local government financing procedure. The domestic rates era, in which a substantial portion of revenue was raised locally, finally came to an end in 1999, being abandoned in favour of a centralised system of financing through a Local Government Fund (LGF) entirely dedicated to local government financial management, and supported by two sources: a contribution from the Exchequer and the proceeds of motor tax. The Exchequer Contribution, which stood at EUR 343 million at the time of its inception, is adjusted annually in line with inflation and the various needs arising from new activities undertaken by local authorities. 10 For more details, see point 4.1.1.

To this end, Section 12 of the Local Government Act 2000 provided that each authority must prepare a budget indicating all estimated revenue and expenditure for the financial year. Section 108 of this act also provides that local authorities may set up a community fund to finance cultural or recreational initiatives, or to carry out joint projects. 3.4 Public-private cooperation instruments. The intermediary role of the unions One of the main achievements of public-private collaboration has been the creation of Public Private Partnerships as instruments for cooperation between the public and private sectors in the preparation of projects or provision of services traditionally supplied by the public sector. The need to devise such forms of association arises from a determination to ensure that services and infrastructure are provided in the most efficient and economically advantageous manner possible. ",
        "26 The Department of Environment and Local Government set up a unit in 1999 to promote and facilitate the development of PPPs in its areas of responsibility. At the end of the same year, the Government announced the launch of a pilot programme specifically focusing on the management of certain public services such as streets, water supply and waste disposal. The PPP Work Programme has developed substantially, with a wide range of projects being submitted \u2013 some 80 in 2002, of which 44 have now made considerable progress. The trade unions play an important part in public-private cooperation. The legal status of trade unions in Ireland is governed by the Trade Union Acts of 1871, 1913, 1941, 1975 and the Industrial Relations Act of 1990. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) was created in 1959, following the merger of the Irish Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions . ICTU is the largest and most important trade union federation, with 72 affiliated unions, 52 of which operate exclusively within the Republic. They play a decisive role in the negotiations between employers and workers in reaching collective agreements. Collective bargaining may be either centralised or decentralised depending on the relevant level. Centralised bargaining applies to the public sector, within bodies operating at national level such as Government departments, State agencies and semi-State bodies. Decentralised bargaining, in contrast, takes place at the level of individual sector associations. ",
        "27 3.5 European integration and economic development at regional and local level: management of the Structural Funds Irish society, politics and the economy have been profoundly affected by the process of European integration, which got under way in the early 1970s following the adoption of the constitutional referendum on Ireland\u2019s accession to the European Community and the simultaneous amendment of Article 29(4) of the Constitution; the integration process was deepened further by the adoption of the Single European Act, and the Maastricht, Amsterdam and, most recently, the Nice Treaties. Although initially many sceptical commentators sought to interpret the European Union\u2019s role solely as a potential source of funding, they were soon forced to change their views in the light of the real impact EU legislation was judged to have on various Government and local government activities in Ireland, with EU directives being transposed through acts of Parliament or ministerial regulations. The Structural Funds certainly represent one \u2013 although not the sole \u2013 factor in the country\u2019s economic success during the 1990s, providing a major source of income for local government. The Structural and Cohesion Funds have enabled local authorities to achieve large-scale objectives, such as the construction of road networks or reorganisation of the water supply network, but have also been used for smaller-scale purposes such as renovation projects for urban centres and villages, or the promotion and implementation of cultural and arts initiatives. The inflow of structural funds and the impact of European legislation have also been of considerable effect in stimulating a reorganisation of the sub-national tier of government. In 1999 the country was considered to form a single region and management of funds was highly centralised, but at the prompting of the European Commission in connection with Agenda 2000, two regions were created; the Border, ",

        "29 IV. LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES 4.1 Management of public services. The regional and local dimension of public services Irish local authorities are responsible for providing a wide range of services which can be broken down into eight broad categories: housing; transport and road safety; water supply and sewerage; development plans and controls; environmental protection; recreational facilities and amenities; agriculture, education, health and welfare; and various services. Although the list of services which local authorities are required to provide or manage is so extensive as to suggest a considerable devolution of powers by central Government, actual analysis reveals that with the exception of housing, the level of devolution is quite restricted. In this regard, it is clear that local authorities have striven over the last ten years to improve the quality of the public services they provide, making them more responsive to consumers\u2019 demands and to the needs of their territorial areas. As elsewhere, provision of public services takes place within the principles and limits laid down by national policy. Local authorities are therefore given general powers giving them some leeway in how they attain the objectives set by central Government and adjust policies and services to local needs. Local authorities enjoy general competence under the terms of the Local Government Act 1991, which was adopted following the push for renewal provided by the 1991 ",
        "30 Barrington Report. Section 6.1 of the Act gave local authorities the general competence required to promote the interests of the local community in whatever way they consider necessary or desirable. The general competence principle, which is restated in the Local Government Act 2001, has the effect not only of overturning the ultra vires rule created by the courts, forbidding local authorities from any action not specifically authorised by law, but also of extending the scope of local authority activity in the area of supplying public services, allowing them to be tailored to specific needs. Section 66.3 of the 2001 act provides that local authorities may take measures or engage in activities in accordance with law in order to promote the interests of the local community. For the purposes of promoting the interests of the local community, it is necessary to adopt measures facilitating social inclusion or the social, economic, environmental and recreational development of communities within the relevant administrative area. This general power attributed to local authorities is, however, limited not only by the areas of competence conferred by law on other bodies, but also by their inability to undertake any activity that would prejudice or unnecessarily duplicate activity arising from a statutory function of another body, or that would involve wasteful or unnecessary expenditure. 4.1.1 The impact of privatisation Privatisation, which was in the past very limited in Ireland, has speeded up considerably in recent years, with the privatisation of the telecoms operator Telecom \u00c9ireann plc, which became Eircom plc in 1999.

        "31 Whereas the United Kingdom boasted privatisation in a wide range of sectors in the first half of the 1980s, public services in Ireland were provided by \"Semi-State Bodies\" 11 (SSB) holding a legal monopoly position. The tax policy and various trade-related measures implemented by successive Governments over the last 20 years, together with the process of European integration, spotlighted the need to change the fundamentally monopolistic position of the SSBs and to commence a gradual process of privatisation. Privatisation has been approached cautiously, as a result of the distaste expressed by the country\u2019s trade unions and the Labour Party. It is worth mentioning, in this regard, that the law setting up An Post and Bord Telecom \u00c9ireann 12 allowed only the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to split it up. This restriction was revoked by the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1996. Before 1996, the way to privatisation was paved by two major legislative initiatives, the Insurance Act 1990 and the Sugar Act 1991. The first semi-State body to be fully privatised was the telecommunications company, Telecom \u00c9ireann. The Postal and Telecommunication Services (Amendment) Act 1999 laid the groundwork for Bord Telecom \u00c9ireann plc (BT\u00c9) to be placed on the market, its shares being put on sale on 8 July 1999. The Eircom experiment heralded further privatisation moves. The Electricity (Supply) Amendment Act 2001 and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited Act 11 The first semi-State body was the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), set up in 1927. It was followed by the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC), the Irish Sugar Company and a series of enterprises geared to supplying services in the fields of transport, telecommunications, information, etc.. 12 Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983 , section 21 .

        "32 2001, provided for the privatisation of the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Ltd (INPC). V. THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON REGIONAL AND LOCAL DEMOCRACY 5.1 Computerisation of public administration (projects, experience and results) As seen earlier, investment in and use of information technologies were seen as key stages in the process of local government reform set out in the 1996 document, Better Local Government (BLG); practical implementation of a computerised system of organisation would certainly improve the quality of service provision to the public and streamline exchange of information between the State, local authorities and other important bodies; Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) would not only optimise the working conditions of local government personnel and minimise the impact of geographical constraints on service delivery, but would also increase public involvement in defining significant options, providing an up-to-date, easily understandable information system and allowing on-going public consultations on policy matters. At local level, some authorities have been more active than others in developing hi- tech information systems. A number of local authorities have set up Intranet sites, for the purposes of internal information and for exchanging information and news between their different departments, together with Extranet sites to support the work of local councillors. ",
        "33 Although most local councils have created their own Internet sites, enabling users to send e-mails, web applications allowing citizens to deal with the local authority electronically are still few in number and not completely active. One exception to this is Co Kerry, which has experimented with forms of direct cooperation between local institutions and residents. The fact that use of ICTs has begun does not, however, mean that delivery of public services has been fully computerised, as a number of significant changes must first be made within local authorities. These organisational-type changes which will then allow all the benefits of computerisation to be reaped in practice. Although much remains to be done, it is worth pointing out that those local authorities which have been notably successful in the use of ICTs are those which have adopted a \u201cthink big, start small, move fast\u201d approach such as Co Meath, which decided to change its own Council organisational structure in order to implement decentralised public service delivery 13 . In order to put on-line delivery of public services into practice, the Local Government Computer Services Board (LGCSB) is working together with local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in a number of specific fields, such as housing, funding systems, the electoral register and education . In the area of electronic voter registration, for example, the personal data protection issue has drastically slowed the process of computerisation, although users have been assured that as soon as it becomes technically possible, they will be able to check if they are registered and, if not, to register on-line; regarding tax, the Department of the 13 For details on the Co Meath experience, see.

        "34 Environment and Local Government is about to launch a pilot project allowing users to pay taxes and charges on-line. In spite of the efforts made over the last few years to computerise services, the feeling remains \u2013 including among local authority figures themselves \u2013 that the ICT use is still in many areas embryonic, and that the road to complete computerised management and efficient on-line delivery of public services is lengthy and full of obstacles. 5.2 Procedures and safeguards for electronic voting. The role of electronic discussion forums. The rise of local television networks Electronic voting was tried out for the first time in the 2002 general elections. The pilot project, announced by Bertie Ahern\u2019s Government back in February 2000, and restricted to three constituencies \u2013 Dublin North, Dublin West and Meath \u2013 was to be the first test-bed for a voting system to be fully introduced in the local and European elections in 2004. The Government\u2019s enthusiasm for e-voting as likely to produce major advances in electoral procedure, by providing faster and more reliable results and making it easier for voters to express preferences, was countered by critics who believed that e-voting would reduce electoral transparency and public awareness. Concern that electronic systems could confuse less expert users on how to express their preferences prompted the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to launch an information campaign during which two booklets were ",
        "35 distributed in the relevant constituencies: Making It Easier to Vote and Electronic Voting - It\u2019s Easy . Despite the efforts made, the e-voting system failed to simplify electoral procedures as expected. Long queues, the need in any case to go to the polling station to use the voting machine, a substantial fall in turnout and voters\u2019 fears about the secrecy of their votes all pointed to the advisability of replacing this arrangement with mobile methods of e-voting (e.g. via Internet or mobile phone), and failed to realise its huge potential benefits for the future. 5.3 Information technology and changing public services The introduction of computer technology was highlighted by the document Better Local Government - A Programme for Change 1996 as one of the key points in the process of local government reform in terms of the quality, efficiency and delivery of public services. Like the 1994 Strategic Management Initiative before it, the programme emphasised that strategic use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) could help build a system of local government able not only to provide citizens with a wide range of services, but also to act as a partner for central Government in bringing about the information society in Ireland . The first Action Plan for the Information Society, entitled Implementing the Information Society in Ireland and published by the Government in January 1999, argued that electronic delivery of services must be implemented in three separate stages; firstly, websites for all Government departments and agencies providing on- line service information while maintaining more traditional means of delivery; ",
        "36 secondly, provision of interactive services and their on-line delivery; and lastly, remodelling information and service delivery in line with users\u2019 requirements. Three years after the first Action Plan for the Information Society, the Irish Government published the New Connections report (2002), restating the importance of ICTs as essential tools in cutting costs and maximising quality and efficiency in the provision and delivery of public services. The Government has set itself a specific target for on-line availability, by the end of 2005, of all essential public services which can be delivered electronically. The Government has set up an interdepartmental body to press ahead with the modernisation of public service management. Reach was established in 1999 to help implement eGovernment . Its particular brief is to improve the management and delivery of public services through its website www. reachservices.ie . Users key in their PPSN 14 to enter the site, where they can, for example, apply for a health insurance card, planning permission, an education grant or a birth certificate. The site also represents the first step towards a standardised mechanism for access to public services, to be known as the Public Service Broker . The electronic broker, scheduled to enter service in late 2003, will act as an intermediary between users and public service agencies, and will be responsible for developing a single access point to services in order to enhance their delivery through both traditional means (telephone or in person) and the new self-service electronic channel. Over the last three years, and pending the creation of the Public Service Broker, a broad range of eGovernment information and service delivery projects have been put in motion. Three of the most important of these projects are Oasis (Online Access to State Information and Services ) , launched in 2001 with the aim of providing citizens with 14 The Personal Public Service Number (PPSN), similar to a Pin, identifies the user and opens access to the system.

        "43 ITALY INTRODUCTION Since 1999, and in accordance with constitutional laws 1/99, 2/01 and 3/01, the entire Italian institutional framework has undergone a substantial overhaul. Under constitutional law 1/99, regional presidents are to be elected by direct suffrage and regions are granted statutory autonomy. Law 2/01, in turn, grants special statute regions the right to self-government, parallel to the amending legislation provided under Law 1/99 for ordinary regions. Finally, under Law 3/01, the republic has been defined as a unit composed of municipalities, provinces, regions and the state. The legislative powers of regions have been considerably extended, while government restrictions on regional legislation have been curtailed. A new legal framework for governance has thereby been created, and new criteria for the distribution of administrative duties amongst the state, regions, municipalities, provinces and metropolitan cities have been established, whilst external controls have been lifted. New provisions governing the financial autonomy of regional and local authorities have been laid down. Finally, regional powers over relations within the European Union and at international level have been redefined. The cooperative nature of the federal model chosen in the 2001 constitutional legislation is apparent in the revised text of Article 118(1) and (3) of the constitution, upholding the principle of subsidiarity. However, the revised Title V has not given sufficient attention to the principle of loyal cooperation between the state and the regional authorities. The only permanent bodies that provide for coordination between the state and regions on the one hand, and between the state, regions and the local authorities, on the other, remain respectively the State-Regions Conference and the Joint State-Regions-Cities- Local Authorities Conference, which were most recently regulated by legislative ",
        "44 decree in 1997. Regarding coordination within regions, under the terms of constitutional law 3/01, the newly established regional statutes are to regulate the Council of Local Authorities, which is the body entrusted with coordination between the region and the local authorities. In recent years, Lega Nord (the Northern League) is beyond doubt the political movement that has made federalisation its top political priority. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned reforms towards federalisation in Italy took place during the XIII Legislature, when Lega Nord was not a member of the ruling (centre-left) coalition. However, the centre-right coalition that won the national elections in 2001, and which passed Act 131/03, is responsible for drafting implementing legislation for revised Title V. Federalism is therefore an ongoing process in Italy. In 2003, further bills amending Title V were submitted to parliament. From an economic point of view, Italy's uneven socio-economic development and the structural crises affecting certain areas made it eligible for a share of the Structural Funds. For instance, in the north, Lombardy has a gross domestic product equivalent to 132% of the European Union average, whereas in the south, in Calabria, GDP stands at 61%. Disparities in employment rates are equally striking: unemployment stands at 24% in Campania, which is over five times as high as the unemployment rate in Trentino-Alto Adige (4.5%). With regard to domestic economic policy, privatisation has been a matter of government policy since the 1990s. The national debt and the need to bring public spending in line with the Maastricht rules and the national antitrust law establishing the Italian competition authority have greatly influenced and accelerated the conversion of public enterprises, which were previously state-controlled. The privatisation process in Italy has resulted in a transition from state ownership to state regulation. In practice, however, the regulations governing privatised companies are ",
        "45 still public-law related to a large extent. Thus the special powers, share ownership restrictions and regulatory provisions that characterise the public sector are still prevalent in the liberalised sectors. I. THE EVOLUTION OF FEDERAL/REGIONAL DYNAMICS. THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 1.1 Organisation of the State in the last thirty years. Historical profile The implementation of Title V of the Italian constitution and, in particular, of the \"ordinary regions\" system began in 1970, when the first elections for regional councils were held. The first law on regional elections, Act 108, was enacted in 1968. Act 281, enacted in 1970, lays down the financial provisions for the implementation of the new regional system and authorises the government (Article 17) to enact legislation transferring functions and personnel from the state to the regions. Under Act 382/1975, the state undertook to complete the delegation of powers through new delegating legislation, which resulted in Decrees 616-617-618 in 1977. The third phase in the transfer of administrative functions to the regions was carried out recently and was decidedly regionalist, not to say federalist, in character. This process has come to be known as \u201cfederalism with an unchanged constitution\u201d. It was initiated through Act 59/1997, known as the Bassanini Bill (Bassanini was the minister for public administration at the time). This act, which was partly inspired by the principle of subsidiarity, led to the enactment of important legislative decrees delegating administrative functions and responsibilities to the regional and local authorities, in particular, legislative decree 112/1988. As this major devolutionary process based on an unchanged constitution began to take shape, the full-scale constitutional reform which had been prepared by a special bicameral commission ",
        "46 failed yet again. Faced with the inability to implement a full-scale reform, a new \u201csector-by-sector\u201d approach was adopted and was used between 1999 and 2001 to reform Title V of the constitution. 1.1.1 The evolution of regionalisation/federalisation procedures and decentralisation processes. The most recent institutional developments In 1999 and 2001, two important constitutional laws were adopted that radically amended Title V of part II of the constitution, governing regions, provinces, and municipalities 1 . The laws in question are constitutional law 1 of 22 November 1999 and constitutional law 3 of 18 October 2001. Furthermore, constitutional law 2 of 31 January 2001 grants special statute regions administrative powers relating to self- government that run parallel to reforms under constitutional law 1/99, regulating the form of government and statutory autonomy of ordinary regions. 1.1.1.1 Reforms concerning the statutory autonomy of regions Constitutional law 1/99 regulates procedures for the approval of statutes for ordinary regions, and the contents thereof. The most significant reform regarding approval 1 Under Article 131 of the constitution \"The following regions have been established: Piedmont, Valle d'Aosta, Lombardy, Trentino-AltoAdige/S\u00fcdtirol, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Liguria, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, Lazio, Abruzzi, Molise, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily, Sardinia\". With regard to special statute regions, Article 116(1) and (2) provides that \u201cFriuli-Venezia Giulia, Sardinia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtir\u00f6l and the Valle d'Aosta are granted specific forms and conditions of autonomy under the terms of special statutes governed by constitutional law. The Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol region is made up of the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano.\" ",
        "47 procedures is that these statutes are no longer subject to approval by an Act of Parliament, as stipulated in the previous constitution, but through strengthened regional procedures. Revised Article 123(2) of the constitution thus stipulates that statutes are to be approved twice by an absolute majority of the regional council at two separate sittings that are separated by a period not inferior to two months. The statute should be published following the second approval. If one fiftieth of the regional electorate or one fifth of the regional council so request, a referendum on the statute may be held within three months of publication. The statute will not be adopted unless it is approved by a majority of valid votes. Furthermore, the referendum for the adoption of the statute is not subject to a turn-out quorum 2 . The government may challenge the constitutionality of a regional statute by bringing it before the Constitutional Court within 30 days of its publication (see Constitutional Court ruling 304/02 3 ) 4 . With regard to the content of the new statutes, revised Article 123 identifies certain essential aspects that must \"comply\" with the constitution. The concept of \"compliance\" has recently been defined by the Constitutional Court, which ruled that statutes \"must comply with the precepts and principles that derive from the constitution\" 5 . 2 Minimum percentage turn-out of eligible voters required to validate the referendum 3 For a commentary on ruling 304/02, see Mangiameli S. (2002), pp. 2358-2365 4 For government control over regional statutes, see Olivetti M. (2002), p. 103 et seq. 5 Rulings 304/02, 196/03 and 2/04 in www.giurcost.org ",
        "48 Article 123 identifies six specific areas which are to be governed by the regional statutes: the form of government 6 , the fundamental principles underlying organisation and administration, the right of initiative, referendums, the publication of laws and regulations, and the composition and organisation of the regional council (regional parliament). Furthermore, in constitutional case 313/03, the Constitutional Court ruled that, since the regional statute regulated relations between the regions' constitutional bodies, it was the instrument best suited to designate the competent authority for approving regional regulations. Needless to say, this does not exclude the possibility that several institutions might share such regulatory powers. In such cases, this would enable regional law to \"regulate and administer such powers according to the matter to be regulated and within the discretionary scope that the law conferred upon the regulatory authority\" 7 . Other areas to be governed by the statutes, in accordance with the increased legislative powers devolved upon the regions under constitutional law 3/01, might include \"programmatic\" provisions and provisions of principle 8 , or the identification of principles for regional organisation and regulations; under law 3/01, these matters now fall within the exclusive legislative remit of regional authorities. The statutes could also be used to further develop principles mentioned in revised Title V, such as 6 In constitutional case 196/03, in www.federalismi.it , the Constitutional Court ruled that the concept \u201cform of government \u201d must also include the regional bodies\u2019 prorogatio, which should, at least in principle be governed by the regional statute except in exceptional cases where dissolution has been ordered in accordance with Article 126(1) of the Constitution. 7 For a commentary on ruling 313/03, see Caravita (2003); Lucarelli A. (2003); Salvemini L. (2003); Balboni E. (2003); see also ruling 324/03 in www.federalismi.it 8 Programmatic provisions - unlike preceptive provisions, which are addressed to all those who are subject to the legal order \u2013 are addressed to the legislator, who is responsible for their actual implementation.

        "49 the \"removal of obstacles that prevent men and women from participating in social, cultural and economic life on equal terms\" and the \"promotion of equal access to elected office for men and women\" (Article 117(7) and Constitutional Court ruling 49/03) and the principles of vertical and horizontal subsidiarity (Article 118). (For recent developments on the same subject, see Constitutional Court ruling 2/04 9 .) 1.1.1.2 Changes to the form of regional government Constitutional law 1/99 defined a non-mandatory model for regional government which overturned the previous model centring on a parliamentary assembly, and made provision for regional presidents to be elected directly by the regional electorate. Although the president\u2019s authority has been reinforced, the form of regional government remains parliamentary in character 10 . According to the terms of new Article 126(3), a vote of no confidence is not the only means whereby a regional council may be dissolved. Article 126 provides that certain events affecting the directly elected president of the regional cabinet (or g iunta ) could lead to the dissolution of the regional council and the resignation of the giunta , namely the dismissal, permanent incapacitation, death or voluntary resignation of the giunta president. The revised text of the last paragraph of Article 126, however, prevents such action from being taken in cases where the regional statute has provided for a form of government other than the one proposed in the constitution and based on the election of the giunta president by direct universal suffrage. 9 For a commentary on ruling 2/04, see Grassi S. (2004) 10 Caravita B. (2002), p. 61 ",
        "50 In fact, whilst constitutional law 1/99 provides a model form of regional government based on the election of the giunta president by direct universal suffrage, it nevertheless grants the regional statutes the right to opt for a different form of regional government, albeit within certain limits. According to the terms of the final paragraph of revised Article 122, the regional giunta president is to be elected by direct universal suffrage \"unless the regional statute provides otherwise. The elected president shall appoint and dismiss the members of the giunta .\" Hence, the regional statute is the source of law that governs the region\u2019s form of government and the fundamental principles underpinning its organisation and administration. Such statutes must comply with the constitution, as specified in revised Article 123(1) and confirmed by recent constitutional case law. Should regions opt for a form of government other than the one defined in the constitution, they nevertheless remain bound by other constitutional provisions, in particular Article 126(2) entitling the council to initiate a motion of no confidence against the giunta president. Furthermore, Article 126(3) 11 specifies in its final sentence that the voluntary resignation of a majority of the council\u2019s members entails the dissolution of the council and the resignation of the giunta . In the recent Constitutional Court ruling 2/04, concerning the constitutionality of the Calabrian regional statute, the Court went further in defining the limitations placed upon the regional statute\u2019s authority to decide the region\u2019s form of government. In particular, making reference to its own case law on compliance with the constitution, it ruled that once a region opts for the model proposed by the constitution, (i.e. that 11 Mangiameli S. (2000), p. 572 et seq. ",
        "51 the regional president be elected by direct suffrage), the region can no longer alter those constitutional provisions 12 . Finally, given that the fiduciary bond is an inalienable aspect of regional government, it follows that a regional statute may not adopt a presidential or \"directorial\" form of government. A semi-presidential model is also excluded since the two-headed nature of its executive is its defining characteristic. Such a situation would be inadmissible at regional level since the giunta president is also the regional president. 1.1.1.3 The regions\u2019 legislative powers over electoral matters (Article 122 of the constitution) Other competences entrusted to the regions by constitutional law 1/99 concern the regulation of the electoral system, and the ineligibility or incompatibilities of the giunta president and the regional councillors, with due respect for the fundamental principles of the constitution. Under Article 122(1), the establishment of fundamental principles lies solely with the state, as do the elected bodies\u2019 terms of office. Article 122(2) states that a regional councillor may not at the same time be a member of the national or European Parliament or of another regional council or giunta . Constitutional Court ruling 196/03 recently defined the limitations of regional legislative powers in electoral matters. A subsequent ruling, 2/04, on regional legislative authority over electoral matters, specified that \"statutory provisions that directly regulate, at least in part, aspects of the electoral system which should be governed by national law are inadmissible ... as are those that fall within the region\u2019s jurisdiction but are contrary, in spirit or fact, to the fundamental principles laid down in Article 122 of the constitution\". 12 For an opinion on the ruling see Grassi S. (2004) and Vizioli N. (2004). The regional statute of Calabria may be accessed on www.federalismi.it ",
        "52 Parliament is currently examining draft legislation governing the underlying principles. Nevertheless, regions are permitted to legislate on related matters before the promulgation of the relevant regulatory principles (Constitutional Court rulings 304/02 and 383/02). 1.1.2 Relations between central government and the regional/local levels of government Constitutional law 3/01, amending Title V of the constitution, profoundly modifies the complex relationship between the state, the regions and the local authorities. Under the terms of revised Article 114, \"the republic is made up of municipalities, metropolitan cities, provinces, regions and the state\". The old text specified that \"the republic is made up of regions, provinces and municipalities\". Revised Article 114(2) extends the application of abolished Article 115 13 (which referred exclusively to regions) to cover regions, provinces, metropolitan cities and municipalities. The constitution thereby expressly recognises, not only regions, but also municipalities, provinces, and metropolitan cities as autonomous entities with their own statutes, powers and functions 14 . The constitution therefore remains the guarantor of self-government powers and defines relations between the state and local authorities 15 . 13 Article 115, which was abolished under Constitutional law 3/01, specified that \"the regions are autonomous entities having their own powers and functions in accordance with the principles laid down in the Constitution\". 14 With specific reference to local authorities, under revised Article 117, the state has exclusive legislative powers over electoral matters, and over the fundamental governing and administrative bodies of municipalities, provinces and metropolitan cities. 15 Caravita B. (2002), p. 33 ",
        "53 Article 114, final paragraph, affirms the role of Rome as the capital of the republic and specifies that its status must be governed by national law. Revised Article 114 thus places the components of the republic on a broadly equal legal footing but with differing competences, as constitutional law 3/01 abolished the heteronomous control of one component over another. In particular, the constitution no longer provides for state control over regional laws (Article 127 \u2013 old text) 16 , state control over regional acts (abolished Article 125) 17 , or regional control over local authorities' acts (abolished Article 130). Constitutional law 3/01 also abolished the role of the government commissioner. This was a government representative, based in each regional capital, who supervised the state's administrative activities there and coordinated such activities with those of the region (abolished Article 124). Nevertheless, Title V of the constitution makes frequent reference to the concept of economic and legal unity cited in revised Article 120(2), which lays down the terms under which the state may substitute regions or local authorities. This paragraph clearly serves to counterbalance the above-mentioned abolition of state control and, most probably, to compensate for the deletion of the specific stipulation in the old Article 117 that regional legislation must respect the national interest, a matter that was left to the discretion of the national parliament. 16 Drago F. (2003a) 17 Corpacci A. (2001), p. 1321 et seq. ",
        "54 There are differing schools of thought as to whether the concept of national interest survives in the revised Title V. According to some commentators 18 , although the revised text does not explicitly refer to national interest, it is implied by the concept of the \"unity\" and \"indivisibility\" of the republic referred to in Article 5 19 . According to other authorities, a generic \"national interest\" has ceased to exist and has been replaced by other specific concepts: legal unity; economic unity; the setting of basic standards for those civil and social rights which must be guaranteed throughout the national territory (Article 117(2)(m)); exclusive state control over foreign policy (Article 117(2)(a)); fundamental principles of national law governing concurrent powers, including the coordination of public finance and taxation, and the equalisation fund. Hence, the concept of \"national interest\" as a means of restricting and assessing regional laws through (parliament and) the Constitutional Court is substituted by a reference to enabling provisions that are applicable in separate and distinct cases 20 . Constitutional Court ruling 303/03 recognises that \"the national interest no longer constitutes a legal or substantive constraint on regional legislative powers\". Nevertheless, it points out that the Italian constitutional system possesses the means to react to the need for national unity. In the above-mentioned decision, the Court affirms that the Italian constitutional system contains devices that allow flexibility in contexts where rights and responsibilities overlap in such a way as to impinge upon the need for unity in innumerable aspects of life \"which, as a matter of judicial principle, rely upon the principle of unity and indivisibility laid down in Article 5 of 18 Barbera A. (2002) 19 Article 5 of the Constitution lays down that \"The republic, which is one and indivisible, recognises and promotes local autonomy. It fully applies administrative decentralisation of state services and adapts its principles and methods of legislation to the requirements of autonomy and decentralisation.\" 20 See Tosi R. (2002) and Anzon A. (2002b), pp. 213-215 ",
        "55 the constitution\". Basing itself on this premise, the Court cites Article 118(1) (see point 1.1.2.4 below) as demonstrating such an element of flexibility. The paragraph specifies that the administrative functions generally entrusted to municipalities may be delegated to another tier of government to ensure uniform practice, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity, differentiation and adequacy. The Court considers that when the need for uniform practice requires that administrative functions be performed by the state: \"legal principle dictates that even functions governed by the subsidiarity principle should be administered and regulated by law. It therefore follows logically that individual regions, with different laws, are unable to organise and regulate administrative functions of national scope, and that such functions can only be governed by national law\" 21 . 21 For opinions on ruling 303/03 see Anzon A. (2003)a, Caravita B. (2003), D\u2019Atena (2003)a, Morrone A. (2003).

See also the more recent ruling 6/04. ",
        "56 1.1.2.1 The redistribution of legislative and regulatory authority: the integration of competences Constitutional law 3/01, amending Article 117 of the constitution, redistributes legislative and regulatory powers 22 between the state and the regions, and lays down the regulatory framework for local government. With regard to legislative authority, revised Article 117 includes a list of matters that fall under the exclusive authority of the state (paragraph 2), which did not appear in the old Article 117. It further includes a much more extensive list of matters that are subject to concurrent legislation of both the state and regions (paragraph 3), and a concluding provision that assigns to the exclusive legislative authority of the regions (also described as \"residual\" competences), matters that do not fall within the exclusive remit of the state or the concurrent remit of the state and region (paragraph 4). 22 Under Law 400/88, the state is responsible for \"enforcement\" legislation (governing the enforcement of laws, legislative decrees and Community law); \"implementing and supplementing\" legislation (laws that govern the enactment and implementation of laws, legislative decrees on principles of law. Legislation on matters within the remit of the region is excluded); \"administrative\" law (governing the administration and functions of public administration in accordance with the relevant legal provisions; \"independent regulations\" (governing matters not regulated by law or acts having force of law, provided that such matters are not strictly matters of law); authorised regulations (concerning matters that are not strictly governed by law foreseen by the constitution and which, falling under the regulatory authority of the government, determine the general regulatory provisions and the abolition of regulations in force, with immediate effect upon the entry into force of the regulatory provisions). In the hierarchy of legislation, formal laws take precedence over regulations. However, in some cases (independent and authorised regulations), regulations have force of law in substantive terms. At a national level such provisions emanate from the government. On a regional level, following the revision of Title V of the constitution, the statute must specify which body (legislative assembly, regional government) or bodies (both) have authority (Constitutional Court ruling 131/03). On this subject, see point 1.1.1.1 above. ",
        "57 In retaining concurrent legislative powers, extending the number of matters to which they apply and broadening the regions\u2019 scope for exercising these powers (which are now their prerogative \"barring\" the State\u2019s authority over fundamental principles and no longer \"with due respect for\" the latter 23 ), the revised constitution has clearly opted for a federal model that aims to integrate rather than separate legislative powers. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether it would be admissible, under the new Title V, to introduce provisional national legislation on matters of concurrent competence if the regional legislator failed to act, with such legislation remaining in force until the regional legislator remedied this omission 24 . The state\u2019s lead-role in matters of concurrent competence \u2013 such as \"the setting of basic standards for those civil and social rights which must be maintained throughout the national territory\" and the protection of the environment 25 \u2013 is surely indicative of the 2001 constitutional legislator\u2019s preference for a \"cooperative federalist model\". In exercising such powers, the state is able to intervene in matters that fall exclusively within the region\u2019s legislative remit (see Constitutional Court rulings 282/02 and 536/02) 26 . 23 As provided under the old Article 117. 24 See Constitutional Court ruling 282/02 in Constitutional Jurisprudence 2002, see D\u2019Atena A. (2002b) p. 2026 et seq. See also ruling 303/03. 25 As interpreted in Constitutional Court ruling 407/02. 26 In ruling 282/02 in www.federalismi.it, regarding state authority over basic standards for services relating to civil and social rights, the Court ruled that civil and social rights are not \"matters\" in the strict sense of the word. They include all areas where the state legislator should have the authority to introduce the necessary measures to ensure that all citizens throughout the national territory have access to the same services, which are fundamental to such rights. This being the case, such services may not be curbed or conditioned by regional legislation. ",
        "58 The provisions of revised Article 117 of the constitution were implemented under Act 131/03 27 . Constitutional law 3/01 introduces a further new dimension to the distribution of legislative powers, which is embodied in Article 116(3) of the constitution. This establishes the right for ordinary statute regions to obtain \"further forms and specific conditions of autonomy\" in matters subject to concurrent legislation, as well as in certain specified matters subject to the state\u2019s exclusive authority 28 . 27 Article 1(2) of Act 131 specifies that \"State legislation regulating matters that are governed by regional legislation will continue to apply after the present law has come into force and until the relevant regional legislation is in place as per paragraph 3 and subject to any subsequent rulings by the Constitutional Court. Similarly, regional provisions governing matters within the state\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction will continue to apply until the relevant national legislation is in place, and subject to any subsequent rulings by the Constitutional Court\". Article 1(3) of Act 131 specifies that \"in matters subject to concurrent legislative powers, the regions shall exercise their legislative authority within the framework of the fundamental principles laid down by the state or, in the absence of expressly stated principles, in accordance with principles that may be inferred from state legislation in force\". With a view to orientating the state and regional legislative process prior to the entry into force of parliamentary Acts laying down the fundamental principles, Article 1(4) of Act 131 delegates to the government the responsibility of adopting, \"within one year of the present law\u2019s entry into force\", one or more legislative decrees of a purely indicative nature, outlining the fundamental principles that may be inferred from existing legislation on concurrent legislative powers and based on the principles of exclusiveness, adequacy, clarity, proportionality and homogeneity, as well as other criteria specified in Article 1(5) and (6). 28 This refers to some of the matters mentioned in Article 117(2) of the constitution: (l) administration of law and order (n) general provisions on education and (s) protection of the environment, ecosystem and cultural heritage. ",
        "59 According to some authoritative legal opinions 29 , in substantive terms, \"promoting autonomy in this manner should result in a transition from concurrent powers to full regional authority, and, in the case of matters referred to under the above-mentioned subparagraphs, a transition from exclusive state authority to concurrent authority\". At the initiative of the region concerned, and after consultation with the local authorities, the above-mentioned further conditions of autonomy may be granted to other regions through national legislation, subject to respect for the principles of financial autonomy laid down in Article 119. Under Article 116, such legislation may be passed subject to an absolute majority in the houses of parliament, and contingent upon prior agreement between the state and the region concerned. Furthermore, the constitutional legislator of 2001, mindful of the fact that ordinary statute regions might now have broader autonomy than had previously been granted to special statute regions, established the principle whereby the provisions of constitutional law 3/01 became applicable to special statute regions and to autonomous provinces \"in all instances where those provisions grant greater autonomy than had previously been accorded\" (constitutional law 3/01, Article 10) 30 . Revised Article 117 grants the state the power to issue by-laws in matters that fall within its exclusive jurisdiction, insofar as it does not devolve this power to the regions. In any other matters, the power to issue by-laws is vested in the regions. Finally, it grants local authorities regulatory power with respect to the organisation and fulfilment of the functions assigned to them (Article 117(6)). 29 Martines. T., Ruggeri. A., Salazar C (2002), p. 21 30 See Constitutional Court ruling 8/04. ",
        "60 1.1.2.2 The constitutionality of substitution by the state. The regions\u2019 substitution powers As previously specified, constitutional law 3/01 explicitly gives \"the government\" the authority to substitute regional and local bodies in order to safeguard legal unity, economic unity, public safety and security, and basic social services, and to ensure compliance with international and Community law 31 . However, it remains unclear whether the government is entitled to intervene at a legislative, as well as an administrative, level. According to one school of thought 32 , such a possibility is excluded by the explicit reference, in Article 120(2) of the constitution, to the substitution of \"bodies\" and, more generally, by the \"manifest intention of the constitutional legislator to uphold previous provisions concerning the state's powers to substitute the regions, based on ordinary legislation preceding the Bassanini reform\", which restricted state intervention to administrative functions alone. Nevertheless, it must be noted that, in deference to traditional constitutional case law on substitution powers, Article 120(2) gives state law the responsibility of establishing procedures to ensure that such powers are exercised in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and loyal cooperation 33 . 31 Article 120(2) of the constitution provides that \"the government may substitute the bodies of the regions, metropolitan cities, provinces and municipalities in case of non-compliance with international or Community legislation, grave risk to public safety or security, or wherever necessary in order to safeguard legal or economic unity, or basic social services pertaining to civil and social rights, irrespective of local government boundaries. The law shall lay down appropriate procedures to ensure that substitution powers are exercised in compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and loyal cooperation\". 32 Anzon A. (2002)b, p. 217 33 See Dickmann R. (2003), p. 485 et seq., on substitution powers. ",
        "61 Furthermore, in its recent ruling 43/04, the Constitutional Court reaffirmed that \"Article 120(2) does not, as a matter of principle, exclude the possibility that, in matters which fall within regional jurisdiction, and in regulating the exercise of municipal administrative functions in accordance with Article 117(3) and (4), and Article 118(1) and (2), regional law could provide for regional substitution powers for mandatory acts or activities, in case of non-performance by the competent body, in order to ensure that unity is not compromised by that non-performance\". 1.1.2.3 Prohibition of State acts intended to guide or coordinate matters governed by the concurrent legislative powers of the regions Act 131/03 34 implementing revised Title V of the constitution no longer makes any reference to state acts guiding or coordinating regional administrative activities, whose regulation had been reformed under Article 8 of constitutional law 59/1997. In the light of revised Title V\u2019s silence on this subject, and shortly after constitutional law 3/01 came into force, legal doctrine 35 and administrative case law supported the view that the prohibition of State acts guiding or coordinating concurrent legislative powers arose directly from revised Title V. Under revised Article 117(3) and (6), the state may only intervene through laws of principle (see Council of State, Consultative section, plenary session of 11 and 22 April 2002, and Regional administrative court of Lombardy ordinance 546/02) 36 . 34 For a commentary on Act 131/03, see Carli M.

(2002), p. 248-249 36 For the principle of subsidiarity, see previously cited Constitutional Court rulings 303/03 and 4/04. For a commentary, see Bartoli S. (2003). ",
        "62 1.1.2.4 Revised Article 118 of the constitution, upholding the principle of subsidiarity The reference to the subsidiarity principle in Article 118(1) and (3) is another characteristic element of the cooperative federalist model promoted by the 2001 constitutional reform. The principle of subsidiarity is referred to in its vertical sense, in that the constitution expresses a preference for administrative functions being carried out by the local authorities that are closest to the citizen (Article 118(1)). It is also referred to in its horizontal sense, in that it promotes the public-interest initiatives of citizens, be they individuals or associations representing civil society. More specifically, Article 118(1) and (3) specify that: 1. Administrative functions are assigned to municipalities except in cases where the need for uniform practice requires that they be assigned to provinces, metropolitan cities, regions or the state, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. 3. The state, regions, metropolitan cities, provinces and municipalities are to promote the independent initiatives of citizens, be they individuals or associations, in the performance of activities that are in the public interest, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. ",
        "63 1.1.2.5 The principle of loyal cooperation: absence of provisions making express reference to said principle or to the establishment of permanent debate and coordination forums for the state, regions and local authorities Revised Title V of the constitution does not pay sufficient attention to the principle of loyal cooperation between the state and the regions. This principle, which is only referred to in Article 120(2), seeks to avoid formalistic separations of power between the two tiers of government in order to ensure that their respective functions are performed in as efficient and as coordinated a manner as possible, and in accordance with the constitutional principle of well-managed public administration. The principle was established by constitutional case law, which traditionally cites Article 5 of the constitution as its premise 37 . (See Constitutional Court rulings 359/85; 151 and 153/86; 214/88; 101 and 138/89; 21 and 351/91; 389 and 520/95; 242/97393/99.) In 1997, Act 59, for the first time, transmuted the concept from case law to statutory law. Since then, it has even been cited by other legal texts as a reference for relations between regions and local authorities (see legislative decree 267/00). Despite this, the 2001 constitutional legislator chose not to include it in the revised constitution. The only new element introduced by constitutional law 3/01 concerning loyal cooperation is found in Article 11, whereby parliamentary standing orders may provide for the participation of representatives from regions, provinces and other local authorities in bicameral commission proceedings that concern regional affairs. 37 Article 5 of the constitution states that \"The republic, which is one and indivisible, recognises and promotes local autonomy. It implements extensive administrative decentralisation of public services and adapts its principles and methods of legislation to the requirements of autonomy and decentralisation.\" ",
        "64 However, according to some legal commentators, regional and local participation, as provided for in constitutional law 3/01, would appear to be \"purely functional (and not structural), being conducted on an ad hoc basis, within the limits to be established by parliamentary regulations\" 38 . Furthermore, under Article 11 of constitutional law 3/01, when the joint commission expresses a negative or not entirely positive opinion regarding amendments to draft legislation concerning matters of concurrent jurisdiction or federal taxation, and the examining commission has failed to reach a compromise, the final decision on the relevant passages rests with the Assembly, on the basis of an absolute majority. Most legal commentators feel that these procedures are inadequate for ensuring proper regional participation. In fact, several authorities emphasise the need for permanent cooperation bodies at constitutional level, for instance a \"house\" or a \"senate\" of regions that could become \"the region's forum for dialogue with central government ..., and central government\u2019s instrument for dialogue with the regions\" 39 . The establishment of a \"house of regions\" would also ensure regional participation in the ultimate authority, i.e. the constitutional reform process. 1.1.2.6 Cooperation forums established by state legislation, and the role of agreements between the state and the regions At present, the only permanent forums for cooperation between the state and regions on the one hand, and the state, regions and local authorities on the other, are the 38 Martines T., Ruggeri A., Salazar C.

        "65 State-Regions Conference and the Joint Conference, i.e. the Joint State-Regions- Cities-Local Authorities Conference, whose functions were recently defined in legislative decree 281/97. This decree also encompassed the State-Cities Conference, as a forum for dialogue between the state and local authorities. However, the main shortcoming of such conferences is that only regional executive bodies are represented. With regard to functions, the State-Regions Conference must be consulted on draft legislation and legislative decrees or government regulations that concern the competences of regions and autonomous provinces, whereas the Joint Conference meets to deal with matters and responsibilities that are common to regions, provinces, municipalities and mountain communities. The State-Regions Conference and the Joint Conference are both authorised to promote and approve agreements between the government and the regions, in the first case, and the government, regions, provinces, municipalities and mountain communities, in the second case. These agreements are designed to coordinate the exercise of each authority\u2019s competences and coordinate activities of joint interest, and to ensure the exchange of information between the authorities concerned 40 . The problem presented by state-region agreements is substantially a matter of where to situate them within the legislative framework. In fact, in order to gain force of law 40 When legislative decree 281/97 came into force, the state and the regions concluded an important agreement on health, which was later implemented through Act 405/01. Following the reform of Title V of the constitution, the state and the regions entered into another agreement on tourism, which falls within the regions\u2019 exclusive jurisdiction. This agreement was later implemented through prime ministerial decree (DPCM) of 13 September 2002. Other agreements between the state and specific regions concern the implementation of state legislation regarding public works. ",
        "66 they must be transmuted into state laws or into prime ministerial decrees. Nevertheless, Constitutional Court ruling 197/03 41 would appear to have implicitly recognised the regions\u2019 authority to enter into agreements to regulate matters that fall within their exclusive jurisdiction (for previous case law see Constitutional Court rulings 206 and 437/01) 42 . In the wake of revised Title V, and in particular the new distribution of legislative and regulatory powers established under constitutional law 3/01, a more thorough analysis of both the scope and legal efficacy of these agreements is necessary. In particular, concerning matters that fall within the regions\u2019 exclusive jurisdiction, such agreements would, in all probability, apply primarily to sectors that nevertheless require a degree of coordination at national level. On the other hand, in matters of concurrent authority, an agreement could serve as a state-regions coordination mechanism for identifying the most congruent form of application of state legislation principles, even at the level of secondary and administrative application. Finally, reference should be made to two other bodies: the Conference of Regional Presidents, which is the forum for the heads of regional executive bodies; and the Conference for Presidents of the Assembly and Regional and Provincial Councils, which is the forum for the presidents of Italian regional councils. 41 See www.federalismi.it 42 See recent Constitutional Court rulings 313/03 and 6/04 on the same subject.

        "67 1.1.2.7 The constitutional enshrinement of the Council of Local Authorities (revised Article 123(4)) The revised Article 123(4) of the constitution requires new regional statutes to set up a Council of Local Authorities as a forum for internal regional coordination, i.e. \"a body for consultation between the region and the local authorities\". According to some legal authorities, \"the revised constitution has paid greater attention to coordination between subnational authorities than to state-region relations, even though the statutory provisions restrict the council to a consultative role\" 43 . Prior to constitutional law 3/01, Article 3(5) of legislative decree 112/98 granted regions the authority to establish, within the framework of their legislative autonomy, \"mechanisms and procedures for dialogue and coordination, which could even have a permanent nature, with a view to establishing structural and functional forms of cooperation that would ensure the cooperation to coordinate the respective activities of regions and local authorities\". Many regions implemented this provision by establishing local government \"conferences\". The composition and role of the Councils of Local Authorities are still being debated, together with the question of whether their opinions should be binding. 1.1.3 Local authority cooperation and associations Three important local authority associations are currently operative in Italy: the National Association of Italian Communes (municipalities) (ANCI), the Union of Italian Provinces (UPI), and the National Union of Mountain Communes (municipalities) and Communities (UNCEM). These associations have a high level of 43 Martines T., Ruggieri A., Salazar C. (2002), p. 252-253. ",

Finally, we should mention the Italian Association of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (AICCRE) 44 . 1.1.3.1 The National Association of Italian Communes (municipalities) - ANCI ANCI was founded in 1901 and currently represents 6,406 of the 8,104 Italian municipalities, i.e. 90% of the overall population. ANCI represents its members at institutions established under national law such as the State-Cities Conference and the Joint Conference, and also at European institutions such as the Committee of the Regions. It also promotes the role of its members and coordination between them, as well as their international relations and decentralised international cooperation activities. In this capacity, it is a member of international institutions such as the International Union of Local Authorities (IULA) and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe (CLRAE). ANCI established Ancitel 25 years ago in order to provide local authorities with videotel information and consultation services on matters relevant to them. In recent years, it has added further important services (Anciform, Ancicnc, Anciservizi), known collectively as \"the ANCI group\". Within each region, ANCI's regional associations, whose organisational structures mirror the national structure, fulfil the same role and objectives as the national association. In 1999, the \"coordinating body for metropolitan city mayors\" was added to ANCI. This provides a discussion forum where all metropolitan areas can meet to exchange experiences. Coordination activities are divided into three categories: institutional, economic and organisational. 44 For methods of cooperation, see points 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 above. ",
        "69 1.1.3.2 The Union of Italian Provinces \u2013 UPI The Union of Italian Provinces (UPI) was formed in 1908 and currently comprises 100 Italian provincial authorities and 14 metropolitan cities. UPI's main objectives include promoting and facilitating the activities of provincial authorities and metropolitan cities, and representing its members\u2019 interests at national, regional and European institutions. It also promotes initiatives that enhance the value of local, provincial and metropolitan city institutions, in furtherance of democracy, efficiency and citizen participation. UPI's regional unions, in addition to acting as mouthpieces for the provinces and metropolitan cities at regional level, help to define the national union\u2019s policies and participate in their implementation at regional level. Upitel, which offers technological administrative support to members, was set up to provide a \"single computer network for Italian provinces\". 1.1.3.3 The National Union of Mountain Communes (municipalities) and Communities \u2013 UNCEM The National Union of Mountain Communes (municipalities) and Communities represents 10 million Italian citizens distributed over 54% of the national territory. Founded 55 years ago, UNCEM includes 361 mountain communities and 4,201 municipalities that are classified as mountainous or partly mountainous, a number of provincial authorities and other authorities operating in mountain areas. The association aims to promote the socio-economic, civil, spatial and environmental development of mountain areas. To this end, it maintains relations with other local government and regional associations, and participates in the State-Cities Conference and the Joint Conference. Within the framework of decentralised international ",

Founded in 1951, the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR) currently includes 46 regional and local government associations from 33 European countries and has had a representation at the European Commission for 15 years. At the time of writing, AICCRE - the Italian associate member of CEMR - includes 84% of the provinces and 30% of the municipalities (communes) in Italy. The association seeks to further \"the development of European Member States that are founded on the full recognition, reinforcement and enhancement of local and regional self-government\" (AICCRE Statute, Article 1, 17 February 2003). AICCRE\u2019s objectives include the promotion of exchanges and twinning between European local and regional authorities, preservation of the ethnic, linguistic and cultural identities of different regions, and coordination of its members\u2019 initiatives to promote a united Europe based on federalism.

        "71 1.1.4 The evolution of the metropolitan government model: the role of the metropolitan cities One of the first responses to the need for providing Italian cities with adequate instruments to govern themselves dates back to 1990 (Act 142/1990 on the regulation of local authorities). Ten years later, T.u.e.l 267/2000, the consolidating statute on local authorities, laid down more detailed provisions for the establishment of metropolitan cities and areas. However, the governance of metropolitan cities in special statute regions was entrusted to the legislative authority of the region concerned. According to Article 22(1) of the consolidating statute (T.u.e.l), \"the areas comprising the municipalities of Turin, Milan, Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Bari, Naples and other municipalities that are closely integrated with them \u2026\" are considered to be metropolitan areas. In the above-mentioned areas, \"the principal municipality and its geographically contiguous municipalities ...\" may constitute a metropolitan city (T.u.e.l Article 23(1)), having the \"functions of a province\" (T.u.e.l Article 23(5)). Metropolitan cities in special statute regions include Cagliari (Sardinia), Catania, Messina and Palermo (Sicily), and Trieste (Friuli-Venezia Giulia). Constitutional law 3/01 granted metropolitan cities constitutional recognition for the first time. Revised Article 114 of the constitution thus provides that \"the republic is made up of municipalities, provinces, metropolitan cities, regions and the state. Municipalities, provinces, metropolitan cities and regions are autonomous entities, having their own statutes, powers and functions in accordance with the principles enshrined in the constitution. Rome is the capital of the republic. Its states is governed by national law.\" Furthermore, metropolitan cities are once again ",
        "72 mentioned in Article 118 of the constitution, which regulates the distribution of administrative functions amongst state, regions and local authorities, and in Article 119, which places them on equal footing with regions, municipalities and provinces as regards financing. Article 2 of Act 131 of 5 June 2003, implementing constitutional law 3/01, requires the government to issue, within one year of its entry into force, one or more legislative decrees specifying the basic functions that metropolitan cities, as well as municipalities and provinces, must perform for the administration and fulfilment of the relevant community\u2019s primary needs. The above-mentioned law further requires the government, in its capacity as national legislator, to revise legislation governing local authorities so as to ensure compliance with constitutional law 3/01. Ad hoc governance of metropolitan cities became a necessity due to the economic and demographic preponderance of Italy's 14 metropolitan cities, which house 40% of the Italian population and generate 42% of national wealth 45 . 1.2 The political and social players in the regionalisation/federalisation processes. The role of political parties and of other forms of associations In recent years, the Lega Nord (Northern League) is undoubtedly the political movement that has placed the federalisation of Italy at the top of its political agenda. Established in 1989 following the merger of a number of centre/northern protest movements, the Lega Nord initially adopted separatist policies. However, nine years later, abandoning its more radical secessionist stance, it argued forcefully in favour of institutional processes of devolution to subnational authorities, specifically citing the 45 See Declaration of intent of the mayors of the metropolitan cities, 21.12.2000 ",
        "73 example of Scotland 46 . Nevertheless, the first significant steps towards Italian regionalisation/federalisation were applied to the institutional framework during the XIII Legislature, when the Lega Nord was not a member of the ruling centre-left coalition. As specified above, constitutional laws 1/99, 2/01 and 3/01 amended a number of articles in Title V of Part II of the constitution. The reforms concerning governance and statutory autonomy granted by constitutional law 1/99 (see point 1.1.1) to ordinary regions were extended to special statute regions. Prior to the adoption of these laws, the reform process had evolved merely through doctrinal and political debate, amendments to ordinary legislation and failed constitutional reforms such as the Labriola draft bill of 1992, the Speroni proposal of 1995, and the text drawn up by the D\u2019Alema commission for constitutional reform. The reform process of Title V of the constitution also involved the limited participation of Italian citizens through a referendum approving the amendments introduced by constitutional law 3/01, in accordance with Article 138 of the constitution. The referendum of 7 October 2001 produced a turn-out of 33.9% and resulted in a 64% majority of valid votes in favour of the constitutional reform. The drafting of implementing legislation for Title V was carried out by the centre-right coalition that came into power following the 2001 national elections. Eighteen months after constitutional reform law 3/01 came into force on 8 November 2001, the Italian Parliament approved Act 131 on 5 June 2003. In April 2003, whilst the implementing legislation for revised Title V was still being examined by parliament, the government drew up a bill amending revised Title V. This came to be known as \"the reform of the reform\" (constitutional reform bill amending Title V of the constitution, adopted by the government on 11 April 2003).

At the time of writing, the bill is being debated in parliament, as is the draft legislation amending the second part of the constitution, referred to as the Lorenzago draft law, which was adopted by the government on 10 October 2003. The draft law proposes reforms that would affect regions, including a federal senate (upper house) and regional involvement in the appointment of constitutional judges 47 . 1.2.1 Regional organisation of political parties and movements The organisation of regional parties and political movements does not differ substantially from that of national parties in so far as parties and movements are divided into national, provincial, inter-municipal and municipal sections. Their organisation reflects the size and political strength of the party. For instance, the Lega Nord intends to open sections at all the above-mentioned levels 48 whilst the Union Vald\u00f4taine only has a municipal section 49 . In comparison with national parties, regional parties pay considerable attention to associations linked to their respective parties. The Lega Nord leads in this respect, with 23 associations operating in the social, cultural and religious spheres. 47 Constitutional bill 2544, in www.federalismi.it 48 Statute of the Lega Nord , 2002, Article 2 49 Statute of the Union Vald\u00f4taine , Article 11 ",
        "75 1.2.2 Regional parties Italian regional parties came into being after the second world war, and for the most part are still in existence. Their emergence is closely linked to the end of fascism and of its policy to \"Italianise\" all parts of the Italian state. In the case of Alto Adige (South Tyrol/ S\u00fcdtirol ) and the Valle d'Aosta/Vall\u00e9e d'Aoste , where the majority of inhabitants are German and French speaking respectively, the first regional parties were founded at the time of the liberation of Italy by the allied troops. The S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei and the Union Vald\u00f4taine were thus founded in 1945 to promote the autonomy of these regions and to safeguard their ethnolinguistic identity. Also in 1945, and for the same reasons, the Association for Regional Autonomy Studies was established in Trentino. This gave rise to various political movements including the Partito del Popolo Trentino Tirolese (party of the Tyrolean population of Trentino), which evolved into the present-day Partito Autonomista Trentino Tirolese (Tyrolean autonomist party of Trentino) (Paat Statute, 1999, Article 1). On the main Italian islands, i.e. Sardinia and Sicily, local parties defending their geographic and ethnolinguistic particularities had already come into existence before the end of the second world war. The establishment of the Movimento Indipendenza Sicilia (Sicilian independence movement) (MIS) coincided with the landing of allied troops in Sicily in 1943, whilst the Partito Sardo d\u2019Azione (Sardinian action party) (PSDAZ) dates back to 1921. In 1946, when the Constituent Assembly met to draw up the future Italian constitution, the MIS and PSDAZ were represented by four and two members respectively. Given the geographical, political and ethnolinguistic peculiarities of these islands, the Constituent Assembly had already envisaged a special autonomy regime for them 50 . At the time of writing, there are 20 Italian regions (Article 131 of the constitution), five of which - Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Sardinia, Sicily, Trentino- 50 Martines T. (1988), pp. 757, 771 ",
        "76 Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol (South Tyrol) and Valle d'Aosta \u2013 \"have their own special conditions of autonomy [\u2026.]\" (Article 116(1) of the constitution). Political and administrative elections in recent years reveal a rather patchy picture as regards regional parties 51 . In the central and northern regions, i.e. Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany and Umbria, the Lega Nord has wide representation. The Lega Nord includes the Liga Veneta, Lega Lombarda, Piemont Autonomista, Uniun Ligure, Alleanza Toscana-Lega Toscana-Movimento per la Toscana, and Lega Emiliano-Romagnola ( Lega Nord Statute 2002, Article 4). In the other ordinary statute regions, in particular Abruzzo, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Marche, Molise, Lazio and Puglia, there are no regional parties whose defining ideology is autonomy. The nomination of giunta presidents (law 43/95) and, subsequently, their election by direct suffrage, resulted in \"a restructuring of the political system around the person of the president\", producing what has been described as a \"personal party\" 52 at regional level. This has led to a considerable weakening of the long-standing role of parties as catalysts for consensus 53 . No such party has, however, gained significant political weight. The five remaining special statute regions have deeply rooted regional parties whose political weight nevertheless varies greatly from one region to another. The most successful are undoubtedly the S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei and the Union Vald\u00f4taine . During the last regional elections, the S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei obtained 21 of 35 seats in the Province of Bolzano 54 , while the Union Vald\u00f4taine won 18 of 35 seats at the Valle d'Aosta 51 See election results, in particular, regional elections on the Ministry of the Interior website http://www.interno.it/sezioni/attivita/Le%elezioni/s_0000000050.htm and http://cedweb.mininterno.it:8900/ind_regio.htm 52 Calise M.

They hold fewer than 30 seats in the senate 56 , and no more than 40 in the chamber of deputies. The regional party with the greatest overall representation is the Lega Nord , which is part of the Casa delle Libert\u00e0 coalition which won the 13 May 2001 elections. The Lega succeeded in securing three ministries: justice, institutional reform and devolution, and labour and social policy. 1.3 The importance of cooperation and social dialogue At regional level, several statutes drafted since constitutional laws 1/99 and 3/01, have given full recognition to the principle of cooperation, and have established regional economic and labour councils to act as consultative, study and research bodies of the regional council and the giunta in the following fields: economic, social, and financial policy; budget and planning; socio-economic development; labour market and employment. As has been observed by some legal authorities, the Council of Local Authorities referred to in Article 123 of the constitution could serve to represent the interests not only of subnational authorities, but also of administrative and social authorities, thereby ensuring that the latter have a forum for dialogue with the region. 55 For further analysis, see Sterpa, A. 56 Senate elections, 13 May 2001: http://www.parlamento.it/leg/14/Elezioni/ef_naz.htm ",
        "78 II. DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AT REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL 2.1 Voting in national and regional/local elections National elections During the first forty years of the Italian republic (1947-1987), the national political landscape was essentially characterised by two constants. The first is the continuity of parties: most of the parties that stood for the elections of the Constituent Assembly were still active in the late 1980s 57 . The second is the parties\u2019 stable political strength. Barring a few specific exceptions, the voting percentages of individual parties rarely fluctuated by more than a single percentage point between one election and the next 58 . Turn-out fluctuated between 93% and 89%, showing a downward trend, whilst the number of blank votes rarely exceeded 2%. Meanwhile, regional political parties' representation in the two chambers of parliament gained strength slowly but surely. Regional political forces with well-established local roots, such as the Partito Sardo d\u2019Azione, the S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei and the Union Vald\u00f4taine , have almost invariably succeeded in obtaining one or more seats at national level. Nevertheless, the number of parliamentary seats held by the representatives of regional parties never exceeded six or seven in total 59 . Liga Veneta first gained a representative in the two chambers of parliament in 1983. According to research carried out in 1990 by Istat, several new parties and/or movements began to emerge from 1987 onwards. Some of these embraced 57 Istat, 1999, p. 59 58 Istat, 1990, p. 60 59 Istat 1990, p. 35-59 ",
        "79 environmental or \"green\" concerns, while others presented a populist challenge to national centralisation and/or an extreme regionalist stance ( Liga Veneta, Lega Lombarda ) 60 . During the 1990s, the Italian political landscape changed dramatically. At the 1992 elections, Lega Nord won 10.3% of the votes. This was a regional party that opposed the party system and was anti-centralisation and anti-south. The Lega provided a mouthpiece for the dissatisfied industrial classes and areas of northern Italy. The Lega 's success combined with other domestic 61 and foreign 62 political phenomena to provoke substantial changes in the Italian political arena and particularly affected the traditional parties. The 1990s thus witnessed the breakdown of two of Italy\u2019s major parties, the Christian Democratic Party and the Communist Party, and the birth in 1994 of Forza Italia , the party founded by the subsequent Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi. Forza Italia currently has the highest electoral representation in the national parliament. One decisive factor in the evolving Italian landscape was the referendum held on 18 April 1993 63 . On that occasion, 83% of the electorate voted to abolish the proportional representation system, effectively overturning the traditional balance of power between political parties and initiating the transition and transformation of the Italian political system 64 . 60 Istat 1990, p. 55 61 In particular, \" Tangentopoli\" (Bribe-opolis). This was an inquiry conducted by Milan investigating magistrates on bribes that had passed from private enterprises to political figures on behalf of their parties in exchange for contracts subject to public tender. 62 Including events in eastern Europe and the flagging global economy 63 Parliament implemented the reform through Acts 276 and 277 in 1993. Under the new electoral system, 75% of the members of each chamber of parliament are elected according to the single-member system. The remaining 25% are assigned according to proportional representation. 64 Diamanti I./Mannheimer R. (1994), p. 9 ",
        "80 The 27 March 1994 elections, which were carried out under the new system, revealed strong voter support for Forza Italia and its allies, mainly Lega Nord and Alleanza Nazionale (National Alliance). Together they obtained 58% of the seats in the chamber of deputies and 49.2% of those in the senate 65 . Diamanti and Mannheimer explain Forza Italia \u2019s success by pointing out that \"[Berlusconi] transferred northern industrial leadership to Rome. However, in doing so he 'nationalised' and therefore neutralised the tensions that the Lega had previously triggered and stifled the confrontations that had emerged vis-\u00e0-vis the south\" 66 . Nevertheless, northern Italian voters still strongly supported the policies of the Lega Nord, which succeeded in winning 180 parliamentary seats. Two years later, in 1996, Lega Nord decided to leave the coalition, triggering a crisis in the Berlusconi government and the calling of new elections. On that occasion, Lega Nord stood for election alone and lost more than half the seats it had obtained in 1994. Nevertheless, it succeeded in retaining 87 seats in parliament. Finally, Lega Nord once again joined a coalition headed by Berlusconi, La Casa della Libert\u00e0, in the 2001 elections. However, it failed to reverse the downward trend in its election results, obtaining 30 seats in the chamber of deputies and 17 in the senate. The national representation of the other regional parties mentioned above has, however, remained substantially unchanged, even during the 1996 and 2001 elections 67 . 65 Diamanti I./Mannheimer R. (1994), p. 12 66 Diamanti I./Mannheimer R. (1994), p. 9 67 For instance, the S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei obtained the following results: 1996 \u2013 3 deputies and 2 senators; 2001 \u2013 3 deputies and 3 senators (the results for 2001 were the same as those for 1992 and 1994). ",
        "81 Voter participation continued its downward trend. The lowest turn-out was in 2001, when 81.3% of registered voters cast their ballot at the senate elections 68 . Turn-out has thus fallen by more than 12% between the late 1940s and the time of writing. During the same period, the number of blank votes rose. In the 2001 chamber of deputies elections, 4.2% of the votes cast were blank, a figure that is two percentage points higher than the average attained prior to the 1980s 69 . Regional and local elections In discussing voter behaviour in regional elections, it is necessary to distinguish between ordinary statute regions and special statute regions. Between 1970 70 and the late 1980s the political landscape of the 15 ordinary statute regions reflected the national scenario. This is also true for turn-out and the percentage of blank votes cast 71 . At the regional elections on 12 May 1985, Liga Veneta , described as \"the mother of all leagues\" by Franco Rocchetta 72 , the president of Lega Nord , put forward candidates in all ordinary statute regions and won two seats on the Veneto regional council 73 . In the subsequent elections in 1990, Lega Lombarda followed suit and put forward candidates in all 15 regions. Its success was noteworthy in the Lombardy region, where it obtained 15 of the 80 seats on the regional council.

In special statute regions, regional elections date back to the immediate post-Second World War period (Sicily 1947; Trentino-Alto Adige 1948; Aosta Valley 1949; Sardinia 1949; Friuli- Venezia Giulia 1964). 71 Istat 1990, pp. 177-185.

        "82 other regions, Lega Lombarda , like other regional parties, failed to shift the traditional political balance of power 74 . An extremely similar political landscape was revealed during the 1995 elections. As a political party with strong regional ties, Lega Nord ( Lega Lombarda, Lega Piemontese, Liga Veneta ) remains the only regional party to have gained political weight (in northern Italy, from 21 seats in 1990 to 29 in 1995) 75 . However, at the same elections, the central and southern Italian electorate showed a preference for national parties 76 . Elections in special statute regions The following data have been gathered regarding the five special statute regions (Valle d'Aosta, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol, Sardinia and Sicily). Election results since 1949 reveal growing support for the local Union Vald\u00f4taine party. In 1954, it won its first seat on the regional council. In 1988, it held 12 of the 35 seats. In 2003, it obtained 47.25% of the votes cast, equivalent to 18 seats and, therefore, an absolute majority on the regional council. Until 1976, voting trends in Friuli-Venezia Giulia were similar to those in the rest of Italy. During the following decade, Lista per Trieste , a party with ethno-local leanings, succeeded in establishing itself, although it never gained more than four seats on the council. However, in contrast with trends in Valle d'Aosta, during regional elections in the 1990s the electorate swung back towards the national parties, 74 Ministry of the Interior, regional elections 1990 75 However, it is worth noting that in Lombardy from 1994 to 1995, Lega Lombarda dropped from a 22.1% share of votes in the national elections to 17.5% in the regional elections.

None of the three regional parties that stood for election obtained more than five seats 78 . Furthermore, turn-out was markedly below the national average, at merely 64.27% 79 . Similar trends regarding the political weight of local parties at regional elections have been observed in Sardinia and, above all, in Sicily. Here too, the electorate have traditionally favoured candidates from national parties. At the time of writing, local parties hold only six of the 80 seats on the Sardinian regional council, while in the Sicilian regional assembly, only 13 of the 90 members represent local political parties 80 . The provincial council of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano is made up of 35 members, who are also members of the Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol regional council 81 alongside provincial members from the Province of Trento. The S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei has traditionally held an absolute majority on Balzano provincial council ( Landtag ) winning 22 of the 35 available seats in 1988, 19 in 1993 and 21 in 1998. The elections of 26 October 2003 confirmed these figures. Despite falling from 56.6% to 55.6% of the vote, S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei remains the dominant political party with 21 seats; the second strongest party, Alleanza Nazionale , won only 8.4% 77 Diamanti I.

He was re-elected by 110,108 voters, i.e. one third of the province. Finally, it should be emphasised that the S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei has succeeded in maintaining an absolute majority in the autonomous province for 55 years 82 . Trento provincial council presents a completely different picture. No single party, be it national or local, has succeeded in having the same impact as the S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei . During its previous term of office, the council was, in fact, made up of 12 political grouping, none of which held more than eight of the 35 seats 83 . In further contrast to the Province of Bolzano, there is a longstanding and tangible predominance of national parties. The most successful party in the elections of 23 October 2003 was the Lista civica della Margherita , a centre-left coalition, which obtained 25.88% of the vote and 11 seats. The second most successful grouping was also a centre-left party, Sinistra Democratica e Riformista , which lagged behind by 12.25%, obtaining 13.63% of the vote and five seats. A similar result (13.42%) was achieved by the present majority party at national level, Forza Italia , which has five members on the council. Local political parties were far less successful than in Bolzano. The four local parties elected to the provincial council were the Partito Autonomo Trentino Tirolese (8.99%, 3 seats), Lega Nord Trentino (6.22%, 5 seats), Leali al Trentino (2.62%, 1 seat), and Unione Autonomista Ladina (1.11%, 1 seat) 84 . 82 http://www.landtag-bz.org/it/consiglieri.htm; Corriere della Sera of 29 October 2003 p. 11 83 http://www.consiglio.provincia.tn.it/consiglio/consiglieri_provinciali/ composizione_attuale_consiglio.asp. 84 http://www.provincia..tn.it/elezioni:/nuovoconsiglio/eletti.htm; Corriere della Sera of 29 October 2003 p. 11 ",
        "85 2.2 Forms and instruments of direct democracy As regional instruments of direct democracy, the constitution provides for legislative initiatives and referendums on regional legislation and administrative provisions. Article 123(1) establishes the regional statute\u2019s obligation to regulate these instruments. There would appear to be no restraints upon the regional statutory legislator\u2019s powers to decide which bodies should have the right of initiative, or the structure thereof. In addition to the bodies identified in statutes currently in force, draft statutes prepared by regions since the revision of Title V also vest the right of initiative in the Council of Local Authorities (see Article 39 of the Calabria draft statute, which was passed at a second reading on 31 July 2003). With regard to referendums, the wording of revised Article 123(1), as amended by the Title V reform, does not differ from the old text, specifying that the statute regulates \"the exercise ... of referendums on regional laws and administrative provisions\". Article 123(3) also provides for possible statutory revision proceedings through confirmative referendums: \"a popular referendum on the statute will be called if, within three months of its publication, one fiftieth of the regional electorate or one fifth of the regional council members so request. The statute shall not be adopted unless it is approved by a majority of valid votes\". The referendum is thus \"optional\", and plays a role alongside government control, during the incorporative phase of the regional statute\u2019s implementation. No quorum is required for the statute\u2019s adoption, which consequently facilitates its amendment. ",
        "86 Article 123(3) does not identify the body vested with the authority to initiate the referendum process. It may therefore be inferred from Article 123 85 that such authority resides in the statute itself. However, the first revision of regional statutes presents problems since the statute cannot regulate the procedures for its own formation. In practice, some regions have solved this problem by adopting ad hoc regional laws 86 . Article 132 of the constitution identifies referendums as the appropriate instruments for decisions relating to the merging of existing regions, the creation of new regions, or the transfer of a province or municipality, upon its own application, from one region to another. Under Article 132(1), a constitutional law may, subject to consultations with the regional councils, authorise the merging of existing regions or the creation of new regions with a minimum of 1 million inhabitants, upon application from a number of municipal councils representing at least one third of the affected population, and subject to approval by a referendum majority of that population. Under Article 132(2) it is possible, by means of a national law, for provinces or municipalities that so desire to leave one region and join another, subject to approval by the majority of the 85 Such inference is made from Article 123(1), which stipulates that \"the statute regulates the exercise of the right of initiative and referendum on regional laws and administrative provisions\", and from Article 123(2), where the statute is described as law of the region. 86 Emilia Romagna law 29/00, Calabria region law 35/01, Marche region law 28/02, Tuscany region law 6/03.

Furthermore, referendums may also be held upon application by a sufficient number of citizens. Finally, with regard to instruments of direct democracy, legal debate is ongoing as to whether regional statutes may institute the right of recall (a decision by the electorate to revoke the authority of a body or individual that holds public office). 2.3 Community identification with regional and local government Italians traditionally feel a strong identification with their local community, and in northern and central Italy this local feeling has always hindered the establishment of a wider regionalism 88 . Voters' sense of allegiance to their town or district presented substantial problems even for the political leagues that emerged in the regions during the 1980s 89 . In southern Italy, and notably in Sicily, regional ethno-linguistic and autonomist movements are not widespread, and the political classes have traditionally taken a centralist stance 90 . However, the importance of language as a key aspect of autonomous movements is well documented in Sardinia and Alto Adige (South Tyrol). In Sardinia, where there is widespread awareness of an \"island identity\", autonomist movements are, as has been seen, fairly limited. Local politicians, with a view to protecting the island\u2019s 87 On this subject, see constitutional case 343/03. 88 Levy C. (1966), p. 4-5, 15-16; For an in-depth analysis see Lyttelton A.

In recent years, this has also been the case in Valle d'Aosta, due to the decline in Alpine agriculture 92 . The establishment of special statute regions and ordinary statute regions, in 1970, and the emergence of political leagues, ten years later, have not changed people's sense of local allegiance. Precisely because of this, it has been suggested that the devolution process should grant further powers to local authorities 93 . In the historiography of the 1990s, there was discernible concern about a growing loss of Italian national identity, which was attributed to the rise of the regional leagues and a more pronounced Europeanism. A very recent study on this subject by Renato Mannheimer suggests that the situation has now changed. Mannheimer\u2019s research has revealed that the number of Italians who considered themselves to be \"first and foremost Italian\" (as opposed to European, or citizens of their city or region) has risen significantly since 2000 94 . Of one hundred people interviewed, only eight stated that they considered themselves to be citizens of the region they lived in, whereas 52 felt that they were, quite specifically, Italian 95 . 91 Levy C.

        "89 III. REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 3.1 The constitutional framework (economic and financial aspects) The provisions of the constitution outlining the pattern of state intervention in the economy are mainly laid down in Articles 41, 43 and 44. These articles define the relationship between private enterprise and property on the one hand and forms of public ownership on the other, and are directed at developing an economy designed to meet social objectives (Article 41), meet objectives of general interest (Article 43), ensure rational land use and establish equitable social relations (Article 44). There are several constitutional provisions for fulfiling these objectives: planning (Article 41(3)); the expropriation of specific enterprises and categories of enterprises linked to essential public services, energy sources or monopolies which are pre- eminently in the public interest, and their transfer to state, public authorities, or worker and consumer communities (Article 43); and agricultural reform (Article 44). Until a few years ago, direct state economic intervention was common; nowadays, the trend is for a gradual privatisation of public enterprises. With regard to financial arrangements, the constitution establishes two fundamental principles of taxation: everyone has to contribute towards public expenditure in proportion to their taxpaying capacity, and tax matters must be regulated by law. The former principle is enshrined in Article 53, which stipulates that \"everyone has to contribute to public expenditure in proportion to their taxpaying capacity. The tax system is founded on the principle of progressive taxation\". ",
        "90 The latter principle is enshrined in Article 23, which establishes the legal nature of taxation 96 . The reform of Title V of the constitution introduced new regulations on the financial autonomy of regions and local authorities; these mainly stem from revised Article 119. Article 119, paragraph 1 stipulates that \"municipalities, provinces, metropolitan cities and regions have revenue and expenditure autonomy\". This new constitutional element implies that \"they are self-financed, that is, they fund their own running, intervention and administrative costs, generally via contributions from local taxpayers; however, this is of course subject to the need to redistribute funds to help less advantaged areas\u201d 97 . Article 119, paragraph 2 stipulates that \"municipalities, provinces, metropolitan cities and regions have independent financial resources. They set and levy taxes and collect revenues of their own, in compliance with the constitution and according to the principles of coordination of public finance and the fiscal system. They receive a share of the proceeds of state taxes related to their territory\". In identifying the legal framework within which the financial autonomy of public authorities is established, this provision mentions both the constitution and \"the principles of coordination of public finance and the fiscal system\" 98 . The new Article 119 thus also makes a 96 Article 23 of the constitution stipulates that \u201cNo obligations of a personal or a financial nature may be imposed on any person except by law.\u201d 97 See Cerulli Irelli, V., (2001). 98 This provision recalls, in parts, the wording used in the old Article 119, paragraph 1, which gave national laws the task of coordinating regional funding with that of the state, provinces and municipalities. These national laws, however, were never enacted: in practice, the state only issued laws which regulated money transfers to the regions on an annual basis. The only coordination regulations are, perhaps, those relating to the internal stability pact. ",
        "91 reference to \"coordination\" and, particularly, to the principles of coordination by which regions and other authorities \"set and levy taxes and collect revenues of their own\". It is to be noted that, although regions were allocated that their \"own taxes\" under the original Article 119, constitutional law 3/01 clearly establishes a definite increase in the regions\u2019 tax-raising autonomy by extending this to \"own taxes and revenues\" 99 . Moreover, the new Article 119 seems to have extended pre-existing regional powers by specifying that regions and other authorities \"set and levy taxes and collect revenues\". The new Article 119, paragraph 2 stipulates that regions and other subnational authorities \"receive a share of the proceeds of state taxes related to their territory\" 100 . The most important innovation is the use of the wording \"related to their territory\": it highlights the fact that the regions\u2019 and local authorities\u2019 shares in state taxes are now commensurate with the revenue from state taxes in the area concerned. In other words, the provision introduces what some legal authorities have defined as the principle of \"territoriality of taxation\", i.e. the principle by which the revenue drawn from a given area, though collected by the state, must be returned to the same area. Following the amendments to Article 119, \"the share of the proceeds of state taxes\" should therefore be the sum produced in the area of the authority benefiting from the share system. Revised Article 119, paragraph 3 also stipulates that national law establishes an equalisation fund to benefit areas where the fiscal capacity per inhabitant is lower, with no restrictions as to the allocation of the proceeds. This is the third and final provision under Article 119 on the funding of regions and local authorities. 99 See also Pinelli, C., (2001), p. 122. 100 The old Article 119 allocated \u201c shares of state taxes\u201d to regions. ",
        "92 Therefore, regional and local funding is essentially made up of the following: 1) own revenues; 2) shares from proceeds of state taxes; 3) financial contributions to an equalisation fund. With regard to the equalisation fund - introduced ex novo \u201cwith no restrictions as to the allocation of proceeds\u201d \u2013 the rule laid down in the third paragraph of Article 119 raises a problem of interpretation: it is unclear whether \"lower\" fiscal capacity means \"lower\" than that of the richest region, or lower than the regional average. Article 119, paragraph 4 stipulates that \"the funds deriving from the sources mentioned in the previous paragraphs shall enable municipalities, provinces, metropolitan cities and regions to fully finance the public functions attributed to them\". This provision thus provides a general yardstick for assessing the adequacy of the resources allocated to the regions, as the resources mentioned in the first three paragraphs of Article 119 should together ensure that regional responsibilities can be carried out appropriately. Article 119, paragraph 5 stipulates that \"in order to promote economic development, social cohesion and solidarity, to remove economic and social inequalities, to foster the effective exercise of human rights, or to pursue ends other than those pertaining to the exercise of their ordinary functions, the state shall allocate additional resources and carry out special actions to the benefit of certain municipalities, provinces, metropolitan cities and regions\". The old Article 119 assigned \"special contributions\" to individual regions earmarked for \"specific purposes, and particularly to improve the Mezzogiorno\": the new text thus considerably extends the areas in which the state may allocate additional resources. ",
        "93 3.2 Privatisation and economic regulation Privatisation has been included in the government\u2019s programme since the 1990s: the severe budget deficit, the need to reform public accounts to bring them in line with the Maastricht criteria, and the establishment of the Autorit\u00e0 garante della concorrenza e del mercato (Italian Competition Authority) under the national antitrust law (Law 287/90) have greatly heavily influenced and accelerated the conversion of public enterprises which were previously state-controlled 101 . The privatisations of the 1990s began with the conversion of credit institutions into semi- public companies in order to increase the efficiency of banks and open up the lending sector to competition 102 . The conversion of public banks has produced two separate bodies: a public limited company providing banking services and a \"conferring body\", known as a banking foundation, which oversees its activities. The formal privatisation of state-controlled enterprises was imposed by a 1992 law which provided for the \"compulsory\" conversion of IRI ( Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale \u2013 Institute for Industrial Reconstruction), ENI ( Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi \u2013 National Petrochemical Authority), INA ( Istituto Nazionale delle assicurazioni \u2013 National Insurance Institute) and ENEL ( Ente Nazionale per l\u2019energia elettrica \u2013 National Electricity Authority) into public limited companies 103 . The main objective of these privatisations was to restore efficiency and 101 See Freni, E., (2003), p. 3951 et seq. In 1992, national public debt had reached a record LIT 1,634,000 billion, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 108.8%; in the same year, INI and ENI, the two main public holdings which employed approximately 515,000 workers at the time, recorded a net loss of over LIT 5000 billion: for more information on this subject, see Malgarini, M., (2000), p. 90. 102 See Law 218 of 30.7.1990, and d.lgs. 356 of 20.11.1990. 103 See Article 15, paragraph 1 of Law 359 of 8.8.1992, modifying Decree Law 333 of 11.7.1992. ",
        "94 competitiveness to former public enterprises by moving them to a competitive market 104 . The system governing the limited liability companies that have replaced former public enterprises is unique: the company shares from the compulsory conversion of IRI, ENI, INA and ENEL, together with those from BNL ( Banca Nazionale del Lavoro ) are allocated to the Treasury, which exercises shareholder rights \u2013 the so- called \"golden share\" \u2013 according to directives issued by the prime minister in agreement with the finance and industry ministers. These powers are exercised to safeguard national economic and industrial policy objectives. As well as the conversion of public enterprises, Law 352/92 (Article 18), following a decision of CIPE (the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning), provided for the conversion of other public-sector undertakings, irrespective of their sector of activity. Consequently, Italy\u2019s state railway undertaking - Ente Ferrovie dello Stato - was converted in 1992; in 1993 a set of criteria were established to convert state monopolies into limited companies and to reorganise the telecommunications sector. The postal services - Ente Poste Italiane - were privatised in 1997. Privatisation of public utilities did not materialise until the second half of the 1990s. Operators running these services use an infrastructure network which, for technical and economic reasons, has to be managed as a monopoly. For this reason, privatisation involved growing numbers of private fixed-line and mobile telephony companies that began operating alongside Telecom, which manages and controls the telecommunications network. In the electricity sector, ENEL held its monopoly of electricity generation until the end of 2003: in future, it may continue being the main producer, with a market share of up to 50%, and will retain ownership of the network, 104 See Bonelli and Roli., M. (2000), p. 98 et seq. ",
        "95 which will be managed by an \"independent\" operator 105 . The privatisation of public utilities was subject to the creation of independent regulatory authorities responsible for tariff regulation and monitoring service quality. Law 481 of 1995 thus established an electricity and gas authority and a telecommunications authority. Detailed legislation for the telecommunications sector was set out in Law 249 of 1997 establishing the regulatory activities of the telecommunications authority, whose remit includes the conversion of the radio and television market. As for the rail and postal services, the Ente Ferrovie dello Stato-Fs became a limited company in 1992 and the Ente Poste Italiane was privatised in 1997. However, inefficiency and chronic overstaffing have hampered any significant liberalisation of these services. Privatisation was also extended to sectoral social security institutions: Legislative Decree 509/94 authorised the conversion of sixteen such institutions into private undertakings. Since these associations and foundations continue to perform a public welfare function, they are granted a derogation from the Italian Civil Code. In the cultural and performing arts sector too, the main lyric theatres were converted into privately run foundations 106 , as were the Centre for Experimental Cinema (Legislative Decree 426/97), the Venice Biennale (Legislative Decree 19/98), the National Institute of Classical Drama (Legislative Decree 20/98), the independent Milano Triennale (Legislative Decree 273/99) and the Leonardo da Vinci National Museum of Science and Technology (Legislative Decree 258/99). The privatisation process in Italy has changed the role of the state from that of owner to regulator. In practice, however, the regulations governing privatised companies are 105 Various authors, (2000c), p. 26. 106 See Legislative Decree 367/1996 which defined the conditions and procedures for the conversion of bodies operating in the music sector. ",
        "96 still, to a large extent, public-law related. Therefore, the special powers, share ownership restrictions and regulatory provisions that characterise the public sector still pervade the liberalised sectors 107 . 3.3 The budget of regional and local authorities: the local authority share of national tax revenue Revised Article 119 of the constitution, which defines the new regional and local financial framework reviewed above under 3.1, has not been implemented yet. In this regard, Article 3 of the 2003 State Budget Act established a high-level committee 108 to help the government \u2013 on the basis of an agreement on the structural mechanisms of \"fiscal federalism\", to be reached by the Joint State-Regions-Local Authorities Conference \u2013 to identify general principles for the coordination of public finance and the tax system, under Articles 117(3), 118 and 119 of the constitution 109 . 3.3.1 Current regional funding rules: changes established by Legislative Decree 56/2000 Until the new Article 119 is implemented, regional funding will continue to be regulated by the state law that was in place when the reform of Title V entered into 107 See Freni, E., (2003), p. 3997. 108 Under Article 3 of Law 289/2002, the high-level committee's composition and regulatory framework are established by DPCM, on a proposal from the Economic and Finance Minister in consultation with the Ministers for Regional Affairs, the Interior, and Institutional Reform and Devolution. The high-level committee also includes representatives of regions and local authorities, nominated by the Joint Conference. 109 On 18 June 2003, the Conference of Regional Presidents drew up a paper concerning the agreement on the structural mechanisms of fiscal federalism. See also the Ravello document on the fiscal federalism of regions and autonomous provinces, 31 March \u2013 1 April 2003. Both documents are available on www.regioni.it. ",
        "97 force. In 1999, a radical and systematic reform of regional funding was introduced by Law 133. This established Legislative Decree 56/00 which superseded the previous regional funding legislation and provided for: 1. the abolition of state transfers to \"ordinary\" regions, with the exception of those made in the national interest or in response to natural disasters; 2. the allocation of a share of VAT revenue to regions, being not less than 20% of the total yield of the penultimate year preceding the one under consideration. The amounts to be allocated to individual regions are based upon predetermined criteria, such as population size, fiscal capacity, health-service needs and geographical dimensions; 3. the setting-up of a national equalisation fund, funded by VAT revenue and, should this be insufficient, by a share of petrol excise duties; 4. the setting-up of an interregional solidarity fund - reviewed every three years - to help poorer regions; 5. fixing each region's VAT revenue share, the poorer regions\u2019 share of the interregional solidarity fund, and each region's share of the national equalisation fund by 30 September of each year. The figures are established by DPCM, in agreement with the State-Regions Conference; 6. an increase in the petrol excise duty due to \"ordinary\" regions with effect from 2001. This will be increased from 242 to 250 Italian lire for every litre of petrol sold; ",
        "98 7. an increase in the regional surtax rates on income tax, with effect from 2000. These rates, currently fixed at 0.5% and 1%, will be increased to 0.9% and 1.4% respectively; 8. a change in the criteria for allocating IRAP 110 funds (Legislative Decree 446/97) to regions; 9. the setting-up, within the Treasury, of a special guarantee fund financed by state transfers to compensate regions when IRAP and income-tax surtax revenues fall short of regional DPEF forecasts; 10. suppression of the municipalities' and provinces' share of IRAP revenue (Article 11). However, Legislative Decree 56 has provided for other treasury transfers to be allocated to them 111 . The following table (3.3.1) shows the revenue of \"ordinary statute\" regions for the year 2000. Figures are in EUR million. 110 IRAP is a local business tax on the value-added by economic activity carried out in each region and is non-deductible from income tax. Businesses, banks, management companies and self-employed members of the professions are all subject to IRAP. 111 It is worth mentioning the arrangements for covering the regions' health costs, which take up a large share of regional expenditure. As shown, Legislative Decree 56/2000 suppressed the state transfers to \"ordinary\" regions. Nowadays health costs are largely financed through IRAP. The decree also stipulated that the suppressed state transfers, including the health fund, are to be compensated by the regional share of VAT, by the increase of regional surtax rates on income tax, and by the increase in excise duty on petrol. Recently, Law 405/01 stipulated that a limit would be imposed on the growth rate of health expenditure, on a yearly basis. Furthermore, in order to tackle regional healthcare sector deficits, with effect from 2001, regions could lay down their own rules on shared funding, variations in the income-tax rate or other fiscal contributions, and further measures designed to control health costs.

This established a distinction between state transfers and ",
        "100 local authorities tax revenue : the former ensure the delivery of basic local services and the latter funds those public services considered necessary for the community\u2019s development. Law 142 also stipulated that this funding must be allocated according to objective criteria which take account of population, area and socio-economic conditions; it must be distributed as evenly as possible, and local fiscal imbalances should be taken into account. With a view to contributing towards local government investment policy, Law 142 also established an ordinary fund for public works of key economic and social importance and a special fund for public works in specific areas or situations established by state law. Finally, Law 142 stipulated that the parameters for calculating the total sum of money transfers and funds should be fixed by law for each financial year of the state\u2019s long-term budget. Legislative Decrees 504/92 and 507/93 were subsequently passed in implementation of the government delegation conferred under Law 421. Legislative Decree 504/92 established ICI, a local tax on immovable property designed to give municipalities a source of tax revenue. The decree also enabled them to establish a surtax on income tax, and authorised provinces to levy an annual tax on land conservation, and a vehicle registration tax. The same legislative decree established arrangements for allocating state transfers, stipulating that \"from 1994, the state will subsidise provinces and municipalities through an ordinary fund, a consolidated fund and an equalisation fund to address local fiscal imbalances\". These are additional to the ordinary and special investment funds. Legislative Decree 507/93 in turn created a municipal tax on public advertising and billposting, a tax on the occupation of public areas, and a tax on the disposal of domestic urban solid waste. ",
        "101 Since the 1990s, funding for local authorities has been marked by a strong drive towards greater autonomy in tax matters. The IRAP local business tax is a case in point, as it benefited municipalities and provinces alike: they each received a share of regional revenue from IRAP, together with a top-up sum 112 . Legislative Decree 446/97, which established IRAP, made an important contribution to local and regional taxation. Subsequently, Legislative Decree 56/00 abolished municipalities' and provinces' share of IRAP revenue, but guaranteed them other fund transfers. 3.4 Public-private cooperation instruments. The intermediary role of the unions The so-called \"negotiated planning\" scheme based on the Territorial Pacts programme was set up in the 1990s, once the special assistance programme for the Mezzogiorno had come to an end. The scheme, benefiting southern Italy, groups together the policies and instruments required to launch a strategy of development based on growth and self-development by adopting a bottom-up approach. Several factors prompted this new approach to developing the south. Firstly, the end of the special assistance programme and of the cumbersome, centrally administered measures in 1992 coincided with reports of the messy state of public accounts and the need for budget reform to meet the Maastricht criteria. Moreover, on the institutional and political fronts, the direct election of mayors (introduced in 1993) and the Lega Nord \u2019s criticism of the aid policies for the south undoubtedly contributed to the spread of economic planning drawn up at local level. Against this new backdrop, which was sustained by local employment and development incentives granted by the 112 Legislative Decree 446 of 15 December 1997, Articles 27 and 28. ",
        "102 European Community, starting with the 1994-1999 programme, cooperation became the obvious choice for the new bottom-up local development policies. In 2000, through the concerted action of institutions, companies and unions, an agreement was reached on the so-called \"territorial pacts\" which provided the opportunity to try out new formulas for flexible work to boost employment in southern Italy. Of the 61 pacts launched, 51 were implemented using national procedures and the remaining 10 in accordance with Community rules; 41 of them involved southern regions, covering 42% of southern inhabitants. Each pact benefits at least 20 municipalities and is fleshed out by approximately forty new private schemes and creates, on average, 530 jobs 113 . A 2001 enabling act on labour market issues, passed under delegated legislation, does not explicitly establish negotiated planning: as far as employment incentives are concerned, the aim is rather to rationalise financial incentives, which are to be reformed in proportion to the level of employment disadvantage recorded in different areas of the country. The White Paper on Italy\u2019s labour market, submitted by the government in 2001, acknowledged the central role which the concerted action of the early 1990s had played in promoting the reform of state finances and exploring new methods of combating unemployment in the south. Nevertheless, it recommended a shift towards a new form of \"social dialogue\", in which the unions and other social partners would hold talks with the institutions (at both national and regional level) before final approval was given to a governmental or regional legislative proposal on employment or social matters 114 . The White Paper\u2019s approach has been criticised by those fearing that more decentralised, sectoral bargaining could weaken the role of the unions and their capacity as intermediaries 115 . 113 The statistics are quoted in Sales, I., (2003), 185. 114 See Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, White Paper on Italy\u2019s Labour Market, Rome, October 2001, Part II, 1.2. 115 See Fontana, G., in various authors, (2003b), 129 et seq., p. 134. ",
        "103 3.5 European integration and economic development at regional and local level: management of the Structural Funds Following the political agreement reached by the Heads of State or Government at the Berlin European Council of 24 and 25 March 1999 on Agenda 2000 - described by the European Commission in 1997 as an action programme and benchmark standard for EU policies for the period 2000-2006 - the EU Member States have undertaken to strengthen the Structural Funds instruments. This has been done by revamping the Objectives (reduced from seven to three) and resources available to states and regions. Furthermore, Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 laid down a set of criteria with a view to developing more dynamic ways of administering Structural Funds. The criteria include greater geographical and financial concentration, more decentralised management, tighter controls and greater effectiveness. Italy\u2019s serious socio-economic imbalances and the structural crises affecting certain parts of the country justify the allocation of Structural Funds. In the face of such a situation, Italy and the European Commission approved two Community Support Frameworks (CSFs) for the period 2000-2006: one covers Objective 1 and the other Objective 3. The Objective 1 CSF (helping areas lagging behind in development and whose per capita GDP is less than 75% of the Community average), approved by Commission Decision 2050 of 1 July 2000, is managed by the Economic and Finance Ministry and takes action to help Mezzogiorno regions 116 catch up with EU standards. The six broad areas covered are: natural resources, cultural resources, human resources, local development action plans, cities, service networks and forums. The Objective 3 CSF (which aims to adapt and update education, training and employment policies and systems, thus bringing together the previous Objectives 3 and 4), approved by 116 These are Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Puglia, Sardinia, Sicily and, for a transitional period, Molise, where aid is being phased out since it has passed the 75% threshold of the Community average. ",
        "104 Commission Decision 1120 of 18 July 2000, is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and covers northern and central Italy 117 . The Objective 3 measures have six priorities 118 . Objective 1 priorities were outlined in seven National Operating Programmes (NOPs) and six Regional Operating Programmes (ROPs). To these should be added the transitional support programme covering Molise. Objective 3 is covered by one NOP and 14 ROPs. The latter were adopted with the participation of the regions concerned. As regards Objective 2 - which brings together the 1994-1999 Objectives 2 and 5b and aims to support the economic and social reconversion of areas facing structural difficulties - on 21 June 2000 the Italian authorities presented the Commission with a list of NUTS III areas in northern and central Italy eligible for Structural Funds assistance 119 . Areas eligible under Objective 2 were established by Commission Decision 530 of 27 July 2000, later modified by Decision 1073 of 117 The regions covered by this Objective are: Valle d\u2019Aosta, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, Lazio, Abruzzo and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano. 118 The priorities are: a) developing and promoting active employment policies; b) labour market integration of people at particular risk of social exclusion; c) promoting and improving vocational training, education and guidance, with a view to a lifelong learning policy; d) promoting a competent, skilled and flexible labour force, supporting businesses, developing the human potential for research and technological advancement; e) promoting equal opportunities for women; f) following up CSFs and operating programmes (OPs). 119 The acronym NUTS stands for Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, established by Eurostat and used in issues relating to Structural Funds since 1998. Italian regions are classified as NUTS II whereas provinces and smaller areas (municipalities, etc.) are classified as NUTS III. ",
        "105 27 April 2001. These decisions were later integrated into 14 Single Programming Documents, one for each region and autonomous province concerned 120 . As regards funding for Italy, the European Union earmarked a sum of EUR 29,656 million. This will be allocated via the European Structural Funds, comprising the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund \u2013 Guidance Section (EAGGF \u2013 Guidance) and the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) in accordance with the EU\u2019s three priority Objectives. It should be noted that the ESF contributes to both CSFs, and fully finances the Objective 3 CSF 121 . Objective 1 regions have been allocated a total of EUR 22,122 million (1999 values) for the period 2000-2006, subdivided into EUR 21,935 million for the six Mezzogiorno regions and EUR 187 million for Molise, in accordance with the transitional funding system. As regards Objective 2, the European Commission designated, for each Member State affected, an upper limit of inhabitants for the four area types that were identified: industrial, rural, urban and fishing-dependent areas. In the case of Italy, this limit is 7,402 million inhabitants, i.e. 13% of the total population, and the allocation is EUR 2,522 million. The regions receiving the highest funding are Veneto (22.9% of the total), Piedmont (15%) and Tuscany (14.5%). Objective 3 funding is not area-based, although Objective 1 regions are excluded. Italy has been allocated EUR 3,744 million of Objective 3 funding 122 for the period 2000-2006. 120 The regions concerned are: Abruzzo, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lazio, Liguria, Lombardy, Marche, Piedmont, Tuscany, Umbria, Valle d\u2019Aosta, Veneto and the autonomous provinces of Bolzano and Trento. 121 For further information on the ESF\u2019s funding programmes and aims, see www.welfare.gov.it/EuropaLavoro/programmazioneFse/FondiStrutturali/default.htm 122 The data are available online at www.tesoro.it/Documentazione/AreeDoc/rgs/ .

        "106 With regard to financial implementation, Italy experienced a number of problems with using the Structural Funds in the past. There were several reasons for this, including a lack of coordination between the various national and regional administrative departments, flawed planning, and complex and lengthy administrative procedures, especially for private bodies seeking access to the funds. Today, however, these problems seem mainly to have been overcome. The data on the implementation of Objective 1 Community measures show that at 30 June 2003, expenditure stood at over EUR 7,221 million of the EUR 19,304 million committed by that date. The Basilicata ROP in particular has shown the best potential to deliver: payments have totalled some 23.1% of the overall allocations for the period 2000- 2006. Objective 2 expenditure stands at around EUR 519 million, with commitments of over EUR 1,607 million. The overall implementation rate is 6.2% and commitment capacity is approximately 19.2%. However, the low level of financial implementation of the Single Programming Documents (SPD) is due to the fact that development measures, and, as a consequence, grant allocations, only began to be implemented recently. The Valle d\u2019Aosta SPD showed a commitment capacity of 80.8%, with an efficiency ratio of 26.5%. As at November 2003, 30% of the total Objective 3 allocation for the period 2000-2006 was already spent 123 . In the case of Italy, overall results are positive and it seems that the problem of automatic decommitment of allocated EU funds has been resolved. 123 Further details are available on www.tesoro.it/Documentazione/AreeDoc/Dipartimenti/IGRUE/ .

        "107 IV. LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES 4.1 Management of public services. The regional and local dimension of public services The term \"local public services\" refers to all activities undertaken by local authorities which are neither strictly administrative nor merely of an economic nature: such services address a basic need of the local community 124 . The distribution of competences between regions and local authorities over local public services is governed by sector-specific legislation. The local authorities\u2019 competences regarding the supply and distribution of water are stipulated in the law on the water service (Law 36/94). Responsibility for organising and running the service lies with municipalities and provinces, while the region regulates cooperation arrangements between local authorities for the management of the service. As regards the form of management, joint enterprises or private companies are preferred. As regards natural gas distribution, the arrangements for gas supply are regulated by each local authority, which awards appropriate contracts using a model prepared by the electricity and gas authority and approved by the Industry Ministry (Article 14 of Legislative Decree 164/00). Local authorities regulate distribution arrangements by means of guidelines and licences, concluding service contracts with the public and private bodies concerned. 124 Dugato, M., (2003), p. 2584. ",
        "108 As regards electricity, local authorities are responsible for monitoring energy saving and rational energy use as well as other duties laid down in regional legislation. Within the regional programming framework, provinces are responsible for promoting renewable energy sources and energy saving, authorising the installation and operation of power plants and monitoring the performance of thermal appliances 125 . As far as local public transport is concerned, Legislative Decree 422/97 confers the management of local railway, maritime and air services on regions and local authorities. Regions are responsible for planning and funding; moreover, in agreement with local authorities, they also decide on the minimum essential services needed to meet people\u2019s mobility demands. Relations between the local authority and the body managing the service are governed by the public service contract that also sets down minimum quality standards for the service provided. As for waste collection, transport and disposal, Legislative Decree 22/97 gives regions the task of drawing up criteria for the siting of landfills and recycling plants. Provinces are responsible for coordinating municipal waste management through a province-wide scheme. Municipalities are responsible for the management of municipal and similar waste: a municipal regulation establishes the various stages of waste management including its transport, collection and selective collection. Alongside these industrial-type services, local authorities provide personal and domestic services as well as cultural and educational amenities (libraries, museums, etc.). 125 Legislative Decree 112/98, Article 31. ",
        "109 After the reform of Title V of Part II of the constitution, a number of the state\u2019s exclusive legislative powers \u2013 such as the safeguarding of competition and the setting of basic standards for civil and social rights \u2013 encroach on or curtail the regional responsibilities laid down in sectoral legislation. In fact, it is wrong to speak of a general regional legislative \"residual\" power over public services by virtue of the convention whereby matters not listed in Article 117 come under the exclusive legislative authority of the regions: public services are not stand-alone issues, as they tie in with a number of matters that are governed by concurrent state and regional legislation. Article 117(3) lists the following matters of concurrent legislation: spatial planning, civil ports and airports, large-scale transport and navigation networks and the production, transportation and national distribution of energy. It does not however explicitly mention the following: local transport; the extraction, processing and transportation of energy and its regional or local distribution; collection and treatment of municipal solid waste. All these matters could be included within the \"residual\" authority of regional authorities 126 . Despite such interpretations, the state has continued to legislate in this area since the reform of Title V. Indeed, in its 2002 Budget (Article 35 of Law 448/01) it amended the legislation on management of local public services, and in September 2003 a decree-law was adopted that further reformed the management procedures of these services (see paragraph below). 4.1.1 The impact of privatisation Arrangements for the management of local public services were first codified by Law 142/90, under which public services of an entrepreneurial nature could be managed by local authorities in various ways: directly, in the case of small services; through a special agency (a public body attached to the municipality though with legal 126 According to the interpretation of Cecere, A.M., (2003), p. 323 et seq. ",
        "110 personality); by a consortium (joint management between various authorities); or by limited liability companies with a local majority public shareholding (Article 22). The difficulty of creating companies which are totally dependent on municipal capital necessitated the introduction of other management arrangements. In 1992, it became possible to set up companies with a minority public shareholding. In these companies, the majority shareholder is a single private partner, chosen by the local authority following a public tendering procedure. The gradual transition to private management was stepped up by Law 127/97 which permitted management by a limited liability company. The consolidating statute on local authorities (T.u.e.l.), adopted by Legislative Decree 267/00, incorporated the model contained in Article 22 of Law 142/90, as subsequently consolidated and amended. Legislation affecting local public services was completely revised ten years after Law 142/90. Article 35 of Law 448/01 127 redefined the management arrangements of local services (Articles 112-118 of T.u.e.l.), distinguishing between \"industrial\" services (electricity, thermal energy, natural gas, the waste cycle, water resources and public transport) and other services (social, personal and domestic, educational and cultural). The reform of industrial services is based on the distinction between infrastructure and network ownership, service management and supply: whereas the network is still managed by a publicly owned company, services are tendered out to private companies. The aim of the 2001 legislation was to retain local authorities' control of the networks and infrastructure and introduce a privatised scheme for the practical running of the services. In September 2003, the government enacted a decree-law that further reformed local industrial public services, defining them as 127 See Purcaro, A. Gravallese I., (2003), p. 243 et seq. ",
        "111 services \"of economic significance\" and obliging municipalities \u2013 as network and infrastructure owners \u2013 to entrust their management to ad hoc authorities or to public companies. The latter may be entrusted with direct management and control of the network 128 . Local non-industrial public services, defined as services \"that are not of economic significance\", are placed under direct management of a) institutions; b) special agencies and consortiums; or c) public companies. Services may also be managed directly by the local authority if their scale is too small to justify assigning them to other bodies. With regard to cultural and leisure amenities, local authorities may entrust these to associations and foundations which they have set up themselves, or in which they have a share 129 . Doubts have been expressed about the wisdom of the radical reform of the local public services system that followed the reform of Title V. Commentators question whether the reforms are justified by the state's competence to protect competition and ensure basic standards of delivery relating to fundamental rights, and whether the constraints are too rigid. The indiscriminate obligation to use the model of the share- capital company, without taking account of the widely differing nature of Italy's municipalities, is particularly open to question, as it prevents the smaller municipalities from running services of industrial or economic significance themselves. 128 On the 2003 reform see Corali, E., (2003). 129 See Articles 113 and 113b of T.u.e.l. as modified by decree-law 269 of 30 September 2003 and converted into Law 326 of 2003.

THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON REGIONAL AND LOCAL DEMOCRACY 5.1 Computerisation of public administration (projects, experience and results) Italy has taken a number of steps to computerise its public administration and introduce eGovernment/e-democracy. The eGovernment Action Plan 130 , approved by the Council of Ministers on 23 June 2000, identified a series of measures about the use of modern technology by the public authorities in information and telecommunications management. These aimed to improve the operational efficiency of the institutions, to computerise services and to give electronic access to users. Consequently, a document adopted by the Joint Conference on 18 January 2001 called for territorial action plans for regional eGovernment, to be drawn up in participation with local authorities and aiming to: 1) identify specific local objectives, in accordance with the thematic areas set out in the National Plan and the European Commission\u2019s eEurope Plan; 2) establish criteria for coordinating eGovernment measures across all levels of local government 131 . 130 The Action Plan is in line with recommendations set out in the eEurope Plan 2002, approved by the Feira European Council in June 2000 (see Capocchi A., 2003, 130). In 2002 another eGovernment plan was approved, eEurope 2005 (European Council, Seville 2002). 131 http://www.innovazione.gov.it/ita/egovernment/entilocali/piani_territoriali.shtml ",
        "113 Besides developing eGovernment projects for regions and local authorities with a view to enhancing infrastructure services and other services aimed at members of the public and businesses 132 , the initial implementation phase of eGovernment was founded on two other lines of action. Firstly, a set of technical, organisational and methodological criteria to help deliver eGovernment projects was established, and a policy paper entitled eGovernment towards an efficient federalism: a shared vision, a collective achievement 133 was drawn up. Secondly, Regional Competence Centres (CRC) 134 were set up in most regions. The second stage of eGovernment was launched 135 on 27 November 2003, at the State-Regions Conference 136 . The main objective at this stage was to mainstream innovation schemes which had already been set in motion for services to members of 132 http://www.crcitalia.it/UserFiles/1333.pdf Document adopted by the Joint Conference on 27 November 2003 on eGovernment in regions and local authorities: The implementation stage.

To this end, five lines of action were established 137 : 1) to develop local infrastructure services (via the network for public administration agencies). This involves those services, provided by a regional or provincial administration for local authorities in its area, which are essential for the success of eGovernment service projects (e.g. administration of card systems at regional level); 2) country-wide distribution of services for members of the public and businesses; 3) to include small municipalities in eGovernment plans. Presently 72.04% of Italian municipalities have fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, while small/medium-sized municipalities (up to 20,000 inhabitants) make up a further 22.12%. Thus, regional service centres (CST) were set up with a view to enhancing cooperation and partnership between the two types of municipalities. These centres will be responsible for setting up eGovernment services, guaranteeing they are run properly and supplying the necessary human and technological resources 138 ; 4) to launch projects to develop digital citizenship (e-democracy). This action aims to promote the use of ICT technology projects to encourage citizens to participate in public decision-making; 137 http://www.crcitalia.it/UserFiles/1333.pdf Document adopted on 27 November 2003 by the Joint State-Regions-Cities-Local Authorities Conference on eGovernment in regions and local authorities: The implementation stage.

The budget for this second stage is approximately EUR 185 million 140 . With regard to the computerisation of public administration, the Committee of Ministers for the Information Society 141 , made up of ministers from 11 different ministries, plays an important role in coordinating the activities of central, regional and local administrations. At the meeting held on 13 February 2002, the committee established three areas of action: a) to increase use of the internet by making public services available online, developing multimedia content and supporting e- commerce; b) to promote the benefits of internet access, its speed and cost effectiveness; and c) to develop new competences and combat any type of \"exclusion\". The goals for the present legislature are as follows: development of online services for members of the public and businesses alike (priority services such as those related to taxation, health, study, work, etc.); efficiency; improving human resources, with the emphasis on ensuring computer literacy among all public employees; transparency (2/3 of public administration offices are to offer the public online access to documents); and quality (all offices providing services are to adopt a customer- 139 http://www.crcitalia.it/UserFiles/1333.pdf Document adopted on 27 November 2003 by the Joint Conference on eGovernment in regions and local authorities: The implementation stage.

Furthermore, on 21 March 2002 the Permanent Commission for Innovation and Technology 143 was established in order to encourage regional governments to implement effective policies and coherent strategies on information society and eGovernment issues. In April 2003, the commission\u2019s Technical Committee published a paper entitled eGovernment towards an efficient federalism: a shared vision, a collective achievement - Reference notes for the development of eGovernment in central administrations, regions and local authorities. It sets the objective of \"forging a common vision for developing eGovernment and setting a benchmark standard for future co\u00e0peration between municipalities, provinces, regions and central administrations\u201d 144 . The paper lists eight areas of action on which the various tiers of government should adopt a common position 145 : 1) interconnecting all public administrations, and connecting them with the public and with businesses; 2) resourcing online services; 3) rationalising arrangements for the supply of online services; 142 http://www.innovazione.gov.it/ita/intervento/allegati/docu_base130202.pdf (Committee of Ministers for the Information Society, meeting of 13 February 2003) 143 http://www.innovazione.gov.it/ita/news/2003/03_04_10.shtml The Memorandum of Understanding was signed by minister Lucio Stanca and Mr Enzo Ghigo, President of the Conference of Regional Presidents. 144 http://www.innovazione.gov.it/ita/intervento/normativa/allegati/visione_condivisa_030408 145 http://www.innovazione.gov.it/ita/intervento/normativa/allegati/visione_condivisa_030408 ",

The role of electronic discussion forums. The rise of local television networks a) To date, Italian law has not regulated electronic voting (e-voting). The concept of electronic voting first emerged in Italy in the 1980s with the first legislative initiatives to introduce elements of computerisation, or simply partial automation, in the electoral process 147 . Concrete steps in this direction were only taken at the end of the 1990s, with the launching of E-poll and True-vote. 146 Reports prepared between 1997 and 2002 by the Authority for Information Technology in Public Administration (AIPA) give a detailed account of the development of eGovernment at a national and subnational level. The 2002 report shows an increase in ICT expenditure by central administrations, whereas many other administrations show a decrease; a marked development in the availability of online services; and further growth of basic infrastructure and connectivity. The report also notes that of the 80 basic services for citizens and businesses selected by the Committee of Ministers for the Information Society, 37 were the direct responsibility of central public administration. Of these, 15 are fully accessible online and 11 only partially. 147 During the IXth Legislature, bills were tabled by Adolfo Battaglia (A.C. doc. 1895) and Carlo Fusaro (A.C. doc. 1896). ",
        "118 E-Poll (Electronic polling system for remote voting operations) is a transnational research and development project co-financed by the European Commission\u2019s Information Society Directorate-General as part of the IST research project (Information Society Technologies) within the 5th Framework Programme. Italy is one of the participants and has received Commission funding of EUR 1.7 million for the project, which attempts to simplify and computerise voting procedures by using cutting-edge technology that is nevertheless relatively easy to apply 148 . In Italy, the first e-voting trial was conducted in San Benedetto del Tronto during the regional elections of 16 April 2000. It involved 468 women (54% of eligible voters) and 404 men (46% of eligible voters); 34% of those voting were over 60 years of age. Further trials were conducted in Avellino in 2001, in Campobasso at the administrative elections of May 2002, and in four Friuli municipalities (Trieste, Gorizia, San Vito del Tagliamento and Cividale del Friuli) during the Regional Council elections held on 8 and 9 June 2003 149 . An e-voting simulation was also organised in Cremona on 17 November 2003, and real-time data were transmitted to the Ministry of the Interior. True-vote (\"a secure and tru stable internet voting system based on PKI\") is a project co-financed by the European Commission involving Italy, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Finland. The project aims to put in place an internet- 148 The basic stages of e-voting are the following: preparing the vote, identifying and authenticating the voter (guarantee of confidentiality required), authorising the vote, transmitting it via a secure environment, counting votes and lastly, announcing the result. For information on E-poll, see www.e-poll-project.net . 149 This was the largest e-voting trial attempted in Italy so far, with a pool of approximately 3,800 voters. Of the 3,791 eligible voters in Friuli, 1,641 (i.e. 43.29%) voted via a touchscreen system, i.e. a system whereby a voter follows instructions by simply touching the computer screen. ",

The Italian project involves Postecom s.p.a. and the city of Milan, whose university developed a secure e-voting system that was tested on the city\u2019s community network between 12 and 18 December 2002 with the participation of approximately 300 internet users 150 . b) The ever increasing use of internet in Italian homes was a decisive factor for the development of institutional websites and local public networks (i.e. eGovernment in its broadest sense). In fact, 49.67% of all Italian households own a PC; 63% of them have an internet connection (even though only 36% use it frequently). The total number of people who access the internet, even occasionally, is approximately 13 million, although the figure drops to less than 12 million if we exclude internet access via an outside source such as during training courses, from friends\u2019 homes, libraries, etc.). Just over 8 million people say they use the internet at least once a week. Internet use has grown steadily over the years, especially from 1998 onwards, although the rate of growth slowed in 2001. Between 2002 and 2003, the number of new connections entered a period of stasis, if not an outright downward trend. However, the latest data suggest a new upturn in September-October 2003, although the trend can only be assessed accurately over a longer period of time. Internet user statistics for Europe reveal that Italy occupies third place, behind the United Kingdom and Germany. Still, it must be said that, compared to more advanced countries, Italy has a relatively low density of use. Eurisko data as at June 2003 show that approximately 50% of those who use a computer regularly are also at home with the internet, with a little over 70% of PCs connected up to it. 25 to 44-year-olds use internet the most and represent 47% of all internet users, while older people are the least likely to access it 151 . 150 For further information on True-vote, see www.True-vote.net. 151 The above data are published in the Censis and Eurisko reports covering September-October 2003 and are available on www.gandalf.it/dati/dati3.htm.

        "120 Central and local government have responded to this situation by launching the above-mentioned cooperation scheme to restructure public administration according to a shared vision of eGovernment development and implementation (see 5.1. above). c) With regard to local radio and television, Italy has a national television station that offers regional programmes (RAI 3) and a large number of regional, municipal and local radio and TV stations. Local private radio took off in the 1970s with the introduction of the first radio libere, independent radio stations such as Radio Valle Camonica, Radio Bra Onda Rossa, Radio Parma and Radio Milano International. Their development was further encouraged by Constitutional Court ruling 202/76, which restricted the previous public monopoly of national broadcasting. Private companies could thus run radio and TV stations, provided they only broadcast locally. Over the years there was a considerable development in local as well as national radio, to such an extent that in 1990 it became necessary to regulate the broadcasting system by means of a frequency plan restricting the number of available frequencies in order to safeguard the quality of reception. However, the radio frequency plan has not been approved yet; in the meantime, radio stations that meet the requisite technical and organisational conditions have been granted provisional licences 152 . With regard to local television, the number of private television stations rose rapidly in the 1970s, from 68 in 1976 to 600 in 1981. The public broadcasting company (RAI) responded in 1979 by creating a third TV channel tailored for a regional community. At present, the presence of two national broadcasters, RAI and Mediaset, has a negative effect on the advertising capacity of local networks: nonetheless, there 152 Information taken from www.raiway.rai.it/storia.htm.

The situation prompted the Italian government to launch an aid policy in 1998 to ease the shift from analogue to digital. The 2002 Budget Act 154 earmarked EUR 20 million for the project. Another law, not yet approved, aims to reorganise the TV and radio system. The advertising rules that apply to national networks would be relaxed for local TV stations, extending the time limit on advertising slots from 20% to 25% and the daily limit on other kinds of advertising from 35% to 40%. 5.3 Information technology and changing public services In 2002, under DPCM of 14 February 2002, the Council of Ministers published a notice on the eGovernment Action Plan about the \"selection of eGovernment projects proposed by regions and local authorities\" 155 . The aim was to select projects proposed by regions and local authorities for services to the general public, businesses and infrastructure services. The overall budget was EUR 120 million, of which EUR 80 million were earmarked for public and business services and EUR 40 million for infrastructure services (Article 5). 138 projects 156 of those submitted following the first notice on eGovernment were selected for co-financing. The People project 157 ( P rogetto E nti O nline P orta l i eGovernment ) is particularly interesting: it involves 57 authorities from 13 different regions 158 with an overall population of around 7.5 million.

        "133 LUXEMBOURG INTRODUCTION The size and population of Luxembourg is roughly the same as that of a region in any other Member State. This makes Luxembourg a particularly interesting case for studying the grassroots democracy phenomenon. The municipalities (communes) are the only tier of local government in the Grand Duchy, their autonomous status dating back to the country's establishment as an independent state. In the absence of intermediate tiers of government between the municipalities and the state, the wide-ranging duties performed in other countries by provinces and the like have been assumed in recent years by inter-municipal consortia (syndicats de communes) . Despite the seemingly highly centralised state structure, which gives the central administration a tight hold on local bodies (system of tutelage or tutelle ), there is a highly efficient system of local democracy, as borne out by the fact that citizens identify closely with their municipalities. The municipality is a fully-fledged tier of government and looks after the interests of the local community in a vast range of areas such as local policing, roadworks, water, nursery and primary education, and social welfare. ",
        "134 Naturally, any account of the relations between citizens and local government institutions must take account of Luxembourg's vast foreign population and of its cross-border commuters with dual nationality. The state level, in turn, is particularly close to the needs of the population; the party system, supported by a long tradition of social consultation (which is centred around the system of Chambers of Trade), guarantees a stable executive and accountable representation. This, plus the existence of a highly homogeneous society, gives us a country in which local democracy has to address the issues facing an efficient and well organised administration rather than questions relating to the representation and composition of local government bodies. Citizens' relationships with government institutions seem to be marked by the recent controversy surrounding forms of direct democracy (referendums, public petitions), proposals for creating a post of ombudsman, and ambitious programmes for developing eGovernment. I. THE EVOLUTION OF FEDERAL/REGIONAL DYNAMICS. THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 1.1 Organisation of the state in the last thirty years. Historical profile The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was created at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 as part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, whose king also took the title of Grand Duke. ",
        "135 Luxembourg's present constitution, adopted in 1868 in the wake of the 1867 Treaty of London, has close links with the 1831 Belgian constitution, which was in force in Luxembourg until 1839 following the Grand Duchy's participation in the 1830 revolution in Belgium. The revision of the constitution in 1919 ended the autocratic regime in which power had been held solely by the Grand Duke (who was not obliged to seek the views of parliament except where provided for in the constitution), introduced the vote for women and made provision for referendums; the first referendum, held on 28 June 1919, voted for the retention of the monarchy. The Grand Duchy is therefore an hereditary constitutional monarchy (House of Nassau), with the Grand Duke as the head of state. Legislative power is exercised by the Grand Duke (who is formally empowered to initiate legislation and who promulgates the laws) and by a single Chamber of sixty deputies elected by universal suffrage every five years. The risk inherent in a single Chamber system of legislative texts not being thoroughly debated is mitigated by the obligation to discuss each legislative draft twice at least three months apart, and by the deterrent role played by the Council of State, which is obliged to issue an \u2013 albeit non-binding \u2013 opinion. (The sole effect of a negative Council of State opinion is that a new vote must be held at least two months later.) The second parliamentary debate can be dispensed with if the Chamber and Council of State agree. (In practice, the Council of State insists on the full procedure being applied only in particularly sensitive cases.) The legislative process also provides for the consultation of six Chambers of Trade, which are elected every five years by universal suffrage under a 1924 law. These ",
        "136 Chambers of Trade can also initiate legislation in areas of interest to the groups they represent. The Grand Duke is also the head of the executive and \u2013 in the words of the constitution \u2013 \"is the sole repository of executive power\", \"appoints and dismisses the members of government\" and \"may dissolve the Chamber\". (He may also issue a veto, though this right is generally regarded as a leftover from the original constitution, which escaped all the subsequent acts of revision.) In reality, however, all executive duties are performed by the government; ministers are also nominated by the head of government, who in turn is appointed by parliamentary majority. The Grand Duke also appoints (for life) the 21 members of the Council of State - the highest administrative jurisdiction and consultative body within the state, which is invested with legislative prerogatives as indicated above. 1.1.1 The evolution of the regionalisation/federalisation procedures and decentralisation processes. The most recent institutional developments The eight revisions of the constitution 1 have not changed the system of political and administrative decentralisation, based on the division of the country into municipalities (of which there are 118 at present). Because of Luxembourg's small area and small population, the national tier of government 1 In 1919, 1948, 1956, 1972, 1979, 1983, 1988, 1989 and 1997 ",
        "137 is more akin to that of a regional government with the result that the state of local democracy must also and above all be assessed with reference to the functioning of the national democratic institutions. The constitution stipulates that \"the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a democratic, free, independent and indivisible state\" 2 and that \"the boundaries and chief towns of judicial or administrative districts and of cantons and municipalities may only be changed by law\" 3 . Despite their mention in the constitution, legislation has made no provision for cantons or any other local authorities apart from municipalities, which, under the terms of Article 107, shall form autonomous authorities, on a territorial basis, possessing legal personality and capable of administrating their assets and interests through their own bodies. In each municipality there shall be a municipal council directly elected by the inhabitants; the conditions to stand as a candidate for election or to be entitled to vote shall be fixed by law. The council shall approve an annual budget and verify the accounts. It shall issue municipal regulations, except in cases of emergency. It may impose municipal taxes, with the Grand Duke's approval. The Grand Duke has the right to dissolve the council. 2 Article 1 3 Article 3 ",
        "138 The municipality shall be administered by a college of the burgomasters and aldermen, who must be chosen from among the municipal councillors. The nationality requirements to be fulfilled by the members of the college of the burgomasters and aldermen shall be determined in a law passed in accordance with Article 114 (5). The composition, organisation and powers of municipal bodies shall be regulated by law. The statute applicable to municipal officials shall be laid down. The municipality shall participate in educational activities, as laid down by law. Supervision of municipal activities shall be regulated by law. Certain acts of the municipal authorities may be subject to the approval of the supervisory authority and may be cancelled or suspended should they be illegal or contrary to the public interest, without prejudice to the powers of the law courts or administrative tribunals. Article 108 gives municipal authorities the exclusive right to prepare birth, marriage and death certificates and keep the relevant registers. The system of political and administrative decentralisation is governed by the municipal act, as most recently amended in 1988 4 . 4 M\u00e9m. A. (1988), p. 1221 ",
        "139 1.1.2 Relations between central government and the regional/local levels of government Although the system of local democracy naturally benefits from central government being extremely close to the grassroots level, the municipal act provides a setup akin to that of an archetypal centralised state, in which the central authorities keep a tight rein on the local authorities. The municipal council is elected by universal suffrage for a period of six years and has a variable number of councillors depending on the size of the local authority. The college of the burgomaster and aldermen is answerable to the municipal council, and its members are selected from among the members of the municipal council. A series of extremely detailed coordinating and monitoring mechanisms is indicative of the close ties between central and local administrations; the Grand Duke may dismiss municipal councillors and veto municipal taxes; apart from being the municipality's executive body, the college of the burgomaster and aldermen also acts on behalf of the central administration, being responsible for the application within the municipality of laws, regulations and administrative provisions; and the burgomaster is also responsible for the application of police laws and regulations. The municipalities are divided up, for supervisory purposes, into the three districts of Luxembourg, Diekirch and Grevenmacher; the district commissioner is entrusted with the task of supervising the administration of the municipalities; he also acts as a link between the municipal and central authorities. The district commissioners are appointed by the Grand Duke from among the officials working for the Ministry of the Interior. ",
        "140 The municipalities have regulatory power with regard to matters falling within their remit or matters of local interest (e.g. urban planning); these regulations, which are generally applicable - albeit only within the territory of the local authority, are vetted by the Ministry of the Interior in order to avoid any conflicts with legislative provisions or government regulations. The 1988 municipal act relaxed to some extent the tight hold on municipal administrations by empowering the latter to contest central government decisions on matter of local interest in the courts. 1.1.3 Local authority cooperation and associations The 1900 municipal act - which was subsequently amended in 1958 and 1981 \u2013 set up inter-municipal consortia (syndicats de communes) to pursue matters of joint interest. In 1981 provision was made for the establishment of monofunctional and multipurpose syndicats and multifunctional and multipurpose syndicats capable of serving more than one purpose, thereby extending the scope of the 1900 act, which only provided for monofunctional and monopurpose syndicats . However, the impact of this act was initially quite small (only six syndicats had been set up by 1950, but the number rose to 30 by 1980). In an attempt to find an optimum size for subnational tiers of government which exercise powers and thus to improve the efficiency of public authorities' actions, the Economic and Social Council has in fact been prompted to recommend that smaller municipalities be merged 5 . 5 CES (2001a) ",
        "141 The main vehicle for inter-municipal cooperation is Syvicol ( syndicat intercommunal \u00e0 vocation multiple des villes et communes ), which was founded in 1986 and sees itself as an \"inter-municipal consortium for all towns and municipalities in Luxembourg and all other inter-municipal consortia 6 \". This body acts as a mouthpiece for local government bodies vis-\u00e0-vis central government institutions and also plays a consultative role in the legislative process in matters that concern it. Inter-municipal cooperation has recently been thoroughly reformed. A law of 23 February 2001 7 granted the syndicats de communes legal personality and gave them powers similar to those held by larger subnational units, such as are not to be found in Luxembourg. The main areas of activity of the inter-municipal consortia are: local and social services; water supplies; local transport; land-use planning and management; and \u2013 in general \u2013 all activities which individual municipalities do not have the economic capacity or territorial power to organise and manage. 1.1.4 The evolution of the metropolitan government model: the role of the metropolitan cities Because Luxembourg is so small and has an extremely uniform subnational structure, a different legal regime for metropolitan areas has not been necessary. The only provision which distinguishes between urban areas and the rest of the country is Article 109 of the constitution, which stipulates that the city of Luxembourg is the capital of the Grand Duchy and the seat of the government. 6 www.syvicol.lu 7 M\u00e9m. A \u2013 36, 26 March 2001, p. 859 ",
        "142 In addition, the municipal administration of Luxembourg is able to liaise with the national government without the mediation of the district commissioner. 1.2 The political and social players in the regionalisation/federalisation processes. The role of political parties and of other forms of associations The three main political parties are the traditional Cr\u00ebstlech-Sozial Vollekspartei (Christian-Social Party), Parti D\u00e9mocratique (Liberal Party) and Parti Ouvrier Socialiste (Socialist Party). The 1990s saw the emergence of new political formations such as the environmental movement and the pensioners' movement (Pensioners' Action Committee or ADR, Action Committee for Democracy and Fair Pensions). 1.2.1 Regional organisation of political parties and movements The national parties are not highly organised at subnational level, as is understandable in such a small country where decentralisation centred on the municipal level is essentially for administrative purposes. Chapter 2 below explains more about how the party system functions in practice. 1.2.2 Regional parties There would appear to be no regional parties. Chapter 2 again says more on this matter. ",
        "143 1.3 The importance of cooperation and social dialogue There is little cooperation between organisations and citizens on urban matters (apart from the planning of social housing, where a large number of the projects are drawn up by municipalities with the help of national tenants' associations). However, rural programmes are prepared jointly, using the partnership method provided for in the Community's Leader programme. II. DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AT REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL 2.1 Voting in national and regional/local elections The turnout in the most recent national elections held in 1999 was extremely high; it was less than 80% in only four of the 118 municipalities and \u2013 even more significantly \u2013 was more than 85% in the majority. The distribution of votes between parties in the country's four electoral districts has remained stable, with the traditional parties (Christian-Social, Liberal and Socialist) having received the same percentages in all the elections between 1959 and 1999 8 . The distribution of seats in the Chamber since the 1980s reveals a slight decline in the seats held by the traditional parties. This decline has been mirrored by the emergence of new formations such as the Greens and the Pensioners' Party ADR (see Table 1.1. at the end of this section). 8 See http://db.statec.lu ",
        "144 However, in local elections, the new parties play a more marginal role, as shown in Table 1.2. The Chamber of Deputies approved the reform of the electoral law on 12 February 2003. This new law will apply at the next national elections in 2004. The new law consist of a general section containing provisions common to national, municipal and European Parliament elections and special sections for each of the three types of election. The main changes are as follows: the maximum age for participating in elections has been raised from 70 to 75 and the minimum age for voting and standing as a candidate has been set at 18; the number of signatures required to support candidates has been raised (though the figures are still very low: 100 signatures for national elections, 50 for municipal elections, and 250 for European elections); a voter may now request a postal vote up to 30 days prior to elections; the grounds for ineligibility and incompatibility have been updated (this is particularly important in a country where a large part of the electorate studies or works abroad and is therefore often out of the country); the right to vote or stand as a candidate in municipal elections has been extended to Community citizens resident in the Grand Duchy for more than five years; and the right to vote in municipal elections has also been granted to non- Community citizens who have resided in the Grand Duchy for five of the last seven years and conform with the legislation governing the right of entry and right of residence. In municipal elections, the second ballot has been abolished. This is because the short time lapse between the two ballots might rule out postal voters plus the fact that the changes in the pattern of voting in the second ballot have had little impact relative to the high cost involved. Another major change is the abolition of electoral wards, ",
        "145 which should allow the electorate in each municipality (now considered as a single legal entity) to identify more closely with their elected representatives. 2.2 Forms and instruments of direct democracy Article 51 of the constitution, introduced when the constitution was revised in 1919, is worded generally and it is not possible to state with certainty whether the referendum referred to therein is an abrogative or consultative referendum. The constitution merely states that \"the electors may be requested to vote in a referendum in cases and under conditions to be determined by law\" ; however, it is generally believed that the type of referendum referred to in Article 51 has no direct effect on lawmaking 9 . At a local level, Articles 35 and 36 of the 1988 municipal act 10 leave no doubt that referendums are to be merely consultative. Article 35 stipulates the following: \"The municipal council may call on electors to vote in referendums on matters of interest to the municipality and under conditions determined by it. The referendum shall take place automatically when requested by a fifth of the electors in municipalities with more than three thousand inhabitants and a quarter of the electors in the other municipalities.

        "146 The arrangements for the referendum shall be determined by Grand Ducal regulation. The provisions of the electoral law on compulsory voting, and in particular Articles 259 to 262 thereof, shall apply. In all cases, the referendum shall be merely consultative.\" Article 36 in turn stipulates the following: \"Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 35, the municipal council or the college of the burgomaster and aldermen may ask municipal administrators, in whole or in part, for their opinion on a specific municipal problem. Participation shall be optional.\" In practice there are signs of a definite lack of interest in referendums at national level (so much so that the basic law on referendums, provided for in Article 51 of the constitution, has still not been approved). On the other hand, since the introduction of local referendums by the 1988 municipal act, local consultations have been widespread, helping to strengthen relations between local institutions and the general public (cf. section 5). The failure to act on the constitution's referendum provisions, and the lack of effect on the system of lawmaking, should not, however, lead us to conclude that referendums are of little importance in Luxembourg; the key moments in Luxembourg's constitutional and social history have in fact been marked by major referendums. In the first referendums in 1919 Luxembourgers voted for the retention of the monarchy (and hence against its replacement by a republic) and for economic union ",
        "147 with France (however, the failure of negotiations with France resulted in the establishment of the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union \u2013 BLEU). The 1937 referendum was held in response to the crisis triggered by the electoral success of the Communist Party, the product of the split within the Socialist Party in 1921, which had resulted in the secretary-general Z\u00e9non Bernard being elected to the Chamber of Deputies. The subject of the referendum was the government's loi d'ordre, which sought to ban membership of any grouping \"whose purpose is to abolish or change the constitution by force or any other illicit means\"; spurred on by the opposition in which the unions played an important role, 50.67% of the electorate voted \"No\" to the question of whether they were in favour of \"the enactment of the law ordering the dissolution of the Communist Party and of any other organisation wishing to change the constitution or national legislation by means of violence or threats\". The present government has stated that it intends to strengthen the instruments for direct democracy provided for in the constitution, and in particular that it wishes to resort to a referendum in the event of \"a fundamental and substantial revision of the constitution\" (1999 government declaration). In his 2003 state-of-the-nation address, the Prime Minister explained draft legislation for giving the general public the right to initiate legislation and for holding referendums as part of this commitment. With regard to the right to initiate legislation, the plan is to entitle 10,000 voters on the electoral register to present draft legislation, which the Chamber would then be obliged to examine. ",
        "148 Should such draft legislation be rejected in the first reading, it could be put to a referendum if at least 25,000 voters so requested. Approval of this draft legislation would also provide a legal basis for the referendums laid down in Article 51(7) of the constitution, more than eighty years after the introduction of this provision; as explained previously, such a referendum would not be binding on the Chamber, but it would carry special political weight. If the revision of Article 114 of the constitution \u2013 which is currently being discussed by the Chamber \u2013 were to be approved, the electorate would also have to be consulted, at the request of one quarter of the deputies or 25,000 voters, on the revision of the constitution, which should be halted in the event of the referendum producing a \"No\" vote. By government decision of 27 June 2003, the future European Constitution will also be put to a national referendum once it has been adopted by the 25 heads of state and government. On 16 July 2003, the Chamber of Deputies adopted a draft law on the creation of an ombudsman (modelled on the post created for the first time in Sweden in 1809), in an attempt to facilitate citizens' participation in public decisions which are of interest to them. The ombudsman will be attached to the Chamber of Deputies and will be an independent body not answerable to any executive authority. The ombudsman will be a Luxembourg citizen who has a university degree and a good command of the three national languages, and will be appointed by the Chamber of Deputies for a non-renewable eight-year term.

        "149 2.3 Community identification with regional and local government Because of Luxembourg's size and population it has no regional tier of government in the proper sense. Similarly, there are no large subnational divisions with important powers, such as provinces. The municipality, however, has a longstanding tradition, which has favoured the formation of close ties with local communities. The strength of such ties is demonstrated, for example, by the high turnout in local elections and the frequent use of consultative referendums to determine local policy (cf. 2.1. and 2.2. above). The decision taken during the 2003 electoral reform to abolish the subdivision of municipal constituencies into electoral wards (cf. 2.1. above) should make it possible for local populations to identify more directly with the municipal authorities. Finally, the ties between citizens and local authorities should be strengthened by the establishment of the post of ombudsman, who is also to be responsible for municipal administrative procedures.

        "151 III. REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 3.1 The constitutional framework (economic and financial aspects) In economic matters the Luxembourg constitution shows a liberal imprint but also reveals its original autocratic approach, which has remained formally intact even after the move to greater democracy in 1919. Article 11 of the constitution stipulates the following: \"The law shall guarantee the right to work and shall enable every citizen to exercise this right. The law shall organise social security, health protection, and rest for workers and shall guarantee the freedom of trade unions. The law shall guarantee the freedom of trade and industry and the exercise of professional and agricultural activities, subject to any restrictions that may be imposed by the legislature.\" Article 16 guarantees that \"no one may be deprived of his property except on grounds of public interest in cases and in the manner laid down by the law and in consideration of prior and just compensation\", while Article 17 states that \"confiscation of goods may not be instituted as a penalty\" . Thus, freedom of economic activity and property guarantees are subject to considerable powers of intervention: whereas private property can be expropriated on ",
        "152 \"public interest\" grounds, the restrictions applicable to the freedom of economic activity are not specified. In reality, the socio-economic situation in the Grand Duchy, in which the interests of the mercantile, commercial and professional classes are central, rules out the possibility that such provisions could be used to impose an interventionist approach to the economy. The six Chambers of Trade that have been established are indicative of the central role played by small business. Apart from representing the interests of particular trades, such Chambers take part in the legislative process by means of the mandatory consultation provided for in the law of 4 April 1924 (see 3.4. below for the role of the Chambers of Trade). The principles governing state finance are laid down in Articles 99 et seq. of the constitution. Above all, in accordance with Article 99, \"No state tax may be imposed except by law. No loan to be borne by the state may be contracted without the consent of the Chamber. No real property of the state may be disposed of, unless authorised by special law. In any event, a general law may fix a limit below which no special authorisation is required. Every important purchase of real property by the state, every large infrastructure project or important building work for the benefit of the state, and every major ",
        "153 commitment of funds by the state, must be authorised by special law. A general law shall set the threshold above which this authorisation is required. No commitment may burden the state budget for more than one financial year, except by special law. Article 100 in turn stipulates that \"state taxes shall be voted on annually. Legislation introducing such taxes shall remain in force for only one year unless renewed\". The budgetary procedure is laid down in Article 104, which states that \"each year, the Chamber shall adopt the accounts and the budget. All state revenue and expenditure shall be indicated in the budget and the accounts\". With regard to the guarantees granted to citizens vis-\u00e0-vis the state as the authority responsible for levying taxes, Article 101 guarantees the equality of taxpayers, stating that \"no privilege may be introduced in the matter of taxation. No exemption or abatement may be granted except by law\" ; whereas Article 102 stipulates that \"save in cases formally listed as forming an exception by law, no payment on assets may be demanded of citizens or public bodies except in the form of state or municipal taxes\". With regard to social security provision, Article 103 stipulates that \"no pension, allowance in lieu of salary, or bonus charged to the treasury may be granted except by law\". And finally, Article 105 makes provision for an auditing body \u2013 the Court of Auditors \u2013 which is required to \"verify the financial management of state bodies, administrations and services; other tasks relating to the verification of the financial management of public funds may also be assigned to it by law. ",
        "154 The duties and organisation of the Court of Auditors, as well as its verification procedures and its relations with the Chamber of Deputies, shall be laid down by law. The members of the Court of Auditors shall be nominated by the Grand Duke on a proposal from the Chamber of Deputies. The general state budget shall be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies with the comments of the Court of Auditors\" . 3.2 Privatisation and economic regulation The public debate on the ending of state intervention in the economy, sparked off inter alia by the locomotive role assigned to private economic initiative, has centred on the liberalisation and privatisation of public services (cf. 4.1. below). In its 2001 report on the role of the state, the ESC made a telling remark in this respect when it underlined how the liberalisation of the markets had to aim at increasing transparency, ensuring fair pricing, and making it easier to monitor compliance with quality standards. The conclusion was that privatisation and deregulation were welcome only to the extent that they were supervised by effective regulatory bodies. For this reason too, Luxembourg has not yet seen the large-scale privatisations that have taken part in other European countries in the energy, postal and telecommunications sectors 11 . 11 CES (2001a), pp. 31 et seq. ",
        "155 3.3 The budget of regional and local authorities: the local authority share of national tax revenue Article 99 of the constitution states that \"no municipal charge or tax may be introduced except with the consent of the municipal council\". This provision guarantees local authorities' budgetary powers to a considerable degree, though this guarantee is weakened by the following provision stating that \"the exceptions shown by experience to be necessary as regards municipal taxes shall be laid down by law\" . Notwithstanding municipalities' right to veto the creation of new taxes, taxation decisions remain in the hands of central government. Trends in recent financial years and the forecasts for 2003 indicate that local authorities are running up constantly mounting deficits due, on the one hand, to fewer transfers from central government and, on the other hand, to the growing debts being accumulated by municipalities in funding local public services. As the latest report of the Economic and Social Council on socio-economic trends shows, state debts are at a historic low and are due to be eliminated by 2008, whereas local authority debts are rising steadily and in mid-2001 were around EUR 453 million or 2.1% of GDP 12 . 12 CES (2003) ",
        "156 3.4 Public-private cooperation instruments. The intermediary role of the unions The makeup of the Luxembourg labour market is quite special, with 65% of the workforce being foreign and 30% cross-border commuters 13 . Moreover, service provision far outweighs manufacturing in the Luxembourg economy. Hence the legislature's and politicians' focus on the demands of small businesses and the professions, which are seen as the motor driving the economy forward. Naturally, in such a situation, social conflict is extremely rare and there is a clear tendency towards corporatism in consultative bodies. A central role is played by the Economic and Social Council, a body representing the various social groupings with a consultative role in economic, financial and social matters, and the system of Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of Trade. The members of the Chambers of Trade are appointed every five years, by universal suffrage, using a procedure that is analogous to that used for the national elections. Each Chamber of Trade can submit proposals for legislation to the government and deliver obligatory \u2013 if not binding \u2013 opinions on all (ministerial and Grand Ducal) laws and decrees which are of interest to the category it represents. These Chambers of Trade are thus hybrid institutions, which alongside their normal function of providing trade union representation perform a special function by participating in the exercise of national sovereignty 14 . 13 CES (2003) 14 Thewes, M. (1998), p. 504 ",
        "157 For workers in paid employment, trade union freedom derives under Luxembourg law from the right of association provided for in Article 26 of the constitution and guaranteed by the law of 11 March 1936, which, inter alia, makes it illegal to require that anyone taking up employment must belong (or must not belong) to a trade union. The law of 10 February 1958 introduced into Luxembourg law the obligations stemming from ILO Conventions 87 and 98 concerning protection of the right to organise and to bargain collectively and the protection of workers against acts of discrimination. Under case law, trade union organisations which have not opted to register as not-for- profit organisations are denied the right to initiate legal proceedings, even for protecting the legal interests of members 15 . The law of 12 June 1965 on collective wage agreements grants trade union organisations which have negotiated a collective agreement, the right to initiate legal proceedings in respect of any action stemming from such a collective agreement. The right to strike, and the corresponding right of lockout, are not enshrined in the constitution, but the preparatory work for the 1948 constitutional assembly show that this was considered unnecessary given that the right to strike was an attribute or consequence of the freedoms enjoyed by trade unions 16 . The Court of Cassation 17 has, however, stipulated that participation in a strike is a legitimate and lawful act and constitutes for each worker a right that is implicitly proclaimed in Article 11(5) of the constitution, while the Attorney-General, in an opinion on the right to strike, has 15 Schintgen, R. (2000) 16 Schintgen, R. (2000) 17 Judgment of 24 July 1952, in Pasicrisie luxembourgeoise, vol. 15, p. 355 ",
        "158 pointed out that while the constitution only expressly sanctions the freedom of trade unions, it is nonetheless necessary to recognise that this freedom also enshrines the right to engage in trade union activity since without such a right the freedom of trade unions would be illusory 18 . The right of lockout is implicitly affirmed in the aforementioned law of July 1965 on collective wage agreements, which obliges an employer who is party to a collective agreement not to threaten or enforce a lockout. 3.5 European integration and economic development at regional and local level: management of the Structural Funds Because Luxembourg is such a small country (it is roughly the same size as one of the smallest Nuts III regions in Community statistics), its central government and the Community institutions are the main partners responsible for managing the structural funds, without the local authorities playing any appreciable role. This also tallies with the system of indirect funding used for local authorities. In the case of the structural funds, too, the local authorities act mainly as the recipient for Community resources that are passed on by central government. Assistance from the Community's development and cohesion funds is understandably low, given Luxembourg's socio-economic situation. However, the level of structural fund use in the fields where assistance is provided (for example, the development of transport networks and tourist infrastructure) is amongst the highest in Europe 19 . 18 Schintgen, R. (2000) 19 CES (2003) ",
        "159 IV. LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES 4.1 Management of public services. The regional and local dimension of public services Under the system adopted by the European Commission, Luxembourg's policy in the field of public services is based on the concept of services of general interest (i.e. services, commercial or otherwise, regarded as being in the general interest and hence subject to specific public service obligations) and the concept of services of general economic interest (i.e. commercial services which satisfy a general interest and are hence subject to specific obligations, as in the case of network-based services such as transport, energy and communications). Seen in economic terms, public services correct deficiencies in market mechanisms. Hence \"the state intervenes only in a subsidiary capacity when self-regulating mechanisms do not function adequately, i.e. do not permit general access to goods and services, in the interest of society's economic, social and cultural cohesion\" 20 . Given the quintessential nature of a good and the fact that market failure must exist as a precondition, it is possible to pinpoint three types of public services: services which counter exclusion; services which contribute to social cohesion; and services which promote the balanced and efficient use of resources. The public service concept is therefore closely linked to the concept of general interest and draws on three fundamental principles \u2013 continuity, equality and adaptability 21 . 20 CES (2001a), p. 33 21 CES (2001a), p. 34 ",
        "160 A key role in the regulation of public services is played by the universal service concept \u2013 the sum total of all the obligations which are designed to ensure access everywhere to essential quality services at an affordable price. This reference framework, set out as part of the planning of public services policy, is reflected in the way legislation is implementation. The legal and regulatory basis for the introduction of the system of universal service is provided by the law of 21 March 1997 on telecommunications and the Grand Ducal regulation of 26 May 1998 on universal service in the field of telecommunications; the law of 24 July 2000 on the organisation of the electricity market; the law of 15 December 2000 on postal services and financial postal services; and the law of 6 April 2001 on the organisation of the natural gas market 22 . General interest services are seen as being part of the social market economy 23 , so that the activities forming services of general interest are crucial for the implementation of civil and social rights, given that they must satisfy the following needs in particular: social protection (including the guarantee of a minimum income, the right to decent housing, and access to certain financial services, such as the right to open a current account and to obtain credit); education; health; information and 22 In the view of the Economic and Social Council, however, apart from the implementation of the two Community directives on telecommunications and postal services, sectoral legislation has not yet defined the public service concept with sufficient precision nor laid down the minimum services to be guaranteed to users with sufficient certainty. See CES (2001a), p. 35. 23 In the view of the authors of the CES 2001 report on the state's role, \"social progress depends on economic progress, but the latter cannot be sustainable without social progress. The principles of the market economy must be complemented by social principles. This is the very essence of the European social model, which is not a handicap but a strength guaranteeing the durability of economic development\". ",
        "161 culture; provision of drinking water and energy, communication and transport services. The state, in particular, guarantees that all citizens are able to open a current account and to have access to credit, notwithstanding a modest income or an atypical or instable work situation, so as to be able to put their housing or business start-up plans into effect. Reference should be made in this context to article 30 of the law of 15 December 2000 on postal services and financial postal services 24 , which provides these rights with a legal basis. Social services in Luxembourg have expanded enormously in recent times, establishing a framework within which the state lays down by legislation the criteria to be respected by bodies working in the sector (mainly private). One \"new\" service of general interest is the assurance d\u00e9pendance 25 (insurance against the risk of no longer being able to live independently in old age), which is mainly provided privately and not directly by the public sector. 4.1.1 The impact of privatisation As the framework for the economic constitution described above shows, direct state participation in private companies' capital is not ideologically driven in Luxembourg, but is rather the result of a pragmatic approach, based in many cases on strategic, economic or social considerations. 24 M\u00e9morial A-135, p. 2963 (documents parlementaires n. 4524), as amended in M\u00e9morial A- 141, p. 3296 25 Cf. CES (2001a), p. 111 ",
        "162 The state has thus become a shareholder in a considerable number of companies operating in the services sector such as the Central Bank (BCEE), the post office (CCP), and the Luxembourg stock exchange in the financial sector; Cegedel, SOTEG and CEGECOM in the energy sector; SES, the RTL Group, and postal and telecommunications firms in the communications sector; and SNCFL, LUXAIR and Cargolux in the transport sector. The liberalisation of these markets and the provision of services therein has thus not been accompanied by a coherent plan for state sell-offs, with the result that the state still has a share in these firms' capital and the physical infrastructure. In its 2001 opinion on the state's role, the Economic and Social Council therefore recommended that a complete list of all direct and indirect state holdings be drawn up first and foremost, and added that when managing its holdings the state had to take constant account of factors linked to the national interest above and beyond the interests of the individual firms in question. In particular, the aim should be to channel private savings into productive activities. At the same time, in the case of firms that were fully state-owned, the policy should be to open up ownership 26 . As for market liberalisation and privatisation, the privatisation policy pursued is generally cautious bearing in mind that the objective according to the Economic and Social Council is \"to guarantee an appropriate balance between liberalisation, which will have to generate healthy and balanced competition within the sectors in question, and the relevant measures, which are based on the principles of the accessibility, quality and continuity of universal service and the transparency of user information\" 27 . 26 CES (2001a), pp. 95 et seq. 27 CES (2001a), p. 101 ",
        "163 The main sectors being liberalised are, as stated above (cf. point 3.2), telecommunications, postal services and energy. Following the outsourcing of services of general economic interest, the Luxembourg Institute for Regulation (ILR) was put in charge of budgetary control and auditing the management of the services. This body was set up to regulate competition in the liberalised sectors for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the fundamental principles of services of general interest, and in particular service continuity, the non- discrimination of users and free access to services, and service neutrality and independence. Another task of the ILR is to maintain a balance between the positive and negative effects of service liberalisation. A constant watch must be kept \u2013 in a manner which ensures that intervention by the public authorities, while confined to regulation, guarantees democratic control and responsibility \u2013 on the responsible consumption of natural resources with a view to lasting and sustainable development, the ban on the abuse of dominant positions, and public service continuity and security. So that this regulatory body can operate to best effect, the Economic and Social Council has recommended financial autonomy and greater independence vis-\u00e0-vis government administration and external operators, favouring the replacement of the old law from 1970 on restrictive commercial practices 28 with a \"new legal framework for competition\", which regulates the abuse of dominant positions and restrictive agreements 29 . 28 Law of 17 June 1970 on restrictive commercial practices, in M\u00e9morial A-(1970), p. 892 29 CES (2001a), p. 55 ",
        "164 Because of the prominence given to the efficiency of the public service sector, the role of local authorities is essentially limited to implementing the policies laid down by central government and to representing the demands of local populations with a view to influencing national decision-making. Local authorities are not able to draw up really autonomous local policies for the public service sector. V. THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON REGIONAL AND LOCAL DEMOCRACY 5.1 Computerisation of public administration (projects, experience and results) The eLuxembourg programme on IT use for public service activities was launched in February 2001 for the purpose of putting Luxembourg at the forefront of the information society in the EU 30 . Statistics show that this objective has not been fully achieved, but in the field of public administration comparative assessments indicate that the eLuxembourg programme has enabled considerable progress to be made 31 . The one-stop portal for SMEs ( portail PME \u00e0 guichet unique ) launched in 1993 has been extremely important. Among the eight objectives of the eLuxembourg programme, the exploitation of new information and communication technologies in the public sector for the purpose of 30 D\u00e9claration gouvernementale 1999 31 The benchmarking exercise on eGovernment carried out for the European Union by Gemini Ernst and Young shows Luxembourg way behind the other Community countries but with a growth rate of more than 100% per year.

        "165 offering new electronic services has been assigned to the eGovernment project, which is coordinated by the Luxembourg Ministry for the Civil Service and Administrative Reform. The eGovernment initiative covers numerous projects the purpose of which is to supply, within the relevant area of administration (education, health, social services, telecommunications), IT services which are accessible via all means of communication. The ultimate objective is to make it unnecessary for the final users of services to know a priori how the public administration is organised and how tasks are distributed, and to free them from the logistical and time constraints linked to traditional counter services and the need to supply and update the requisite personal data. It is planned to set up a one-stop portal for accessing public sector services, through which users will be able to obtain a number of different services such as the provision of free public documents not covered by secrecy laws (opinions, reports, brochures, statistics, etc.), the downloading of service application forms, the supply of materials for payment (publications, stamps, etc.) and the request for certificates and printouts. Pending the definitive version of the one-stop portal, the National Commission for the Information Society attached to the Ministry for the Civil Service and Administrative Reform is promoting the harmonisation of the various eGovernment initiatives, and particularly those to do with local administrations. It has published a Charte de normalisation de la pr\u00e9sence sur Internet de l'Etat, which apart from being a technical guide for building local administrations' websites that are sufficiently well harmonised to provide input for the future \"virtual\" one-stop shop, also constitutes an embryonic charter of users' rights.

        "166 ICT is particularly widespread in schools, with the number of students per computer and the number of Internet connections in schools placing Luxembourg at the forefront of the EU. Despite this, the Economic and Social Council thinks that the new communication technologies have not been adequately incorporated into curricula, and points out that in the absence of an overall strategy what has been achieved has been mainly down to individual teachers 32 . 5.2 Procedures and safeguards for electronic voting. The role of electronic discussion forums. The rise of local television networks Electronic voting is not available either for voting at home via IT networks or - in simpler form - for voting in polling stations. The political discussion on the network was given a major boost at the social forum held in the Grand Duchy on 14 July 2003. As a result, all the bodies involved in promoting direct democracy launched a joint portal www.demokratie.lu, which aims to become the main centre of information for citizens and to carry forward the public discussion on IT democracy and eGovernment and on direct democracy and grassroots' participation. 5.3 Information technology and changing public services Participation in the information society is regarded as one facet of the \"universal service\" concept, given the view that the relationship between service providers and users may be radically changed by any aspect of the information society and that the more widespread use of IT networks can increase consumer importance, while at the same time allowing service providers to make economies of scale as a result of their 32 CES(2003), p. 108 ",
        "167 access to a worldwide market; this results in a democratisation of the markets, which is also brought about by the increased scope for integrating citizens who are at risk of being excluded, such as persons with disabilities and the inhabitants of remote or peripheral regions 33 . With regard to on-line access to goods and services in the private sectors, satisfactory use is made of the Internet by both firms and households (according to Eurobarometer data from November 2002, Luxembourg is in sixth position in the EU for Internet use by households and second position for on-line shopping). In the research sector, Luxembourg has benefited satisfactorily from taking part in the Community eEurope programme. A central broadband network called GEANT has been set up to which approximately 3100 research institutes are connected. Within the context of the eEurope 2005 action plan, Luxembourg is proposing to introduce broadband connections in the coming years on a wide scale.

        "173 THE NETHERLANDS INTRODUCTION In terms of regional and local government structures, the Netherlands appears at present to be a country in transition: after a long period of concentration of powers in the state institutions, substantial changes in this field have taken place in the last few years. Decision-making powers and responsibilities for the provision of public services are gradually being transferred to the provinces and municipalities; the central government is increasingly engaged in laying down general guidelines under which local authorities can enjoy some independence in managing public affairs, although for the time being the representatives of the national government responsible for regional and local institutions retain considerable powers. This traditional concentration of the decision-making process is also reflected in the lack of an autonomous political sphere at local level, which normally shows the same balance of forces as the national elections, as well as in the rather limited interest shown by citizens in sub-national elections and the resulting lack of regional or local party organisations. This is accompanied by a growing trend towards coordination of the activities of provincial and municipal governments; with the intention of making the services provided for citizens more reliable and efficient, local authorities tend to rationalise their own activities and seek as far as possible to cooperate both with the other regional and municipal institutions and with the other social and economic forces in the area, to the extent that they make increasingly frequent use of private entrepreneurs to provide public services for citizens. These forms of cooperation are made possible, among other things, by the high level of computerisation of public offices and private dwellings, which is reflected not only in a functional management ",

I. THE EVOLUTION OF FEDERAL/REGIONAL DYNAMICS. THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 1.1 Organisation of the State in the last thirty years. Historical profile 1.1.1 The evolution of regionalisation/federalisation procedures and decentralisation processes. The most recent institutional developments Traditionally, the institutional framework of the Netherlands is described as a \"decentralised unitary state\", a definition which suggests a considerable degree of control, or at least monitoring, by central political actors of the local authorities' exercise of their own powers. For example, in a comparative analysis carried out in the 1970s of 15 federal or non-federal forms of state, the Dutch system appeared to be the most centralised one in terms of the proportion of taxes payable to the central government (98%) 1 . However, in the same study it was pointed out that, alongside this \"organisational\" centralisation, there remains in the Netherlands a \"sociological federalism\" \u2013 also historical/cultural in nature \u2013 which inevitably influences the perception and function of local authorities within Dutch institutional frameworks beyond what is laid down in the relevant constitutional rules. 1 Lijphart A. (1988), 189 ",
        "175 Identification with the local authority \u2013 in the Dutch case above all the province, which takes the traditional place of the regional authority in other systems \u2013 is therefore very strong, both as an intermediate level of government between central state and municipality, and, above all, as a point of reference in sociological terms 2 . Dutch local authorities have enjoyed considerable autonomy since the time of the Holy Roman Empire; this was maintained under Spanish Habsburg domination, up to the creation of the first autonomous state entity, the Republic of the Seven United Provinces (1568-1795), in which the province was endowed with its own territorial independence. The cities took on a prominent role in the actual administration of the territory, particularly in the western areas, while the function of the central government necessarily remained in the background, favouring management of public affairs based on compromise between distinct interests, in which one can probably see the forerunner of the \"associative\" nature of the present-day Dutch political system 3 . However, the effectiveness of decentralisation was seen as an obstacle to the reorganisation of the state apparatus as a whole. Partly because of the effectiveness of the centralising influence of French domination in 1795-1813, the extent of local autonomy was scaled down, to the extent that the Netherlands' first constitution of 1798 set up a unitary state in which the provinces were little more than an administrative extension of the central government. This structure lasted for most of the nineteenth century; the emergence of diverging social, political and economic requirements produced corresponding interest groups, above all on party or religious lines, but structured also on the basis of territorial subdivisions. This led to economic, cultural and social questions \u2013 dealt with in federal systems through the local 2 Hendriks F., Raadschelders J., Toonen T. (1995), 216 3 Keman H. (1997), 352 ",
        "176 authorities \u2013 being handled above all by the said interest groups (always with a view to consensus among the parties involved), while provinces and cities remained essentially a technical/legal back-up for a political will determined in other fora. This was also to a large extent the inspiration for the constitutional model drawn up at the request of King William II by the liberal Johan R. Thorbecke in 1848: the Constitution of the Netherlands (1848), the Law on the Provinces (1850) and the Law on the Municipalities (1851) helped to produce a form of state in which the local authorities enjoyed a certain autonomy at administrative level, but always in the context of a general accord with the central state, whose authorities were thus called upon to produce the general rules under which provinces and municipalities could develop their own management of the matters for which they were responsible. Here, too, there was thus a marked search for consensus in the management of public affairs in both directions along the centre-periphery administrative axis. In the first half of the twentieth century the provinces retained this second-tier role, while the municipal administrations succeeded in extending some of their competences in technical/organisational fields in comparison with the central government. The need to revive the economy after the Second World War led to a reorganisation of the management of public affairs, starting with the role of the local authorities. From the end of the 1960s onwards the gap between the various territorial entities gave rise to a way of organising national policy based on more scope for provinces and municipalities, which were undoubtedly more dynamic and effective, especially in promoting cooperation at local level. Then, in the 1980s, the Dutch Government set up the Montijn Commission (known by the name of its chairman) with the task of analysing ways of reorganising local political activity, particularly in terms of reviving the country's economic productivity. The Montijn Commission's proposal to set up strong regional governments in the larger urban areas did not, however, have significant effects. In this respect the local authorities have acted independently in the meantime to set in motion joint or cross-frontier economic ",
        "177 development projects, particularly in a Community context, which in some cases have produced very positive results 4 , and which seem to stimulate the central authorities to create the conditions for economic planning centred on the local level, encouraging a general reorganisation of Dutch provincial and municipal government in the direction of more decentralisation of powers and functions. An important restructuring step was taken with the adoption of the 1994 laws on provinces and municipalities (known respectively as the Provinciewet and the Gemeentewet ), regarded as the framework legislation of the period, which consolidated the ongoing process of decentralisation. Then, in September 1998, a royal commission for the reform of local government was set up, with consultative functions and with the aim of creating a new institutional model for local authorities, focusing on a clear separation of powers between the local council and the committee composed of the mayor and aldermen ( Raad van Burgemeester en Wethouders, B&W ), officially the executive body of the municipality, although the powers of the two institutions were not clearly demarcated. The commission's conclusions were presented in January 2000 and largely accepted by the Dutch Government, which used them as a basis for the Law on Local Government adopted in February 2002. The latter made considerable changes to the position of the municipal council, starting with the fact that aldermen can no longer be members of it. At all events, the general thrust of the reform is to consolidate exclusive executive power at local level in the hands of the B&W . At the same time, the reform is intended to strengthen the decision-making power, in policy matters, of the council, which is no longer burdened with administrative 4 Hendriks F., Raadschelders J., Toonen T. (1995), 227 ",
        "178 responsibilities as it was before 2002, and has greater powers to monitor and verify the implementation of its decisions by the municipal executive 5 . 1.1.2 Relations between central government and the regional/local levels of government The Dutch constitutional system provides for two levels of local government: provincial (there are 12 provinces) and municipal (at present there are 489 municipalities). Two categories of competences are attributed to them: autonomous competences, whereby they can issue decrees, provided that these do not conflict with the relevant legislation in force at national level (in the case of provinces and municipalities) and/or with decrees issued in the same field by the province in which the municipal authority is located (in the case of municipalities); and competences granted by the state, under which local authorities are obliged to cooperate with the central government to achieve objectives set at state level. Government organisation is currently evolving towards a broader decentralisation of competences and responsibilities to the local authorities, to narrow the gap between the citizen and the public administration and to cut down on red tape. For example, the Law on Municipalities lays down that municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants may now set up municipal districts with their own functions and competences, each run by a district council 6 . Nonetheless, relations between the central government and the local administrations continue to rest essentially on a hierarchical principle, since the executives of local authorities still include members directly appointed by the central government, whether for a province (the Queen's Commissioner), for a municipality (where the mayor is appointed jointly by the 5 Denters B.J., Klok P.J., Van der Kolk (2003), 14 6 An option which has so far been taken up only by the cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam.

        "179 Queen's Commissioner and the Government in The Hague) or for the water control authority. Recently, however, an attempt has been made to introduce a relationship of cooperation rather than dependence between central government and local authorities; details of this will be given below. Another recent tendency is for local, particularly municipal, authorities to cooperate on problems of common interest, such as urban traffic or environmental questions: an initiative which could probably be even more effective if coordinated at provincial level. The sources of financial support for local authorities are of three kinds: local taxes, local fees and transfers from the central government. State funds are allocated to the provinces and municipalities in the form of funding for specific purposes, to which is added general funding which in principle can be used by the local authorities in the interests of their communities in the ways they deem to be best. The local authorities' own sources of funds include the property tax and local charges (such as parking fees), but it is also possible to introduce specific taxes, such as a tax on dogs or on tourism. The twelve Dutch provinces have responsibility for environmental management, town and country planning, energy, and social, sporting and cultural activities. The institutional structure of each province consists of a council (the \"Provincial States\"), an executive body and a Queen's Commissioner. The members of the provincial council, whose number is proportional to that of the citizens resident in the province, are directly elected by the latter for four years, and elect in their turn the members of the provincial government from among themselves. The Constitution allows for conditions to be laid down by law for residents of non- Dutch nationality to be granted the right to stand or vote in provincial elections, provided that they meet the same requirements as those applying for this purpose to ",
        "180 Dutch citizens 7 . The Queen's Commissioner, appointed by the central government, remains in office for six years and chairs both the legislative body (in which, however, he has only a consultative vote) and the executive, thus acting both as a representative of the central state and as the highest provincial authority. The Commissioner is responsible for implementation of the measures taken by the council or by the provincial government, but he can suspend their implementation where there is reason to regard them as contrary to the law or the public interest, and they need to be annulled by the Crown. If the annulment does not take place within 30 days from the Queen's Commissioner's submission, the latter must carry out the measure in question. The Netherlands now have 489 municipalities (June 2003) \u2013 a number which has fallen considerably through the constant incorporation of smaller municipalities into larger local authorities, as part of the general process of reorganisation of the administrative structure, against the opposition of some smaller municipalities. It has been calculated that 174 municipalities were absorbed by larger ones between 1979 and 1998. In the latter year only 25 municipalities \u2013 4.4% of those in existence \u2013 had fewer than 5000 inhabitants 8 . As regards their role in the administrative apparatus, the local authorities have competences of their own in the fields of water supply, traffic, building, the management of state schools, social and health services, sport and recreational and cultural activities. In 1994 the central government launched a programme of urban renewal, with special expenditure in 25 cities to improve the quality of their services in education, safety, 7 Article 130 of the Netherlands Constitution 8 Kraaykamp G., van Dam M., Toonen T. (2001), 404 ",
        "181 health, employment, sport, culture and infrastructure, even creating the post of Minister for Urban Policies to coordinate these measures. The institutional organisation of the municipalities provides for a council, a municipal government (comprising the mayor and the aldermen) and the mayor. The municipal administrative authorities are officially placed under the supervision of the province and the central government, which in fact make very little use of this power. The council is directly elected for four years by all adult local residents, including all foreign citizens who have been legally resident in the Netherlands for at least five years. EU citizens acquire the right to stand in municipal elections when they become resident in the Netherlands. The council elects from among its members the aldermen, whose number is proportionate to the municipality's population, while the mayor is chosen by the Queen's Commissioner of the relevant province from among the names on a list drawn up by a special committee of the municipal council; he or she is appointed by the central government for six years, and the appointment can be renewed. In an attempt to make the procedure for appointing the mayor more democratic, the option has recently been created of holding consultative municipal referenda on the membership of these lists, but for the moment there does not seem to be much enthusiasm on the part of the citizens 9 . The mayor, who is responsible with the aldermen for day-to-day local administration, chairs both the council and the executive body, which is mainly responsible for carrying out the decisions with regard to its territory taken by the central government and the relevant provincial executive. As mentioned above, in 2002 a reform law sought to rationalise the role of 9 Denters B., Klok P.J. (2003), 14 ",
        "182 local government bodies, above all by separating more clearly the council's functions from those of the executive and by strengthening its decision-making powers 10 . Finally, the water control authorities are public-law bodies, like the administrative bodies mentioned earlier, and constitute one of the oldest forms of democratic management of public affairs found in the Netherlands. Some of them go back to the Middle Ages, and they are still extremely important in a country where more than half of the land is below sea level. Responsible for protecting the country from floods, these bodies control the building and management of dikes, sluices and canals, water flows and levels, and the maintenance of water quality. The General Council of each body is elected by property owners resident in the area covered, while the executive committee and chairman are appointed by the central government. 1.1.3 Local authority cooperation and associations As the model followed by the various actors involved in administering the territory is consensual rather than competitive, it is not surprising that among the local, and above all municipal, bodies there is a high level of cooperation through agencies or agreements for the supply of services. Coordination in this context is managed mainly by the Association of Dutch Municipalities, which constitutes a real reference point for the sector. As mentioned above 11 , the Dutch Constitution gives local communities the power to regulate and administer their own competences, freely defining within this framework the objectives to be pursued and the ways in which their powers are exercised, as 10 See above, point I.1. 11 See above, point I.2. ",
        "183 long as these fit in with relevant national and provincial provisions. Moreover, local authorities should be involved as much as possible in the application of national legislation at local level, through what is known as co-governance , a strategy for dividing up responsibilities in which it is difficult to identify any area where a single level of government has exclusive competence. Moreover, since the 1950s one of the priorities of the state authorities has been to organise local government operationally on the basis of regional cooperation, above all because in the Netherlands, given the population density and the limited space available, the administrative obligations of the municipalities do not coincide with the geographical limits of the conurbations. Nonetheless, the various proposals for reform in this field have often remained a dead letter, particularly because of the reciprocal vetoes of the various coalitions of sectoral interests 12 . Thus, for the time being, the local authorities continue to practise the voluntary inter-municipal cooperation authorised by the laws on Gemeenschappelijke Regelingen of 1950, 1985 and later. These allow for the setting up of \"inter-municipal\" government bodies, linked to the municipal authorities and operating on a strictly consensual basis, or with the possibility for each municipality involved to veto a measure under discussion. In the latter case any possibility of an effective joint administration is excluded; this is very likely to happen when the measures under discussion conflict with interests strongly held by the electorate of a specific municipality. Thus the instrument of \"inter-municipal\" government as at present constituted does not seem appropriate for managing key questions at local level, such as economic planning, acquisition of firms, coordination of fiscal policies and planning decisions 13 . 12 Toonen Th.A.J. (1993), 123-126 13 Denters B., Klok P.J. (2003), 5 ",
        "184 1.1.4 The evolution of the metropolitan government model: the role of the metropolitan cities Some years ago the Dutch Government launched an integrated strategy of urban policies, designed to create \"the complete city\" (de complete stad) , i.e. a city capable of meeting the community's needs effectively (Ministry of the Interior, 2000). The strategy is based on an integrated political approach which makes it possible to take action at the same time on the three aspects (economic, social and physical) of current urban problems \u2013 especially in the case of large metropolitan areas. To carry out such strategies, a Ministry for Urban Policy and Integration has recently been set up, alongside the Interministerial Committee for Urban Policies and the Ministerial Council for Urban Policies: however, these central government bodies operate in close collaboration with the municipal authorities, also seeking to involve both public and private partners, with the aim of achieving significant structural improvements in the various fields of action. A decentralised approach was chosen, placing the responsibility for the functioning of cities above all in the hands of local authorities and their inhabitants, their business community and their relevant institutions. This strategy enables each city to focus on its own problems, at the same time allowing central government to assist local authorities in carrying out their strategies, identified with the help of resident citizens and in agreement with the national institutions. More specifically, the strategies to be put into practice for each of the three aspects are as follows: 1) Employment and economy Given the awareness that the economic vitality of a city is absolutely essential for reviving its depressed districts, urban economic policies place the small and medium- sized enterprises of the area at the centre of their action; the main objective is to ",
        "185 provide more job opportunities; the local authorities pursue this objective by supporting the city's businesses (especially in the ICT and biotechnology sectors), but without neglecting jobs in the less skilled areas, such as commerce, industry and catering, and by providing training courses, e.g. in the IT sector. 2) Environmental development Development of the physical environment makes it possible to improve the living, working and general conditions of urban areas: to this end measures are envisaged to renew residential areas, industrial zones and open spaces, with an improvement in road conditions and consequent speeding up of traffic and reduction of environmental pollution. However, these objectives can be achieved only through close collaboration between municipal authorities and various categories of private legal persons, such as owners of commercial concerns, entrepreneurs, investment companies and building cooperatives. 3) Social context The quality of city life is not measured solely in terms of an adequate, pleasant and secure living environment, but also in terms of working conditions, proximity to shopping areas, educational facilities and social cohesion. The main aim of measures here is to improve social infrastructures, focusing on health, social security, safety, youth policies, quality of life, social integration and the participation in local political life of both native populations and communities of foreign immigrants, with special attention given to the most vulnerable groups in this context (ethnic minorities, disadvantaged individuals). The objectives of these integrated urban policies are supported largely by the use of European funding (European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund), ",
        "186 and in particular for the 2000-2006 period with subsidies for priority objectives (Objectives 2 and 3) and Community initiatives (Urban 2, Equal) 14 . The larger cities (such as Amsterdam and Rotterdam) enjoy a high level of autonomy in running their own administration, to such an extent that they operate almost as a separate part of the local government system, capable even of exerting pressure on central government; this is due to the special treatment in terms of autonomy which they receive because of their size and the specific social, political and economic conditions which characterise them. In general this results in high efficiency in the provision of services by the city authorities, but it can involve problems for some in terms of greater bureaucracy, precisely because of the special status of these large municipalities within the traditional three-part structure of public administration. 1.2 Political and social players in the regionalisation/federalisation processes. The role of political parties and of other forms of associations Traditionally the Dutch political scene has always been characterised by a large number of parties, partly because of a highly proportional electoral system, the nature of which (list voting rather than individual voting; constituency covering the whole country; exclusion threshold of only 0.67%, i.e. virtually negligible) is enough to explain why, for example, between 1945 and 1980 the level of non-proportionality between the number of parties standing for the national elections and those actually represented in Parliament was barely 1.1 15 . Essentially, the Dutch electoral system appears to do very little to reduce the number of parties, in accordance with a 14 See point III.5 below. 15 Lijphart A. (1988), 171 ",
        "187 conception of politics which is habitually focused much more on the search for consensus than on the opposition of diverging strategies. In this context, the emergence of local parties, which necessarily express specific and particular interests, therefore seems less likely. Only the partial decline of this basis of political activity, as indeed of the traditional organisational forms of social life - not only party political but also religious, for example \u2013 has led to local needs being organised in a more structured way, generating political movements of a localised kind, whose presence in the representative assemblies of Dutch provinces, and municipalities grew in the 1990s. However, the tendency to \u201cnationalise\u201d electoral choices, even in local elections, and the appointment and control of provincial and municipal administrative authorities by the central executive \u2013 in relation to which they therefore recognise a much greater political responsibility than in relation to the local communities they administer \u2013 undoubtedly act as a significant brake on the development of purely localised forms of political organisation. Even the afore-mentioned process of fusion of municipal authorities 16 , by preventing the crystallisation of strong interest groups around specific needs solidly rooted in the locality, tends to prevent the formation of political and party organisations at local level. To this should be added the Dutch tradition of holding municipal elections on the same day at four-year intervals; in the view of many scientific observers this gives rise to a \u201cnationalisation\u201d of local election campaigns, in which it is the national parties, far more than the personalities and problems directly concerning citizens, which influence voting choices 17 . As a result, it is not surprising that purely local 16 See point 1.2 above. 17 Kraaykamp, G., van Dam, M., Toonen., T., (2001), 407 ",
        "188 political movements are rare; they include the Frisia National Party ( Fryske Nasjonale Partij ); some are linked to former colonial territories, such as the independence parties of Aruba or the Antilles. 1.2.1 Regional organisation of political parties and movements All the main Dutch parties have the traditional mass organisational structure, with recruitment centrally controlled; each political movement is organised on a national scale, particularly as a result of the representative electoral system with a block list and a single constituency covering the entire national territory, adopted in 1918, which has led the parties to adopt a centralised structure for better coordination of the composition and list of candidacies at the various levels. Moreover, the current electoral system directs a considerable part of the electors\u2019 attention towards the party and the programme. This calls for strong coordination among the various organisational levels in election campaigns, while it usually leaves the individual characteristics of candidates in the background. 18 The organisational structure common to all the parties has three levels, corresponding more or less to the three levels of the administrative operators: local, provincial and national. The local level of organisation ( afdeling ) is not only the basic element of the structure, sending its own delegates to the higher levels; it is also the main party body as regards municipal policies. This dual function places the afdeling under constant pressure, since it obliges it both to manage questions of local interest and to discuss matters concerning higher levels. There is, however, a tendency to concentrate attention on local matters, especially on the part of the smaller bodies. 18 Katz, R.S., Mair, P. (1995a), 284 ; Katz, R.S., Mair, P. (1995b), 620 ",
        "189 Another characteristic of the Dutch party system is the presence of the Party Council ( partijraad ), which is in a sense a smaller version of the National Congress, but with a completely different composition. While the National Congress is made up of delegates of the local bodies, the Council is dominated by delegates from the provincial organisations. The partijraad not only manages questions internal to the party, but also plays an important political role in the Congress structure. This centralism in the organisation of the provincial apparatus of the parties was attenuated in the late 1960s and in the 1970s, when \u2013 probably also because of the abolition of compulsory voting \u2013 most of the political organisations introduced, to varying extents, programmes to decentralise their own structures with the aim of ensuring more democracy in the internal decision-making process. However, the local organisations did not take full advantage of the opportunity offered to them, and from the 1990s onwards there was a general tendency to return to centralised management of the inter-party decision-making procedure, partly as a reaction to the discontent produced by the importance which the regional bodies have managed to acquire in this respect, and because of the poor electoral results achieved in that period by parties which had gone further towards internal decentralisation, such as the Partij van de Arbeid (PvdA) (Labour Party) and the conservative Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie (VVD) (People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy). 1.2.2 Regional parties The range of Dutch parties includes party formations of a regional nature, such as the Fryske Nasjonale Partij , and political movements reflecting the specific territorial situation of former colonial possessions, as in the case of the independence parties of Aruba and the Antilles, which do not, however, exercise much influence on national politics. ",
        "190 1.3 The importance of cooperation and social dialogue As mentioned above 19 , management of local government in the Netherlands has over the years been increasingly inspired by principles of cooperation among the various parties involved, both at the institutional level and in relations with other social organisations. We shall provide detailed descriptions of these in subsequent chapters 20 ; here we can point out the cooperation between provincial and municipal institutions and private bodies (particularly through the increasing use of privatisation to deliver public services at local level), associations such as trade unions, interest groups, etc., and citizens directly, in an attempt \u2013 which does not seem to have been very successful so far \u2013 to encourage direct popular participation in the subnational political context. II. DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AT REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL 2.1 Voting in national and regional/local elections A fairly recent analysis of the Dutch political-institutional situation at local level 21 identified two specific coalition models at the head of local executives, especially in the municipal context: the \u201ccommunity\u201d model, based on bodies and candidates strongly rooted in local conditions, and the \u201cparty\u201d model, in which the relationships between the political forces involved tend to reproduce the equilibrium found at national level. In the first case it is possible to find local governments in which a clear governing majority is matched by an equally recognisable opposition, while in the 19 See point I.3. 20 Chapters III and IV 21 Kuiper, W., Tops, P. (1989), 220 ",
        "191 second case one finds the tendency towards association and consensus already observed for some time at national level 22 . The \u201ccommunity\u201d or \u201cmajority\u201d model is traditionally found in the local authorities in the south of the country, where the Catholic People\u2019s Party, traditionally very strong in these areas, tends to put forward its own candidates only in the large cities, thus making it possible for independent political figures to emerge in the smaller centres. This shifts the attention of the electorate from the parties - often absent from these elections - to the personal characteristics of the independent candidates, who once elected form coalitions amongst themselves unrelated to traditional party links. As stated, this system can be successful only in cases where the national parties do not directly take part in local elections (this normally occurs only in a geographically and politically defined area; in other cases the traditional \u201cparty\u201d or associative model applies, in which the composition of the local authorities seeks to be a faithful reflection of the proportional distribution of votes among the parties involved in the election). There are a number of reasons why the associative model has also gained great favour at local level: first and foremost, the institutional framework of local authorities entrusts the greater part of decision-making powers to the municipal executive, so that participation by a party means having a more or less large, but nonetheless effective, share in the management of local affairs. In addition, the post of mayor, decisive in terms of the local political direction, is external to the balance of forces at municipal level, since the mayor is appointed by the national government: the principal factor leading to the polarisation of the political forces involved is therefore lacking, with all the consequences that entails. Secondly, the extent of the 22 Lijphart, A. (1988), 142, 171 ",
        "192 powers granted to local executives is rather limited: this prevents party positions from being highly politicised, creating favourable conditions for cooperation even among political forces which are ideologically distant. Finally, the influence of national positions on local elections, described above, means that assuming radical positions could lead not only to exclusion from the municipal executive in the immediate future, but also in the longer term to possible \u201costracism\u201d by the other political forces, with a serious possibility of remaining excluded from decision-making centres in the medium or long term. All this explains both the persistence of the \u201cassociative\u201d coalition model at local level, rather than the \u201ccommunity\u201d model, and the tendency to abandon the latter model gradually in favour of the former at a time when, for example through the aforementioned merging of local authorities to form larger municipal entities 23 , the structural conditions which until then had made possible the emergence of local political candidacies and groupings, instead of the traditional party spectrum, are disappearing. In terms of political participation, Dutch citizens show little interest in expressing their own preferences in local elections: the average turnout in these cases is less than half, in comparison with the turnout for national elections to renew the lower chamber, which has never been lower than 73% in recent decades. 23 See paragraph I.2.1 above.

The same effect is probably produced by the highly structured and functional Dutch social state, which tends to deal with all problems which individuals can encounter in social or economic terms, reducing citizens\u2019 sense of responsibility in their relations with municipal bodies, at any rate when specific interests perceived particularly at local level are not involved.

        "195 2.2 Forms and instruments of direct democracy Although the Netherlands are one of the five countries in the world which have never held a referendum at national level 25 , the debate on including direct democracy provisions in the Dutch constitution has been going on for more than a century. However, the constant mistrust of referenda and popular legislative initiatives, especially on the part of conservative political forces, has led to a situation in which by the end of the 1990s no more had been done than to appoint commissions of experts periodically on the subject (as many as five in the 20 th century). The cautiously positive conclusions of these commissions were then systematically disregarded by the government of the day. In 1994, a national government containing no Christian Democrat parties and characterised by the presence of the progressive D66 Party attempted to introduce elements of direct democracy at national level, with varying results until on 1 January 2002 a \u201ctemporary law on referenda\u201d entered into force which introduced the referendum at national level, albeit not in a binding way. The subsequent centre-right government, however, declared its intention to abolish this law \u2013 a plan put aside temporarily following the tragic death of Pim Fortuyn. At all events, despite these setbacks the institutions of direct democracy have enjoyed a certain success in the Netherlands from the 1990s onwards, at least at municipal level, above all in terms of the reorganisation of the municipal boundaries, on which the national parliament is however competent to decide. Between 1991 and 2001, in the hope of checking the drastic fall in participation in local elections 26 , 62 of the 537 municipalities introduced forms of referendum to change existing legislative provisions, although some topics on the political agenda (such as fiscal discipline, the budget, politicians\u2019 25 Nijeboer A. 26 Neijens P., Minkman M., Slot J. (1998), 300 ",
        "196 allowances and rules relating to \u201cweak\u201d social groups such as prostitutes or asylum seekers) are excluded from this procedure. Moreover, in accordance with the old Dutch tradition which regards direct democracy above all as a potential threat to the representative system 27 , care was taken to maintain a veto power for municipal councils, which are not legally bound by the results of the referenda. However, leaving aside the actual effect of referenda on the political positions of representative bodies, the tendency to use them fairly often at least in the local context \u2013 particularly in metropolitan areas such as Amsterdam \u2013 constitutes an innovation which is open to future development on the Dutch political scene; the success of referenda, especially in the large cities, can in the view of some be regarded as an indicator of interest, if not affection for, local politics. Moreover, a recent law allows municipalities to hold consultative referenda as an instrument for control by citizens of the operation of local institutions. Many municipalities have introduced a programme of \u201cinteractive government\u201d designed to intensify the direct popular participation of citizens and other interested parties (social organisations, enterprises, independent public commissions) in local political activities. In some cases this also involves delegating decision-making powers through contiguous structures and allocating a small budget to residents\u2019 associations. The nature of participation in interactive government differs in at least two ways: firstly, the aim of participation can vary, since in some cases it turns out to have a simple consultative value vis-\u00e0-vis the executive or the municipal council, and is therefore non-binding, while in other cases it is the politicians themselves who seek in this way to influence local institutions more deeply. Secondly, the extent of opening up to participation varies, since it can be limited to professionals from non- profit organisations (already involved in the supply of local public services), to the 27 Van Holsteyn J. (1996), 128 ",
        "197 public officials of other administrations or to independent public commissions, or instead it can allow indiscriminate involvement of all citizens. Of course there are cases of joint strategies to involve various players in local politics, but in general participation is almost entirely by organisations of \u201cpolitical professionals\u201d (non- profit associations, public officials from quangos 28 and from business), while ordinary citizens do not seem particularly interested for the moment; this may, however, depend on the need to identify forms of political participation which are simpler and more accessible for the masses 29 . 2.3 Community identification with regional and local government In the absence of specific indicators on the subject, it is necessary to go back to the analyses and elements which can indirectly provide a measure of the attachment and interest of local populations towards institutions which administer the sub-national communities to which they belong: in this sense, some observers have seen a demonstration of interest and involvement of communities in local questions in the increase in the number of referenda on questions of regional or municipal interest, in the inclusion of volunteer workers and private individuals, not only in planning and political development, but also in the supply of services, and in the adoption of highly transparent administrative procedures through which citizens can assess more clearly the work of their representatives. On the other hand, the gradual process of incorporation of municipalities into larger entities could have negative effects on the quality of the relationship between citizens 28 See point III.5 below. 29 Denters B., Klok P.J., Visser M.

REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 3.1 The constitutional framework (economic and financial aspects) Articles 104 to 106 of the Netherlands constitution define the basic principles of the economic constitution. These lay down that laws shall be used to regulate taxes and other state levies, prepare the budget of public revenue and expenditure, establish the rules for management of state finances and control the monetary system. Thus, from an organisational viewpoint, the highest institutional authority for economic planning is the national legislator, i.e. the joint action of the Netherlands government and parliament. 3.2 Privatisation and economic regulation Apart from what is laid down by national law 31 , other instruments for organising relations between the central state and local authorities, particularly in an economic context, are conventions ( Akkoorden) : the first convention, dating from 1987, contained agreements on the principles and procedures for regulating relations between the two levels of government, although from the legal viewpoint these acts are not binding, but rather create moral obligations intended to reduce opportunistic behaviour which would violate earlier reciprocal agreements. One problem derives from the fact that the Association of Municipalities operates on behalf of about 500 30 Denters B., Klok P.J. (2003), 4 31 See point III.3 below. ",
        "199 members, without the authority to conclude agreements which are effectively binding on all of them. The most important provisions of the 1987 convention concern the principle of proportionality in carrying out the programme of cuts in public expenditure at national and local level, as well as the national government\u2019s decentralisation policies. The convention applying to the period 1999-2002 is innovative in many ways, particularly because it seems to be based on the results obtained (so that the funds granted imply the existence of measurable objectives and of periodic monitoring of work carried out); it also provides for consultations twice a year between the Prime Minister, the ministers and the main representatives of associations of provinces and municipalities. The effects of the conventions on the distribution of powers in relations between centre and periphery are difficult to assess: on the one hand the most recent conventions open up additional channels through which the national ministers can influence local bodies and monitor their work through new instruments; on the other hand they guarantee provincial and municipal authorities greater operational discretionary power and additional sources of funds, as well as new means of access to the central government. 3.3 The budget of regional and local authorities: the local authority share of national tax revenue The decentralisation process has also had consequences in economic terms: in the areas in which local bodies have declared their willingness to take responsibility (such as public building, educational services, social security and care of children and young people), the transfer of powers has taken place only where municipalities have at the same time accepted that public funding should cover less than 100% of the ",
        "200 expenditure on the services which are transferred to their control 32 . This has made possible significant savings in state finances, which are under pressure because of the urgent need to reduce public expenditure felt in all the Member States of the EU. Turning to the economic organisation of sub-national bodies, each of the provinces and municipalities in the Netherlands adopts its own budget. The Law on the Provinces and the Law on the Municipalities regulate in much the same way the economic planning of the local authorities. At the provincial and municipal levels respectively, the provincial council and the municipal council constitute the highest authorities in financial matters. Budgets are drawn up on the basis of the recommendations made by the provincial and municipal executive bodies (defined respectively as the Gedeputeerde Staten and the Mayor and senior municipal councillors), elected by the local representative bodies from among their own members. The provincial budget, once approved, has to be sent to the Minister of the Interior by not later than 15 November of the year preceding the year of reference, while the municipal budget has to be sent to the relevant provincial government endowed with monitoring powers, also before 15 November. The provincial and municipal councils commit themselves to balancing their own budgets, at least in the long term; the expenditure headings inserted in the budget are those regarded as necessary for provincial and municipal responsibilities and activities, including incidental expenditure. Also to be included are obligatory expenditure, such as the payment of interest or the repayment of loans negotiated earlier and other debts, and expenditure laid down by law or involved in the enhanced cooperation for implementing legislative provisions. Should such expenditure be omitted, it will then be inserted by the authorities responsible for monitoring the 32 Denters B., Klok P.J. (2003), 8 ",
        "201 budgets 33 , which can also decree a corresponding reduction in incidental or non- obligatory expenditure in cases where the amounts allocated do not cover essential expenditure. If the Minister of the Interior takes the view that a provincial budget is not balanced, and will not become balanced in future years, he must explicitly approve that budget: there can be the same requirement when the budget has not been submitted by the agreed deadline or the statement of accounts has been presented late or shows a deficit. The same rules apply to municipal budgets which, as stated above, have to be approved by provincial executives. Approval can be refused only if the budget appears to be contrary to the law or to the general economic interest. This procedure has replaced the general approval of local authorities\u2019 budgets, which was normally given after an a posteriori check carried out by the relevant authorities. The provincial and municipal budgets are binding on their respective executives; hence the expenditure for a specific purpose cannot exceed the amount allocated for the heading in question. Provincial and municipal governments are responsible for the implementation of their budgets, while any expenditure based on a budget which has not been approved requires the authorisation of the aforementioned supervisory bodies, unless an exemption has been provided for (exemptions are possible only up to a certain financial limit). It is possible to authorise urgent expenditure without prior approval of the budget or its modifications, provided that the decision is communicated immediately to the relevant monitoring authority. However, if the budget or modified budget has not been approved, the provincial or municipal councillors who have taken the decision on the urgent expenditure may be called upon to justify it to the relevant local authority: so far, however, this has never happened. 33 Warmelink H. G., 466 ",
        "202 Expenditure by provincial and municipal authorities may derive from their own responsibilities, like the financial activities necessary for carrying out their tasks, but may also derive from obligations imposed on them by higher government authorities: the distinction may be made between different forms of expenditure, e.g. obligatory or non-obligatory, but may also have an influence on revenue. The Financi\u00eble Verhoudingswet lays down that the provinces and the municipalities should receive payments from the funds for provincial and municipal funding, which are a separate heading of the national budget ( Rijksbegroting ), made up of amounts allocated annually for this purpose. In 2002 the funds allocated amounted to more than EUR one billion for the provinces and to EUR 12 billion for the municipalities \u2013 showing that the greater part of the local authorities\u2019 services are entrusted to the municipalities. These funds are distributed by the provinces and municipalities bearing in mind the likely revenue and the differences as regards the necessary expenditure in individual cases: for this reason the law provides certain relevant criteria for the distribution of these amounts. General payments are made towards local public financial departments, which can then use them as they see fit. If a municipal authority\u2019s own revenue reaches an acceptable level, but its public finances do not manage to satisfy the basic needs of its community, it is possible to authorise and guarantee additional funding, but normally with further conditions placed upon the authorities concerned, such as wide-ranging precautionary monitoring by the Ministry of the Interior \u2013 the body which administers the municipal finances fund. Combined with the precautionary monitoring by the relevant municipal councillors \u2013 laid down in the Law on Municipalities \u2013 the general conditions for the granting of additional subsidies can considerably restrict the autonomy of the municipal authority: this helps to explain ",
        "203 why the number of municipalities requesting additional funding has fallen from 20 to 5 in the last 10 years 34 . From local funds, payments can be made on a temporary basis also to the public finances of provinces and municipalities. In addition, it is possible to cover specific provincial or municipal costs, normally in relation to agreements drawn up by higher administrative levels but which have to be implemented by the provincial and municipal levels, which consequently have rather limited decision-making powers in the use of these resources. Moreover, the provinces and municipalities have limited own resources, divided between those derived from taxes and duties and those derived from other forms of taxation. Apart from the taxes listed by the Law on the Provinces and the Law on the Municipalities, local authorities cannot impose any others at local level, unless other laws specifically provide for this. The provincial and municipal councils, which are also responsible for the local budget, decide through an ordinance and within the deadlines laid down by the law what is to be taxed and the nature and rates of the tax. In 2002, 37% of the revenue of municipal authorities was derived from payments made from state funds (the proportion of the total funding of local authorities has been rising constantly since 1986), 46% from other forms of payment, and the remaining 17% from local taxes 35 . For the provincial level the distribution of the various types of funding is 35% from provincial funds, 38% from specific payments and 27% from local taxes. In this case, too, both the payments derived from funds allocated to the provinces and the specific payments have gradually increased in the last few years. 34 Warmelink H.G., 467, note 14 35 Warmelink H.G., 467 ",
        "204 The provinces and municipalities transmit their decisions on the securing or granting of loans and on the guarantees provided for them to the supervising minister and the provincial councillors respectively; their approval is no longer an obligatory condition, so that the local authorities have become gradually more autonomous in this sector also. However, some examples of financial failure of local authorities (such as the province of Zuid-Holland, dragged into an administrative crisis in 1999 by the bankruptcy of the private company Meteco, to which the provincial authority had granted a substantial loan, or the city of Rotterdam, whose financial management by former mayors and councillors was strongly criticised recently) have shown how such freedom may have been granted without the necessary guarantees: consequently, amendments to the Law on the Municipalities have been proposed in order to introduce various measures to improve the quality of monitoring of local finances, for example by setting up auditing offices at local level. One characteristic of the Netherlands\u2019 local government system is the presence of a municipal bank, run by a board appointed by the central and municipal governments, with the task of providing funds on competitive terms to support the initiatives of the local government through municipal finance funds. This confers great stability on the funding of local projects, since the finance fund increases or decreases by the same percentage as the municipal budgets. 3.4 Public-private cooperation instruments. The intermediary role of the unions In the context of the general cooperation between public and private sectors, it is worth giving special mention to quangos, which are private entrepreneurial bodies providing public services on the basis of contracts concluded with the responsible ",
        "205 public authorities 36 . Among the various categories of qangos, the best known in the Netherlands is that of former public enterprises which have now been privatised, such as the post-office bank, the telephone company or the state mines. More popular are the \u201csemi-privatisations\u201d (or true quangos, according to some), which Dutch politicians describe as having been \u201cautonomised\u201d rather than really privatised; this has led to the rapid creation of agencies ( agentschappen ) and independent administrative authorities ( Zelfstandige bestuursorganen, Zbo) . From 1994 onwards the central administrations transferred more and more tasks to private agencies: however, although the contracts lay down the operational relations between the Dutch agencies and the public departments concerned, ministerial responsibility for the sector is maintained, and constitutionally the agency remains part of the department. It is a different matter for the independent administrative authorities, which enjoy much greater autonomy and for which ministerial responsibility is much more limited. Examples are the work distribution service, the public universities, childcare centres, chambers of commerce, art councils, companies providing student loans, and bodies which analyse food and agricultural products. Although the Zbo were being set up throughout the 20 th century, many of them were formed in the 1980s. In 1995 the Dutch Court of Auditors published research on the Zbo which showed that they had a low level of responsibility in relation to the services provided. This gave rise to a wide-ranging debate, leading to pressure for a return to administrative management led by elected politicians rather than bodies independent of the public administration. Subsequent rules therefore laid down clear conditions for setting up a new quango in a specific sector and the type of responsibility it should have. 36 The United Kingdom Parliament, Select Committee on Public Administration Memoranda, Memorandum 43 ",

The agreement provides for more efficient use of the Structural Funds, concentrating assistance even more on specific geographical areas and political- economic aspects. The sector was granted an overall budget for the period of EUR 195 billion: of this, EUR 3,286 million have been allocated to the Netherlands (as against EUR 2,654 million in 1994/1999, representing an annual increase of 6%). Priority objectives The overall budget available for projects covered by the four Structural Funds 38 is divided into three priority objectives. Objective 1: regions most lagging behind in development This promotes the structural development and improvement of less developed regions, and only regions whose GDP is less than 75% of the European average can make use of it. In the Netherlands the Province of Flevoland (277,000 inhabitants) lost on 1 January 2000 the status of Objective 1 region which it had from 1994-1999, 37 The following data are based on a report by the European Union dated December 2002 and available at the following address: http://europa.eu.int/comm/regional_policy/country/overmap/nl/nld_en.htm. 38 The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) ",
        "207 because its GDP had risen above the threshold laid down. However, the region will be entitled to transitional aid of EUR 123 million up to 2005 (equivalent to EUR 126 million at current prices). In 1994 to 1999 the Netherlands obtained a total of EUR 163 million in Objective 1 aid. Objective 2: regions facing structural difficulties Objective 2 (which replaces objectives 2 and 5(b) for the 1994-1999 period) supports economic and social restructuring of areas which encounter structural problems. In 2000-2006 four types of areas with such problems were identified: industrial, rural, urban and areas dependent on fishing activities. On 1 June 1999 the European Commission laid down for each state the maximum population for a region eligible for Objective 2 funds: for the Netherlands the limit was set at 2.333 million inhabitants, equivalent to 15% of its total population. This is the only criterion for the allocation of Objective 2 resources among the Member States: in other words, every inhabitant of an area eligible for this type of subsidy will account for per capita funding of EUR 41.4 (1999 prices). The Netherlands received EUR 795 million in this context, sub-divided into EUR 676 million for Objective 2 areas and EUR 119 million for transitionally assisted areas (these areas were eligible for Objective 2 and 5 (b) funds in 1994-1999, but are not eligible for the new Objective 2). Objective 3: education, training and employment This supports the adaptation and modernisation of education, training and employment policies, combining the old Objectives 3 and 4, and is closely linked with the new title on employment in the EC Treaty as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Objective 3 does not operate through classification of areas, so the aid ",
        "208 can be used for financing projects throughout the whole Community except in regions coming under Objective 1. In 2000-2006 the funding under Objective 3 allocated to the Netherlands comes to EUR 1,686 million, as against EUR 1,176 million in 1994-1999. Fisheries The Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) funds measures concerning common fisheries policies. In Objective 1 regions, funds allocated through the FIFG are linked to the other subsidies granted for funding regional development projects. For the 2000-2006 period the Netherlands receive EUR 31 million for this sector. Community initiatives On the basis of the three priority objectives, the Structural Funds also provide funding in the new period, through four different community initiatives, whose overall budget for the Netherlands in 2000-2006 amounts to EUR 651 million: Interreg: promotes cross-frontier, trans-national and inter-regional cooperation, with the aim of stimulating balanced development and territorial planning in a European context (EUR 349 million); Urban: funds the economic and social recovery of cities with serious structural problems, to promote sustainable urban development (EUR 196 million); Leader: supports rural development (EUR 78 million); Equal: finances trans-national cooperation to promote new practices guaranteeing full equality of opportunity in access to the labour market (EUR 28 million). ",
        "209 Agricultural development policy Finally, although strictly speaking it is not structural assistance, the Netherlands receive some funding for agricultural development from the guidance section of the EAGGF. Since the Berlin agreement of March 1999 identified agricultural development as a key element of the common agricultural policy (CAP), the guidance section of the EAGGF will in future support four measures to be carried out within the Community, together with another six applicable to regions which do not qualify for Objective 1 funding. With this approach, assistance to agricultural development is not linked to specific regions. The annual budget for agricultural development allocated to the Netherlands is EUR 55 million, equivalent to 1.3% of the Community funding available for this sector. IV. LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES 4.1 Management of public services. The regional and local dimension of public services The gradual process of decentralisation has also involved the management of public services, in which the provinces and municipalities play an increasingly important role, with a considerable degree of autonomy compared to the past. Apart from specific measures in the various areas of their responsibility, the provinces have the possibility to coordinate cooperation projects between local authorities at various levels, going beyond the specific municipal context, and in some cases (e.g. in town and country planning or management of municipal finances) also carrying out monitoring tasks on the work of individual local authorities involved in such projects: ",
        "210 this, however, is a power which the provinces exercise only rarely, in comparison with the reciprocal consultation and cooperation with the municipalities which takes place much more frequently. The action of public administration on the territory concerned is sub-divided into five main sectors: social policies, employment, vocational training, environmental protection, transport and mobility. In each of these sectors the provinces and municipalities have precise roles and tasks, details of which are set out below for each sector. Social policies Measures in this sector are intended to benefit specific groups of citizens and individuals (workers with little vocational training, the long-term unemployed, immigrants), who are helped through wage supplements, publicly subsidised jobs and job opportunities created in the public sector. In addition to these collective programmes, there are measures to rehabilitate individuals who are unable to work and to remove barriers preventing the disabled from participating in the labour market. Finally, there is a system of social policies made up of minimum social security contributions (obligatory and private health insurance schemes), unemployment benefits (to which are added measures for reinsertion into the labour market), insurance for those unable to work, basic pension insurance schemes and family benefits. The provinces take action in various ways: managing social care at regional level, caring for the mentally handicapped, administering old people\u2019s homes and assisting young people and youth employment. The municipalities play a more complex role, including the detailed management of social policies, the administration of social services, and social care tasks in the context of state regulation of the sector; they also ",
        "211 manage health care services and assistance to the disabled, assistance to older people, children and young people, and social housing. Employment Although the Dutch economy has shown an essentially positive trend in recent years, certain problems remain: hidden unemployment, which is not visible from the official sectoral statistics, and long-term unemployment, which applies to about half of the unemployed. Given that most of the unemployed do not have sufficient education or training, public action in this field must necessarily provide for integrated cross- sectoral measures in which the local authorities play a very important role. In this field the provinces perform the function of employment agencies, which put employers in touch with workers in the territory they cover, while the municipalities allocate unemployment benefits and develop programmes to create jobs locally. In addition, the municipal administrations develop their own integration programmes for people receiving unemployment benefit. Vocational training The Dutch educational system combines a national organisation regulated by state rules with a decentralised administration of educational establishments: for this reason local authorities are called upon to perform very complex functions. First and foremost, the provinces act as centres for vocational training at regional level; in addition, they provide services for adult education at basic and higher levels and apprenticeship services, manage the local coordination of training carried out outside official educational structures, look after vocational training programmes for young people and adults, and perform a consultative function on the coordination of the current work of reorganising vocational training. The municipalities have a general ",
        "212 responsibility at local level for vocational training and publicly run schools, particularly on the administrative side. Environmental protection Protection of the environment in the Netherlands has undergone radical change as a result of the first national environmental programme (also known as \u201cEcological plan\u201d), started in 1989, whose implementation depends primarily on close cooperation between the central administration and the local authorities for the areas of their responsibility; the task of providing many services in this sector is delegated to them. There is also the fact that, because of the relatively small size and the nature of their territory, and their sensitivity to pollution at regional and global levels, the Netherlands take a very active part in international cooperation on environmental protection. The provinces operate primarily as bodies called upon to implement at regional level the environmental policy measures adopted nationally, although from the 1990s onwards they have gradually taken on a role which is not only executive but also initiatory, firstly through the programme which each regional authority issues annually, laying down the guidelines for inter-regional cooperation programmes in the environmental field. Among the responsibilities directly conferred on the provinces are those for action against the spread of acid rain and polluting substances, combating the reduction in water resources, waste collection measures and energy-saving programmes. Moreover, the provinces guide regional and urban planning in the environmental sphere, soil protection and improvement measures and supervision of water resources, monitor the work of the municipalities in the aspects of the sector which they cover, and provide the necessary authorisations for large industrial establishments, taking account of their environmental impact. Within the areas of their responsibility, the municipalities perform essentially the same functions as the provinces and according to the same priorities; in addition they have the tasks of urban and land-use planning, management of waste collection services, monitoring ",
        "213 of water resources at local level, management of recycling programmes, and preventing or punishing actions which damage the environment. Transport and mobility The essence of Dutch transport policy lies in the interdependence of regional development, economic policies, planning and regional mobility. Improving mobility (not only on roads, but also by rail and sea) is one of the conditions which the government is trying to establish in order to attract international investment to the country. The provinces manage regional traffic, public transport, regional planning, and the construction and maintenance of provincial roads. The municipalities are responsible for the construction and maintenance of local roads, public transport at municipal level and urban planning. 4.1.1 The impact of privatisation We have seen how, within the general system of devolution, the provinces are called upon to act as training centres at regional level: the recent reorganisation of these centres into learning structures in a wider sense also involves considerable participation by private bodies, which thus cooperate with public administrations in providing this service. Going beyond the new set of rules for local government 39 , at all events, the debate on the subject has certainly not been exhausted, but has rather encouraged a very wide range of studies on ways of organising the sector in the near future. Starting from the principle that the national government should \u201chold the rudder rather than row\u201d 40 , 39 See point I.1. above. 40 Osborne D., Gaebler T. (1992), 25-48 ",
        "214 there are many who agree on leaving it to the central administration to define which goods and services correspond to the needs of citizens, while the local authorities, especially the municipal authorities, would be called upon to \u201crow\u201d, operating with integrated strategies and through an organisational structure streamlined to facilitate their operation, and encouraging the use of prioritisation and contracting-out for the provision of the services for which they are responsible 41 . Three alternative models of organisation of the functions performed by local authorities have been developed in this context; they are applied in various cases and sectors of local administration. The municipalities transfer the production and provision of services to non-profit organisations. One variant of this model involves the municipalities directly in setting up the new non-profit organisation very close to local government to manage the services in question. This structure is applied in areas such as cultural policy, sporting and educational establishments, and involves the granting of subsidies as the main instrument for guiding the work of the municipal institutions. Many goods and services are negotiated with private entrepreneurs or through production organisations, involving the joint participation of several local authorities. This strategy has proved to be effective for the production of goods and services which can easily be provided also by private companies, as in the case of waste collection, maintenance of streets and parks, etc. In some cases the municipalities have also replaced former public agencies with new private enterprises, of which they manage part of the assets or in which they are represented in the board of management, giving rise to a sort of partial \u201cmunicipalisation\u201d. The municipalities are introducing a form of contract management to run local administrative agencies. 41 See section IV, below. ",
        "215 It is the first two models which have been applied most often, but in the last two decades the Dutch municipal authorities have made increasing use of various forms of production and provision of goods and services. In many cases the transfer of functions and powers to the private sector, the non-profit sector or public organisations is accompanied by \u201ccontracts\u201d specifying the nature of the services to be provided, and a system for assessing the quality of those services and for monitoring continuing compliance with the conditions laid down in the contract. The use of performance-based management is thus not only an instrument for creating new relationships between central and local government, but is also typical, for example, of relations between local politicians and administrative agencies and between local government and non-profit organisations to which funds are allocated. Many municipal authorities have also attempted to use group analyses and consumer surveys to gain a better idea of the preferences of the users of the services provided, while some municipalities are experimenting with \u201ccitizen\u2019s rights cards\u201d for the services under their control, with the aim of strengthening the position of users of public services provided at local level. The possibility of negotiating with private legal persons for the supply of certain services (through the contracting-out instrument) reflects the widely held belief in the Netherlands that it can be desirable to manage the provision of public services according to entrepreneurial criteria: the choice is left to the relevant individual institutional authorities, while higher levels of government confine themselves to establishing the tasks to be carried out and the levels of service to be guaranteed. This managerial autonomy is another aspect of decentralisation: alongside the decentralised administration of services entrusted to the municipalities, it creates the possibility of managerial decentralisation within the municipality itself. This implies reducing the role played by the political leadership: once the objectives and political strategies have been determined, those responsible (the managers) deal with the ",
        "216 practical management of the service. Under these conditions, the private sector can be involved in the supply of a service on the basis of a proper contract negotiated within the relevant local authority. There are many cases of a managerial approach to public services in Dutch local government: in the city of Tilburg, for example, the elected politicians retain responsibility for the political direction to be followed, but once the political choices have been made the service managers have considerable operational freedom in implementing them, with the aim of maximum efficiency. This negotiated management represents a shift from a hierarchical form of organisation to one based on an operational network, from a bureaucratic structure to one based on profit centres, with managerial decentralisation and the possibility of requiring accountability on the part of service managers, and of ensuring some return for the administration. The Tilburg system seeks to ensure that profit centres are also open to competition from private legal persons, which can include both the voluntary (non- profit) sector and private companies, with the municipal council committed only to negotiating with those concerned for the supply of services on the basis of agreed objectives and entrepreneurial plans. On the other hand, it should also be pointed out that not all municipalities have chosen the same strategy as Tilburg. From 1984 to 1988, for example, the city of Delft adopted the same tactic as Tilburg on the provision of public services, but regularly monitored users\u2019 assessments of the quality of services received and then used these data to improve their quality. The city of Capelle aan den Ijssel followed a similar path, decentralising certain functions to restructured service departments. ",
        "217 V. THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON REGIONAL AND LOCAL DEMOCRACY 5.1 Computerisation of public administration (projects, experience and results) The Netherlands are undoubtedly among the European states with the most widespread use of ICT: while in 1995 19% of the Dutch population declared an interest in information technology, five years later there were 35 PCs for every 100 inhabitants (17 in the commercial sector and 18 in private dwellings), while more than 6 million citizens \u2013 equivalent to 39 per 100 as against 23 in the United Kingdom and 20 in Germany \u2013 regularly made use of the internet 42 . The 2002 data confirm this trend: with 65.5% of private dwellings connected to the internet (as against the European average of 40.4%) and 3% of users having a broadband connection (European Community average 1%), the Netherlands are leading in the spread of ICT for private use. In the entrepreneurial sector, too, the use of ICT is now an established reality: 79% of Dutch firms have access to the internet (as against a European average of 68%, but well below that of the Scandinavian countries, which with a figure of more than 89% clearly lead this specific category). Thus the Netherlands have a leading position also in on-line business 43 . It is also becoming possible to perceive the impact which this wide dissemination of the new media can have on political initiatives, above all at local level. For the Dutch authorities eGovernment constitutes a very high priority among projects for the near future, and arouses enormous interest also for local government: the projects, 42 Padovani C., Nesti, G., (2003), 217-218. 43 Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (2003), 44-46, 58-59 ",
        "218 coordinated and drawn up at central level, are received with enthusiasm also by provincial and municipal authorities. One example of this is the city of Alphen aan den Rijn, whose municipal offices are completely computerised and provide 24-hour on-line services 44 . 5.2 Procedures and safeguards for electronic voting. The role of electronic discussion forums. The rise of local television networks Technologically very advanced, the Netherlands have long devoted much attention to the procedural and practical aspects of electronic voting, with many studies on the subject which have identified certain basic principles on the matter 45 , such as ensuring that the result of voting is correct (i.e. that only electors entitled to vote do so, and only once, and that all the votes cast are counted only once), that the ballot is secret, so that no-one is able to link the vote with the elector who cast it (to avert the risk of a vote being imposed on someone via a third party), and that no elector can prove how he has voted (to avoid the risk of buying and selling of votes), and that the results can be verified by those concerned. At present the Dutch authorities are studying various ways of casting electronic votes, both in polling stations (using special voting machines or programmed PCs), and through the so-called \u201cdistance vote\u201d or \u201cnetwork vote\u201d (via internet or through specific telephone links), which may be trialled in the forthcoming European elections. Reasons mentioned for preferring the use of special machines or PCs for voting in the place of the traditional ballot boxes include efficiency in the polling station, reducing election costs and obtaining the results of voting more rapidly. Among the disadvantages mentioned are the fact that the elector cannot check 44 See the websites www.alphenaandenrijn.nl and www.alphen.com 45 Pieters (2003) ",
        "219 whether his or her vote has been registered correctly and the fact that results are not verifiable without knowing the software and hardware used in the specific case. Use of the PC in itself has advantages and disadvantages: the former include ease of use, the option of holding the vote in several stages (e.g. first choosing among the parties, and then among the candidates of the lists elected), no limit on the number of parties and elections, and a modern look. The disadvantages are: the delicate functioning of the computers which can easily cause breakdowns, and the need for considerable technical work to set up telematic polling stations. Although the issue of electronic voting has only recently come to the fore, Dutch legislation on electronic voting already has a fairly complex history, with the approval of the first legislative rules on the matter going back to 1989. In 1997 two provisions were issued first of all: a decree introducing the two-stage vote (the first to choose a party, the second to choose a candidate) and the option of using the same procedure for two types of vote at the same time when necessary (e.g. parliamentary election and referendum, or provincial and municipal elections); and rules on the conditions for the vote to be valid, intended to liberalise the market for suppliers of the technology needed for electronic voting. However, on 22 July 1997 the TNO Centre (the Dutch organisation for applied scientific research) was set up to assess instrumental and security technology; this essentially re-confirmed the central role of the state in providing technological licences for electoral equipment. However, the government still had the option of drawing on other companies, thus encouraging competition in the sector. On 3 June 1998 the electoral council proposed setting up a sub-committee for computerising the elections, and on 28 May 1999 a report on computerisation of voting drawn up by an expert group in cooperation with the electoral council proposed that legal questions relating to the calculation of votes be examined; on 1 September 1999 the report on the development of the rules on ",
        "220 electoral procedures drawn up by the Ministry of the Interior fully adopted the report drawn up by the electoral council's sub-committee. In 2000 the Ministry of the Interior launched an electronic voting project which investigates the possibility of freeing voting procedures from rigid geographical areas and giving citizens more opportunity to express their electoral preferences, in accordance with the objective of using digital technology to make the public sector more efficient and practical for users. The electronic vote is not new to the Netherlands: since 1974 traditional equipment for voting has gradually been replaced by electronic equipment, and, in the last political elections of May 2002, 95% of Dutch municipalities were equipped with electronic instruments for voting, while in some polling stations it was also possible to vote by computer. The electronic voting project was to carry out two experiments in the European elections of June 2004, intended to ascertain the practicability of postal voting 46 , computer voting or telephone voting for Dutch citizens resident abroad, and of voting in any of the polling stations in their municipality for those resident in the Netherlands, with the aim of making the act of voting independent of a specific geographical area. Before electronic voting is introduced, however, it will be necessary to introduce an electronic identity card as part of a wider system consisting of an electronic signature and the possibility of using biometric personal data (Dutch Ministry of the Interior, 2003). In addition, studies are being made of systems for cooperation between the ICT networks of state and local authorities, such as Back- 46 The 20,000 Dutch citizens currently resident abroad who can already vote by post constitute an ideal group for testing distance voting and electronic voting projects, although it is admitted that postal voting cannot give the elector as much freedom of choice as voting in an electoral booth. However, it is expected that the introduction of distance voting and electronic voting could encourage more participation by electors resident abroad than would occur with postal voting. ",
        "221 office , which could prove to be particularly useful for identifying citizens in the context of eGovernment 47 . Thanks to the widespread ownership of ICT equipment among the general public, there seems to be a growing interest in the use of local networks, especially for electronic communication, but for the moment there are no significant data on this. 5.3 Information technology and changing public services Because of the high level of dissemination of ICT in the public sector and among private individuals 48 , most Dutch public offices also provide for ICT access to their services. Among the most innovative examples of ICT applications to public services is Back- office 49 : this is above all an operational methodology, regarded as the backbone of eGovernment , and made up of a network of organisations whose objectives do not necessarily coincide and whose interests may even clash. One application of this methodology was started some time ago by the Dutch public administration in large- scale sectors (such as building, social security and employment), linking organisations which tend to be independent of one another, and each of which tends to collect data independently on citizens and enterprises for sectors which concern it, with all the attendant problems of duplication and inconsistency of the filed information. On the other hand, it is assumed that a transaction carried out through eGovernment could be more efficient and reliable if the data used by the organisations involved are as uniform as possible: thus an effort is being made, 47 See point IV.1.c. 48 See section V. 49 Homburg V., Bekkers V. ",
        "222 following the \"principle of authentic registration\", to collect the data for a public transaction as close as possible to their source \u2013 something which ought to make them easier to obtain and more reliable; they would then be communicated to the other public institutions which may need them, thus making more uniform the file held on a citizen or a firm by the various branches of the public administration. Practical applications of this operating method already exist, such as the municipal register of information on residence, the lists of licence holders or motor vehicle registrations, the data on polluting emissions or those on citizens' tax status: when someone asks the public administration for an authorization or a permit, his past record is checked by comparing the data on him held by various organisations. When a request is made for unemployment benefit, for example, checks will be made on the data relating to the requester's address, the labour agency responsible for issuing the authorisation, the institutions responsible for implementing employment programmes to verify his employment record, etc. ",

        "227 PORTUGAL INTRODUCTION The asymmetric nature of Portuguese regionalism is due to the fact that there are two island regions (the archipelago of the Azores and the island of Madeira) with statutory and legislative autonomy conferred on them by the constitution, and a constitutional model of regionalism for the mainland (administrative regions) which has never been implemented in practice. After the 1998 consultative referendum rejected the setting-up of administrative regions, the process of regionalising the mainland came to an abrupt halt: the reform process of the past three years has therefore focused on regional planning bodies and the way local authorities are organised. The reform project has sought, in particular, to revamp the bodies dealing with regional economic development: in 2003, the former regional coordinating commissions were converted into what are now Regional Coordination and Development Commissions (Comiss\u00f5es de Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenvolvimento Regional - CCDR) . The purpose of the reform was to make the CCDR representative of the relevant local and regional authorities; in practice, however, they appear still to be very much under the authority of central government. As regards local authorities (municipalities and parishes), the laws on local-authority bodies have been substantially amended in the last three years and a radical reform of the metropolitan areas has been approved. ",
        "228 Dialogue and relations between local authorities and central government appear to be increasingly badly affected by the recent cuts in budgetary funding for local authorities. The prospect of mainland Portugal being regionalised does not seem at present to be tied to any emerging political movement focusing exclusively on a regionalisation programme. There is a clear division between the north and the south of the country when it comes to the dissemination of the culture of regionalism on the mainland: the industrial north appears to be much closer and more open to the concept of regional bodies whereas the south is still attached to the centralist model. Economic development in Portugal continues to be closely bound up with Community cohesion policy: the Structural Funds play a decisive role in the development of infrastructure and in environmental protection. This is confirmed by the European Commission\u2019s recent adoption of an Accessibility and Transport Operational Programme as part of the Community Support Framework for Portugal for the 2000-2006 period, which provides for investment to the tune of EUR 3,366.8 million. As regards domestic economic policy strands, the privatisation process launched during the second half of the 1990s spawned large numbers of regulatory bodies operating in liberalised economic sectors, some of which have close links with central government. Significant legislative constraints also continue to be imposed on the participation of private enterprise in local public service management. The radical transformation of Portuguese society began in the 1960s, but statistics and social studies reveal a country which is still attached to traditions although it is also constantly developing. In particular, the current trend towards a labour market which includes an increasing number of highly specialised women, the diminishing ",
        "229 influence of Roman Catholic culture on life choices and the ongoing dialogue between Catholicism and other growing religious cultures (other Christian denominations and animist religions) are stimulating Portuguese society to adopt the same models and standards as other European countries. The constantly developing society is reliant on public services which have substantial shortcomings (particularly in the health sector) largely due to the fact that they are considerably less computerised than elsewhere in Europe. The launch of the process of computerising the public administration planned in 2003 by the government-sponsored Innovation and Knowledge Mission Unit (UMIC), could be decisive in this regard: in this project, improving the quality of public services is part of a wider initiative to modernise the public administration at both central and local level. The project and the management of eGovernment initiatives by UMIC appear to be highly centralised, but while the initiative and the project have, without a doubt, been promoted and designed by the government, one of the main elements of the eGovernment action plan is the computerisation of local administrations in order to ensure more effective decentralised management of public services, in accordance with the principles of decentralisation and subsidiarity, which are also pillars of the constitutional organisation of regional and local authorities. ",
        "230 I. THE EVOLUTION OF FEDERAL/REGIONAL DYNAMICS. THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 1.1 Organisation of the State in the last thirty years. Historical profile Twentieth-century Portuguese constitutional history is characterised by a succession of liberal-democratic parliamentary systems and military coups resulting in a long authoritarian regime, and a return to democracy with the period of the revolution. The First Portuguese Republic (1910-1926) came to an end in 1926 with a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat which established an authoritarian, corporatist regime led by Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, who became prime minister in 1932. The totalitarian system of what was termed the New State (Estado Novo) came to an end with the 1974 revolution, triggered by the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 25 April 1974 organised by the Armed Forces Movement (FMA). In April 1975, the six largest parties represented in the MFA signed a constitutional pact which provided for the election of a Constituent Assembly. The Assembly was elected on 25 April 1975 and the moderate political groupings in the MFA gained a considerable advantage: in November 1975 an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat by the most radical military forces was crushed and those elements of the MFA\u2019s leadership were removed. In February 1976, the constitutional pact between the MFA and the political parties was renegotiated. The pact provided for the institutionalisation of the revolutionary council which, as guardian of the \u201cspirit\u201d of the revolution, was responsible for supervising the military forces and monitoring the constitutional nature of the law (through its constitutional committee). ",
        "231 The Portuguese constitution was promulgated on 2 April 1976, with the stipulation that it could not be revised during the first five years. In April 1976, the elections for the national parliament (Assembly of the Republic) were held, in which the moderate political groupings dominated, and on 27 June 1976, General Antonio Ramalho Eanes was elected the first President of the Republic 1 . The framework defined by the 1976 constitution (CRP) has produced a dual presidential-parliamentary system, in which the central position of the parliamentary institutions is flanked by the government's dual accountability to the single-chamber parliament (the Assembly of the Republic) and to the President of the Republic, who is directly elected by the people (Articles 190-191 of the CRP). The prime minister is the effective head of government; in relations between the executive and the president, the prime minister therefore has decision-making autonomy. The interdependence between the government and the parliament rests on the request for a vote of confidence which the government may make for approval of its general programme (Article 192 of the CRP) and matters of general policy (Article 193 of the CRP), and on the motions of censure which can be tabled by the members of parliament or parliamentary groups (Article 194 of the CRP) 2 . The original 1976 constitution reflected the political and ideological principles of the revolution and therefore laid down the objective of ensuring the transition to socialism, nationalising the means of production and participation of the Armed Forces Movement in the country\u2019s political life through the revolutionary council. 1 Cf. Maxwell, K.R. - Monje, S.C. (edited by), 1991 2 Gomes Canotilho, J.J. (2002), 591 et seq. ",
        "232 This text was refined with the 1982 revision, which abolished the revolutionary council and set up the constitutional court as the guardian of the constitution. The constitutional court is made up of 13 judges, ten of whom are appointed by the parliament. Six of those members appointed or co-opted have to be selected from among the judges of the other courts; the remainder have to be jurists. Their term of office lasts for nine years and is not renewable (Article 222 of the CRP). The court monitors the constitutionality of the provisions of state and regional legislative acts and the constitutionality and legitimacy of national referendums, verifies the physical incapacity of the Head of State, and rules on election-related disputes, including those relating to local elections. The court is also responsible for directing the dissolution of political parties which pursue ends associated with fascist ideals. The next revision, carried out in 1989, removed the \"revolutionary\" provisions regarding the organisation of economic relations 3 ; the 1992 and 1997 revisions, carried out when Portugal signed the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam, introduced the right for foreign citizens to vote, the right of legislative initiative for citizens, and exclusive legislative powers for the parliament. The most recent revision, carried out in 2001, relating to the extradition system, became necessary when Portugal signed the Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court. As regards the link between the Portuguese institutions and European integration, it should be pointed out that the first constitutional government submitted a formal request to join the European Economic Community in 1977. Public opinion was largely in favour of joining the EEC and all the political parties, with the exception of the Communist Party, were also supportive. From 1985, the year when it officially 3 This issue is expanded further in point 3.1 below. ",
        "233 acquired the status of EEC member, Portugal recorded solid economic growth, which was largely dependent on Community assistance. This growth was also facilitated by the stability of the national political scene: from 1987 onwards, Portugal benefited from a series of stable parliamentary majorities which ensured that governments lasted their full term. Indeed, although the Community cannot be seen to be entirely responsible for the democratisation of the country, European integration indisputably played a key role in its economic development, as well as influencing the political system and Portuguese culture 4 . 1.1.1 The evolution of regionalisation/federalisation procedures and decentralisation processes. The most recent institutional developments During the period of totalitarian rule, the structure of local and regional authorities (parishes and municipalities within districts) remained unaltered within a system of authoritarian government. Under the new 1936 Administrative Code, the districts were reorganised into a new provincial structure and two new provinces were set up in the island regions (the Archipelago of the Azores and Madeira). In this period, the self-government powers of the parishes and municipalities were greatly reduced because of the lack of funding allocated to them; practically no policies were formulated at local level as local authorities were mere executors of decisions taken by central government 5 . With the transition to democracy, the regions became a key issue in two respects: on the one hand, regionalisation met the need to scale down the central bureaucracy of the totalitarian era and, on the other, it appeared essential in order to reduce the 4 See Barreto, A. (1999), 116. 5 See Opello, W.C. (1993), 163. ",
        "234 considerable economic and social divide between the Atlantic coast area, which included the densely populated cities of Lisbon and Oporto, and the inland rural areas and island regions where development was limited and slow. The fundamental principles underpinning the 1976 constitution include the principle of the unitary state (Article 6(1)), under which the territory is an indivisible republic with a single constitution and, therefore, sovereign bodies which are the same for the whole country. As such, however, the nature of the Portuguese republic is fully compatible with the recognition of regional self-government and territorial devolution. Devolution is achieved through the recognition of autonomous regions (the Archipelago of the Azores and the island of Madeira) and local authorities (municipalities and parishes) and through the planned administrative regions. The constitution identifies two distinct forms of regional organisation: the autonomous regions \u2013 the islands \u2013 (Articles 225-234 of the CRP) and the administrative regions in mainland Portugal, which are governed by the provisions laid down in the section on local authorities (Section VIII \u2013 Local Authorities). Giving the island regions political autonomy does not affect the unitary nature and integrity of the sovereign power of the state (Article 225(3) of the CRP); in any case, regional autonomy appears to have been increased by the 1997 revision of the constitution, which cites the autonomy of the autonomous regions as one of the factors to be respected in any constitutional revision (Article 288(o) of the CRP) 6 . 6 There are differing schools of thought as to how these guarantees should be interpreted vis- \u00e0-vis the unitary nature of the state. In particular, the definition of the Portuguese republic as a regional state or unitary regional state is not accepted by those who emphasise the \"exceptional\" nature of the autonomy of the island regions. On this point, see Gomes Canotilho, J.J. (2002), 358. The term \"partial regional state\" is used by Miranda, J. (1994), 256. ",
        "235 The autonomous regions have the right of initiative as regards revision of their statutes, although these have to be approved by the national parliament, which cannot amend or reject a draft without first obtaining the opinion of the regional assembly (Articles 226(2) and (3) of the CRP). Once that opinion has been received, it is the national parliament (the Assembly of the Republic) which debates and takes a final decision on the text of the statute. The acts approving the statutes of the autonomous regions therefore take the form of an ordinary state law (Article 161(b) of the CRP) 7 . The island regions have legislative autonomy under which their regional assemblies adopt regional legislative decrees : the legislative power of these assemblies is primary or general (Article 227(1)(a) of the CRP), and is authorised or delegated within the bounds set by the national authorising body (Article 227(1)(b) of the CRP); it relates to the implementation of fundamental state laws on matters that are not within the exclusive powers of the Assembly of the Republic (Article 227(1)(c) of the CRP). Only in the 1997 revision does the constitution explicitly list the matters of \u201cspecific interest to the region\u201d in which regional authorities have legislative power (Article 228 of the CRP). This amendment helped to clear up the legal uncertainty which had arisen regarding the concept of \u201cspecific interest to the region\u201d and to eliminate doubts as to whether the lists of matters of regional competence contained in the autonomous regions\u2019 statutes (Article 31 of the statute of the Azores and 7 The political and administrative statute of the Azores was approved by Law 39/1980 of 5 August, as amended by Law 9/1987 of 26 March and, most recently, by Law 61/1998 of 27 August (www.alra.pt); the statute of the Region of Madeira was approved by Law 13/1991 of 5 June as amended by Law 130/1999 of 21 August (www.alrm.pt). As regards the doctrinal doubts which have emerged as to whether this procedure for approving the statute is compatible with real statutory autonomy, see Ar\u00e1gon Reyes, M. and Aguado Renedo, C. (1996), in Miranda, J. (1996), vol. I, 718. The statutes of the autonomous regions describe the region\u2019s form of government, the way the legislative and executive powers are organised, the role of the state representative, the region\u2019s external powers and the economic and financial organisation of the region. The statutes also mention the region\u2019s symbols (its flag, stamps and anthem). ",
        "236 Article 49 of the statute of Madeira) were intended to be exhaustive or merely illustrative. Under the statutary provisions and the new Article 228 of the CRP, the autonomous regions can legislate on nature protection, land use and spatial planning, transport, agricultural, commercial and industrial development, sport, tourism, crafts, the organisation of regional administration and all other issues related to the specific needs arising from their island status 8 . Regional laws must comply with the constitution and are subject to the constraints of international law and cannot encroach on the areas in which the state (the national parliament and the government) has exclusive legislative power (Articles 161, 164, 165 and 198(2) of the CRP); regional laws adopted within the framework of delegated powers have to be compliant with the limits laid down by the state law delegating these powers, just as regional laws supplementing fundamental state laws are subject to the specific constraint of respect for the principles laid down by the state legislator. The regulatory powers of the regions are divided between the regional assembly and the regional government. The assembly adopts provisions implementing the general laws of the republic (by regional regulatory decree \u2013 decreto regulamentar regional ) (Article 227(1)(d) and Article 232(1) of the CRP), while the government is responsible for implementing the region\u2019s legislative acts (by decree or another equivalent provision). The autonomous regions also have administrative autonomy. The constitution grants them executive powers (Article 227(1)(g) of the CRP), thus presupposing a regional executive which, in addition to being the centre of political authority, is also the head of the region's administration (Articles 46 and 60 of the statute of the Azores). 8 Piergigli, V. (1998), 1056. ",
        "237 Form of government in the autonomous regions . The organisation of powers is based on a system of parliamentary government: the regional government is politically accountable to the regional legislative assembly, which passes votes of confidence on the programme or other issues of interest to the region and can propose motions of censure on the execution of the government\u2019s programme or on other important matters (Articles 49-52 of the statute of the Azores). The president of the regional government is appointed by the Minister of the Republic, with due regard for the results obtained by the political groupings in the elections for the regional assembly 9 . The administrative regions. Unlike the autonomous island regions, the administrative regions (Articles 255-262 of the CRP) do not have political autonomy, being conceived as organisational bodies with administrative and financial autonomy responsible for directing public services and coordinating and supporting the activities of municipalities, while respecting municipal autonomy (Article 257 of the CRP). The general law on the establishment of the administrative regions was adopted in 1991 (Law 56 of 13 August 1991), under Article 255 of the CRP. Subsequently, with Law 19 of 1998, parliament subdivided the territory into eight regions (Entre Douro e Minho; Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro; Beira Interior; Beira Litoral; Estremadura e Ribatejo; Alentejo; Algarve; Lisboa e Set\u00fabal) and put the matter to a popular referendum, as required by Article 256 of the CRP 10 . 9 Gomes Canotilho, J.J. (2002), 606 et seq. 10 Article 256 makes the establishment of the administrative regions subject to the adoption of a law of establishment relating to each individual region and to subsequent consultation of the electorate on the effective establishment of the administrative regions and of each regional area. If a majority of voters oppose the establishment of the administrative regions, the votes relating to the establishment of each individual area are disregarded. According to Rebord\u00e3o Montalvo, A. (2003), 87, the complex and intricate nature of the procedure for establishing the administrative regions laid down in the constitution has hindered and slowed down the creation of these new bodies. ",
        "238 The 1998 referendum rejecting the establishment of the administrative regions 11 interrupted the long, intricate process laid down in the constitution for establishing these new bodies in mainland Portugal (Article 256(2) of the CRP). The arrangement which had been planned for the administrative regions follows the twin model that is typical of local government: the regional assembly is the deliberative body and is composed of a combination of directly elected members and a smaller number of members elected by proportional representation by members of the municipal assemblies (Articles 259-60 of the CRP, Articles 3 and 22 of Law 56/1991). The regional board is the executive body, elected by secret ballot by the regional assembly from among its members. The failure to establish the administrative regions is the result of the political parties' ambiguous attitude to regionalisation; while they realise that regions could help to overcome the deficiencies of a centralised state and redress economic and social imbalance, they are also afraid that establishing the regions would provide political openings for opposition parties 12 . There are two tiers of local authority: parishes ( freguesias ) and municipalities ( munic\u00edpios ). Each municipality is made up of a number of parishes. There are 308 municipalities (278 in mainland Portugal and 30 in the autonomous regions) and 4251 parishes (4047 in mainland Portugal and 204 in the islands) 13 . Local authorities are corporate institutions with their own representative bodies (Article 235 of the CRP). The constitution's provisions on local authorities enshrine fundamental principles which cannot be altered even by constitutional revision, as central government bodies depend on the existence and constitutional organisation of these 11 See point 2.2 below. 12 Cf. Opello, W.C. (1993), 166 13 See www.dgaa..pt/DGAL%20INTERNET.html and www.anmp.pt/munp/mun/mun101w4.php?stri=A for these figures. ",
        "239 authorities 14 . The implementation of the constitutional principles relating to local authorities is governed by Decree-Law 161 of 18 September 1999, as amended by Law 5-A of 11 January 2002 which repealed the legislation in force on the organisation of local authorities and regulates local-authority bodies. Each parish has a parish assembly ( assembleia de freguesia ) and a parish board ( junta de freguesia ) (Articles 244-246 of the CRP). The parish assembly is the deliberative body and is elected by direct universal suffrage (secret ballot of all resident citizens, using a system of proportional representation). The number of members of the parish assembly varies according to the number of resident voters 15 . In parishes with fewer than 150 registered voters, a plenary meeting takes the place of the parish assembly, and its decisions are valid only when at least 10% of the voters resident in the parish are present. The parish assembly elects the members of the parish board by secret ballot; the latter is the parish's executive body, and is made up of a chairman and elected members 16 . In parishes with over 150 voters, the chairman of the parish board is the head of the list which receives most votes in the elections for the parish assembly, while in smaller parishes (fewer than 150 voters), the chairman of the parish board is elected by the plenary meeting. Each municipality has a municipal assembly ( assembleia municipal ) and a municipal chamber ( c\u00e2mara municipal ) (Articles 250-252 of the CRP). The municipal assembly is the deliberative organ and is directly elected by the people. Its members also include the chairmen of the parish boards. 14 See Gomes Canotilho, J.J. (2002), 359 15 The number ranges from a maximum of 19 members in parishes with over 20,000 voters to a minimum of seven members in the smallest parishes (with 1,000 voters or less). 16 The members of the parish board are elected by the parish assembly on a proposal from the chairman of the former: the number of members is laid down by law and ranges from a minimum of two members in parishes with over 5,000 voters to a maximum of six members in parishes with 20,000 voters or more. ",
        "240 The municipal chamber is the executive body of the municipality. It is led by a president, who is the head of the list which receives the most votes in the elections for the municipal assembly. The number of other members is laid down by law 17 . Elections for the municipal assembly and municipal chamber take place at the same time. As the administrative regions have not been set up, the administrative tier above the municipality is the district ( distrito ). Legally speaking, these are not local authorities but administrative districts, with a deliberative assembly made up of representatives of the municipalities and an advisory council which assists the Civil Governor. The Civil Governor represents the state and is responsible for monitoring the districts\u2019 proceedings. 1.1.2 Relations between central government and the regional/local levels of government The relationship between the state and regional and local authorities is based on the principle of subsidiarity, which was enshrined in Article 6(1) of the constitution in 1997. Under this principle, the higher or larger tiers of authority take on responsibilities which the lower or smaller tiers are unable to discharge or would discharge less effectively. It also helps to secure democratic decentralisation, ensuring that regional and local authorities are accorded specific competences for governing their communities; this ties in with the objective of avoiding bureaucracy, 17 Lisbon has 16 members, Oporto has nine, municipalities with over 100,000 inhabitants have 10 and municipalities with 10,000 resident voters or less have four. ",
        "241 which underpins community involvement in the management of public services (Article 267(1) of the CRP) 18 . The constitution provides for a relationship of active cooperation and allegiance between state bodies and regional government bodies, which are to help ensure the economic and social development of the autonomous regions with a view to correcting inequalities arising from their island status (Article 229 of the CRP). In the autonomous regions, the state is represented by a Minister of the Republic , appointed by the President of the Republic on a proposal from the government, after consultation of the Council of State and the regional legislative assembly (Article 230 of the CRP; Article 69 of the statute of the Azores). As part of his scrutiny activities, the Minister of the Republic may ask the constitutional court to examine the constitutionality of regional regulations or legislative decrees. If the court rules these to be unconstitutional, the minister issues an implementing ban and refers them back to the body which adopted them so that they can be repealed (Article 72 of the statute of the Azores). Under the constitution, relations between the administrative regions and the state were originally to be conducted via a government representative appointed by the Council of Ministers; since the 1997 reform, the presence of such a representative has been optional. Should the administrative regions be set up, their powers are to be exercised in cooperation with the local and regional authorities already existing in the area (Article 262 of the CRP). Article 258 of the CRP made the administrative regions responsible for coordination between national and regional planning; this role continues to be performed by the Regional Coordinating Commissions (CCR). These are decentralised bodies of the Ministry of Public Works, Planning and Regional 18 Gomes Canotilho, J.J. (2002), 361 ",

Over the years, the CCR have become quite high-profile administrative agencies, although officially they remain decentralised units of the Ministry and are not elected bodies or representative of the public in any other way. There has thus been substantial pressure for their reform, particularly in view of the fact that they are responsible for the coordination of large sums of money coming from the EU Structural Funds 20 . In actual fact, the acceleration of the EU integration process coincided with a general desire to move away from this centralised, convoluted model of regional coordination. This is the background to the procedure which led to the adoption in 1991 of the framework law on the creation of the administrative regions and to the subsequent consultative referendum in 1998 21 . After the \"no\" vote in the 1998 referendum on the establishment of the administrative regions, radical reform of the CCR was relaunched and the 2003 reform law turned them into the present Regional Coordination and Development Commissions ( Comiss\u00f5es de Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenvolvimento Regional \u2013 CCDR). The present five commissions \u2013 the Commission for the North (CCDR Norte) based in Oporto, the Commission for the Centre (CCDR Centro) based in Coimbra, the Commission for Lisbon and the Tagus valley (CCDR LVT) based in Lisbon, the Commission for the Alentejo (CCDR Alentejo) based in Evora and the Commission for the Algarve (CCDR Algarve) based in Faro \u2013 are responsible for the implementation of the regional operational programmes provided for by the Community Support Framework for 19 The Regonal Coordinating Commissions, which were set up in the 1960s, were regulated by Article 1 of Decree-Law 494/1979 of 21 December and reorganised under Decree-Law 224/2001 of 9 August, within the four administrative regions (North; Centre; Lisbon and Tagus Valley; Alentejo and Algarve). In May 2003, Decree-Law 104/2003 was passed, converting the CCR into the present Regional Coordination and Development Commissions (CDDR). 20 See point 3.5 below. 21 See Baum, M. and Freire, A.

The regional council is an internal CCDR body whose members include mayors of municipalities and representatives of parishes in the region concerned. Despite these new mechanisms for ensuring local-authority representation on CCDR executive bodies, the CCDR are still closely tied to the government and the relevant ministry 22 . In giving effect to the constitutional principle of subsidiarity, Law 159 of 1999 laid down procedures for the administrative devolution of responsibilities to the local level. This principle requires that responsibilities be exercised by the tier of government which is in the best position to do so effectively, rationally and in a way which best serves the interests of the citizens (Article 2(2) of Law 159 of 1999). The responsibilities of the municipalities include infrastructure and energy-resource management (transport and communications, energy, town and country planning), health and security (health, civil protection, municipal police services and external cooperation), education and culture (education, leisure facilities, science and culture), economic development and environmental protection (promotion of development, the environment and consumer protection). In practice, the division of administrative responsibilities between the state and the municipalities is tempered by provision for negotiations over the exercise of specific responsibilities. Provision is made for a negotiated transition of a series of responsibilities to the local authorities by 2004: a kind of \"dynamic\" devolution in which, each year, the state budget stipulates the sums to be allocated to local authorities for the exercise of new, additional responsibilities assigned to them. Because of the considerable differences between Portuguese municipalities, the 1999 22 Cf. Decree-Law 104/2003 of 23 May 2003.

        "244 law introduced a system of differentiated devolution whereby the new responsibilities would be assigned to those municipalities which, under special agreements with the state, meet the practical conditions for exercising them. In reality, this devolution has yet to be implemented because endless bureaucracy at the centre is preventing the actual transfer of administrative responsibilities to the local authorities 23 . 1.1.3 Local authority cooperation and associations The smaller authorities (municipalities and parishes) have frequently joined forces as a way of compensating for the inadequate funding they have traditionally received. Indeed, local authority associations are so widespread as to be considered an alternative system to the regions, particularly after the \u2018no\u2019 vote in the 1998 referendum on the establishment of the administrative regions. The local authority associations provided for in the constitution (Article 235 of the CRP) are public authorities governed by their own statutes and with their own funding, and are subject to the same scrutiny as the municipalities. There are also private-law associations such as ANMP (National Association of Portuguese Municipalities) (www.anmp.pt) and ANAFRE (National Association of Parishes) (www.anafre.pt), which protect the interests of their members 24 . 1.1.4 The evolution of the metropolitan government model: the role of the metropolitan cities The constitution permits the establishment of other forms of local government in large urban areas and on the islands (Article 236(3) of the CRP). Under this principle, 23 See Rebord\u00e3o Montalvo, A.(2003), 93 24 As regards forms of cooperation, cf. points 1.1.1 and 1.1.2. ",
        "245 the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Oporto were established in 1991 (Law 41/1991 of 2 August). Metropolitan areas are public authorities which aim to promote the interests of the municipalities within their boundaries; two-thirds of the municipal assemblies representing the majority of the area's population must first vote in favour of their establishment. They have their own funding and financial autonomy, and their goal is optimum management of interests and services throughout the area, particularly public transport and communications, provision of health and environmental protection infrastructure, and civil protection. The metropolitan areas perform their tasks through bodies which, unlike those of other local authorities, are not representative of the people. The metropolitan assembly (the decision-making body) is thus made up of members elected by the municipal assemblies, whereas the metropolitan committee (the executive body) is made up of the chairmen of the municipal executive bodies. The advisory body responsible for coordination between the different tiers of administration in the metropolitan area is the metropolitan council, which is made up of the chairman of the Regional Coordination and Development Commission (CCDR), the members of the metropolitan committee, and representatives of public services and bodies whose activities fall within the remit of the metropolitan area. The metropolitan area of Lisbon (AML) (www.aml.pt) covers 19 municipalities. It is responsible for coordinating investment and services of supra-municipal interest, particularly as regards city and suburban public transport and communications, and for coordinating state and municipal decisions in matters of infrastructure, environmental protection and civil protection. The metropolitan area of Oporto (AMP) (www.amp.pt) is part of the heavily industrialised and densely populated North region. It has the highest proportion of employed residents (31%) in the region, as well as being home to almost half (48.5%) of the region's unemployed. The high level of business transactions conducted in this area is evidence of its key role in ",
        "246 economic development. As a result, the AMP has a key role to play in economic and social cohesion policies to curb social exclusion and urban decline in the area. The metropolitan areas\u2019 legal system has recently been reformed. In May 2003, a law was passed 25 providing for the establishment of two types of metropolitan area: a) large metropolitan areas (GAM), comprising a minimum of nine municipalities and at least 350,000 inhabitants; b) urban communities (ComUrb), comprising a minimum of three municipalities and at least 150,000 inhabitants. The law gives the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Oporto a maximum of one year to adopt the reform. 1.2 The political and social players in the regionalisation/federalisation processes. The role of political parties and of other forms of associations Right from the very first elections in the democratic era (25 April 1976), a fairly stable political framework emerged: the main political groupings (the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) and the Socialist Party (PS) on the left, the Democratic Popular Party (PPD)/Social Democrat Party (PSD) on the right, and the Party of the Social Democratic Centre (CDS)/People's Party (PP) in the centre) together usually account for more than 90% of all votes. A genuinely bipolar system has emerged, dominated by two parties: the PS on the centre-left and the PSD on the centre-right. 25 Law 10/2003 of 13 May, published in the Portuguese official journal, I Series A, No. 110, of 13 May 2003. ",
        "247 This system has been fostered by the presidential-parliamentary form of government, in which parliament and the President of the Republic \u2013 both of them directly elected \u2013 share responsibility for forming and preserving a stable government 26 . Despite proportional representation, the bipolar system has made it difficult for the smaller parties to break through and win seats. In 1999 the Socialist Party, which had won the 1995 elections after 10 years in opposition, failed to achieve an absolute majority in parliament. As a result of this election, the declining situation of the Communist Party was brought under control and a new far-left grouping known as the Left Bloc ( Bloco de Esquerda ) was formed from a coalition of Maoist and old-style communist parties and new citizens' groupings. The emergence of this new force prompted the Socialist Party to move to the left: the libertarian, radical approach of the Left Bloc (whose political programme focused on the problems of immigrants and the poor and issues related to new rights) thus appears to have influenced Portugal\u2019s political agenda 27 . As regards the formation of political associations, a number of pro-regionalist public pressure groups were founded during the 1998 referendum on the establishment of the administrative regions. These groups had relatively little influence on the outcome, however; the \"no\" vote was essentially due to the ambiguous and uncertain stance adopted by the political parties behind the referendum 28 . 26 Costa Lobo, M.( 2001), passim ; see Farelo Lopes, F. and Freire, A., (2002), 43 et seq. on the origins and structure of Portuguese political parties. 27 Costa Lobo, M and Magalh\u00e3es. P. (2001), 14 28 See point .2.2 below. ",
        "248 1.2.1 Regional organisation of political parties and movements All the major parties have regional and local sections. As regards the geographical influence of each individual party, it is well known that the Communist Party, which had well-organised local sections even before the 1974 revolution, has always enjoyed very solid electoral support in the Alentejo because of that region's rural and highly anticlerical social structure. The Socialist Party, on the other hand, had a rather limited organisational structure before the change-over to democracy. After the 1974 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat , the voters in the centre, who were conservative and heavily influenced by the Catholic Church, tended to support the programmes of the Democratic Popular Party (PPD) and the Social Democrat Party (PSD) 29 . 1.2.2 Regional parties Small parties linked to the autonomous status of the island regions (the Partido Democr\u00e1tico do Atl\u00e2ntico \u2013 PDA, the Alian\u00e7a Democr\u00e1tica dos A\u00e7ores \u2013 AD-A, and the Uni\u00e3o Democr\u00e1tica Popular \u2013 UDP, which is a far-left party) stand in local and regional assembly elections in these autonomous regions. However, these parties have achieved little electoral success 30 . 1.3 The importance of cooperation and social dialogue In the new period of democracy after 1974, consultation mechanisms were set up in many public institutions, such as schools, universities and hospitals, to give the public and users a greater say. Despite the general climate of openness, genuine civil and political participation was not achieved. There was virtually no local authority or 29 Maxwell, K. (1995), 71 30 For regional election results, see point 2.1 below (tables 2.2 and 2.3). ",
        "249 private-law association involvement in the governing boards of a number of public institutions (e.g. large hospitals), and consumer and user associations were relatively thin on the ground, especially considering the wide range of public services 31 . As regards economic and social cooperation, in which representatives of the state or local authorities get together with representatives of the business world to exchange information, compare forecasts and take joint decisions, the ups and downs of Portuguese political life have certainly not helped a culture of consultation to take root. This practice started to become more firmly established during the second half of the 1990s, following the Socialist Party's victory in the 1995 elections. Generally speaking, the weak position of the Portuguese business sector during the period when democracy was being established set the tone for all subsequent action, and particularly for efforts at social dialogue, which only provided a belated and therefore ineffective response to resolving the problems besetting Portuguese industry 32 . The importance of socio-economic cooperation is, however, now enshrined in the constitution which, since the 1989 revision, includes among the rights of trade unions the right to be represented in social consultation bodies (Article 56(d)), and provides for the setting-up of an Economic and Social Council. This body is governed by Article 92 of the CRP, which defines its membership and role. The ESC\u2019s members include representatives of the government, of trade union organisations and employers\u2019 organisations, of family organisations and of local and regional authorities. The ESC participates in the adoption of major decisions and in economic and social development plans 33 . 31 Cf. Barreto, A.(2002) 32 Paz Ferreira, E. (2001), 340 et seq. 33 The Economic and Social Council was set up by Law 108/91 of 17 August as subsequently amended by Decree-Law 90/92 of 21 May (www.ces.pt). See point 3.4 below for the role of this body and of social consultation in Portuguese economic development. ",
        "250 II. DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AT REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL 2.1 Voting in national and regional/local elections The 1976 Portuguese constitution contains an explicit decision to use a proportional representation system for elections. This system is an essential guarantee of democracy and, as such, cannot be changed by constitutional revision (Article 288(h) of the CRP). For national parliament ( Assembleia da Rep\u00fablica ) elections, the constitution also lays down the formula for converting the number of votes won by the candidates into seats, using the d\u2019Hondt method or method of the highest average (Article 149(1)). For the election of other representative bodies, the constitution lays down the principle of proportional representation and the law defines the particular electoral formula of proportionality to be employed. The members of the national parliament and of local and regional representative bodies thus have to be elected by proportional representation (Article 113(5)). This general principle is explicitly confirmed in relation to the election of the regional legislative assembly (Article 231(2)) and the assemblies of local authorities (muncipalities and parishes) (Article 239(2)). It can therefore be said that, except for the election of the President of the Republic, the principle of proportional representation is firmly enshrined in Portuguese law. Consequently, any laws creating mixed systems or changing constituency boundaries in order to undermine proportionality are constitutionally invalid. The 1997 constitutional revision sought to make the proportional representation system more flexible by introducing single-member and party-list voting systems in order to achieve more personalised votes 34 .

The electoral law for the Assembly of the Republic lays down the detailed rules governing these electoral districts. In each of the 22 multi-member districts, the votes won are converted into seats in the national parliament. Eighteen of these electoral districts are the same as the administrative districts, two are the same as the autonomous island regions (the Azores and Madeira) and the last two are reserved for emigrant voters. Since the 1997 revision, the structure of the electoral system has continued to consolidate the parties\u2019 regional roots and their central role in the selection of candidates. The parties are, for the most part, structured on the basis of regional sections, which broadly correspond with the multi-member electoral districts. This means that the lists of candidates for the national parliament are agreed with the regional party leaders and are under the influence of the party\u2019s central bodies to a greater or lesser degree. The list system also affects the candidates\u2019 relationship with their party and the voters: as the lists are blocked, the voter cannot indicate a preference for a particular candidate. Portuguese voters thus vote for a party rather than a candidate, and whether a candidate is elected depends on the position allocated them in the list by their party. Portugal is divided into large electoral districts: out of the total 22 electoral districts, 59.1% of the members of the national parliament elected in 2002 came from the districts of Lisbon and Oporto (which elect 48 and 35 Article 149 of the CRP stipulates that the members of the Assembly of the Republic are to be elected by electoral districts, the boundaries of which are to be laid down by law, which may also provide for the existence of multi-member and single-member electoral districts as well as their kind and complementarity, in order to secure the system of proportional representation and the d'Hondt highest average method when converting the votes into the number of seats. With the exception of the national electoral district, the number of deputies allocated to each multi-member electoral district is to be proportionate to the number of voters enrolled in the electoral register for that district.

        "252 38 members respectively) and the five medium to large districts (with 11 or more seats). These figures are actually not very different from those recorded in the 1987 elections. This means that the 1989 and 1997 constitutional changes to the national parliament\u2019s electoral system, which reduced the maximum number of members to 230, had little effect on the average size of the electoral districts. Indeed, the average number of seats to be filled in each district has fallen from 11.4 to 10.5. Moreover, the number of seats allocated to each electoral district is proportional to the number of registered voters: from this point of view, there is no danger of unequal representation in the national parliamentary elections and, therefore, a vote has more or less the same value in each electoral district 36 . In the last national elections, votes were strongly polarised around the social-democrat right and the socialist left: the centre (CDS-PP) won slightly more support (8.72%) than the Red-Green alliance (PCP-PEV-CDU) (6.94%). On the far left, the Left Bloc (BE) won 2.74% of the vote, whereas other minor groupings such as the coalition of Portuguese workers (PCTP/MRP), the Partido nacional renovador (PNR), the Movimento O partido da Terra (MPT) and the alliance between the Left Bloc (BE) and the UDP ( Uni\u00e3o Democr\u00e1tica popular ), a far-left party, did not win any seats at all.

However, the constitution does not specify which type of proportional representation system is to be adopted for converting votes into seats, as it does in the case of elections for the national parliament (Article 149(2) of the CRP). The statute of each autonomous region lays down rules governing the demarcation of constituencies and other rules defining the electoral system for regional assembly elections. In the autonomous region of the Azores, each island in the archipelago forms one electoral district; each district elects two deputies, plus one for every 6000 registered voters or for every polling station serving more than 1000 voters (Article 13 of the statute of the Azores) 37 . However, this system has a number of limitations, as it fails to take account of the varying population densities of the different islands of the archipelago. Thus an island such as Corvo, which has 300 voters, elects the same number of deputies (two) as islands with 4000 voters (such as Flores and S\u00e3o Jorge), or even 5000 voters (as is the case of Santa Maria and Graciosa) 38 . The regional statute also lays down rules governing length of term, submission of candidacies, and the criteria for allocating seats. Regional deputies remain in office for four years and are elected on the basis of individual or joint 37 This rule is laid down in the electoral law for the regional assembly of the Azores, approved by Decree-Law 267/80 of 8.8.1980 as most recently amended by Organic Law 2/2001 of 25.8.2001 (www.alra.pt). 38 See Ara\u00fajo, A. and Freire, A.

In each district, votes are converted into seats by means of a proportional system using the d\u2019Hondt method of the highest average. The seats won by each list are allocated to individual candidates on the basis of the order of precedence stipulated in the declaration of candidacy (Article 18 of the statute of the Azores).

The results were slightly different for the autonomous region of Madeira. The winning party in the elections for the regional legislative assembly was the Social Democrat Party, which exceeded the 50% threshold with ease (55.91%), while the Socialist Party won just 21% of the votes; the far left (UDP) achieved a slightly better result (4.79%) than the Red-Green coalition (PCP-PEV) (4.64%).

Each local authority forms a single electoral district; proportional representation and the d\u2019Hondt method of the highest average are used to convert votes into seats. The members of the local authorities' decision-making bodies and the municipal chamber ( c\u00e2mara municipal ) are elected by direct, secret suffrage from competing multi-member lists put forward for each body to be elected. Each voter may only vote for one list. In the last elections for the municipal chambers, the socialists and the social democrats shared almost 60% of the votes: the Socialist Party came first, winning 34% of the votes, followed by the Social Democrat Party, with 28.22%, and the coalition of Communists and Greens (PCV and PEV), with 10.61%.

Calculating turn-out . In order to exercise their right to vote, Portuguese citizens have to have been registered prior to the election in the electoral roll ( Censo Eleitoral ). In each election, the official number of abstentions is calculated by taking the difference between the number of registered voters and the number of those who actually exercised the right to vote. This method of calculating abstentions can lead to an over-estimation, as there may be citizens who, although potentially entitled to vote, 39 Cf. Article 2 of Organic Law 1/2001 of 14 August 2001 (electoral law relating to local authorities): Article 5 lays down similar conditions for the right to stand for election, for which no age restriction is specified (www.cne.pt) 40 The figures for the 2001 elections can be viewed at www.cne.pt ",
        "257 were not registered in the electoral roll prior to the election. The number of registered voters may also be distorted by dual registration errors, e.g. following a change of residence; these kinds of errors, too, can lead to over-estimation of the actual number of people who have abstained. Over and above these \u201ctechnical\u201d problems of calculation, the fact remains that the level of abstentionism in Portugal started to rise in the 1980s and continued to do so throughout the 1990s. It was observed that abstentionism in Portugal rose by 91% between 1970 and 1990: this is surprising given that no similarly high increase was recorded in other countries which made the transition to democracy at the same time (Spain and Greece). Turn-out tends to be highest in general elections and presidential elections, with the level of abstentionism rising progressively for regional, local and, lastly, European Parliament elections. As regards the influence of social factors, it has been ascertained that, from a socio- demographic perspective, the crucial factor in turn-out at the 1999 general election and the 2001 presidential election was age: the older the voters, the higher the turn- out 41 . In the most recent elections for the national parliament (2002), the abstention rate was 38.52%; in the elections for the Azores regional legislative assembly (2000) it was 47.04%, while in those for the Madeira legislative assembly it was slightly lower (38.09%). Similar levels of abstention marked the local-authority elections of 2001. Thus 39.88% of the electorate failed to vote in the elections for the municipal chambers ( C\u00e2mara municipal ), with a similar percentage in those for the municipal assemblies (39.87%) and parish assemblies (39.97) 42 . 41 See Freire, A.(2003), 119 et seq. 42 These figures can be viewed at http://eleicoes.cne.pt ",
        "258 2.2 Forms and instruments of direct democracy The 1976 Portuguese constitution did not lay down any provisions for referendums at either national or local level. In practice, popular participation in the 1970s took the form of huge turn-outs in national parliament elections (between 1976 and 1983, turn-out never fell below 93%), workers experimenting with self-management, and participation in political demonstrations of all kinds. Portugal's accession to the European Community in 1986 served to consolidate the institutions of the market economy and representative democracy 43 . The 1982 constitutional revision introduced local referendums: Article 240 of the CRP allows local authorities (municipalities and parishes) to hold referendums on matters falling within their respective remits, subject to the provisions of the ordinary law governing the form of such requests and the procedures for submitting them. The 1989 constitutional revision introduced national political referendums, the conditions for which were further defined in the 1997 revision. Under Article 115 of the CRP, such a referendum may be called by the Assembly of the Republic or the government on matters falling within their respective remits and subject to the restrictions laid down by the constitution and the law implementing the referendum 44 . Article 115 of the CRP also stipulates that referendums may not be held on amendments to the constitution, budgetary, fiscal and financial questions, matters 43 Freire, A. and Baum, M. (2003), 136. 44 Cf. Organic law on the national referendum 15-A/98 of 3 April 1998, which regulates the initiative phase and the decision-making phase. In the initiative phase, a proposal is submitted by the Assembly or approved by the government, or a popular initative is supported by 75,000 registered voters. The constitutional court then rules on the constitutionality and legitimacy of the questions posed in the referendum; the court has to pronounce judgment within 25 days (a deadline which can be brought forward by the President of the Republic on grounds of urgency). The decision-making phase is reserved for the President of the Republic, who also has the power to reject requests for referendums. ",

Referendums may also be requested on issues of significant national interest which are the subject of an international agreement, with the sole exception of issues relating to peace or the alteration of borders (Article 115 of the CRP). The final decision on proposals for referendums lies with the President of the Republic, who can refuse to give his assent and must, in any case, rule within 20 days of the constitutional court's judgment on the constitutionality and legitimacy of the questions posed. The outcome of a referendum is binding when the number of votes cast is greater than half the the number of registered voters: if this is the case, the competent political bodies are obliged to implement the proposal and adopt the political and/or legislative acts specified therein 45 . The 1997 revision introduced regional referendums, which can be held on specific questions falling within the remit of the autonomous island regions (the Azores and Madeira) (Article 232(2) of the CRP), and referendums which form part of the legislative procedure for establishing the administrative regions (Article 256 of the CRP). The national referendums on the establishment of the administrative regions and the legalisation of abortion. The first national referendums were held in 1998; there were two questions on the establishment of the administrative regions and one on the legalisation of abortion. The question on abortion proposed the full liberalisation of the practice. The first question on regionalisation concerned the creation of new 45 Gomes Canotilho, J.J. (2002), 299. ",

The decision to hold referendums on these issues was the result of a political agreement between the centre-right PSD party and the government, led by the Socialist Party leader, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: the right-wing conservative parties (CDS and PP) only appeared to support these referendums for strategic reasons, while the left-wing parties of the Unitary Democratic Coalition ( Coliga\u00e7\u00e3o Democr\u00e1tica Unit\u00e1ria \u2013 CDU), led by the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), strongly opposed them. The two referendums generated wide-scale democratic participation, with \u201corganised\u201d participation in the referendum campaign from numerous pressure groups, civic movements and public committees. There was a high rate of abstention in both referendums. Twice as many people (68.1%) abstained in the referendum on abortion as in the 1995 political elections (33%); the level of abstentions in the referendum on the establishment of the administrative regions (52%) was twenty percent higher than that recorded in the preceding political elections.

Seven organised civic groups took part in the referendum campaign on abortion: three were in favour of legalisation and four were opposed. Left-wing party representatives supported the views of the pro-legalisation civic groups, although none of the groups was dominated by one political party. The standpoints of the groups opposing legalisation differed. The Solidarity and Life movement, which advocated preserving the existing legislation on abortion (permitted only in cases of rape, serious foetal malformation or danger of serious harm to the physical or mental health of the mother), was backed by the prime minister and the conservative PSD and PP. The three other groups opposed to legalisation were the Together for Life committee, which included the Minister for Finance, the socialist Antonio de Sousa Franco; the Life North group, which brought together prominent figures from northern Portugal; and the No to abortion on demand group, which was formed in Coimbra and had members from across the political spectrum. The low turn-out in the referendum on the administrative regions was ascribed to the ineffectiveness of the pressure groups and citizens\u2019 committees and the uncertainties and divisions within the parties supporting the proposal. Indeed, of the 25 pressure groups which sprang up at the time of the referendum, only five or six were not controlled or organised by the major political parties. The control exercised by the 47 Freire, A. and Baum, M. (2003), 140, also point out that there were many authoritative voices in the Catholic Church, including the Patriarch of Lisbon, D. Jos\u00e9 Policarpo, who adopted much more moderate positions. ",
        "263 political parties over the pressure groups was thus quite substantial: the low turn-out was a clear reflection of the uncertainties and divisions within the very parties which had promoted the referendum. The divisions within the Socialist Party were particularly significant, where the party's elder statesman M\u00e1rio Soares took a public stand against regionalising the country while the leader and Prime Minister in office, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, upheld the case for regionalisation 48 . The opposition to the creation of the administrative regions was led by the opposition Social Democrat party, which was allied with the Christian Democrats of the People's Party and with two independent civic movements: the (centre-right) United Nation ( Na\u00e7\u00e3o Unida ), whose campaign was based on nationalistic arguments, and One Portugal ( Portugal \u00danico ), which was tacitly supported by the former socialist president, M\u00e1rio Soares. Opinion polls revealed that opposition to regionalisation was brought about by a number of factors: 1) fear of breaking national unity and allowing separatism to prevail; 2) concern that regionalisation might increase the wealth of the northern regions and exacerbate the isolation of inland rural areas; 3) fear that, as was the case with the autonomous island regions, regionalisation would greatly increase the number of public officials and, therefore, push up the national debt, leading to a rise in taxation; 48 Cf.

Whereas in the referendum on abortion, the parties and pressure groups had to contend with a very tough adversary in the Portuguese Catholic Church, the key factor in the referendum on regionalisation was the role of the political parties and their ability to absorb pressure groups and civic movements. However, the voting pattern in this referendum did not reflect the geographical areas of influence of the different political parties. Although the northern areas, in which there is a greater concentration of small and medium-sized businesses, voted mainly for the right-wing parties in the 1995 political elections, these same areas strongly supported regionalisation in 1998, despite the fact that the referendum had been instigated by the Socialist Party. This can be explained by the fact that an increasingly powerful cross-party lobby was emerging in the northern regions in support of regionalisation. In the Algarve region, all the local centre-right representatives supported the \u201cyes\u201d campaign. Despite this backing, the campaign mounted by the regionalist lobby in these regions was not strong enough to win a majority. In the central regions, including Santar\u00e9m, the heated controversy over the geographical delimitation of the regions was manifested in a large vote against regionalisation. The extensive support for regionalisation in the Alentejo region (where 51% voted \u201cyes\u201d) was linked to the strong concentration in that area of the Communist Party, which wanted to create a region it could control itself, and to the fact that none of the local pressure groups or civic movements supported the \u201cno\u201d cause. 49 See Blanco de Morais, C. (1999), 420 ",
        "265 Regional and local referendums. Under Article 232 of the CRP, each regional assembly can propose regional referendums. If such a proposal is approved by the President of the Republic, the public is called upon to give its binding opinion directly on a question of specific regional interest. The conditions and the referendum procedure itself follow the rules laid down in Article 115 applying to national referendums. Local referendums are governed by Article 240, which entitles local authorities (municipalities and parishes) to call referendums on matters falling within their respective remits according to the conditions and procedures laid down by Organic Law 4 of 24 August 2000. Article 4 of this lists the matters which cannot be the subject of this kind of referendum, namely: questions which fall within the legislative powers of the sovereign bodies; matters governed by laws or regulatory statutes binding on local authorities; decisions contained in the plan; budgetary, fiscal and financial questions; matters which are the subject of irrevocable decisions enshrining legally-protected rights or interests, with the exception of parts thereof which are detrimental to the addressees; and matters on which court judgments have been issued. Matters which have been the subject of programme contracts are also excluded. Deputies, municipal and parish assemblies, municipal chambers and parish boards have right of initiative as regards referendums. The public also has a right of initiative which can be exercised by groups of citizens registered in the area of the municipality or parish in question (Article 10). Once the municipal or parish assembly has decided on the holding of a referendum, the constitutional court scrutinises the questions to ensure their compliance with the constitution and the law; it has 25 days to give a ruling (Article 27). A referendum only has binding force if the number of voters is greater than one half of the voters registered in the census (Article 115 of the CRP); the result is then binding on the local-authority bodies concerned. Referendums do not preclude the right to submit petitions: Article 52 of the CRP gives all Portuguese citizens the right to submit, individually or jointly with others, ",

They also have the right to be informed, within a reasonable time, of the response. A further form of direct participation in political life is the plenary meeting of voters which replaces the municipal assembly in very small parishes. 2.3 Community identification with regional and local government In the wake of the defeat of the regionalist lobbies in the 1998 referendum, commentators sought to interpret the high abstention rate and the victory of those opposed to regionalisation in mainland Portugal. The explanation probably lay in the structure of the local institutions. Mainland Portugal does not have a tradition of meso-level institutions, and local calls for a reduction in state powers are so thin on the ground that there cannot seriously be said to be any real conflict between centre and regions. Only the island regions identify with the regional tier of government, and their separate status contributes to the widespread view that this tier is unnecessary elsewhere 50 . That does not mean, however, that there is not wide support for decentralisation in Portugal: there was no shortage of proposals offering an alternative to the administrative regions after the failure of the 1998 referendum. These included the idea of strengthening local authorities (municipalities and parishes) and local- authority associations. Portugal's municipal authorities are well-established institutions, yet they receive a very small state budget (one of the lowest in Europe). This makes it very difficult for them to establish the services, infrastructure and 50 See Baum, M. and Freire, A.(2003), in Bukowsky, J. et al. (2003), 39 ",
        "267 communication networks necessary for local economic development, even when they join forces with other authorities. In addition to the fact that municipal government takes many different forms, there is a widespread and now deep-rooted awareness of the limits of the centralised state. Despite steps to devolve the tasks of various government departments, the issue of coordination between these departments and the Regional Coordination and Development Commissions, which remain largely under the authority of the state, has yet to be resolved. As Portugal continues its integration with the rest of Europe, the creation of a mainland regional government structure will clearly become a key item on the political agenda once more 51 . III. REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 3.1 The constitutional framework (economic and financial aspects) The 1976 Portuguese constitution laid down numerous principles, rules and guarantees regarding economic relations, in recognition of the important role the economy would play in securing the political and social change visualised by the revolution of 25 April 1974. The aim was the antithesis of the corporatist regime imposed by the 1933 constitution. The Armed Forces Movement succeeded in including in the 1976 constitution the principle of the \u201ctransition to socialism through the creation of the necessary conditions for the working classes to be able to exercise democratic power\u201d: the Portuguese democratic state thus undertook to socialise production methods and wealth and to promote the well-being of the working classes 52 . These goals underpinned the public ownership of the principal means of production, economic development planning, the central role of the plan with regard to the free exercise of private economic initiative, and the irreversible nature of 51 Baum, M. and Freire, A, (2003), 43 52 Cf. Articles 2 and 9(c) of the 1976 constitution. ",

In practice, however, after the introduction of the 1976 constitution, law-making and economic policy moved clearly away from Marxist principles and was guided move by the rules of the market economy 53 . This is the backdrop to the 1982 revision, which removed the ideological principles applicable to the transition to socialism and established the principle of the co- existence of the various forms of ownership (public, private and cooperative) for the means of production. The 1982 constitution also stipulated that compensation was to be provided for requisitioned and expropriated estates, including those expropriated from large landowners 54 . The ideological cleansing of the constitution was completed with the subsequent 1989 revision, which abolished the principle of the \u201cirreversibility of nationalisation\u201d and made provision for the \u201creprivatisation of \u2026 the means of production or other property nationalised after 25 April 1974\u201d (Article 296 CRP); with this revision, Portugal came into line once and for all with the European constitutional systems regarding economic relations 55 . The 1997 revision eliminated the constitutional principle relating to sectors excluded from private economic initiative. Portuguese law is thus now no longer obliged to determine the basic sectors in which private business activity is forbidden; it merely has the option of doing so 56 . The constitution also incorporated a number of principles regarding the financial and tax system: the central banking system must comply with international and Community law (Article 102); taxes are to be imposed by law, as provided by the constitution (Article 103); and tax rates must be proportional to family income and needs (Article 104). 53 Sousa Franco, A. and D'Oliveira Martins, G.

(1991), 32 56 Article 86(3) of the constitution stipulates that the law may determine the basic sectors in which private economic enterprise is banned. ",
        "269 3.2 Privatisation and economic regulation The growing need to incorporate private law into the public enterprise system contributed to the development of a major economic privatisation drive. The movement for privatisation which emerged in Portugal sought to address the specific needs of a country in which the abovementioned constitutional constraints on the development of private enterprise had helped to slow down this process considerably. Once those constitutional constraints had been removed, and faced with the imperative need to reduce a very high national debt, Portugal launched an intense privatisation programme in the 1990s. The programme was so huge that the revenue from privatisation during the period 1996-1999 was twice that generated between 1989 and 1995 57 . The framework law on privatisation was adopted in 1990, laying down the rules on re-privatising the ownership of, or right to use, means of production and other assets nationalised after 25 April 1974 58 . In an initial phase, public enterprises were turned into companies with share capital. The privatisation process could then take the form of a transfer of shares, an increase in share capital or direct sale; by law, a percentage of shares was to be reserved for small shareholders under more favourable terms. The state had the option of retaining golden shares which, whatever their number, enabled it to exercise the right of veto in decisions on changes to the Social Pact and other decisions explicitly specified in the company's articles of incorporation. The privatisation process speeded up sharply from 1995 onwards with the adoption for the first time of a government programme on enterprises to be privatised or likely to be privatised in the future. According to information published in 1999 by the Finance 57 Paz Ferreira, E. (2001), 356 58 Cf. Article 1 of Law 11/90 of 5 April 1990. ",
        "270 Ministry, at the end of the first half of 1995, 130 operations had been carried out transferring the state shareholdings of over 100 companies. Privatisation had several effects: 1) it significantly reduced state involvement in the economy; 2) it cut the national debt; 3) it gave a decisive boost to the capital market. More specifically, the contribution of public enterprise to GDP (Gross Domestic Product) fell from 19.7% to 8% between 1988 and 1997; the national debt fell from 66.5% to 62% between 1995 and 1997. In addition to these positive effects on the Portuguese economy, it is necessary not to overlook the fact that the privatisation process was actually brought about by external factors such as the need to meet the convergence criteria imposed by EU integration, and was also influenced by the political decision to break with a strong historical tradition of state involvement in the economy 59 . Economic regulation developed alongside the privatisation process: once production had been transferred from the public to the private sector, the most appropriate forms of state involvement had to be regulated to ensure the smooth functioning of the competitive market. The most important case was the creation of the regulatory body for the electricity sector (ERSE \u2013 Entidade Reguladora do Sector El\u00e9ctrico ), as part of the restructuring programme for the sector required by Community directives. In 1991 the state electricity company (EDP) was converted into a company with share capital, and its privatisation commenced in 1997. The reorganisation of the service led to the creation of a public electricity generation and supply network (SEP \u2013 Sistema El\u00e9ctrico de Servi\u00e7o P\u00fablico ) and an independent network (SEI \u2013 Sistema 59 See Paz Fereira, E. (2001), 384. ",
        "271 El\u00e9ctrico Independente ), operating in competition. Decree-Law 182 of 1995 created a regulatory authority (ERSE), which was given the task of regulating the public network (SEP) and managing relations between the SEP and the SEI. ERSE is a public law body with administrative and financial autonomy and its own resources, but it is not an independent authority, being answerable to the Minister for the Economy. In the communications sector, the regulation process led to the creation of the communications authority (ICP \u2013 Instituto das Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es de Portugal) , whose role extends far beyond that of regulation in the strict sense of the word: its tasks include helping the government manage telecommunications policy, price-setting and monitoring the liberalisation of the sector. This tendency to give regulatory bodies roles more far-reaching roles was confirmed with Decree-Law 229-B/98 of 29 September 1998 setting up the national rail transport authority (INTF \u2013 Instituto Nacional do Trasporte Ferrovi\u00e1rio ), which operates in tandem with the national rail network body running the infrastructure. The nature of the national civil aviation authority (INACA \u2013 Instituto Nacional de Avia\u00e7\u00e3o Civil ) is equally hybrid, resembling a public enterprise body with no real regulatory powers. The tendency to give public-utility regulatory bodies additional non-regulatory duties was also apparent in the environmental protection field, with the creation in 1997 of a regulatory authority for water and waste (IN\u00c1R \u2013 Instituto Regulador de \u00c1guas e Res\u00edduos ). This body regulates, controls and oversees the management of services run by the municipalities, while also ensuring a balance between quality of service and cost-effective management 60 . 60 See Paz Ferreira,E. (2001), 409 et seq. ",
        "272 3.3 The budget of regional and local authorities: the local authority share of national tax revenue The financial systems of the municipalities and parishes are governed by Law 42/98 of 6 August 1998 on local authorities\u2019 finances, as amended by Law 87-B/98 of 31 December 1998, Law 3-B/2000 of 4 April 2000 and Law 15/2001 of 5 June 2001. Since January 2002, local authorities\u2019 accounting systems, which are currently governed by Decree-Law 341/83 of 21 July 1983, have been subject to the provisions of the official accounting plan for local authorities ( Pocal ). The Directorate-General for Local Authorities (www.dgaa.pt) regularly publishes breakdowns of the financial situations of each municipality. Classification of the revenue and expenditure items in local authorities\u2019 accounts is governed by Decree-Law 341 of 1998, which includes under current transfers: \u2013 revenue coming from transfers from the state budget ( Fundo Geral Municipal, Fundo de Coes\u00e3o Municipal, Fundo Base Municipal ); \u2013 revenue from Community funds (European Social Fund - ESF); \u2013 revenue from other transfers. As regards the first category, the law on local authorities\u2019 finances defines the role of each individual fund. The basic fund ( Fundo de Base Municipal ) represents the minimum funding necessary to run the authority, while the general fund ( Fundo Geral Municipal ) provides the financing needed for local authorities to perform their tasks, taking into account the levels of activity and investment of each body. The role of the cohesion fund ( Fundo de Coes\u00e3o Municipal ) is to iron out the imbalances between municipalities by helping the less-developed ones to catch up. Resources are ",
        "273 allocated on the basis of indicators reflecting the extent to which revenue and opportunity levels fall below the national average. Parishes receive financing from the parish resources fund, which is distributed between the three territorial units (mainland Portugal and the autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira) 61 . In 2003, local authorities were entitled to a share of national tax revenue equal to 33% of the arithmetic mean of the revenue derived from personal income tax, corporation tax and VAT. Thus, in 2003, a total of EUR 2,323,799,024 was divided between the different funds as follows 62 : \u2013 4.5 % for the basic fund; \u2013 20.5 % for the general fund; \u2013 5.5% for the cohesion fund; \u2013 2.5% for the parish resources fund. 3.4 Public-private cooperation instruments. The intermediary role of the unions. Economic cooperation is pursued via the agreements reached between the social partners and between the social partners and the government on the adoption, development and implementation of socio-economic measures, particularly as regards the regulation of terms of employment, economic policy and income and price policies. The political scene in Portugal did not facilitate the dissemination and consolidation of socio-economic consultation, the theory and practice of which only 61 Law 42/98 of 6 August 1998 on local authorities\u2019 finances, as amended by Law 94/2001 of 20 August 2001. 62 These data appear on website www.dgaa.pt/Participa.htm ",
        "274 started to be seen as important in the 1980s. However, it played a key role in the policies of the second half of the 1990s after the socialist government took office 63 . It is likely that the weakness and instability of Portuguese businesses during the transition to democracy did not facilitate attempts at social dialogue, although this method of pre-emptive resolution of conflict between the social partners and government decisions did take on an increasingly important role. This is borne out by the fact that, after the 1989 revision of the constitution, Article 56 of the CRP gave trade unions the additional right to be represented on social consultation bodies. The establishment of the Economic and Social Council, which replaced the National Planning Council, was a further decisive step in consolidating socio-economic consultation. Furthermore, Article 92 of the CRP not only describes the Economic and Social Council as the \u201cbody responsible for consultation and coordination in relation to economic and social policies\u201d, but also stipulates that its members are to include \u201crepresentatives of the government, of organisations representing workers, of organisations representing economic interests and families, of the autonomous regions and of local authorities\u201d. The practice of consultation gives private organisations representing the social partners and the subnational authorities (local authorities, trade unions, employers\u2019 organisations and other economic associations) a public role and enables them to help shape government policy. This culture of consultation in modern-day Portugal is far removed from the corporatist democracy and representation of interests which underpinned the 1933 constitutional system. Many commentators view social consultation as being based on the existence of a common ethic in which promises are expected to be fulfilled, and on genuine representativeness of the leaders of stakeholders\u2019 organisations. 63 See Paz Ferreira, E. (2001), 340. ",
        "275 The distribution of employment in Portugal differs somewhat from the Community norm. Thus, farming accounts for 12.7% of employment (compared to the EU average of 2.2%). Industry is moving closer to the EU figure (35.1% compared to 31.3%), while the service sector employs just 52% of the active population, a percentage which is well below the EU figure of 66.5%. The active population (including the unemployed and young people looking for their first job) is about half of the total population (between 48 and 49%), which is in line with the Community average. The unemployment rate is well below average, and is one of the lowest in the entire Community (between 4 and 5%). Fifty-five percent of the workforce belong to a trade union. While the unions have close ties with the particular parties whose ideologies they follow, they also engage in constructive dialogue with the government and the other social partners. The principal Portuguese trade union is the communist-oriented General Confederation of Portuguese Workers ( Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Geral dos Trabalhadores Portugueses-Intersindical-CGTP ), which accounts for over half of trade-union membership (57%). The other main trade union is the General Workers' Union ( Uni\u00e3o Geral dos Trabalhadores - UGT ), which is closer to the Socialist and Social Democrat Parties and accounts for 33% of trade-union membership. A further 10% of trade-union members belong to unions which are not affiliated to political parties 64 . 64 Cf. Il Portogallo visto da vicino , published by the Italian Chamber of Commerce for Portugal, 2000, 21, on www.ccitalia.pt; on the relationship between the principal political parties and the trade unions, see Farelo Lopes-F. and Freire, A.

        "276 3.5 European integration and economic development at regional and local level: management of the Structural Funds Portugal is one of the countries (along with Greece, Spain and Ireland) benefiting from the Cohesion Fund, which is granted to states whose Gross National Product (GNP) is less than 90% of the Community average 65 . The Cohesion Fund is managed by European Commission Directorate-General XIV, which approves the projects submitted by the four beneficiary Member States. The Fund supports and facilitates the implementation of projects in the field of transport and environmental protection. Through the Fund, the European Community provides up to 85% of the sum to be invested in projects. The Fund is administered at national level by the Directorate- General for Regional Development, which is the authority which distributes the payments (www.dgdr.pt). From 1993 to 1999, the Cohesion Fund received around EUR 2,990 million (about ESC 595 billion), which had already generated revenue of EUR 2,827 million (ESC 557.6 billion) by the end of 2001. This funding was used to implement 156 projects and distributed equally between the transport and environment sectors. In the transport sector, 39% of the funding was used for roads, 23% for the bridge over the Tagus, 19% for railways, 12% for airports and the remaining 7% for ports. In the environmental protection sector, the funds were used for water supply (35%), waste water disposal (34%), solid waste processing (26%) and the building of the Alqueva Dam hydroelectric power station (5%). 65 The Cohesion Fund was temporarily created by Council Regulation (EC) No. 792/93 of 30 March 1993 and definitively regulated by Regulation (EC) No. 1164/94 of 16 May 1994, as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 1264/99 of 21 June 1999. Further information on this fund can be found at www.dgdr.pt/Fcoesao/index.htm. ",
        "277 The following Cohesion Fund implementation period (2000-2006) was preceded by reorganisation of the national strategy for implementing the Fund, which until then had been managed as part of the operational programmes for infrastructure, transport and the environment included in the third Community Support Framework (CSF III) for Portugal. The fact that this period coincided with the CSF implementation period and with the revision of the national and Community regulations made it possible to coordinate and streamline distribution of the resources provided through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under CSF III (2000-2006) with the resources provided through the Cohesion Fund during the same period. The ESF Management Institute ((IGFSE) 66 was created in 2000 to manage the European Social Fund (ESF), which is the EU's principal financial instrument for achieving its strategic employment policy objectives 67 . This is a national public body which is responsible for the management, coordination and financial scrutiny of measures implemented with ESF assitance. The government\u2019s intention in setting up this coordinating body was to ensure more consistent, flexible management and coordination of ESF financing under the current Community Support Framework (CSF III). As the body overseeing the management of the ESF at national level, the IGFSE helps those responsible for managing the funds to understand and coordinate national and Community rules on ESF implementation, and acts as the European Commission\u2019s Portuguese partner in managing the Fund. Under the CSF III audit system, the IGFSE is responsible for second-level auditing of ESF activities; as well as assessing the government\u2019s audit system, it also monitors the decisions taken by 66 Created by Decree-Law 45-A/2000 of 22 March 2000: for information on the operation of this body, see www.igfse.pt . 67 For the aims and objectives of the European Social Fund, which is governed by Regulation (EC) No. 1784/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 1999, see website: http://europa.eu.int/comm/employment_social/esf/20000/index.htm.

The IGFSE reports to the Secretary of State for Employment ( Secret\u00e1rio de Estado do Trabalho ). Since there is no regional government structure on mainland Portugal, the Structural Funds have been managed at regional level by regional coordinating commissions and more recently by the Regional Coordination and Development Commissions ( Comiss\u00f5es de Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenvolvimento Regional - CCDR ) set up in 2003 68 . These commissions play a key role in selecting and promoting numerous projects to be funded at regional level. The present five commissions \u2013 the Commission for the North (CCDR Norte) based in Oporto, the Commission for the Centre (CCDR Centro) based in Coimbra, the Commission for Lisbon and the Tagus valley (CCDR LVT) based in Lisbon, the Commission for the Alentejo (CCDR Alentejo) based in Evora and the Commission for the Algarve (CCDR Algarve) based in Faro \u2013 have to ensure the implementation of the regional operational programmes for Portugal provided for in its Community Support Framework and perform an essential role in supporting and monitoring economic development in the regions. Since the 2003 reform, regional councils participate in the appointment of CCDR chairmen. The regional council is an internal CCDR body made up, inter alia , of mayors of the municipalities and representatives of the parishes within the region concerned. Despite this move to ensure representation of local authorities on CCDR bodies, the CCDR are still closely tied to the government and the Ministry of Public Works, Planning and Regional Administration. 68 Decree-Law 104/2003 of 23 May 2003 set up the Regional Coordination and Development Commissions, which took on the role of the CCR: the new commissions are decentralised units of the Ministry of Public Works, Planning and Regional Administration (Article 1). See point 1.1.2 above for the changes to their organisation and role. ",
        "279 Now that the CCDR have been given an important role in coordinating the Structural Funds' regional development activities, observers feel that the development and increasing use of the system whereby Community aid is managed by bodies that remain under the authority of government departments has in fact helped to revive state involvement in the economy, which had fallen dramatically following the large- scale privatisations of the 1990s 69 . IV. LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES 4.1 Management of public services. The regional and local dimension of public services Demand for public services began to grow dramatically in the 1980s, and has continued to develop as the structure and needs of Portuguese society have changed. In the 1950s, the average age of Portugal\u2019s population was lower than that of other European countries; by the end of the 1990s, however, the proportion of the total population over the age of 65 was greater than that under 15. Life expectancy rose substantially, from 60 and 66 (for men and women respectively) in 1960 to 73 and 79 in 2001. Population ageing has been caused by the fall in the birth rate (11%) and in the female fertility rate 70 . There have been considerable changes in family life, largely related to women\u2019s emancipation. Women now account for half of the employed active population, compared to just 20-25% in 1960. In 1998, 56% of university students were women; this figure is slightly higher than the figures for Sweden and France. A breakdown of the number of women in employment in 1995 69 Cf. Mozzicafreddo, J. (2000), 149 70 Cf. Barreto, A. (2002) ",
        "280 according to the level of study achieved revealed that 91% of women with degrees or diplomas were in employment, while the European average was below 80% 71 . Between 1960 and 1999, the number of church weddings fell. In the north and the centre there was a greater tendency towards marriage and less of a tendency towards cohabitation. In Lisbon, the Tagus Valley, the Algarve and, to some extent, the Alentejo, however, there was a higher proportion of unmarried unions, a significant number of children born out of wedlock and a lower marriage rate. As regards the composition of the family unit, a clear tendency has emerged in recent years towards the nuclear family; most single-parent families are headed by a woman and, despite the very few forms of support available for mothers with small children, 70.8% of lone mothers are in employment; this percentage is much higher than the figure for women in childless relationships 72 . National health service. While society has developed at a remarkable rate over the past 30 years of democracy, the efficiency of the production and public-service systems is still well below the European average. With the nationalisation of the health system, a potentially free, state-funded service was created and, despite changing health policies, there is no doubt that the increase in life expectancy at birth, the fall in infant mortality and the rise in the average age at death are evidence that the standard of living in Portugal has improved considerably over the past 15 years 73 . Education and training. Improved schooling has had an equally decisive impact. Public spending on education increased from 3.5% of GDP in 1985 to 5.15% in 1991, 71 See Torres, A. (2003), 243 et seq., 254 72 Cf. the data recorded by Torres, A. (2003), 251 73 Cf. Mozzicafreddo, J. (2000), 57 ",
        "281 producing a substantial increase in the number of people benefiting from nursery, vocational, secondary and higher education 74 . 4.1.1 The impact of privatisation Law 88 of 1913 allowed Portuguese municipalities to organise and manage public services at local level by setting up \"municipal enterprises\". These bodies were governed by public law and were part of the municipality\u2019s internal organisation. In 1977 (Law 79/1977 of 25 October), it became possible to set up municipal enterprises which were separate from the municipality in terms of legal personality and capacity, although still subject to municipal controls. Municipal enterprises became widespread, particularly after the adoption of Law 58/1998 regulating the setting-up of municipal, inter-municipal and regional enterprises 75 . The municipal enterprises managing the principal public services can be divided into those which perform an activity that is merely of public interest and those which have been set up to deliver a public service. Some of the enterprises hold a local monopoly and perform economic activities that are not open to private companies (i.e. water collection, treatment and distribution; collection, treatment and recycling of urban waste water; collection and processing of solid urban waste; rail transport operated as a public service). 74 Cf. Mozzicafreddo, J. (2000), 63, table 2.15 75 Rebord\u00e3o Montalvo, A.(2003), 180, points out that in 1999, there were 34 municipal and inter-municipal enterprises and 143 companies in which municipalities owned share capital; by October 2001, there were already 114 of the former and 187 of the latter: in total, 269 municipalities were involved. In addition to these, there were 58 limited companies, 35 cooperatives, 21 foundations and 19 banks, taking the total number of companies and bodies with municipal involvement to 434. ",
        "282 The current legal system governing municipal enterprises managing public services is laid down by Law 58/98 of 18 August 1998 (Framework law on municipal, inter- municipal and regional enterprises), which endeavoured to reconcile the need for efficient municipal economic initiative with the need to ensure order and transparency in the way the sector is managed 76 . This law distinguishes between public enterprises , in which a municipality (or administrative region) owns all the capital; publicly-owned enterprises , in which municipalitites or associations of municipalities (or administrative regions) own capital alongside other public bodies; and publicly-controlled enterprises , in which municipalities, associations of municipalities (or administrative regions) own the majority of the capital and private bodies hold a minority share. This wide range of models for managing local public services has helped to transform the traditionally bureaucratic, archaic management of these services by providing more flexible arrangements that are better geared to the differing needs of local authorities 77 . The frequency with which urban public transport management, waste collection and treatment and water collection and distribution services are entrusted to private companies is further evidence of Portugal\u2019s openness to the private sector. There are also a number of partnerships with private companies based on service contracts for the upkeep of parks, surveillance and security of public buildings, and organisation of school transport. Cooperation between the public, private and social sectors at local level is ensured by strategic consultations between municipal chambers, local businesses and other 76 Cf. Pacheco de Amorim, J. (2000), 42 77 See Paz Ferreira, E.(2001), 290 ",
        "283 associations on the framing of projects of municipal or inter-municipal interest. Thus, municipal authorities are increasingly playing a leading role in economic development and promoting local community involvement in key local projects 78 . The autonomous regions also have independent control of their assets and can therefore set up their own enterprises. In practice, however, this independence has been greatly curbed by the framework law on privatisation, which made the government responsible for the decision to sell off nationalised public enterprises, including those performing their principal activity within an autonomous region 79 . Private enterprise will have an increasingly important role to play in the organisation of the health service. Private-sector service providers are increasingly taking on a leading role as the sector develops, especially in the field of specialised medicine, diagnostic methods, customised treatments and tests 80 . On a more general note, this raises the question of the role of the welfare state ( Estado-Provid\u00eancia ) in the management of public services: redefining the state\u2019s role does not mean dismantling the welfare state, but striving to give it a key role in the regulation of services rather than in their delivery 81 . Regardless of the question of the respective roles of the private and public sectors, the Portuguese health system is lagging well behind other European countries in the use of new information technology and telecommunications. Precisely with a view to overcoming these shortcomings, a series of projects to computerise the health system form part of an information society action plan: these projects include creating a healthcare portal, connecting ambulances to accident and emergency units, extending the use of electronic 78 See Rebord\u00e3o Montalvo, A.(2003), 193 79 Paz Ferreira, E.

This action plan establishes a number of priorities, which include: 1) improving the services provided to the public; 2) achieving an efficient, modern public administration; 3) connecting the entire administration up to broadband; 4) rationalising public administration communications costs; 5) a national e-commerce programme; 6) modernising local public administration; and 7) an information campaign relating to communications initiatives undertaken in the various government departments and public offices 83 . 5.2 Procedures and safeguards for electronic voting. The role of electronic discussion forums. The rise of local television networks. Portugal has not yet experimented with e-voting. A project for e-voting in the forthcoming European elections is being developed and will be finalised from January 2004. This pilot project will run in a limited number of parishes and is based on the \" voto electr\u00f3nico presencial \" technique tried out in Brazil: instead of voting at the polling station in the traditional manner, each voter registers his or her vote via an electronic terminal. At present, e-voting via the Internet is inconceivable, not just because of the small number of Portuguese households which have access to or use 83 Cf. eGovernment action plan, at www.umic.pcm.gov.pt/UMIC/ ",
        "287 the Internet but, first and foremost, because in this relatively young democracy, the physical presence and participation of the voter at the polls is still seen as an integral part of exercising the right to vote. As regards the structural conditions necessary for the dissemination of e-voting, the introduction of ICT in Portugal is in a dynamic, transitional phase. The results of a survey commissioned by the UMIC and published in September 2003 confirm that the Portuguese are gradually starting to use the Internet for both cultural/educational and work-related purposes. Half of the Portuguese population own a computer (53%, including 46% of households) and, of these, a large proportion (82%) are frequent users. Only 39% of the population use the Internet, but an average annual increase of 25% was recorded between 2000 and 2003; 77% of users use the Internet frequently. Twenty-eight percent of families have an Internet connection and, here too, there was an annual increase of 52% between 2000 and 2003; only 10% of families also have broadband (high-speed Internet access), but it should be noted that this figure is three times the 2002 figure. The rise in Internet access is linked to professional requirements (23%), the need to provide children of school age with a research tool (20%) and the need to keep up with technological advances in society (20%). The number of Portuguese conducting e-commerce transactions remains low (5%) 84 . As regards local media networks, there are regional television channels and many regional and local radio stations. The public television company RTP\u2019s first television channel was launched in 1957 and began to broadcast to the autonomous island regions in the 1970s: broadcasts to Madeira started in 1972 and to the Azores in 1975. Regional radio stations cover different districts (spanning several municipalities) in the Azores and Madeira, while municipal radio stations only 84 The results of this survey appear on the UMIC website: www.umic.pcm.gov/UMIC/Media/SaladeImpresa/inquerito_internet_2003.htm; as regards UMIC's role and initiatives, see point 5.1 above.

        "288 broadcast to one municipality. There are two regional radio stations on the mainland, which are both private and have been broadcasting since the end of 1990. The Lisbon-based Radio Nostalgia covers the south of the country and specialises in music from the 1950s and 1960s. The northern half of the country is covered by TSF , a company born of a joint venture between the local radio stations in Lisbon and the regional stations in the north; it broadcasts news, music and sport. There are around 300 registered local radio stations in the coastal areas, but they are unable to broadcast to the whole country. The coastal areas of Aveiro, Lisbon, Oporto and Faro have a lot more stations than areas inland such as Beja, Portalegre, Guarda, Castelo Branco and the islands: this reflects and confirms the fact that the coastal areas are still more economically developed and more dynamic than areas inland 85 . 5.3 Information technology and changing public services A government web-portal ( www.lojadacidadao.pt) has been set up with the aim of using new information technology to improve public services . This portal contains a series of links to the various departments which issue certificates, and a specific site for public information. The creation of the portal was accompanied by a large-scale trial of the \"one-stop shop\" management model. The project began in October 1997 when the government set up a five-member team (reporting directly to the Secretary of State for Public Administration and Administrative Modernisation) to oversee the setting-up of one-stop shops in certain towns and cities, where users would be able to request and access a range of services. This was part of a wider strategy to modernise the public administration and decentralise and streamline use of the services. 85 In 2002, 354 local radio stations were registered, 318 of which were on the mainland, 22 in the Azores and 14 in Madeira: see www.ics.pt/verfs.php?fscod=388. ",
        "289 The project was first piloted in Lisbon and Oporto. The siting of the one-stop shops was decided on the basis of a number of criteria, including the location of the easiest access routes to the city, the accessibility of public services, and parking availability. The services managed by these centres include water, electricity and gas supply, telephone connections, vehicle registration, passport issue and social security and health services. There are currently six one-stop shops in Portugal (in Lisbon, Oporto, Aveiro, Viseu, Set\u00fabal and Braga). There is also a site ( www.infocid.pt ) from which it is possible to access information on services available online, including the Servi\u00e7o P\u00fablico Directo ( http://spdirecto.infocid.pt ), to which online applications can be made for civil and commercial certificates. The central government was the driving force behind the streamlining of public services: this particular project was spearheaded by the prime minister\u2019s office, and the department responsible for its implementation is the Ministry for State Reform and Public Administration 86 . Interlinkage between IT tools, new technology and streamlining public services is a priority of the current government, which established the eGovernment action plan developed by the Innovation and Knowledge Mission Unit (UMIC) 87 . The objective of providing high-quality, efficient public services to individuals and enterprises is one of the seven pillars of the action plan. Projects contributing to the achievement of this objective include creating a public portal; streamlining communications costs; promoting e-commerce; creating an administration portal; a single, integrated social security system; a single vehicle registry; and an integrated civil registry system. The creation of a public portal forms part of an overall strategy for the public 86 Cf. Timonen, V. - O'Donnell, O. - Humphreys, P.C.

Clearly, the objective of creating efficient services which are increasingly in tune with the public\u2019s needs involves local authorities: where eGovernment at local level is concerned, it is the municipalities which have to provide more user-friendly, integrated services. To this end, in 2003 it is planned (i) to revamp the digital cities and regions project, which is one of the objectives of the information society action plan 88 , (ii) to register the basic electronic services which local authorities will be able to use in the future, and (iii) to enlist the support of information technology in the decentralisation process. The provision of electronic facilities for the delivery of grassroots services (local eGovernment) is perfectly in keeping with the approach enshrined in the constitution, based on the principles of decentralisation and subsidiarity 89 . 88 See point 5.1 above. 89 See point 1.1.1 above.

        "297 UNITED KINGDOM INTRODUCTION Regionalisation, federalisation and devolution have also affected the United Kingdom. The centralised form of government that had been characteristic of this country for the previous thirty years has, since the second half of the 1990s, undergone significant changes in the direction of federalism. In this sense, devolution in Scotland and \u2013 albeit in a more diluted form \u2013 in Wales has highlighted the profound changes that have taken place in the shape of the country and of its government. These changes are further evidenced by the decisive steps taken since 2002, when the Government published its white paper on governance. This highlighted the emergence of entirely new needs in respect of the coordination and development of these types of autonomy: metropolitan local government was revived, developed and strengthened (in particular the Greater London Authority); greater interaction between associations, trade unions and political parties was promoted, and all of these were put on a stronger regional footing (a trend that could favour embryonic regional parties, which can be clearly identified even within the two major political parties, Labour and Conservative). There is an increasing awareness of the value of cooperation and social partnership as an instrument of government and as a means of achieving broader, more effective governance. These policies thus reflect a new kind of politics. Devolution has not led to fragmentation. Rather, the new arrangements have facilitated greater integration of and interaction between all the players (both institutional and socio-economic) in the different territorial entities that make up the United Kingdom. ",
        "298 Scotland is certainly the region that has received the greatest degree of autonomy as a result of devolution, although now \u2013 about five years after the first Act on the subject \u2013 some research bodies are asking whether the current situation really constitutes an improvement. At the same time, it must be emphasised that this state of affairs has stimulated greater civic participation, possibly helped by spin-offs from technological progress; electronic voting and the development of networks at local level open up new avenues that could revitalise democratic channels that currently seem to be dying out. As a result local and regional economic development seems to be flourishing, particularly in the wake of the Thatcher era of privatisations at national level. Indeed, it seems to have benefited from the treatment, in the form of the business-friendly legislative and regulatory environment that has been in place in recent years, as well as from incentives for public-private cooperation and, as a result of the steady process of European integration, from increasingly carefully-targeted use of the Structural Funds. The United Kingdom appears to be a country which, following the first stage of devolution, which was largely focused on legislation, is now about to enter upon a second stage. This would be focused on promoting a network-based model of open society. The idea would be to bring together \u2013 for example, in the provision of public services \u2013 the public sector with the private, the social partners with the authorities, and initiatives from elected politicians with those of local and other interest groups, in a way that promotes the actors who are best placed to understand local needs in the regions that are stronger, because their autonomy is constitutionally (and thus legally) recognised, and richer, because their autonomy enables them to manage their own affairs more wisely. Therefore, the perspectives for this country are very interesting, even in comparative terms, in that they promise to open up new opportunities within ",

I. THE EVOLUTION OF FEDERAL/REGIONAL DYNAMICS THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 1.1 Organisation of the State in the last thirty years. Historical profile The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, the result of a long institutional process, and does not have a written constitution. The legal basis for Britain\u2019s constitutional framework can be found in a number of laws that govern constitutional matters, in the customs of the institutions, and in case law. Among these laws are the Magna Carta of 1215, the Bill of Rights of 1688, and the Act of Settlement of 1700, as well as the Act of Union with Scotland (1706), the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, and the Representation of the People Act 1983. Great Britain is the product of the unification of the various kingdoms of the island, whereby the English crown progressively took in the areas that are now Wales (by means of a lengthy process concluded in the 16 th century), Scotland (Union with Scotland Act 1707) and Ireland (1801). Government has been characterised by a high degree of centralisation 1 . The unitary structure did not really change until the beginning of the devolution process. The only political and institutional debate about the organisation of government related to local 1 See Loughlin, J. ( 2001), 37 ff. ",
        "300 government. Before the process of devolution, the central government maintained a predominant role over local, publicly-elected bodies. The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, who were appointed by the Prime Minister, respectively had powers of supervision and control over elected county councils in Wales, regional councils in Scotland, and district councils in Northern Ireland. Territorial arrangements in England, on the other hand, were organised along different lines. Rather than a Secretary of State, there was a Minister for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, who had powers of supervision and control over the 39 elected County Councils and, until the 1985 Local Government Act abolished them, the six Metropolitan Councils and the Greater London Council. The picture of local government in England was completed (and, to a large extent, remains so) by numerous District Councils (metropolitan or otherwise) and by the 33 London boroughs. The British form of government revolves around the Prime Minister. Within the context of the two-party system, the Parliamentary form of government evolved firstly towards a Cabinet model, then into a premiership one 2 . The leader of the party that holds the majority after the national general election becomes the head of the executive. This role confers considerable powers on him or her. For example, the Prime Minister appoints and dismisses ministers and proposes the dissolution of the House of Commons to the Queen. In recent British history (except in 1974), the winning party has always enjoyed an absolute majority in this chamber thanks to the single-round, single-member, first-past-the-post electoral system. The House of Lords, on the other hand, is not elected and is not directly involved in Government 2 Caravale , G. (1997), passim . ",
        "301 activity 3 . A strong role is given to the leader of the losing party, who enjoys certain privileges as Leader of the Opposition and the chair of the Shadow Cabinet, in which the Opposition prepares its alternative government. 1.1.1 The evolution of regionalisation/federalisation procedures and decentralisation processes. The most recent institutional developments In recent years, the constitutional structure of the United Kingdom has undergone profound changes as a result of devolution, which has shown itself to be a broad, wide-ranging process, rather than a one-off event 4 . The subject of devolution, meaning the conferment of powers on territorial bodies within the Kingdom, is not a recent phenomenon, but has been a recurrent political theme in the country\u2019s history, although it has only been in the late 1990s and the first few years of the new century that there have actually been significant moves in this direction. A number of political changes at national level were very important to this process. During the last years of the Conservative government, devolution had effectively been removed from the political agenda 5 . It was only the policy work of the Labour Party and its electoral success in 1997 that permitted the process of institutional 3 The upper house is made up of hereditary members and, since 1958, of members nominated for life by the Monarch on proposals from the Government. A committee of the House of Lords, made up of the Law Lords, carries out the role of an appeal court in civil and criminal cases. 4 See Davies, R. (1998); Hazell, R, Young, S, according to whom there is no reason to believe that the changes that have taken place in the last three years will not continue. It is certainly possible that the powers devolved to these regions could be extended or reduced over time. 5 See Hogwood, B.(1995), 267 ff. ",
        "302 transformation to be set in motion 6 . In 1998, the Westminister Parliament, thanks to a sizeable Labour majority and the action of Prime Minister Blair, passed the Scotland Act, the Government of Wales Act and the Northern Ireland Act, and, the following year, the Greater London Authority Act. This had a significant impact both on the structure of local and regional government and on the country\u2019s constitution itself. The introduction of devolution into the British system has had a significant impact on the fundamental laws that used to govern the Kingdom. The Acts passed by the Westminster Parliament have significantly altered the structure of government in the United Kingdom and have undermined the basis of the supremacy of the national Parliament. Scotland and Wales initially pursued similar political and legal paths. In 1997, the outcome of popular referendums in those two parts of the United Kingdom favoured the creation of parliaments which would be autonomous of London. In Scotland, the vote in favour was decisive, at 74.5% 7 of votes cast, but reached just 50.3% in 6 The Labour Party manifesto New Labour, New Life for Britain referred to institutional reform, including, among other things, devolution. Specifically, this meant conferring greater legislative and administrative powers on Wales and Scotland, which, as stated in the White Paper on Scotland\u2019s Parliament , are \u201cregions with strong national identity\u201d. When the Labour government took office, it made a commitment to launch the process of devolution of powers to a Welsh and a Scottish Parliament, and to provide for an overhaul of regional arrangements in Britain and of the structures of regional and local authorities. See Morrison, J., (2001); Blackburn, R., Plant, R. (Eds) (1999) . 7 Unlike Wales, turnout was very high (60.1%), handing a comfortable victory to the pro- devolutionists. The nearly four million people entitled to vote were also asked to vote in a second referendum on local taxation. On this second question, only 63.5% voted to give the Scottish Parliament tax-varying powers. ",
        "303 Wales 8 ; the results allowed the process of passing the respective Acts on devolution to be speeded up. Following this phase, the devolution process in the two parts of the country developed in very different ways. The content of the laws passed by the Parliament in London set out the different levels of autonomy that would be granted to those two \u201cregions\u201d of the United Kingdom. According to the provisions of the Scotland Act, the Scottish Parliament is empowered to pass primary legislation on certain devolved matters, and can therefore pass its own Acts on matters that are not reserved for the central legislature. In addition, it can adopt secondary (also known as delegated or subordinate) legislation in those same areas of primary legislative competence. The Edinburgh Parliament, which began work on 1 July 1999, can therefore legislate, among other things, on education, local government, tourism, economic development, sport and agriculture, as well as in connection with both civil and criminal law. This latter power also reflects the existence of an independent legal system and judiciary (Scots law). In Wales, devolution has taken a very different form. The Welsh Assembly does not have legislative powers, but has the power to adopt delegated legislation on devolved matters, such as health, education, culture, agriculture, tourism, transport, and development. The level of autonomy granted to the National Assembly for Wales is even more limited if the relationship with the Welsh Office in London is taken into 8 In Wales, a little more than 50% of the 2.2 million electors entitled to do so took part. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, Wales, unlike Scotland, has never really had a history of independence. Secondly, the southern part of Wales is heavily anglicised, to the extent that the people of South Wales are referred to as \u201cWenglish\u201d. It was these latter, fearing that the \u201cpure\u201d Welsh would leave them a minority in a Welsh parliament, who helped to reduce the participation in the vote, despite it being supported by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Welsh nationalists. ",
        "304 consideration. Recently, however, an independent commission was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Richard to identify areas for improvement in the limited autonomy of Wales, with particular reference to the lack of primary legislative powers. This commission completed its work at the end of 2003. Moreover, the very institutional structure of the type of government provided for in the 1998 Act is undergoing noticeable changes. There is an increasing separation of powers between the Assembly and the Assembly Secretaries; these latter are often incorrectly referred to as Ministers, and the Executive Committee, as it should be called by law, is often simply called the Welsh Cabinet 9 . The situation in Northern Ireland cannot be compared to the other two \"regions\" that benefited from the process of devolution in 1998. The considerable social and political problems in this part of the country meant that it was not possible to follow the same route of setting up and empowering institutions without first having reached a peace agreement between the government in London, the Nationalists, and the Unionists. The historical events linked to Home Rule have over the years paved a tortuous road to the present situation, as the most recent developments have demonstrated. In 1998, an agreement (known as the Good Friday Agreement or Belfast Agreement) was reached that enabled real devolution to begin. This was signed by the British government and the main local political parties, and was then the subject of a popular referendum in which 71.1% of voters supported the multilateral agreement. Devolution was enshrined in the Northern Ireland Act 1998, on the basis of which the Northern Ireland Assembly received the power to adopt primary and delegated 9 Hazell, R., 3-4. ",
        "305 legislation in respect of some matters that were not reserved for the Westminister Parliament. However, the devolution process was suspended in October 2002, a year after the Assembly was set up, because the British government lost confidence in Sinn Fein following an episode of spying and the departure of the nationalist party from the regional government. From that moment, the devolved institutions were suspended, and this crisis was not resolved in time for May 2003, when Prime Minister Blair, faced with the non-compliance with the agreement by nationalist forces, postponed the Assembly elections 10 . Devolution, then, is a complex and diverse process. Far from being concluded by a single act of legislation, it requires constant, ongoing political support. This does not just apply to situations such as Northern Ireland, where considerable tensions exist, but also to other areas. The most striking characteristic of devolution in the United Kingdom is the very varied nature of the forms of autonomy granted by the central government. The powers that have been conferred vary both qualitatively and quantitatively, which has led to an \u201casymmetrical process of devolving powers\u201d 11 . In addition to the differences in the prescribed doses of devolved powers, fundamental differences in the way devolution has been experienced in different areas of the United Kingdom arise from the nature of the driving force behind it: in Scotland and Wales, this had a national focus, whereas in Northern Ireland, it was compounded with a religious element. 10 In May 2003, elections should have been held for the Northern Ireland Assembly, following six months of inactivity of that body due to the intensification of terrorist activities in the country. However, Prime Minister Blair postponed the elections due to the strong disagreements with Sinn F\u00e9in and the IRA concerning the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. 11 See Bradbury, J., Mitchell, J. (2002) 299 ff. ",
        "306 In London, the experience was again different. Here, the demand for autonomy was born out of a break with the centralised model of government, with a view to moving towards regional rather than national power, including for England. (See paragraph I.3.) The process of change in the British system of government is beginning to include England in the logic of devolution, with proposals for reforming its territorial government. As early as 1998, Parliament adopted the Regional Development Agencies Act, which created the nine regions of the country, each one having a development agency appointed by the Government. In 2000, the UK Parliament passed the Local Government Act. Where England was concerned, this piece of national legislation covered the County Councils, the District Councils, the London Borough Councils, the Common Council of the City of London, as well as the Scilly Islands Council; in Wales, it covered the County Councils and the Borough Councils. The Local Government Act 2000 gave local authorities (i.e. those described in paragraph I) the power to pursue whatever activities they considered necessary to the economic, social and environmental improvement and promotion of their own area. It also set out the regulatory framework for the aspects relating to the organisation and powers discussed below in part II. A decisive step was taken in July 2002 with the White Paper on Regional Governance, Your Region, Your Choice , published by the Government, which provided for the possibility, for those regions who wanted it, of directly electing their respective Assemblies. The White Paper was published in May 2002 and, in the following months, was the subject of a heated debate between the government in ",
        "307 London and the interested parties. These latter were able to submit their comments and views to the central government on the draft reforms and the proposed stages. However, the problems that the White Paper faces in building an English regional model seem to be significant. Firstly, the proposals seem to give limited economic resources to territorial bodies; furthermore, a reform of this type will necessarily have an impact on the interests of local government and of big cities. The destiny of the English regionalisation project is therefore highly uncertain 12 . The White Paper provided for a specific political process divided into several phases: the first involved a survey to assess how interested the public was in regionalisation; thus, this step of consulting the relevant population was introduced in addition to the model that had previously been applied to devolution. Only, subsequently, might there be a phase involving a full-scale referendum. Only if the referendum gave a positive result would Parliament then act to pass a law regulating the new Regional Assemblies. Following the results of telematic surveys 13 , the referendums provided for by law will be held in only three regions in the north of England. In the autumn of 2004, referendums will he held in the North East; Yorkshire and the Humber; and the North West, where the public will be asked to vote on the creation of an elected Regional Assembly with powers over (among other things) employment, public health, transport, culture, tourism, and sport. 12 See the Devolution Briefing on The English Regions Debate: What do the English Want?, 3 July 2003, part of the research programme on Devolution and Constitutional Change, op. cit. The text collates the various expectations expressed by the citizens of the eight English regions with regard to referendums. 13 cfr. www.local-regions.odpm.gov.uk/consult/region-assembly/01htm ",
        "308 The Assembly will be an opportunity, according to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, for the regional community to participate in decisions that affect it. The Assembly will be elected by a proportional system, which, whilst not breaking with the UK\u2019s majoritarian tradition, will make it much more representative and thus better able to carry out its intended role as a place for participation. It is foreseen that the elected body will be able to use a progressively increasing budget made available by the Government. Initially, this will be around \u00a3350 billion, in line with current by central government spending, and will then rise to a higher figure. However, it is not public spending that is the major issue here, because what is really new about the creation of a democratically-elected Regional Assembly is that policies that are currently under complete control of central government would in future be pursued with the participation of the communities they affect. The issues that the Assembly will deal with are: employment, housing policy, urban planning, transport, health, tourism, sport, and the environment. The new Assembly will have to comprise at least 25 members, a sufficient number to be able to represent the various parts of the region. The proportional electoral system will most probably ensure political pluralism and avoid the risk that a single party will have overall control of the assembly. If this were to happen, it would change the functions of the assembly itself, which is to be set up precisely to increase the level of participation and policy-sharing in the field. The intention of central government is both to encourage the participation of all political and cultural players, and also to avoid disproportionate representation of different cities and localities. All citizens resident in the region who have reached the age of 21 will be entitled to vote. The assembly will have a four-year term. Setting up the Assembly will cost the UK Treasury about \u00a325 million per year, \u00a35 million of which will be the costs of transferring existing staff to other offices, whilst ",
        "309 the remainder relates to elected members' expenses, the cost of elections, and the additional staff to be taken on. Part of the costs will be covered by a tax; the remaining costs will be borne by central Government. It is expected that the proposed regionalising reforms will have a significant impact on the level of democratic legitimacy of regional politics, in that it would for the first time enable voters \u2013 who are also the users and the beneficiaries of public services \u2013 to express an opinion on their performance through the ballot box. In addition, the Assembly would be able to give a voice to the region\u2019s interests at national level. Based on the example of what has happened in those parts of the UK where devolution has taken place, central government believes it possible that means may be devised for regional communities to take part in the decisions of their elected bodies (Civic Forums, involving representatives of local government and economic players). 1.1.2 Relations between central government and the regional/local levels of government The developing relations between the UK's various governing bodies are not governed by legislation \u2013 with the exceptions set out below; devolved/central government relations are not even mentioned in the devolution acts. This runs counter to the requirements for links between institutions that have become apparent wherever territorial pluralism has been introduced, and also opens the way to the adoption of informal instruments in the system of inter-governmental relations. ",
        "310 As has been seen, the actions of central government were not radically changed by the devolution process in the early years of its implementation 14 . Other than the instruments put in place by the Agreement relating to Northern Ireland, including the North-South Ministerial Conference and the British-Irish Council, a relationship between the United Kingdom and the devolved institutions has been established through the annual plenary meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee (every October). There have also been some specific JMCs, not least those relating to Europe. As has been said, therefore, with reference to each institution and to every single instrument of inter-governmental relations, the United Kingdom clearly remains the dominant partner. Looking at the legislative texts on devolution, one can find just a few references to inter-governmental relations. For example, the Scotland Act states that functions that are exercisable within devolved competence shall be exercisable by the Scottish Ministers instead of by a Minister of the Crown (Section 53). On the other hand, if the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that any action proposed to be taken by a member of the Scottish Executive would be incompatible with any international obligations, he may by order direct that the proposed action shall not be taken. Conversely, both for Scotland and for Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State may order that any action that is required for the purpose of giving effect to international obligations shall be taken. The Secretary of State may also revoke subordinate legislation that is incompatible with any international obligations or the interests of defence or national security. 14 Hazell, R.,7-8. ",
        "311 Furthermore, outside of the framework of devolved powers, by virtue of an Order in Council, provisions can be made such that any function that can be exercised by a Scottish Minister may be exercised (a) by the Scottish Ministers instead of a Minister of the Crown, or (b) by both concurrently, or (c) by the Minister of the Crown only with the agreement of, or after consultation with, the Scottish Ministers. 1.1.3 Local authority cooperation and associations The relationships between local authorities in the United Kingdom, in the context of a unitary state, have undergone significant developments in recent years, not least as a result of the increased role of those authorities. They belong to the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents them along similar lines to those in many more decentralised countries. This association was formed in April 1997, and represents local authorities in England and Wales, of which there are around 500 in total. The aim of the Association is to promote better local government (http://www.lga.gov.uk/home.asp). Still on the subject of relations between local institutions, considering that the country has a less rich experience of this than elsewhere in Europe, the Local Government Act 2000 provides for the possibility of a function of a particular institution being exercised by another. In this case, which applies to relations both between institutions and between bodies within them, provision is made for the Secretary of State to make provisions within the law. The conditions that may require the transfer of functions are based on objective factors (such as the size of the authority) and contingent historical situations. ",
        "312 1.1.4 The evolution of the metropolitan government model: the role of the metropolitan cities With the Greater London Authority Bill of 1999, the Westminster Parliament provided for radical reform of the government of London. This was a reaction to the centralising tendency of the previous years and gave the capital of the Kingdom the power to govern itself in a number of areas strategic to its development. Following the reform carried out by means of the Greater London Authority Bill, Londoners are thus now able to directly elect their Mayor and the Assembly, the Greater London Authority (GLA). The system for electing the Mayor allows for a second preference vote: that is, the elector can put down a second choice after the first. In the event that no candidate achieves 50% + 1 in the first round, the second preference votes are counted to determine the winner. The form of government provides for the division of powers between the Mayor and the Assembly, which has 25 members. From the point of view of doctrine, there is a very strong link between the process of devolution that has been taking place for a few years in the United Kingdom and developments in its capital. In the case of London, as has already been said, institutional reforms have been carried out not in response to nationalist or religious demands, but rather as part of the national government\u2019s vision of regionalisation. Indeed, it is not inconceivable that other large cities in the United Kingdom may also come to enjoy similar forms of autonomy. The autonomy conferred on London means that it now has administrative powers within its territory over transport, security, economic development, the environment, health, culture, and planning. The powers of the Mayor in this area are however very limited. This is the case not so much because of the balancing of his powers with ",
        "313 those of the Assembly (which acts as a counterweight), but rather due to the power of central government and the London boroughs. The central government is able to have significant influence on the policies of the London Mayor, as was demonstrated by recent events in the area of transport 15 , both because most of the London authority\u2019s finance comes from the state, and because central government still holds considerable powers on devolved issues. 1.2 The political and social players in the regionalisation/federalisation processes. The role of political parties and of other forms of associations The party political system of the United Kingdom is largely structured around the two major national parties, the Labour Party and the Conservative Party. There is also a third, smaller party, the Liberals. At the last two general elections (1997 and 2001), the Labour Party defeated the Tories and formed a single-party government without the support of the Liberals. As has already been highlighted, the political parties have played a crucial role in the devolution process, as Tony Blair\u2019s Labour has put great emphasis on institutional reform, as is clear from the 1997 and 2001 manifestos. The attitude of the Conservatives has been different. Under Mrs Thatcher\u2019s government, there was a refusal to envisage devolutionary experiments 16 . They have often opposed devolutionary processes in parliament and in referendums. Although 15 For more details on this, particularly with specific reference to financial policies in London, see Martino, P (2002), p. 1457 ff. 16 See Local Government Act 1985. ",
        "314 there are historical reasons for their weakness here, the Tories are significantly under- represented in the devolved Assemblies when compared to the national level. This is not true of New Labour (see part II.1). Nonetheless, regional political parties also played an important role in the devolution process, both when they developed largely nationalist, secessionist policies, and when they became less extremist supporters of devolved institutions (see paragraph I.2). In contrast to the nationwide political battle along the Labour-Tory axis, the Scottish and Welsh assemblies, which the Labour Party controls, have seen the Lab-Lib coalitions opposed by the respective nationalist parties (the SNP in Scotland and Plaid Cymru in Wales), while the Conservatives have never played a significant political role. 1.2.1 Regional organisation of political parties and movements The national political parties are present and operate in the territories affected by devolution, albeit with very different levels of support. Where they are present, these parties present themselves as component parts of the respective Westminster-based parties, but they try to emphasise their regional nature 17 . In Scotland, for example, there are the Scottish Conservative Party, the Scottish Labour Party and the Scottish Liberal Democrats; similarly, Wales also has the Welsh Labour Party, the Welsh Conservative Party and the Welsh Liberal Democrats. 17 See Devolution Briefings: The Elections in Scotland and Wales : What\u2019s at Stake? within the research programme Devolution and Constitutional Change , which states that the devolution process begun in 1997 has brought about lasting structural change to the British political system. However, \u201cthe traditions of Westminster government and the disproportionate focus those traditions bring on politics as seen from London can all too easily obscure the extent of change.\u201d (p.1). ",
        "315 The Labour Party, compared to the others, is characterised by its strong grassroots ties in Wales and Scotland, such that it is able to formulate its own, independent policy programme on employment and development, for example, in the Welsh party. The fact remains, however, as is stated in the documents of the Scottish party, that the latter \u201cis an integral part of the British Labour Party\u201d, whose rules and values it shares. Moreover, in common with the national party, the Scottish organisation also has strong links, on a local basis, with the trade unions (see paragraph 3). In Northern Ireland, given the particular situation in which national political forces have to operate, the London parties are not present, except in very different forms or with very little electoral support. The latter is the case of the Conservative Party, which has had close links with the Westminster Conservatives since 1972, but is almost non-existent in electoral terms (see part II). 1.2.2 Regional parties The presence of regional parties can be analysed at two different levels of government: local and national. Locally, the political system of each of the territories that have benefited from devolution has created its own party system, or else has strengthened the pre-existing structure. ",
        "316 Thus, thanks in part to the Assemblies\u2019 partly proportional electoral system 18 , a very great number of regional (or local) parties have come into existence, only some of which have succeeded in being elected to the Assemblies. Although they do not often get their representatives elected, these are nonetheless building a framework of inter- party relations that is profoundly different from the national one 19 . The number of parties that could be classified as regional is thus very large if one looks only at local elections; however, at national level, this number falls significantly, because very few of them are of national relevance and succeed in obtaining seats in the Westminster Parliament (see part II). It is also worth noting that, in order to take part in elections (including those to the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly), political parties must be registered in accordance with the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998. In comparison to the high number of political parties listed on the register, the number of those that actually have significant electoral support or get elected to the Assemblies is very small. 18 The electoral systems for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly are mixed. A quota of Assembly members is elected by the first-past-the post system in single-member constituencies in a single round of voting. The remainder are elected by proportional representation based on votes cast for party lists or independent candidates. In the first-past- the-post element, voters choose between single candidates from the respective parties. For the proportional element, each registered party submits a list of names (maximum 12, minimum 1), and the available seats are contested on a regional basis. There are firm exclusion clauses concerning candidatures in multiple constituencies or regions; it is also forbidden to stand in a single-member constituency at the same time as featuring on a regional list. ) If a party\u2019s regional list has been exhausted (the candidates being elected in the order in which the party placed them on the list), that party no longer participates in the allocation of seats. Where the seat of a constituency member is vacant, an election shall be held. Where the seat of a regional member is vacant, it will be filled by the next candidate on the list. 19 See Saitz, M. (1999), passim . ",
        "317 In Wales, in contrast to the other two autonomous regions created in 1998, the party political landscape is very similar to that at national level, and the only significant local party is Plaid Cymru. Alongside this, there are the Welsh Labour Party, the Welsh Conservative Party and the Welsh Liberal Democrats, the regional manifestations of the respective London-based parties. The Party of Wales 20 came into existence in 1925. Its objective is to improve the constitutional status of Wales, with the ultimate aim of Wales becoming a fully- fledged Member State of the European Union. It also seeks to ensure economic prosperity, social justice, and the health of the natural environment, based, as stated in its Constitution, \u201con decentralist socialism\u201d. In its 2003 manifesto for the Assembly elections, Plaid Cymru firmly opposed the policies of the Lab-Lib majority that ran the region from 1999, and, whilst judging the process of devolution in itself to be positive, it highlighted the undeveloped potential of that process. In Scotland, the situation is somewhat different. Whilst the national parties still get most of the votes, there is a strong regional party (the Scottish National Party), which also has seats in London, and a number of small but rapidly-growing parties, including the Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP). The Scottish National Party is, as its constitution states, a \u201cdemocratic left-of-centre political party\u201d. It was founded in 1934 with the aim of making Scotland an independent nation in the mainstream of modern Europe. In its seventy years of political activity, the SNP claims to have brought Scotland from being \u201can almost totally unionist country to a nation on the brink of independence.\u201d In any case, the 20 Article 1 of the party\u2019s Constitution says \u201c The party shall be called 'Plaid Cymru - The Party of Wales' \u201d. The party also has four MPs at Westminster and two MEPs. ",
        "318 nationalists sit on the opposition benches in the Parliament, but continue to fight vigorously for Scottish independence. At the last elections to the Edinburgh Parliament (see Part II), both the Greens and the SSP significantly increased their share of the vote, at the expense of Labour and the SNP. The SSP, which has come into existence only very recently, fights for an independent Scotland, but from a different perspective from that of the nationalists. Under the inspiration of socialism, they hope that Scotland will become part of an international anti-capitalist network. In Northern Ireland, the political landscape is very much shaped by the division between Unionists and Nationalists. The UK-wide political parties are unable to integrate the region's political dynamic. The largest Unionist party is the Ulster Unionist Party (U.U.P.) 21 , whose leader since 1995, David Trimble, is First Minister of Northern Ireland. The main aims of this party are keeping the \u201cregion\u201d under the Crown as an integral part of the United Kingdom, to support the democratic institutions of government, and to safeguard the British citizenship of the residents of Northern Ireland. This party worked closely together with the Conservatives in London, until the latter, when they were in government, signed the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, resulting in the links being severed. The other main Unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (D.U.P.) 22 , founded in 1970, is the principal opponent of the Agreement 23 . There are other, smaller, Unionist 21 See their website at www.uup.org. 22 See their website at www.dup.org.uk . 23 See the 2001 Parliamentary and District Council Election Manifesto , which attacks Prime Minister Blair and the UUP in some detail. ",
        "319 parties, such as the United Kingdom Unionist Party (U.K.U.P.) 24 , which is against the Agreement, but which split following the actions of some of its leaders, who founded another small Unionist party (NIUP) 25 . The nationalist side is represented by Gerry Adams\u2019 Sinn F\u00e9in (SF) 26 , which has been the largest nationalist party since 2001, when its support overtook that of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). The leader of this latter party, Mark Durkan, is Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland. Sinn F\u00e9in is a republican, socialist party that aspires to represent the Irish people and demands the end of British rule in Northern Ireland. It also defines itself as nationalist and internationalist, and initially supported the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, but wants a united Ireland. Aside from numerous other small parties, there is the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, which has the special characteristic of being a \u201ccross-community\u201d party 27 , a Green party, and a party which, although it calls itself Labour, has no relationship with the national party of the same name. With reference to the political forces present in the GLA, apart from the unique phenomenon of Mayor Livingstone (a Labour dissident who stood as an independent candidate), the Assembly is made up of the traditional political parties: Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberals and, additionally, the Greens. These parties, partly because of the form of government in the city, which relegates the assembly to a secondary role, do not really have an identity separate from the national party. 24 See their website at www.ukup.org. 25 See their website at www.niup.org. 26 See their website at www.sinnfein.ie. 27 See their website at www.allianceparty.org . ",
        "320 1.3 The importance of cooperation and social dialogue As is well known, the scope for autonomous political action by the trade unions in the United Kingdom has repeatedly been diminished by the role played by political parties. This is particularly true of the Labour Party, which was born out of the trade union movement and maintains a direct relationship with it to this day 28 . This phenomenon was also repeated at local government level in the areas of the country that were affected by devolution. Looking at the experience of the Scottish Labour Party, its political literature makes clear the strong links between itself and the Scottish trade unions. Specifically, the party structure provides for a Scottish Trade Union Labour Party Committee, made up of representatives of the trade unions affiliated to Labour, in order to coordinate policy on social issues. Furthermore, many members of local trade unions have been elected to the Scottish Parliament, which confirms the integration of the unions\u2019 political activities into those of representative parties 29 . 28 For an historical analysis of this relationship, including from the perspective of devolution, see Lang, M.S. (2001). Trade unions formally came into existence following the repeal of the Combination Law (1824-1825), which outlawed workers\u2019 organisations. However, the development of de facto associations and increasing social tension led to the prohibition being lifted. In 1869, the Labour Representative League (the precursor to the Labour Party) was formed. This had its first MPs elected to the House of Commons in 1874. The Labour Party itself was not formed until 1900. 29 The Scottish Labour Party and its affiliated trade unions have pursued joint policies on economic and social issues at a local level, leading the Scottish Parliament to approve the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit and the minimum wage. See the meetings between the ",
        "321 The Scottish case is the most interesting one to analyse, compared with other experiences of devolution. In comparison to Wales, Scotland not only has greater powers, but also a different socio-economic structure 30 . Wales\u2019s development has been heavily influenced by the rapid process of the \u201csecond de-industrialisation\u201d, whose effects are being mitigated by increasing public sector employment and by the use of European funds. Scotland, on the other hand, has chosen to build a knowledge economy, which it is doing with the close involvement of the social forces in Parliament and outside it. In London, too, which enjoys a far lesser degree of autonomy, the issues of social and economic development are part of local politics, as the 2003-2004 Action Plan of the Corporation of London\u2019s Economic Development Team shows. The functions devolved to the city\u2019s government also include economic development and health, albeit with the strict limits outlined above. The London authority therefore has policies to support both SMEs and large multinationals. II. DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AT REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL 2.1 Voting in national and regional/local elections At national level, the 2001 general election, which the Prime Minister called in order to exploit a moment where his political support was high, confirmed the landslide victory that Labour had achieved in the 1997 election, leaving the Tories in opposition. 30 See Cooke, P. (2000), passim . ",
        "322 Of the 659 MPs in the House of Commons, there are currently 409 Labour MPs, 163 Conservatives, and 54 Liberal Democrats. In addition, there are small groups of unionists (11 in total) and the nine representatives of the nationalist parties (the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru). The four Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, who have not taken up their seats at Westminster, are a special case. Turnout in 2001 was very low. Only 59.4% of those entitled to vote did so. Among the youngest members of the electorate, the figure was below 40%. Already in 1997, turnout was 71%, the lowest level since 1935, but four years later the rate of abstention rose by 12%, bringing turnout below that in 1918, during wartime. In European elections, the turnout is even lower: in 1999, the figure was just 23% 31 . Compared to 1995, in the 1999 elections to the European Parliament the gap between the Conservatives and Labour narrowed. The latter lost almost 15 percentage points, compared to 42% in the previous elections, whereas the Conservatives, with 35.8%, gained 9 points. Support for the Liberals, at 12.7%, was also down on five years previously. The Greens, who had previously been absent from the electoral landscape, did well with 6.7%, while the Scottish nationalists received 2.7% of the vote nationally, and Plaid Cymru 1.9%. The Conservatives were allocated 36 seats, Labour 29, the Liberals 10, the nationalists five and the Greens two. If the data is analysed on a regional basis, turnout in Wales was considerably higher, with almost 30% of the electorate going to the polls. The June 1999 elections to the European Parliament saw a reduction in the gap between Labour and the Conservatives, which nonetheless remained significant, with the parties receiving 32 31 It is a matter of record that this is \u201ca lower percentage of UK population than those who voted in the phone ballot for the final episode of Channel 4\u2019s Big Brother game show\u201d (The Independent Commission on Alternative Voting Methods, Election in 21 st Century: from paper ballot to E-voting, p. 16). ",
        "323 and 22.7% of the vote respectively. Plaid Cymru asserted itself as the second biggest party, with 30%, whilst the Liberals got just 18%. Turnout in Scotland, on the other hand, was lower, with just one elector in four casting a ballot. Here, as in Wales, the real contest was between the Labour Party and the nationalists, in this case the SNP (28.7% and 27% respectively). The Conservatives and Unionists received less than 20% of the vote, while the Scottish Liberals got 10%. The Scottish Greens received a flattering 5.8%, whilst other minor parties failed to receive any significant support. In Northern Ireland, on the other hand, turnout at the last European elections was above 57%, far higher than other areas of the UK. Votes were distributed among the Unionists (28.4% for the DUP and 17.6% for the UUP). The SDLP received a little more than 28% of the vote, while Sinn F\u00e9in got 17%. Turnout at local elections, at around 28-30%., is barely higher, leading some researchers to suggest that we are facing a \u201ccrisis in British democracy\u201d 32 . In May 2003, there were elections to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Compared to the previous elections, the party political landscape did not change significantly, despite the fall in votes for both Labour, who along with the Liberals held the majority in the previous parliament, and the nationalists, who were the official opposition. Prime Minister Blair\u2019s party now has 50 MSPs, six fewer than were elected in the first elections in 1999. The SNP also lost eight seats, and now has 27 members in the devolved parliament. The votes that were lost did not, however, go to the other two traditional UK political parties. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives held on to the same number of seats they had had in the previous parliament, with 17 and 18 MSPs respectively. Instead, two parties that had previously been tiny minorities on the Scottish political scene 32 Ralling, C., Thrasher, M. (2000) ",
        "324 saw their support increase significantly. These were the Scottish Green Party and the Scottish Socialist Party. Each of these had just one MSP in the previous parliament, but they now have 7 and 6 respectively. The Lib-Lab majority that was formed after the 1999 elections has thus been significantly weakened. It now has 67 MSPs, giving it an overall majority of just one. In the Welsh Assembly, half of the sixty seats went to the Labour Party, which gained one seat compared to the 1999 result. As in Scotland, the Liberal Democrats maintained their share of the vote and kept their six members of the assembly, while Plaid Cymru lost four seats (12 compared to 16 previously). The Conservatives gained two seats, making their total 11, while another went to an independent. In May 2000, Greater London voted in elections for a self-government body. The Mayor was directly elected, as were the 25 members of the Assembly. Ken Livingstone, a Labour dissident who had stood as an independent against the candidate of Blair\u2019s party, won the mayoral election. \u201cRed Ken\u201d, as he was nicknamed on account of his position to the left of New Labour, received 39% of the vote. The other candidates were widely spaced out. Norris, the Conservative candidate, came second with 27%, followed by Dobson (Labour) on 13% and Kramer (Liberal Democrat) on 12%. As none of the candidates exceeded 50% of the vote, the two leading candidates had the second preference votes of electors who had voted for their opponents added to theirs. Each elector had two votes, the first of which would determine either the winner or who would go through to the second round; and a second to choose the candidate who was \u201cleast far\u201d from his political views, in case his first choice of candidate was not successful. Thus, Livingstone received 178,809 votes in addition to the 677,000 he received in the first round, whilst the Conservative candidate received ",
        "325 188,000 in addition to his 464,000 first round votes. The Labour dissident was thus elected with a majority of over 200,000. Voter behaviour in this dual vote mechanism is worthy of separate analysis. If the first and second preferences are added together, the candidate who came second, Norris, obtained fewer votes than the Liberal Democrat candidate (564,000 against 607,000). The latter received many of the second preferences of Conservative voters, but also some of those of Labour voters who were reluctant to vote, even in the second round, for \u201cRed Ken\u201d. On the other hand, only a tiny proportion of the victor\u2019s 667,000 second preference votes went to Labour; Dobson received just 200,000 of them. Many of these probably went to the Greens, who, having received just 38,000 first preference votes, got 192,000 in the second round. The Assembly elections, on the other hand, gave a much more balanced picture, with nine of the 25 seats going to Labour, the same number to the Conservatives, four to the Liberals and three to the Greens. The case of Northern Ireland deserves separate analysis, because the elections scheduled for May 2003 did not take place due to the events mentioned above. In this part of the country, the share of the vote is highly fragmented. The two Unionist parties received 21% (UUP) and 18% (DUP), with the first receiving 28 seats and the second, 20. These cannot be taken as a single group given their differing positions on the Belfast Agreement. The largest share of the vote went to the Social Democratic and Labour Party (with 22% of the vote and 24 seats), whilst the nationalist Sinn F\u00e9in obtained 17.6% and 18 seats. Smaller shares of the vote went to two other Unionist parties (UKUP, 4.5% and 5 seats; PUP, 2.5% and 2 seats), whilst the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland received 6.5% of the vote and six seats. With regard to turnout in the elections to the \u201cregional\u201d assemblies, that in Scotland was a little less than 50% in 2003, compared to 58% four years earlier. In Wales, too, ",
        "326 turnout in the Assembly elections fell. At the last elections, just 38% of Welsh voters turned out, compared to 46% on the previous occasion. It is also interesting to compare data for Westminster constituencies in the individual areas affected by devolution with data for the respective assemblies. In the 2001 general election, Wales sent 46 Labour MPs to Westminster, compared to five Conservatives and three Liberal Democrats. Scotland elected 63 Labour members, 13 Liberal Democrats, and seven nationalists. Northern Ireland\u2019s constituencies elected a large number of Unionists and Nationalists. Moving on to local elections, it should be noted that turnout in council elections is even lower than for general elections. After the 2003 elections, Labour controlled 57 councils, having lost 17 and gained just one. Conversely, the Conservatives gained 17 (and lost just one), increasing the number of councils they controlled to around 30, but with their total number of councillors far exceeding that of Labour. 2.2 Forms and instruments of direct democracy National referendums are rarely held in Britain. The will of the people is expressed largely, if not exclusively, in national elections, and does not leave much room for the use of instruments of direct democracy, although the heavy use of opinion polls does have a significant influence on the political life of the country. At local level, on the other hand, referendums are often used, particularly with regard to local government. Apart from the role played by the referendums on devolution (see Part I), the London boroughs and local authorities have called referendums to sound out public opinion on specific local issues. The recent Local Government Act 2000 provides for a series of circumstances where a referendum may be held. Leaving aside consultations on the organisation of the ",
        "327 executive (Section 25 of the Act, see point I.2 above), provision is made for referendums following a petition (Section 35), a direction (Section 36) or an order (Section 37). 2.3 Community identification with regional and local government With regard to the population\u2019s sense of belonging to its respective local authority area, the analysis should be carried out both with reference to the situation before devolution and to that since the creation (and development) of the respective elected assemblies. In order to answer the first of these two questions, some researchers have suggested analysing the electoral data from each region from the referendum on the creation of the assembly and the turnout in the subsequent national and local elections 33 . This would show that in Wales, the proportion of the electorate in favour of an elected assembly had increased significantly in relation to those who preferred not to have such a body. Some researchers state that the impact of the creation and operation of the Assemblies has been to strengthen the sense of regional identity, particularly in areas where that identity was relatively weak, as was the case in Wales. On the other hand, a sense of national identity developed on a civic rather than ethnic basis, thanks to the fact that these bodies worked to develop social policies. As has become clear, there is a clear difference between the Scottish sense of belonging and the Welsh one 34 . According to some data, 33.7% of Scots feel 33 See Wyn Jones, R., Scully, R. (2003). ",
        "328 \u201cScottish and not British\u201d, whereas only 18% of the Welsh opt firmly for their own identity rather than that of the UK 35 . There is another statistical difference between the two regions. 35.6% of Scots feel \u201cmore Scottish than British\u201d (against 20% of Welsh people), and only 23% give equal weight to their Scottish and British identities. In Wales, however, almost 40% of the population feels equally Welsh and British. The same statistics show that only 10% of Scots and 3% of Welsh people are in favour of independence both from the United Kingdom and from the European Union, whilst 18% and 2% respectively would like independence from the motherland whilst remaining inside the European Union. Finally, the absolute majority of Scots is in favour of the elected Parliament with tax- raising powers, whereas only 25% of Welsh people would be in favour of such an assembly. The Welsh would appear to be much more \u201ctied\u201d to the United Kingdom, as only 38% are satisfied with the recently created Assembly, and fully 27% think that they could do without it. III. REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 3.1 The constitutional framework (economic and financial aspects) The concept of economic constitution in Great Britain is identified more with \u201clegislative public opinion\u201d, defined by the constitutionalist Albert Dicey at the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s as being the sum total of the institutions and 34 Ardensen,R. , passim 35 Ardensen, R., 2. ",
        "329 legislative rationes that make up the connective tissue of a certain section of public law that has a bearing on the economy, rather than in a specific constitutional law 36 . Thus, defining the British constitutional framework with respect to the economic and financial constitution means defining the scope and the extent of public law that affects the economy. Incidentally, this is a question that has often been asked regarding economic development at regional and local level in recent times, particularly in the light of the progressive increase in legislation following the arrival of the Labour government, led by Tony Blair 37 , after the Thatcher era. The laws governing the economic and financial constitution in Great Britain are made up both of Statutes \u2013 that is, primary legislation passed by Parliament \u2013 and of administrative instruments issued by the Government (such as licences ) and by sectoral authorities, in addition, of course, to the jurisprudential rules of common law 38 . At the same time, the option of intervening in the economy can be exercised both with ordinary social aims (from information regulation to private regulation), and in order to develop economic regulation, which represents, and has represented, a significant part of Great Britain\u2019s recent interventions in its economy 39 . Thus, following on from the era of nationalisations, when government control over public corporations was quite invasive, came the Thatcher era, during which the polemic against \u201cbig government\u201d led, through fifteen years of strong, decisive policies of deregulation and privatisation, to a market economy. This was followed 36 This becomes clear also with respect to the same use of this terminology by teachers and researchers, in that they often talk of \u201cregulation\u201d or \u201cregulatory law\u201d rather than \u201ceconomic public law\u201d. For a very useful summary, see Bonomo, A. (2003). 37 For a general outline see Graham, C., Prosser, T. (1988); Prosser, T. (1997). 38 For a general outline, see D\u2019Alberti, M (1990). 39 For a clear overview, see Ogus, A. (1994). ",
        "330 by the Tony Blair era (1997 to the present day), which has been characterised by a desire to continue the processes of deregulation and privatisation already in progress, but, at the same time, to temper them with new forms of regulation, so-called re- regulation, which seem to have changed the nature of state intervention in the economy, making it far more complex. The British market has thus become freer and richer, since it has been privatised, but also more competitive, as the rules protecting competition and free access to markets have been strengthened. Last but not least, the incremental advance of Community legislation, pushed forward by the policies of the Labour Party, means that a significant part of the British financial and economic sector is now affected by Community harmonisation policies. The peculiarities of the British order now seem increasingly to be giving way to the relevant EU regulations. 3.2 Privatisation and economic regulation Not only is privatisation in Great Britain the first real example of a newly recast relationship between the economic system and state intervention; it is perhaps also, by virtue of its variety and quality, the best and broadest programme in this area. Consequently, it has become a reference model that everyone quotes and tries to imitate 40 . The characteristics of privatisation in Great Britain can be summarised in four points: the relative speed with which it was carried out; the incentivisation and progressive building of a large number of small shareholders, most of them in families, who invested their savings in the stock market; the widespread introduction of elements of 40 In general, see Kay, J., Mayer, C., Thomson, D. (1986); Wright, V. (1988), 86 ff.; Bishop, J., Kay, C., Mayer, C. (1999). ",
        "331 regulated competition in sectors that had previously been controlled by strong, deep- rooted public sector monopolies; and, because of this, the opening of many public services to the market through the sale, among other things, of public utilities, whilst at the same time creating public organisations responsible for regulating them (particularly through the so-called quangos created by Mrs Thatcher) 41 . However, following on from the era of privatisations carried out by Margaret Thatcher between 1979 and 1993 (notably the reform of the railways) 42 , Tony Blair has continued this policy since 1997, privatising not only some public transport services (such as the London Underground), but also, in 1999, the Post Office, founded by King Charles I in 1635, turning it onto a plc and putting some of its services on the market, thus definitively breaking the monopoly on postal services, against a backdrop of increasing confrontation between the \"old\" and the \"new\" left. At the same time, the Blair government not only hived off the problems of the National Health Service and, citing the difference between the state and public spheres, privatised some parts of it (ranging from supplies to infrastructure and paramedic services), but also turned increasingly to the private sector to manage schools and public services (such as fire brigades), and did not hesitate to increase fees at public universities. In this context, it is important to emphasise how much the Blair government has done in the transport sector, not least in the light of the tragic consequences of serious fatal accidents. In January 2002, a ten-year plan for overhauling the national railways was presented in the form of the Transport Act 2002. This plan, which was drawn up by the government\u2019s Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), provided for \u00a333.5 billion of state funding and \u00a334 billion of private funding. The main aims of the plan are to improve 41 For more on all four of these points, see Foster, C.D. (1992), 15 ff. 42 For a comprehensive overview of this subject, see Grimstone, G. (1993). ",
        "332 services in the short term and to expand the network in the long term, although it was criticised by Railtrack, the company that has been in administration since 7 October 2001 and owns and runs the country's crisis-hit rail network. Similarly, Blair\u2019s preferred route to privatisation in the healthcare sector seems to have been particularly difficult. This seems to point towards public hospitals potentially run by the patients, according to a \u201cfoundation hospital\u201d model, as set out by the British Secretary of State for Health, Alan Milburn. The idea of this reform is that hospitals should remain public bodies, and thus paid for by the State, but be run and administered by their patients, becoming an autonomous entity able to manage its budget, its staff and its operations without having to refer to the Government. This plan thus introduces a business model which belongs to the community and is also required to reinvest profits, protecting the property of these Foundation Hospitals from any form of sale. In addition to all this, the most recent proposal of the Blair government is to privatise the technical infrastructure of the judicial system in England and Wales. This would affect only England and Wales, as Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own legal system. The proposal involves putting archives, security, clerks\u2019 offices and everything that is peripheral to the administration of justice on the market. This would strip the Courts Service, which was created in 1995 and is responsible for the management of the Court of Appeal, the High Court, county courts and tribunals, of all its powers. According to a report by a Government-appointed commission chaired by Kenneth McKenzie, the Courts Service has many deficiencies when it comes to offering an efficient service to the public. Thus, in general terms, it should be emphasised that the privatisations that have been carried out do not seem to affect development at regional or local level by bringing about wide-ranging decentralisation, but rather seem to have the quite different effect ",
        "333 of reducing public intervention and expanding \u2013 in a horizontal direction, so to speak \u2013 the activities of the private sector and of the market in many areas. Privatisations seem to operate directly on the market, avoiding almost completely any form of decentralisation or devolution between regional and local levels. It is public bodies as such \u2013 both state and sub-state \u2013 which, in the hard logic of the British process, seem to be becoming ever further removed from the process of reform that is taking place. There is no principle of decentralisation or subsidiarity involved in this process; nor is there any transfer of management or supply of public services from the State to sub-state bodies. The reform plan, which is more balanced but otherwise mirroring the decisions taken in the Thatcher era, thus concerns the relationship between the public and private sectors rather than that between the state and the sub-state level. This is what characterises the privatisation model adopted in Great Britain, which is totally removed from any kind of involvement of sub-state entities. 3.3 The budget of regional and local authorities: the local authority share of national tax revenue The doctrinal basis for the process of devolution that has characterised the second term of the Blair government was set out in the 1960s, notably by the works of the constitutionalist J.P. Mackintosh 43 . Part of this process has been the redistribution of the budget, despite economic reports showing that 97% of Scotland\u2019s budget - with an identical picture for Northern Ireland or Wales \u2013 depends on London 44 . With respect to Scotland, it should be noted that the Scottish Parliament was given tax- 43 Torre, A. (2002), 867 44 Patrice, C. (2000) ",
        "334 varying powers 45 after 63.5% of Scots voted in favour of such a measure. This raises the so-called \"West Lothian question\" concerning the ability of Westminster MPs from Scottish constituencies to vote on all English matters, whereas English MPs have no such power over devolved issues in Scotland 46 . That having been said, although the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly have primary legislative powers on issues devolved from London, whilst the Welsh Assembly only has administrative powers, local and regional authorities\u2019 share of national tax revenue is of little relevance given that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has exclusive power over British economic policy. Only the Scottish Parliament has limited tax-varying powers for funding local authority expenditure. The system for financing the three regions\u2019 budgets is based on the \u201cblock and formula\u201d system, whereby the budget consists of a given sum (block) which is adjusted on the basis of numerical variations in the population via an appropriate formula (known as the Barnett formula). Thus, the central government retains relatively tight control over public policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 3.4 Public-private cooperation instruments. The intermediary role of the unions Public-private cooperation is also developing, in part through the increasing importance of public companies, although private companies (i.e. companies with a limited shareholder base that do not intend to float on the stock market) remain a widespread type of structure. 45 For the results of the referendum, see www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/devolution 46 See Poggeschi, G. (1998), 955. ",
        "335 The intermediary role of trade unions, however, has \u2013 as has already been made clear \u2013 lost much of its relevance, despite the Labour Party being in government. In particular, the progress of privatisation has certainly increased tensions and led to repeated and severe strikes of whole areas of the public sector. However, the Government has always stood up to these, taking ad hoc measures to replace strike- bound services. A recent example of this is the use of the army to replace firefighters who were on strike in protest against their privatisation; however, this solution did not prevent a number of deaths from occurring over the strike weekend, possibly due to the inexperience of the army in civil protection matters. 3.5 European integration and economic development at regional and local level: management of the Structural Funds In 1999, the rules governing the Structural Funds were subject to a complex reform, the main thrust of which was set out in the Communication \u201cAgenda 2000: For a stronger and wider Union\u201d, which was presented by the Commission in July 1997 47 . In particular, the Communication set out the position of the Community institutions with regard to the political and economic development of the Union with the strategic prospect of enlarging the Union to the new countries of central and eastern Europe and, against that backdrop, set out common policy objectives and outlined the financial framework for the first seven years of the millennium (2000-2006). Interestingly, in contrast to widely-held perceptions, Great Britain was shown to be one of the biggest users of the European structural funds. 47 European Commission. Agenda 2000: For a Stronger and Wider Union COM(97) 2000 final, 15.7.97 ",
        "336 Following the reform of the Funds introduced by the new rules, which tends to focus more heavily on priority objectives for intervention, entails changes in the management, monitoring and assessment of measures, and reduces the number of objectives from seven to three, it can be seen that the Structural Funds used by Great Britain amount to EUR 15,635 million for the period 2000-2006. This is a very significant figure compared to those of other countries such as Italy or France. It is certainly the case that a significant proportion of this Community aid comes in the form of the British rebate \u2013 granted because of its limited use of agricultural subsidies \u2013 which has benefited the country significantly. At the same time, due emphasis must be given to the lasting close relationship that exists between the UK\u2019s Permanent Representation to the EU (UKREP) and the European offices of the devolved administrations; and to the small group of the Ministerial Coordination Committee on EU Policy, to which the devolved institutions make a contribution. The European Union is an important forum for the devolved administrations: Scotland and Wales have active representations in Brussels dealing with their particular interests: in the case of Scotland, Scotland House, and Wales, the Welsh European Centre. These are not mouthpieces for the interests of the United Kingdom (although some members of the Scottish Executive take part in UKREP, where they represent the interests of the UK, and not just those of Scotland).

        "337 IV. LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES 4.1 Management of public services. The regional and local dimension of public services Great Britain was the cradle of the Welfare State, but over the last few decades has also been the country which, more than any other in Europe, has transformed public intervention in economic and social policies using privatisation and competition instruments. Experts have identified two different periods in compiling the history of public services in the UK, during which the State significantly strengthened its role. The first was between the end of the 19 th century and the early years of the last one; the second was after the Second World War 48 . The end of the 19 th century was the beginning of the end of the laissez-faire era and the start of that of state intervention, laying the foundations for the system of public services. The need to establish a social security system was highlighted by the 1942 Beveridge Report, which was based on the assumption that such a system needed to recognise the central role of the family, with the aim of full employment and the creation of a national health protection system for His Majesty\u2019s subjects. In 1946, after the Second World War, the National Health Service 49 was created, the most significant act in what has been described as the \u201cpost-war consensus\u201d between the national political parties in favour of (Keynesian) state intervention in the 48 Fenwick, J., Harrop, K., 53 ff 49 The institution came into being through the National Health Service Act. ",
        "338 economy and the creation of a progressive tax system. Aside from action in the area of health, the National Insurance Act was adopted the same year, followed in 1948 by the National Assistance Act 50 and the Children Act. The scope of this legislation covered areas that were closely linked to the Welfare State, such as health, education, individual social services, housing, and social security. The National Health Service itself has, over time, remained at the heart of social policy. This system was created with the aim of protecting the health of all citizens, thanks in part to the construction of a very wide network of public hospitals. In the nineteenth century, medical care was mainly provided by private individuals or by charities, notwithstanding the setting up of \u201cinfirmaries\u201d for the poorest under the Poor Laws. The very diversity of these organisations led to the creation of a Local Government Board. On this basis, the task of unifying healthcare, which passed into the hands of local authorities in 1930, was progressively completed. There was a clear shift from a public system run along charitable lines alongside a basic service provided largely by the private and voluntary sectors to a national system of public service for all citizens, which was created in 1946. However, notwithstanding the intentions, if one looks at the effectiveness of the service, the system was not truly extensive and comprehensive, as the costs of treatment were often too high and waiting times very long. Hospitals played a very important role within the healthcare system. Indeed, they accounted for 70% of healthcare spending; however, their geographical distribution was not optimised (the classic example being London, where all the hospitals are in the centre of the city). 50 This replaced the Poor Laws. ",
        "339 This disparity was addressed by the Labour governments of the 1970s, who put in place instruments to rebalance the distribution of hospitals and make them more specialised, whilst promoting the role of primary healthcare. The Conservatives continued to move in this direction, and some hospitals were closed. In its early days, the NHS was organised into hospitals, primary care, and local authority services. That structure was modified over the years with the introduction of regional, area and district levels, but the real innovation came when, based on the belief that the NHS was a source of waste and inefficiency, it was thought necessary to introduce market principles. The idea was that attention to costs and efficiency would increase and Health Authorities would be better able to control their activities. In addition, a number of \u201cquasi autonomous trusts\u201d were created, from which the authorities could buy the various services. It is clear that, at the beginning of the 1980s, and coinciding with a slowdown in economic growth, the post-war settlement broke down and new ways of running public services began to be looked at, particularly by the Conservative Party. Once they came to power in 1979, the Conservatives prepared a plan for the progressive withdrawal of the State from the provision of public services and the economy, introducing competition into various areas of public utilities. This policy, which was continued throughout the 1980s, had a direct impact on local authorities, who had been playing a significant role in the provision of public services. These became less and less providers of services and more and more monitors and regulators of competition between private service suppliers. In terms of the relationship between central and local government, this also led to a significant move towards centralisation, due to the introduction of unelected, government- appointed bodies. ",
        "340 The Conservatives made use of their four terms in office to continue reducing state intervention in the economy and in service provision; meanwhile, the Labour Party, having for a time maintained its traditional position, accepted the model proposed by the governing party and began to propose very similar ideas for developing public services and the economy 51 . Some have suggested that his convergence constituted a new consensus between the two major parties along the lines of that which allowed the Welfare State to develop after the 1940s. This time, the agreement was about the need to keep reducing the role of the state, and instead to encourage private operators to provide services on a competitive basis. The role of central government became progressively less significant, particularly once the process of devolution was completed and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland political institutions had started work. Each region has both a Secretary of State with a department of central Government, and its own Assembly and Executive. Scotland and Northern Ireland have different laws from those in England and Wales. The Scottish Parliament has wide legislative powers, and the Scottish Executive has its own social policy. Similarly, the administrative structure of Northern Ireland provides for a Health Board, based on the Irish model, which deals with personal social services, while public housing is managed by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. In the various sectors that are considered as public services, the relationship between the centre and the periphery has in most cases become very complex, and the implementation of devolution has complicated it still further. Looking to the field of education, it can be seen that, in the post-war years, a school system was created, 51 Giddens, A. (1998) ",
        "341 jointly run by the centre and the regions, but that this developed very differently following devolution. The development of Education Authorities themselves in Scotland, England and Wales was very different. On the one hand, the Labour Party, whilst committed to public-private partnership and managerial control, wanted to leave some powers with the Education Authorities. On the other, the Conservatives, whilst not wanting them to be abolished, are demanding a reduction in bureaucracy and centralisation in the sector 52 . During the 19 th century, local authorities were given an increasing role, particularly in policies relating to poverty (Poor Laws 53 ) and, subsequently, in the provision of public services relating to health, social assistance and education. Local authorities lost those prerogatives one by one due to a drive towards centralism, which has led to a situation whereby local authorities can now only pursue those activities that the central Parliament allows them, often under the direction of central government, which carries out a wide-ranging monitoring role. Furthermore, local authorities have limited fiscal and economic room for manoeuvre. However, this institutional framework has demonstrated the risk that centralised policymaking will have a slow (or distorted) effect across the country. In today\u2019s United Kingdom, local authorities are the principal bodies ensuring protection of the individual and social rights. Legislation and case law gives them powers in matters relating to public health, street management, town planning, social services, leisure, and education 54 . Local authorities carry out a very large number of 52 Campbell, C. (2000), 85-106 53 The experiment of the Poor Laws began at the end of the 1500s (1531, 1536, 1598), continued in the Elizabethan era (1601) and in the nineteenth century (1834). 54 See Highways Act 1980; Public Health Act 1936, 1961; Clean Air Act 1974; Building Act 1984; Control of Pollution Act 1974. ",
        "342 functions, including services for people with disabilities, the mentally ill, and children 55 . It should immediately be pointed out that there has been a progressive move away from a model of social services provided directly by local authorities to other models. Increasingly, various other service providers have come into existence alongside local authorities, such as quangos and other unelected bodies. The acronym \u201cquango\" stands for \u201cquasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation\u201d; this refers to statutory bodies that are required to protect and promote social rights, and are not really completely independent, but are part of government 56 . In the summer of 2001, the Office of Public Service Reform was created to work with the Prime Minister and Government departments on the reform of the UK\u2019s public services, including the Civil Service and local government. The aim of the Labour government is to begin a phase of \u201cmodernising our public services\u201d, as Prime Minister Blair has said 57 . The Labour government\u2019s policy on public services is summarised in this body\u2019s documents. It is worth remembering that Labour won the 2001 general election with a message of improving public services in health, employment and education. The presumption of increased public spending and better services is, however, closely tied to the country\u2019s economic growth. However, the Labour government expected to increase capital investment from 2002 onwards. Public spending on education and 55 See Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1976; Children Act 1989; National Health Service Community Act 1990. 56 For a discussion of quangos see Edward, D.A.O., Robinson, W., McColgan, A.

In 2003, the estimates show an further increase to 44.6 for education and 53.8 for health. On transport, the Government has drawn up a plan to improve the rail and road network involving \u00a3180 billion of public and private funds. Furthermore, in preparing what has been described as \u201cthe most ambitious programme of public service reform and investment since 1940\u201d, the government intends to put the customer at the centre of policymaking in this area, strengthening the principles that already exist in the current model. As is stated in the Office of Public Services Reform report, \u201cpublic services have to be refocused round the needs of the patients, the pupils, the passengers\u201d. Labour\u2019s reforms are supposed to be based on four fundamental principles: setting national standards and clarifying responsibility; devolution and delegation to front-line staff, giving local government a central role, inter alia in assessing the impact of services in relation to specific needs; greater flexibility in organising services and incentives and awards for the best services; and customer contact, listening to calls for change 58 . 4.1.1 The impact of privatisation In UK politics, privatisation has had a significant, wide-ranging impact, because the process has not only opened up to the private sector activities from which it had previously been barred, but a private-sector mentality has also pervaded the very way in which public bodies are organised and public services are provided (even where these have remained in public hands). 58 As well as the document in the previous footnote, see Powell M. (2002), Rouse, J. (2002), Smith, J. (2002). ",
        "344 Thus, the country has undergone a process, which started during the long period of Conservative government, of transfer of some significant areas of public services to the private sector. This happened with telecommunications, gas, water, electricity and the railways. Council housing was sold to its tenants on favourable terms, and construction of new council houses was limited. In the area of broadcasting, a legal framework was created in 1990 to allow private entities to use analogue broadcast frequencies and thus to provide an alternative to the BBC. The main instrument used in reshaping the UK\u2019s social system during the long period of Conservative government was contracting-out. The aim of this was to take the supply of some services out of the hands of local authorities. In some areas, services were also contracted out to voluntary organisations or individual citizens who carried out the activities free of charge. Regarding non-profit making organisations, it should however be noted that a lively debate has emerged in the UK about whether it is appropriate to keep in place the significant (tax and other) concessions that the law grants them, thus giving them a de facto advantage over other organisations 59 . An important pillar in the public service model of the 1980s was compulsory competitive tendering (CCT). This established the principle by which local councils were required to submit a specified set of activities to a bidding process. However, this procedure left open the possibility that the local authority would itself win the contest (in the absence of private bidders or on merit), but in this case the services it provided would in future have to be carried out on the basis of private sector economic criteria 60 . The activities subject to this mechanism of contracting and 59 Soldati, N. (2000) 546 ff 60 Fenwick, J., Shaw, K., Foreman, A. (1994), 45-55 ",
        "345 supply, are set out in the national rules contained in the Local Government Acts. The 1988 Act made the use of this procedure compulsory, applying to street cleaning, cleaning of buildings, collection of refuse, upkeep of open spaces, catering for schools and welfare schemes, and the repair and maintenance of vehicles. This list was gradually extended over the years to include leisure management and some departments of local councils themselves, such as finance, legal, architecture, and property management. As has already been stated above, the use of competitive instruments (in particular CCT) was the method by which central government reduced the level of autonomy enjoyed by local authorities. This instrument, which has been very widely adopted, has led to significant centralisation of power in the hands of central government, which has become the guardian of its operation and of competition 61 . There are other reasons why this process of change has had a very significant impact on local authorities. The latter had been established in a system of democratic accountability for their actions. That is, the evaluation of their work was carried out above all according to political criteria and influenced by votes at elections. The changes carried out in the 1980s have led to a very different situation, where accountability is based purely on economic criteria and in terms of efficiency and value for money as the market dictates. People on the receiving end of public services are increasingly considered as users rather than citizens. The strengthening of the user concept has progressively paved the way for the consumer-orientation concept, reflecting the increasing attention paid to users by the public sector. This customer-awareness is further strengthened by the creation of 61 Fenwick, J., Shaw, K., Foreman, A. (1994) ",
        "346 consultation procedures, bringing services closer to the user, and the creation of performance and customer satisfaction league tables. The process of building the new model of welfare produced another important phenomenon: that of value for money indicators, particularly by virtue of the changes to the concept of accountability itself. Local councils are required to monitor and evaluate the activities of private-sector service providers on the basis of these indicators. Just as local authorities have the task of monitoring private companies, they themselves are subject to performance monitoring by central government. This monitoring is carried out by the Audit Commission 62 , an independent public body, which sets the criteria for evaluation of performance and publishes reports on the state of the nation 63 . The Local Government Act 1999 made significant changes to the instruments that the law confers on local authorities for deciding on companies providing public services. The system of CCT was replaced by Best Value 64 . Highly pragmatic in nature, this method requires local authorities to formulate a performance plan for each service with the declared aim of securing best value for each service. This new system has also had an effect on the accountability of local authorities, which is now evaluated with reference to the performance plans. By reducing the role of competition in the provision of services, it also increases their scope for action. 62 The Commission was set up by an agreement between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Department of Health and the Welsh Assembly. It checks that public money is spent effectively, efficiently and economically at local level and in the supply of services relating to criminal justice, health and housing. For further information on the Commission, visit its website at www.audit.commission.gov.uk . 63 See 1995 Report. 64 See Barnes, M. (1999), 60-75; Bartlett, B. (1999), 102-118. ",
        "347 One of the most distinguishing features of the Best Value legislation is that it requires local authorities to consult users of each public service. This mechanism is supposed to shape the service to the various specific requirements of the users, and thus to enhance local democracy 65 . Under the previous system (CCT), of course, decisions on the supply of services were entirely a matter for local authorities. In spite of this clear pointer, no provision was made for a single model applicable to all local circumstances according to which the individual authorities would have to effect this opening up to the outside; rather, each of them was instrumental for this purpose 66 . Among the various approaches taken by local authorities, some did not introduce any significant innovations in the management of public services (such as the cases where a service panel was set up), whereas in others, the means made available to users encouraged the expression of new ideas from the community ( the community development approach ). In yet others, residents\u2019 meetings were organised, which simply turned into forums for political propaganda and did not engender any real sense of participation among those involved. The common feature in all the different areas is unquestionably the difficulty in designing a universal model for consultation, especially in view of two factors: firstly, the costs of such activities and the extra work they mean for local government; and secondly, the influence that the nature of the local ruling class will have on the results of those activities. 65 Dibben, P., Bartelett, B. (2001) 43-58 66 See Modernising Local Government: The Government Agenda, 1998. ",
        "348 V. THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON REGIONAL AND LOCAL DEMOCRACY 5.1 Computerisation of public administration (projects, experience and results) Public administrations in Great Britain are highly computerised, and, as many annual reports published by specialised companies (for example, by Assinform) indicate, IT and the development of telecommunications in Great Britain are a key part of the Government\u2019s strategy for bringing the institutions closer to the citizen. Indeed, the aggregate ICT (Information and Communications Technology - http://www.becta.org.uk/index.cfm) market for the public sector clearly shows that Great Britain is a leading country, along with France and Germany, in the increasing use of hardware and software in the public sector, including at regional and local level. This is reflected particularly in investments in new IT architecture, in keeping with Internet/Intranet or ERP applications. In this context, Great Britain\u2019s efforts to implement the European Commission\u2019s directives on investment in information technology in the public sector have made it the first country in the European Union to achieve the objectives set out by the European Commission in this area. Certainly, this is not a policy that has been imposed from above, but is based on consensus among citizens, as expressed through a Government-commissioned survey in 1996, which examined public interest in information technology (computers, bar code readers, fax machines, ticket machines). Many of these programmes were introduced thanks to the work of the National Council for Educational Technology, which was renamed in March 1998 as the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. Although a ",
        "349 centralised body, the scope of its activity means that it has quickly developed at a regional and local level as well. In the last year, the National Council for Educational Technology has acted on behalf of the Department for Education and Skills, promoting, among other things, IT in schools, but also investment in new technology, multimedia products and educational software. 5.2 Procedures and safeguards for electronic voting. The role of electronic discussion forums. The rise of local television networks It has recently been pointed out, in the light of the increasingly poor turnout at general elections, that \u201cpeople are becoming used to conducting their transactions in flexible ways \u2013 by post, phone, in the street or supermarket, and increasingly at home via e-mail and the web \u2013 and the burden of walking to a polling station to cast a vote could seem anachronistic\u201d 67 . It should be remembered that, in order to vote in the United Kingdom, citizens must be listed on the Electoral Register, which is currently updated each month at the initiative of the citizen (for example when he moves house). This system is known as rolling registration. Registered voters receive a polling card from the authorities, which states the type of election and the location of the polling station. It then falls to the elector to go to the polling station to cast his or her vote on an individual ballot paper, enabling the elector to be identified in the event that this becomes necessary 68 . Finally, the counting of ballots takes place elsewhere than the polling station (except in the case of local elections). Candidates and their agents may be present during all 67 The Independent Commission on Alternative Voting Methods, Election in 21 st Century: from paper ballot to E-voting, 5. 68 See Ballot secrecy: electoral reform Society-Liberty working party report, Electoral Reform Society, 1997. ",
        "350 electoral business, so that the system benefits from a high level of transparency, in addition to security and secrecy. In general, the counting of votes is not subject to significant delay, partly because only 0.3% of ballot papers are spoiled. The Representation of the People Act 2000 provided for experiments with new voting methods for the local elections of May that year in 32 local authorities and in London. The experiment introduced postal voting, the use of electronic voting and counting machines, longer opening hours for polling stations, and the use of mobile polling stations 69 . The main alternative voting methods are: \u2212 Postal voting \u2212 Telephone voting \u2212 Online voting. In addition, there are voting and counting methods that may be introduced in the future. These would alter the way that elections are currently conducted, consisting of computerised voting at polling stations and (independently of this) electronic counting. With respect to both voting and counting methods, the advantages, disadvantages, risks and possible solutions have quite properly been highlighted. 69 See Piloting New Electoral Arrangements, a Local Government Association Briefing for May 2000 elections, LGA Publications, April 2000; It is interesting to note that private organisations have also been trying to change their internal voting methods \u2013 trade unions are one such case. ",
        "351 For example, postal voting does not represent a real break with the traditional way of organising elections, as it is in any case used alongside polling stations. The 2000 Act currently offers electors in England, Scotland and Wales the possibility of voting by post, whilst there are some restrictions in Northern Ireland 70 . In 2001, 5.3% of votes were cast by post (against 2.4% in 1997). However, following the 2000 reforms, universal postal voting was used in some areas on an experimental basis. On 4 May that year, citizens voted for some borough councils by universal postal ballot. On the basis of the guidelines contained in the legislation approved by the Westminster parliament, all registered electors in those areas experimenting with universal postal voting were sent the necessary materials for casting a postal vote. In each case, local authorities were required to work hard to assist electors with the new system. Voting was permitted to commence between 24 and 7 days before the election date. Whilst postal voting would appear to offer a high standard of secrecy, increased participation, and cost savings, its security is more questionable. Similarly, telephone voting, so far little used in the United Kingdom, seems to offer a fast, secure alternative to the traditional method of voting that will potentially increase participation at a reasonable cost. However, let us now turn to what seems to be the real challenge to the traditional organisation (and regulation): electronic or online voting. The United Kingdom has only very recently begun to experiment with electronic voting for public bodies, although it was used a number of years ago in some local referendums. In 2000 and 2001, Bristol City Council and the London boroughs of Croydon and Islington 70 In Northern Ireland, notwithstanding those restrictions, the use of postal voting was far higher than average: 3.3% compared with 2.4% in the 1997 general election. ",
        "352 experimented with this type of voting. Electors in these areas were able to vote by post, by telephone or on line. Turnout in Bristol was 40.2%; in Croydon, 35.1%; but only 2.7% and 3.4% respectively used the Internet to vote. If these percentages are analysed by area, social group and age, however, it becomes clear that the use of Internet voting is far more widespread in areas with a wealthier, better educated population, because Internet access is not yet universal. In the referendum in Islington, on the other hand, where turnout was 22.3%, only 2.4% used the Internet (2.4% voted by telephone). In the 2003 local elections, following government approval, some 59 local authorities, encompassing 6.5 million voters, experimented with alternative voting methods, between them including all such methods. Of these local authorities, 32 experimented with all-postal voting, seven experimented with flexible opening hours and locations of polling stations, while 17 used electronic voting, along with voting by telephone, via the Internet and through digital television. Finally, four authorities used e-voting in conjunction with postal ballots. The experiments in these localities showed that the use of postal voting, for example, increased turnout. The beneficial effect of e-voting on turnout, on the other hand, seems to be far more doubtful 71 , even though the trend towards use of e-voting is increasing. 71 See Piloting Alternative Voting Methods in the 2003 Local Elections in England, Report and Comments by the Electoral Reform Society. For an account of the voting experiments in 2003, see also the Electoral Reform Society\u2019s website. ",
        "353 E-voting offers a high degree of flexibility to electoral procedures and positively addresses one of the main reasons for abstention in the United Kingdom, given that 21% of voters who failed to vote in the 2001 general election stated that it was too difficult to get to the appropriate polling station 72 . However, in any discussion on Internet voting, it is also important to consider the issue of access, which is far more widespread in some geographical areas and social classes than in others. Thus, the Internet makes possible new and innovative voting methods, but also changes the way that public institutions and bodies communicate, providing a considerable boost to openness and transparency. The institutions use the net to increase participation and to stimulate interest among citizens. For example, it is possible to follow the proceedings of the devolved institutions on the Internet. On some of the Assemblies\u2019 websites, for example, it is possible to watch live sessions of parliamentary committees, thus increasing the openness of the authorities\u2019 work. 5.3 Information technology and changing public services The role that information and communications technologies are progressively acquiring in public administrations and public service providers has been apparent for some time. In the May 2000 Modernising Government White Paper, there is also an explicit reference to the impact that ICT is intended to have on public services. EGovernment is now able to develop using many and various means, such as the creation of websites and of call centres that give information on services and how to 72 See Electoral Commission, Voter attitudes surveys for the 2001 general election , www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/moripoll.htm. ",
        "354 use them; the use of smart cards for the acquisition and exchange of data; and digital television, to raise awareness of services and differentiate between them. Furthermore, these individual instruments can be rendered interoperable thanks to the digital technologies opening up their content. Each year, the UK government spends a significant budget on ICT 73 , in addition to that spent by external private companies and associations. Numerous studies have highlighted how ICT can transform the relationship between various levels of government and members of society, whether viewed as service users or citizens, while these technologies represent \u201cthe biggest change for the United Kingdom\u2019s local authorities\u201d 74 . Before the available technologies reached their current stage of development, local authorities were already using databases and computerised administrative tools 75 , but the impact of new technologies has made necessary a complete rethink of internal working practices and relations with the public. The advantages of these innovative tools are clear, both in terms of accessibility of information and services, transparency, and openness, but also of distribution of services and information on the ground. Anyone who needs to deal with local government, whether as a citizen or as a service user, can potentially choose not only what to request, but also when and where to do so. As experts have shown, whilst the academic debate has focused on the relationship between democracy and ICT, these technologies are in practice most widely used in 73 See UK Parliament\u2019s Public Accounts Committee First Report , which put public sector expenditure for 1998-1999 at \u00a37 billion. 74 See Cremin, M.(1999). 75 Bellamy, C., Taylor, J.A.(1998); Compare Automatic Data Processing (ADP) ",
        "355 relation to public services. Indeed, in the last twenty years, the New Public Management idea has permeated the way public services are run and has put the emphasis on citizens as users rather than players in democracy. However, this distinction between citizen and user has some difficulty penetrating local authorities\u2019 work with new technologies. This is the case because the first practical tool that local authorities have used has been the creation of websites; by now, almost all local authorities have a presence on the web 76 . On these sites, it is difficult to distinguish clearly between content aimed at people in their capacity as citizens and that aimed at users 77 . Further developments in ICT will be required before distinguishing between different types of content becomes easier. A study into hundreds of local authority websites carried out at the end of the 1990s showed that these were the main form of ICT used, and, at the same time, that these websites rarely contained any services as such, but were purely sources of information with varying degrees of relevance to each authority\u2019s tasks. One of the most significant problems here has been keeping sites up to date, with news of important events in the local community was still not online several weeks afterwards: \u201c in this sense, local government appears to lag behind some private sector pratice \u201d 78 . This failure arose from a lack of technical capacity and from distrust of new technology, but it is clear that local government long retained an oversimplified idea of the use of ICT. 76 See Horrock, I., Hambley, N. (1998), 39-44. 77 Cremin, M. (1999), 11 78 Cremin, M. (1999), 21-22 ",
        "356 However, the Labour governments of the last few years have put a great deal of emphasis on the use of ICT, not least in public services. To this end, the website www.ukonline.gov.uk, managed by the Office of the e-Envoy, part of the Cabinet Office, has a section where it is possible to access some services directly, in addition to the traditional section that contains information. In the \u201cDo it online\u201d part of the site, it is possible to register to vote, buy a TV licence by credit card, apply for a passport, calculate personal taxes, etc. There is also an alphabetical list of all local authorities and of numerous other services divided by subject or area of interest 79 . 79 The site has some strict rules for users who access it. These can be found in the section entitled \u201cTerms and Conditions.\u201d ",

        "365 SPAIN INTRODUCTION Although Spain is undoubtedly one of the most decentralised states in democratic Europe, devolution remains a key issue in Spanish politics. This is borne out by recent political and institutional events which are calling into question the solidity of the present devolution system and with it the overall future of the autonomic state. The government has seen a host of requests from governing parties in various regions for different forms of autonomy, ranging from the declared sovereignty of Basque nationalism to the incisive declarations of autonomy from the Catalan left. The Catalonia regional elections of 16 November 2003 marked the end of a historic stage in Catalan politics, dominated by the figure of Jordi Pujol, leader of the moderate Catalan nationalists. Mr Pujol had led the Catalan Generalitat without interruption since 1980 and had shown a strong commitment to dialogue and negotiation with central government. The new coalition government headed by the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) leader, Pasqual Maragall, has announced important changes in social, fiscal and economic policy which it plans to fully implement during the current legislature, and proposes wide-ranging reform of the statute of autonomy, with the aim of significantly extending the region's autonomy within both the autonomic state and the European Union. In the Basque Country, the Basque prime minister Ibarretxe has announced that a consultative referendum will be held at the end of 2005 on the new draft political statute (the Estatuto pol\u00edtico de Euskadi ). The draft was approved by the Basque government on 25 October 2003 and is now being discussed at the parliament in Vitoria. The draft calls for the territorial authorities that historically make up the Basque region to be granted the right to self-determination, and voices the intention to set up an autonomous legal entity known as the Community of Euskadi; this ",
        "366 community should be able to associate freely with the Spanish state and establish a new system of political and legal relations with it, enabling it to carry out its duties with full autonomy. To this end, the new statute significantly extends the competences of the Community of Euskadi, not only as regards cultural and language matters but also in the economic and fiscal field, leaving the Spanish state a limited number of competences in a small number of fields. The draft statute also provides for the establishment of an autonomous judicial authority and a special division of the constitutional court, known as the Tribunal Euskadi-Estado , to be responsible for settling any disputes of competences between the Spanish state and the institutions and authorities of the Community of Euskadi. On 13 November 2003 the Madrid government responded to the challenge posed by the Basque nationalists by formally contesting the draft statute at the constitutional court; shortly afterwards, it tabled a proposal in parliament to reform the penal code, with the clear aim of sanctioning the actions announced by the Basque government to secure approval of its statute. Although the recent demands for autonomy by the nationalist parties in the Basque Country and those of the left in Catalonia differ significantly in their aims and content, their main effect has been to focus political/constitutional debate in Spain on the question of how the country is governed. These demands were not promoted solely by the nationalist parties' scant loyalty to the constitution; they are also the result of original structural dysfunctions within the autonomic state that remain unresolved. A particular shortcoming is the lack of active multilateral cooperation between the state, the autonomous communities and the local authorities, and the absence of a chamber that is truly representative of the subnational authorities. This situation led the two government and opposition parties, the People's Party (PP) and the Socialist Party (PSOE), to focus their campaigns for the 2004 national elections on the country's system of government. The PP has tended to radicalise its dealings with all the regionalist and nationalist groupings and has stressed the need to retain constitutional stability in order to preserve the country's unity. The PSOE, in contrast, ",
        "367 feels that the constitutional reforms necessary to complete the autonomous regions system (in particular, reform of the senate to turn it into the representative chamber of the autonomous communities) should be implemented during the coming term. Against this backdrop of far-reaching political instability, Spain has managed to achieve a high rate of economic growth and widespread prosperity. With a GDP of EUR 542,000 million and per capita GDP of EUR 18,110, Spain is now one of the ten most developed western economies. In the last ten years, Spain has significantly reduced its public deficit, and has made its economic system more flexible by setting in train a privatisation programme and adopting measures to curb public spending. The Spanish government's economic policy in recent years has sought first and foremost to achieve real convergence with its EU partners, particularly as regards per capita income and unemployment. The main instruments deployed have been curbing public spending \u2013 thus enabling Spain to be a founding member of the eurozone \u2013 and implementing an ambitious privatisation programme, thereby opening up the markets and increasing competition. The adoption of the 2000-2003 stability programme , which entered into force with the 2003 budget, was designed to press ahead with these strategies. The budgetary policy laid down in the programme aims at a substantial improvement in the main variables: public accounts, primary balance, public savings and public debt/GDP ratio. The idea is to wipe out the deficit by a policy of restructuring expenditure, reducing tax pressure, and measures to encourage development plans in the fields of education, research and social policies. In the public services sector, the transfer of new competences (health and education) to the autonomous communities, backed by the requisite financial support, has strengthened the role of regional authorities in the management and delivery of public services. Devolution of health to the regions has made it possible to transfer to the regional health services the management and supply of a number of health services that were previously the responsibility of the national health institute (Insalud).

Largescale decentralisation to the autonomous communities in recent years has further highlighted the need to transfer wider competences and tasks to local authorities too. One recent legislative step in this direction was the approval on 16 December 2003 of Law 57/2003 on measures to modernise local government, designed to strengthen the local government system. More particularly, this law promotes the application of new forms of direct democracy and the dissemination of new information and communication technologies with a view to increasing people's involvement in local political life. The aim here is to implement the strategy identified in Info Action Plan XXI , adopted in 2001 by the interministerial committee on the information society and new technologies, for promoting ICT and eGovernment in Spain's regions. Some 300 initiatives have been launched so far, significantly increasing the computerisation of the public authorities and improving access to the information society for both businesses and individuals. I. THE EVOLUTION OF FEDERAL/REGIONAL DYNAMICS. THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 1.1 Organisation of the State in the last thirty years. Historical profile The first constitution in Spain's political history was approved in Cadiz at the beginning of the 19 th century, opening a long cycle of political and institutional instability which marked the whole process of developing a constitution for the liberal Spanish state. The most recent stages in Spain's institutional development began with the outbreak of the civil war in 1936 which led to the fall of the second ",

A plebiscite on 26 July 1947 secured the return of the monarchy and Franco's role as \"regent\" for it in the interim, and in 1969 he appointed as his successor Prince Juan Carlos of Borbon. The death of Franco and the accession to the throne of Juan Carlos in 1975 ushered in a political transition governed by a special law passed in 1976 with a popular referendum. This restored certain basic rights and brought the election in 1977 by universal suffrage of the Cortes Generales (Spanish parliament), which was given the task of drafting a new constitution. The new text was approved by popular referendum, by a large majority, on 6 December 1978 and entered into force on 28 December 1978. With the specific aim of preventing the abuses of Franco's authoritarian regime, the 1978 constitution adopted a parliamentary monarchy and a democratic system of government, as can be seen both in the new legal position of the Crown (Title II) and in the relations between parliament and government (Title V). The new system involves a rationalised form of parliamentary government which is closely modelled on the 1949 German constitution and thus assigns a stronger role to the prime minister. The Spanish parliamentary system rests on some basic mechanisms designed to stabilise the executive, such as the particular mechanism for appointing the prime minister (Article 99), the \"constructive motion of censure\" (Article 113) and the \"automatic\" dissolution of parliament (Article 99(5)). Although these mechanisms rationalise the parliamentary system, they do not guarantee the executive full autonomy from parliament and real stability \u2013 two factors that are essential for the proper functioning of parliamentary government. In Spain, however, this has also been achieved by the combined effect of various political and institutional factors, such as the moderating role played by the constitutional court and the constructive operation of the party system. This has combined the advantages of one-party government (albeit sometimes without an absolute majority) with the flexible, consensus-based coalition system, all within a generally alternating trend ",
        "370 and with different majorities between central government and the autonomous communities 1 . 1.1.1 The evolution of regionalisation/federalisation procedures and decentralisation processes. The most recent institutional developments As regards the type of State, the territorial organisation system enshrined in the 1978 Spanish constitution does not conform to classical federalist or regionalist models 2 . In the context of the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the constitution recognises the right to autonomy as a general principle of state organisation. This principle lies behind the division of the national territory into municipalities, provinces and autonomous communities, which are to \"enjoy self-government for the management of their respective interests\" (Article 137). The constitution also guarantees implementation of the principle of solidarity (Article 138), and a \"just and adequate economic balance between the different areas of Spanish territory\" (Article 139). Building on these premises, the constitution guarantees the autonomy of the 8,104 municipalities and 50 provinces which make up the Spanish state, stipulating the democratic and representative nature of their governmental bodies (Articles 140 and 141) and the provision of sufficient funds to perform the tasks assigned to them by law. The constitution does not provide a priori for the existence of autonomous communities, but guarantees the right to autonomy of nationalities and regions under 1 Chimenti, C. (2000), 4 et seq. 2 For an analysis of the originality of the territorial organisation system adopted in the Spanish constitution, see in particular L\u00f3pez Aguilar, J.F. (1999), 104. ",
        "371 an implementing principle which offers autonomy as a right which can only be exercised by following one of the procedures for establishing self-government laid down in Title VIII of the constitution. Title VIII provides several paths for this and two separate levels of competences that may be attained 3 . However, the solution adopted in the constitution does not divide the Spanish state into two levels of autonomy, but offers any sub-state authority the possibility of choosing its own path for establishing an autonomous community, in accordance with its particular aspirations; the initial (but not final) level of competences will depend on the path chosen. This is because, although the system adopted in the constitution for distributing competences between the state and the autonomous communities (Articles 148 and 149) is based on two lists of respective competences and a residual clause, it gives the autonomous communities the possibility of extending their competences after five years have elapsed, through reform of the statutes of autonomy (Article 148(2)). The provision within the constitution for an equal distribution of competences across the autonomous communities is not incompatible with its recognition of certain local linguistic, cultural, legal and economic features, known as \"hechos diferenciales\" (differentiating factors): this asymmetry is inevitable in the autonomic state. In recognising these factors, the constitution introduces criteria for differentiating between the autonomous communities with the result that some of them demand different treatment, generally aspiring to a higher level of competences and self-government. 3 Title VIII provides for an ordinary system of gradual access to full autonomy by a \"slow path\" (Articles 143, 144 and 146) and a special system for immediate access to full autonomy by a \"fast track\" (Article 151 and the second transitional provision). The fast track takes the form of a twofold alternative procedure designed to attain the maximum level of competences provided by the constitution, while the slow path requires a less complex procedure for achieving an initially lower level of autonomy while offering the possibility of extending competences through reform of the statutes of autonomy after five years. The only communities which have acceded to the highest level of autonomy from the outset are the three historic nations (Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia) and Andalusia; the latter followed the complex procedure governed by Article 151. ",
        "372 The provision of different forms of access to self-government and of two initial levels of competences enabled the disparate regions that made up post-Franco Spain in 1978 to set up autonomous communities in just a few years. The 17 autonomous communities that today form the Spanish state concluded their autonomy process at the end of 1982 with the approval of their respective statutes of autonomy 4 . The initial activation of a different level of competences, combined with the recognition of the differentiating factors, led to the establishment of an asymmetric form of regionalism which over the years has seen a partial standardisation of institutions and competences. This process was made possible by the political and legislative reforms adopted in the last 30 years, which extend the regulatory framework for Spanish regionalism and are the hallmark of its steady development. The first steps towards remedying the initial asymmetry were made with the 1981 and 1992 autonomy pacts, concluded respectively between the Democratic Centre Union (UCD) and the PSOE, and between the PSOE and the PP. These pacts should be seen as part of a wider reform programme conducted by the main national political groupings with the aim of steering the autonomy process towards a cooperative form of regionalism. The pacts made it possible to establish an identical institutional architecture for all the autonomous communities, devise a procedure for remedying the asymmetrical distribution of competences (Article 148(2)) and strengthen cooperation. They were implemented by the organic law harmonising the autonomy process (LOAPA), Organic Law 9/1992 on the transfer of powers to the autonomous communities under Article 143, the organic laws of March 1994 reforming the 4 Spain currently comprises the two autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla and 17 autonomous communities: Andalusia, Aragon, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, Cantabria, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla-Le\u00f3n, Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja, Madrid, Murcia, Navarra, the Basque Country, Asturias and Valencia.

With the 1994 reform of the statutes of autonomy and the transfer of education and health competences to all the autonomous communities, the process of levelling out the competences of the autonomous communities was broadly concluded (December 2001). However, this has not produced complete uniformity. Differences remain as a result of the differentiating factors, which enjoy constitutional recognition in some autonomous communities and prevent total standardisation of the competence system. At present there is one set of competences broadly enjoyed by all autonomous communities, and a second set of specific competences enjoyed by certain communities as a result of their differentiating factors 5 . The institutional standardisation process has been concluded with the further statutory reforms approved since 1996 by virtually all the autonomous communities, which have significantly changed the form of regional government and strengthened the parliamentary system. Among the reforms designed to strengthen cooperation within the autonomic state, mention should be made of the reform of the regulation of the senate, of 11 January 1994. This established a new legislative commission, the Comisi\u00f3n General de las 5 The distinct financial and tax system in the Basque Country and Navarra, the economic/fiscal system of the Canary Islands and the existence of regional civil law and autonomous police in some autonomous communities are examples of special competences arising from the differentiating factors .

However, the standardisation process has been hampered by trends in the other direction which have slowed down the supposed completion of the federal/cooperative side of the autonomy process. In 1996 the Aznar government concluded \"governability\" pacts with the Catalan, Basque and Canary nationalist parties which, in exchange for political support, granted special concessions to the autonomous communities represented by these parties. The main political result of these pacts was the reform of the autonomous financing system, adopted for the five- year period 1997-2001, which gives the autonomous communities greater financial autonomy 7 . It is clear that, as well as facilitating bilateral relations between the government and the autonomous communities, these pacts aggravate the asymmetric nature of the autonomic state by constitutionally acceding to the most insistent demands for autonomy. Finally and most recently, the autonomy system risks being destabilised by the renewal of ETA's terrorism campaign, the outlawing of the Batasuna radical Basque political party and the demands for sovereignty on the part of the \"democratic nationalist\" Basques. All this could heighten the climate of uncertainty. The application of the new organic law on political parties (No. 6/2002, approved by parliament on 28 June 2002) led the supreme court to ban the Batasuna party on the grounds that it gave political support to terrorism by offering institutional cover to 6 It is agreed that constitutional reform is needed to alter the role of the senate and turn it into a chamber for representing sub-state interests.

This exacerbated the tension between central government and the nationalist parties in the Basque government which, as well as being extremely reluctant to implement the ruling, began to step up their demands for self-determination. The conflict came to a head on 25 October 2003 with the adoption by the Basque government of a new draft political statute setting up a new autonomous legal entity, the Community of Euskadi, which may associate freely with the Spanish state 9 . The Basque government also threatened to hold a regional referendum on the proposed statute with a view to pushing it through if the national parliament refuses to approve it. The scale of the autonomists' recent demands has thus raised the autonomy issue so acutely that it is causing an interinstitutional and inter-party conflict which is without precedent in democratic Spain under the present constitution. This highlights the genuine need to reach agreement on a definitive model of territorial organisation, with a view to adopting the legal and political measures needed to complete the autonomy process. 1.1.2 Relations between central government and the regional/local levels of government The 1978 Spanish constitution refers to coordination as one of the basic principles underpinning the activity of the public authorities.

In politically decentralised states, close cooperation between central and regional tiers of government (\"vertical cooperation\") is institutionally necessary to attain a satisfactory level of political integration. \"Horizontal\" cooperation is also vital to allow regional bodies to work effectively together on cross-sectoral issues. The Spanish constitution provides no explicit guarantee of vertical cooperation. This failure to enshrine vertical cooperation arrangements has impeded the development of an effective model of autonomic cooperation, facilitating the growth of bilateral relations and leading to widespread conflict between state and regions 10 . The need to introduce new cooperation mechanisms and to reduce the conflict between state and regions has prompted constitutional jurisprudence and state legislation to take steps to strengthen vertical cooperation. Spain's constitutional jurisprudence has, on a number of occasions, called on the state and the autonomous institutions to cooperate closely, affirming the importance of the principle of constitutional loyalty between the state and the autonomous communities. This principle seems to be drawn from the principle of federal loyalty ( Bundestreue ) adopted in the German Federal Republic, albeit with significant differences in the way it is applied. 11 10 For a detailed analysis of the significance and development of cooperation in the autonomic state, see the study by Tajadura Tejado, J. (2000), 61-145. 11 However, the principle of autonomic loyalty does not operate in the Spanish system as a legal/constitutional obligation, as it does not strictly impede legal action by the state and regional authorities. This matter is particularly highlighted by Aja, E. (1999), 142-144. ",
        "377 As regards state legislation, there is the above-mentioned Law 30/1992 on the statutory framework for public authorities and on common administrative procedures, which defines cooperation as an essential element in the proper functioning of the autonomic state. This law introduced new cooperation instruments (consortia) and improved the operation of existing ones (sectoral conferences, conventions), without establishing a new model of cooperation relations between the state and the autonomous communities. Horizontal cooperation, in contrast, is explicitly enshrined in Article 145 of the constitution, which states that the statutes of autonomy may stipulate the circumstances, requirements and terms under which the autonomous communities may reach agreements amongst themselves regarding the management and supply of services; this article also establishes the nature of the involvement of the parliament. The statutes of autonomy provide for two different types of agreement (cooperation conventions and agreements) which, theoretically, the autonomous communities can use to regulate any matters of supraregional interest. However, a series of constitutionally prescribed limits impede the effective operation of these instruments and prevent them being used in practice. The biggest limit is control by the parliament, which is exercised in the national interest at the final stage of the framing of agreements 12 . As a result, the autonomous communities have not developed sufficient cooperation to guarantee a satisfactory level of coordination and integration. The growth of bilateral relations between state and regions in the Spanish system has been prompted mainly by the low level of cooperation between autonomous 12 As regards the control exercised by the Cortes in the framing of interregional agreements, see Gutierrez Vecen, C.

However, one should not underestimate the significant progress achieved in recent years, signalling a clear will to improve existing cooperation 13 . Firstly, an effort has been made to give a new boost to cooperation by giving the autonomous communities a role in some state bodies (state councils for telecommunications and universal postal services, the data protection agency). The steady increase in the number of agreements concluded between state and regions \u2013 around 500 per year since 1999 \u2013 is a further encouraging sign. Lastly, the setting-up of bilateral cooperation committees on matters of constitutional jurisdication has significantly reduced the number of constitution-related disputes between the state and the autonomous communities. These committees were set up by Organic Law 1/2000 of 7 January 2000 amending Article 33 of the organic law on the constitutional court, which extended to six months the deadline for submitting a charge of unconstitutionality, so as to facilitate conciliation between the state and regional institutions involved. 1.1.3 Local authority cooperation and associations The local government system is based on Articles 137, 140 and 141 of the constitution, which, as well as making provision for municipalities and provinces, outline the basic principles underpinning their organisation. These articles establish three basic principles for the local government system: a) constitutional guarantee of local self-government, with specified bodies being guaranteed the right to organise their political authority on a territorial basis; 13 Useful information about recent trends in institutional relations between the state and the autonomous communities can be found in the study by Ram\u00f3n C\u00f3lera Leirado, J. (2001), 87-116. ",
        "379 b) the democratic origin and representative nature of local government bodies; c) financial self-sufficiency for the performance of the duties assigned to them. Although the constitution unequivocally guarantees local self-government, practical devolution has been slow as it depends on joint legislative action by the state and the autonomous communities. Under the provisions of Article 149(1)(xviii) and Article 148(2), it is up to the state to lay down basic legislation while the autonomous communities are responsible for fleshing out the detailed measures. This generic breakdown is made clearer by constitutional case law which delineates more precisely the competences of the state and the autonomous communities regarding local self-government. It is thus the task of the state to establish the minimum levels of competence needed to guarantee the autonomy of the local authorities, while the competent legislator (state or autonomous community, depending on the field concerned) has the task of establishing the detailed competences (constitutional court ruling 214/1989). This means giving the state a central role in the setting of local provisions and leaving their implementation to the autonomous communities which, by transferring or delegating matters and duties within their remit, can give the local authorities effective autonomy 14 . The new system of local, municipal and provincial self-government was established under the Local Government Act (LBRL 7/1985), which went some way towards implementing the constitutional requirements regarding the foundations for Spain's new system of local government (Article 149(1)(xviii). The act lists core public services which have to be transferred to the municipal authority (safety, traffic, 14 There is a wide range of autonomous competences which, by their very nature, can be managed efficiently at local level and which should be decentralised in future. These competences are: consumer affairs; ports; education; employment; environment; spatial and urban planning; management of historic and artistic assets; civil protection and the voluntary sector; health; transport and tourism. On this point, see Ram\u00f3n C\u00f3lera Leirado, J. (2001), 108. ",

In order to improve the management of these services, the act establishes other local bodies such as mancomunidades (groups of municipalities), comarcas (districts) and metropolitan areas , which are given responsibility for certain muncipal services and activities in a specified area (generally, a province) 15 . The mancomunidades are voluntary associations of municipalities, set up to jointly manage certain municipal services. The comarcas are municipal organisations directly set up by the autonomous communities to manage certain services in fields that come within their remit. The metropolitan areas are groupings of municipalities set up by the autonomous communities in densely populated areas to jointly manage one or more services. Although the act transferred certain services to local authorities, it did not give them specific competences; these have to be transferred to them by the competent legislative body (state or autonomous community). However, the limited number of laws adopted pursuant to the LBRL since 1985 has not made it possible to complete the local devolution process. In the 1990s a strong local movement arose with the aim of strengthening local government and increasing the competences and financial resources of local authorities to enable them to manage the interests of their communities. 15 A detailed map showing these bodies in each autonomous community can be found on the website of the Public Administration Ministry: http://www.dgal.map.es/cgi- bin/webapb/webdriver?MIval=reel ",
        "381 The Spanish federation of muncipalities and provinces (FEMP) has promoted these demands since 1996, conducting lengthy negotiations with central government and the political parties represented in parliament. These negotiations led to the conclusion of an agreement on local self-government which was finally adopted on 17 July 1998 with a local pact that was signed in the Council of Ministers. The agreement represents a broad political compromise between the state and the local authorities, whereby the signatories undertake to increase the autonomy of the smaller subnational authorities by redefining their competences and strengthening their institutions. However, the legislative bodies have been slow to act on this, preventing the achievement of the objectives laid down in the local pact. The pact has been partially implemented through the provisions of five state acts which, despite extensive coordination and cooperation arrangements, do not implement the intended decentralisation 16 . In practice, conclusion of the local devolution process depends on the adoption of local agreements between autonomous communities and local authorities. The idea is that these agreements should be concluded bilaterally, to enable them to be individually tailored to the specific characteristics and problems of each area 17 . To date, local pacts have only been concluded in Andalusia and Asturias. These two autonomous communities 18 have gone some way towards implementing 16 The relevant acts are: Organic Law 10/1999 of 21 April amending Organic Law 8/1985 governing the right to education; Law 10/1999 of 21 April amending Law 1/1992 of 21 February on the protection of public safety; Organic Law 11/1999 of 21 April amending Law 7/1985 of 2 April on local government and measures for the development thereof; the Law on traffic, circulation of vehicles and road safety; and Law 29/1985 of 2 August on water. 17 For a discussion of the failure to implement the local pact and the development possibilities of local government, see Calonge Vel\u00e1squez, A. (2000), 150 et seq. 18 In Andalusia the laws adopted in implementation of the local pact are: Budget Law 8/1996 of 26 December; Health Act 2/1998; Law 13/1999 of 15 December on public events. In Asturias, the provisions of the local pact are formally enshrined in Law 1/2000 of 20 June establishing the Asturian commission for local government.

The autonomous communities have competences in this field but they have not adopted particular proposals either. However, in the last few years, cities such as Barcelona have strengthened some aspects of city government, opening the way to a new stage in the development of metropolitan self-government with a view to the adoption of a national law on the main cities and urban areas. While the city of Barcelona is geographically a metropolitan area, it is not really one in administrative terms. It has just two metropolitan administrative bodies, namely the transport authority and the water and waste treatment agency, plus the mancomunidad of neighbouring municipalities for the supply of joint services. Recently, however, Catalan political groupings opened negotiations with central government to obtain greater autonomy through recognition of the municipal charter adopted by the Catalan parliament in 1998. On 20 February 2002 the Catalan parties tabled a senate motion calling on the government to adopt a draft special law for the city of Barcelona forthwith, assigning the municipal council \"the capacities and competences\" recognised in the Charter 19 .

The role of political parties and of other forms of associations The drafters of the Spanish constitution deliberately opted for a devolution model that could be further tailored to different requirements, and this has enabled the political parties to play a key role in the evolution of the autonomic state. The two main national political parties \u2013 from 1978 to 1982 the Democratic Centre Union (UCD) and the Socialist Party (PSOE), and from 1982 to 2003 the PSOE and the People's Party (PP) \u2013 have played an important role in the constitutional development of the autonomic state, with the adoption of important political pacts in 1981 and 1992 which wound up the first stage of the autonomy process. The laws adopted in implementation of these pacts merely gave legal status to the guidelines already drawn up by the political authorities. However, although these parties cooperated effectively during the first stage of the autonomy process (1981-1996), there was deep disagreement about the definitive model of territorial organisation which would conclude the political side of the autonomy process. After the general election in 2000, the combined effect of the absolute majority obtained by the PP and the Basque and Catalan demands for national self- determination caused serious instability, which severely tested the current model of 20 To this end, the Public Administration Ministry has recently published a long report on major cities and urban areas ( Informe sobre las grandes ciudades y las \u00e1reas urbanas , which can be consulted at: www.dgal.map.es/cgi-bin/webapb/webdrivermival=cg.

As a result, the PP government and the PSOE opposition (the two parties which underpin the operation of Spain's political system) have focused their debates and disputes on the local government system. In the period 1996-2000, the PP essentially handled the devolution process by means of bilateral negotiations with the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties, but from 2000 onwards with a homogeneous government it was able to uphold the unity of the country \u2013 a policy criticised by the other parties as being anti-autonomy and recentralising. In contrast, the PSOE, which aspires to govern with the future support of nationalist or regionalist parties from autonomous communities such as Andalusia, the Balearic Islands, Catalonia and Galicia, has been obliged to accept proposals from the traditional nationalist groupings. This is confirmed by the paper adopted by the PSOE at the self-government conference of 19 January 2003 which, with an eye to the upcoming elections on 25 May, set the following key objectives for the party's autonomy policy: improvement of the distribution of competences and resources between the state and the autonomous communities; strengthening of intergovernmental cooperation, through the establishment of a conference of the presidents of the autonomous communities; and constitutional reform of the senate, to make it the representative chamber for the autonomous communities 22 . 1.2.1 Regional organisation of political parties and movements At least in the early stages of the autonomic state, the absence of specific legislation limiting political parties' ability to run their own affairs, together with Spain's particular and incomplete democratic history, meant that the Spanish party system at national level was not conducive to the establishment of regionalist structures.

        "385 requirement of \"internal democracy\" (Article 6) has gradually led the parties to adopt a stronger regional dimension by setting up regional conventions and assemblies which play a part in the framing of policy guidelines 23 . 1.2.2 Regional parties Spain's party system is notable for the large number of nationalist and regionalist parties that are represented politically in a single autonomous community. The regionalist stance of these parties makes it difficult for them to make an impression at national level. However, even though these parties do not gain a high percentage of votes in national elections, the high concentration of votes in a given region still enables some of them to obtain a considerable number of seats in the chamber of deputies. Also, from 1993 to 2000, the fact that no party had an absolute majority in the chamber of deputies considerably strengthened the hand of the nationalist parties at national level (for instance, the Catalan and Basque nationalist parties played a key role in the governability of the Spanish state). Although it is difficult to establish a clear line of demarcation between regionalist and nationalist parties, it is possible to distinguish between those political formations which aspire to strengthen the self-government of their autonomous community by working with central government on the one hand, and those whose autonomy demands are so ambitious as to sometimes verge on the unconstitutional on the other. The latter would include some of the nationalist parties, more particularly those on the Basque nationalist front (Basque Nationalist Party (PNV); Eusko Alkartasuna ed Eskerra Batua) which, on 25 October 2003, approved a draft political statute demanding full self-determination for the Basque people. There are other radical 23 As regards the organisation and operation of political parties, see Navarro M\u00e9ndez, J. (1999), 330-370. ",

The cornerstone of this is the economic and social council (CES), which represents the various strands of Spanish society. The autonomous communities pursue economic and social cooperation by setting up their own economic and social councils, the composition and operation of which usually reflect those of the national economic and social council. The establishment of regional economic and social councils has provided an institutional forum for ongoing dialogue and communication between the social partners and representatives of the regional administration, and has ensured that the latter play their role in the planning and implementation of regional socio-economic policy. To this end, the regional economic and social councils have the following advisory duties: a) at the request of the regional government, they issue non-binding opinions and assessments of the main regional socio-economic policy and planning instruments; b) they conduct studies and surveys on topics of particular regional interest; c) they draw up an annual report on general labour market trends and the regional socio-economic situation, which they submit to the governing council of the autonomous community. ",
        "387 Immediately under these regional economic and social councils, virtually all the autonomous communities also have a number of sectoral committees, reporting to the individual authorities. These play a specific intermediary role to facilitate the conclusion of agreements between economic operators and the regional authority. II. DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AT REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL 2.1 Voting in national and regional/local elections In Spain, elections are held every four years, by universal suffrage and direct secret ballot, to elect members of the national, regional and local assemblies. The electoral system for the two chambers of parliament (chamber of deputies and senate) is governed by the constitution and by Organic Law 5/1985 on the general electoral system, which lay down separate rules for each chamber. The chamber of deputies has 350 members and is elected by a proportional system using the d'Hondt method, with party lists for each province. The number of deputies elected for each province is roughly proportional to the population, but such as to ensure that each province has at least two deputies. A party must also obtain at least 3% of the vote in order to take part in the proportional distribution of seats. The senate has 259 members and is also elected every four years, using a two-tier proportional majority system whereby each province 24 elects four senators and a further 51 are elected by the autonomous communities (one for each community, plus one for every million 24 This rule does not apply to the island constituencies, where the number of senators varies from three (Gran Canaria, Majorca and Tenerife) to one (Ibiza-Formentera, Minorca, Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, Gomera, Hierro, Las Palmas) and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, which each elect two senators. ",
        "388 inhabitants, elected by the representative assemblies from among their members according to the rules of the proportional system). The election of the autonomous assemblies is governed by the respective statute of the autonomous community concerned. Under Article 152 of the constitution, the assembly is elected by universal suffrage in accordance with a system of proportional representation that also has to ensure the representation of the various areas of the territory. The representatives of the regional assemblies are elected by a proportional system using the d'Hondt method, with party lists for each province (Andalusia, Aragon, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla-Le\u00f3n, Galicia and Valencia) or region (Cantabria, Madrid, Navarre and La Rioja). The members of the local assemblies are elected using the same system and the same mathematical formula, but with a higher exclusion threshold (5%). A comparison of the results of recent national and local elections shows that Spanish voters have become quite volatile in their party preferences. The results of the 12 March 2000 elections for the chamber of deputies and the senate opened a new electoral cycle with the PP gaining an absolute majority, giving a clear indication of the change which had occurred in the political stance of the Spanish electorate in the preceding few years (see Table 2.1). This change had been foreshadowed by the results of the previous general election (1996), which gave the ",
        "389 PP what was generally termed a \"bitter victory\" 25 . However, the trend was only partly confirmed by the local and autonomous community elections of 25 May 2003, which saw the PSOE push ahead, gaining 200,000 more votes than the PP and securing 34.71% of the vote compared with the PP's 33.84% (see Table 2.2). Whilst this result cannot be interpreted as confirming full support for the PP, the small difference between the number of votes for the two main parties shows that there were no real winners or losers in these elections, which did not substantially alter the balance of political power in the country 26 .

Despite its significantly weakened political position and contrary to predictions, the PSOE held on to 40% of the seats in parliament. The relative majority secured by the PP led it to seek parliamentary support from nationalist parties such as the CIU and the PNV, thereby enabling it to form a government. The special circumstances surrounding the 1996 election and its results led politicians and academics to speak of a \"bitter victory\" for the PP and a \"sweet defeat\" for the PSOE, as the latter saw its superiority confirmed with a 50.9% share of the vote. For more details of the particular conditions which led to the PP victory in 1996, see Ram\u00f3n Montero, J. (1996), 84. 26 The PP won a majority of votes and seats in the regional assemblies of eight autonomous communities: the Balearic Islands, Cantabria, Castilla-Le\u00f3n, Valencia, Madrid, Murcia, Navarre and La Rioja. The PSOE retained its position in the autonomous communities where it had won in 1999, namely Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha and Asturias. The election results do not automatically produce majority governments because in some cases the parties conclude post-electoral coalition agreements with minority parties.

",
        "392 Ignoring fluctuations caused by exceptional political, economic or social circumstances, the average turn-out can be said to be around 70% (Table 2.1). This rather modest level is similar to that of certain other European countries 27 . It is difficult to find a general reason for high or low turn-outs, as it has been shown that turn-out depends more on the economic climate at the time of the election than on structural factors 28 . However, it is fair to say that politico-cultural variables (the level of party identification) and institutional factors (the electoral system) are generally the most important determinants of electoral behaviour and thus also of the level of participation in political life 29 . At national level, both the low level of identification with a particular party and the not fully proportional representation system influence the behaviour of Spanish voters, who prefer to cast a \"useful\" vote, i.e. to vote for a party that can realistically win seats in parliament 30 . This explains why Spanish voters have focused on a limited number of parties and on essentially moderate options. This stance, backed by the low level of party fragmentation and polarisation in the Spanish political system, has fostered a mainly two-party system, fluctuating slightly according to the political cycle, which has led to fairly solid government majorities at national level. 27 On this subject, see the study by De Battisti, S. (2001), 79-108, which points out that a significant number of the countries under discussion have an average electoral turn-out of between 70% and 80% (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, United States). 28 For a discussion of the factors and conditions influencing election turn-out in Spain, see Ram\u00f3n Montero, J. (1996), 84. 29 De Battisti, S. (2001), 83. The author looks at the phenomenon of abstentionism in 19 countries in different cultural areas, analysing regulatory/institutional and historical/cultural factors. 30 On this point, see Ram\u00f3n Montero, J.

In the last three local and autonomous community elections it has stood at 67.08% (see Table 2.4). In such circumstances, turn-out can significantly affect the result. Thus, for example, the higher turn-out of young voters in the 25 May 2003 local and autonomous community elections enabled the PSOE to win by a slim majority (200,000 votes). Alongside lower turn-out, autonomous community elections also tend to see stronger splits into nationalist groupings, producing different voting patterns and different party systems. The existence of strong nationalist parties in some autonomous communities and the presence of regionalist parties in others affects the level of regional party fragmentation. The two-party system is much less in evidence, partly because of the more proportional effects of regional electoral systems and, more importantly, because of the focal position of the regional parties. The autonomous communities which have moved furthest from the two-party system are the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre, where subnational parties have gained over a third of the vote, followed by the Canary Islands and Aragon.

There is a large number of floating voters who can be swayed by the particular circumstances of each election. Votes can also reflect such factors as the influence of the personalisation of politics and clientelist links in Spain's political culture; these factors, combined with the role of individual leaders, are especially influential at local level. 2.2 Forms and instruments of direct democracy The 1978 Spanish constitution gives direct democracy only a marginal role, as the constitutional organisation of the state is based on the principle of representative democracy. This move was probably prompted by the deep suspicion of mechanisms which could lend themselves to populist exploitation in a highly unequal society such as the post-Franco Spain of the late 1970s. The constitution offers the electorate two instruments for direct democracy: submission of bills by \"popular initiative\", and referendums. ",
        "395 The submission of bills by popular initiative (Article 87 of the constitution) is governed by a special organic law (Organic Law 3/1984 on popular legislative initiatives). The initiative must be proposed nationally by at least 500,000 members of the electorate, in the form of a detailed draft bill backed by 500,000 authenticated signatures. It may not cover taxation, international affairs, or areas governed by organic laws or by royal pardon. Popular legislative initiatives are one of the few expressions of direct democracy which also apply at regional level. All the autonomous communities' statutes contain provision for these initiatives and have appropriate legislation governing their procedures, which broadly follow the model laid down in Organic Law 3/1984. However, some autonomous communities have introduced specific procedural provisions. Thus, for instance, while some communities (Aragon, Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Galicia) allow the committee promoting the initiative to defend its proposed bill in front of the full parliament, others provide for a reading of the justificatory text appended to the draft by a member of the president's office in the chamber 31 . The constitution makes provision for various types of referendum at national and autonomous community level. These are governed by Organic Law 2/1980 on the regulation of the various implementing arrangements for referendums. The instruments enshrined in the constitution and regulated by this law are the consultative referendum (Article 92 of the constitution) and the constitutional referendum (Articles 167 and 168) at national level, and the autonomous community 31 Aragon, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands and Galicia have provisions for intervention by the committees promoting the initiative in the respective regional assemblies. In Aragon, the committee can also withdraw its proposal if it considers that it has been modified during the parliamentary procedure. In Catalonia, members of parliament may not sit on the committee promoting the initiative, so as to ensure that the committee is not represented when the bill is going through parliament.

        "396 referendum (Article 151) and the statutory referendum (Articles 151 and 152(2)) at regional level. Constitutional and statutory referendums are obligatory stages in the framing of constitutional laws and statutes of autonomy. Consultative and autonomous community referendums, in contrast, are forms of popular consultation with differing aims, conducted at national and regional level respectively. In constitutional referendums, voting may be optional (for a partial revision of the constitution) or obligatory (for a full revision). In a consultative referendum, the electorate does not vote on the adoption of a piece of legislation but only on key political decisions. These decisions must be specified in the decree calling the referendum, which is issued by the king on a proposal from the prime minister and with the prior authorisation of an absolute majority of the chamber of deputies. Thus, both in the way they are launched and in their non-binding effect, such referendums do not impinge on the primacy of representative democracy in the Spanish political system 32 . Regional referendums involve direct consultation of the people, generally with the aim of guaranteeing the autonomy of the subnational authorities. Autonomous community referendums are a mandatory form of consultation and are part of the procedures for attaining self-government under Article 151 of the constitution. Under this article, subnational authorities which wish to follow this path to autonomy must, in order to gain the widest possible degree of autonomy from the outset, submit their self-government project to the electorate. Although this instrument is a necessary stage in the establishment of an autonomous community, it has only been used four 32 Chimenti, C. (2000), 12 et seq. ",

A statutory referendum under Article 152(2) is not mandatory for reforming the statute of autonomy of all communities, but only of those operating under Article 151 (Andalusia, Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country). Once approved as a draft organic law, and before being promulgated, the reform of the statute must be ratified by a referendum of the electorate of the community concerned. The difference between this case and those covered by Article 143 is that, for the latter, a referendum is an optional but not essential stage in reforming the statute, as it is governed by the respective provisions of each statute of autonomy 34 . Nonetheless, one should not underestimate the political importance of such consultation, firstly because it gives the community a chance to give their views on the draft, and secondly because closing the process by holding a referendum keeps the statute outside the purview of the state 35 . The statutes of autonomy do not provide for any other forms of popular consultation, because of the restriction imposed by Article 149(1)(32) of the constitution which stipulates that only the state has competence to authorise popular consultations through the holding of a referendum. This article is probably one of the main factors limiting the development of direct democracy at regional and local level, as it has prevented the autonomous communities from holding referendums without prior state authorisation. To date, only two of the 17 autonomous communities have introduced provisions on the procedure for holding local referendums (Catalonia in 33 Catalonia and the Basque Country held their referendums to ratify the establishment of their autonomous communities on 25 October 1979. Andalusia followed on 28 February 1980, and Galicia on 21 December 1980. Under Article 151 of the constitution, the referendum must be approved by an absolute majority of the electorate in each province of the region which wishes to set up an autonomous community. 34 This form of referendum has not yet been used for reforming statutes of autonomy. See the 2002 report on La democracia directa en Espa\u00f1a , p.11, www.demopunk.net. 35 On this subject, see Ru\u00edz Rico Ru\u00edz, G. (2003), 75-103. ",

One of the few to have done so is the municipal council of Mieres (Asturias), which in June 2001 adopted a regulation establishing a consultative referendum and laying down the relevant implementing arrangements 36 . 2.3 Community identification with regional and local government There is a strong sense of regional identity in Spain. People generally feel a strong attachment to their community of origin, and this attachment goes hand in hand with general satisfaction about the operation of the autonomic state. This is borne out by a large-scale opinion poll on national and autonomous institutions, conducted in September 2002 by the Sociological Research Centre (CIS), the most prestigious of Spain's official polling bodies, which revealed broad satisfaction with the situation. Of those questioned, 51.3% were completely satisfied with the operation of the autonomic state, while 25% would prefer a state system which gave more powers to the autonomous governments and 5% favoured full autonomy 37 . At the same time, 57% of respondents said that they felt equally attached to Spain and to their autonomous community, while just 13% identified more with their community. The feeling of belonging to a community, a nation or a region is thus of essentially ideological significance and may correspond with a variety of political choices or find expression in a variety of political parties. In practice, however, it can only produce politically important effects if it is reflected in a system of political parties 36 See the 2002 report on La democracia directa en Espa\u00f1a , p.11, www.demopunk.net. 37 These figures are taken from a survey conducted in September 2002, and are published in study 2455 on Instituciones y autonomias , published in Bulletin 31 of the Sociological Research Centre (CIS), January-April 2003.

In any event, the parties do not necessarily reflect the views of their voters when they adopt key political decisions 38 ; these decisions are often the result of medium- or long-term strategies and do not reflect the degree of nationalist feeling present in the autonomous community. Accordingly, the nationalist stances found within Spain are not always faithfully reflected in the political activity of the parties which represent them at institutional level. This explains the existence of very disparate political situations: for instance, some autonomous communities with a strong sense of regional identity (Andalusia, Galicia, etc.) aspire to increase their level of autonomy while fully respecting the principles of allegiance to the constitution and autonomous co-responsibility, while others use this identity as a platform for more ambitious demands for autonomy that sometimes stretch the constitution to the very limit. A case in point is the Basque Country, whose nationalist coalition government approved a draft reform of the statute on autonomy on 25 October 2003 claiming the right to self-determination for the Basque people and hence the establishment of an autonomous state freely associating with Spain 39 . 38 On this subject, see Aja, E. (2003), 189, who considers that grassroots regionalist and nationalist sentiment is not truly reflected in the actions of the political parties tied to them. 39 This is the gist of the new draft tabled by the Basque parliament on 25 October 2003, based on the founding tenets of radical Basque nationalism: the irridentist claim to Navarre, exercise of the right to self-determination, and unconditional sovereignty for the historic Basque community.

        "400 III. REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 3.1 The constitutional framework (economic and financial aspects) The 1978 Spanish constitution contains detailed provisions on economic regulation, including the principles governing socio-economic life, economic rights and freedoms, and the rules governing state intervention in the economy. As well as according wide recognition to economic rights and freedoms, the constitution has a separate title on economic regulation (Title VII \u2013 Economy and finance), which contains rules on state intervention in the economy, regulatory instruments for the planning of general economic activity, and rules on public assets and on taxation and the budget 40 . Taken together, these provisions illustrate the twin \"economicist\" and \"social\" strands of the Spanish constitution 41 . The constitution clearly envisages a mixed economic system that may be termed a market economy, offering plenty of freedom for private initiative while giving the state ample scope for influencing the structure and operation of market dynamics. The constitutional provisions recognising and guaranteeing economic rights that are essential for the operation of a market economy (e.g. Article 33 on private property rights and Article 38 on freedom of enterprise) are flanked by other provisions which give the state wide scope for pursuing social objectives. Many provisions stipulate that state intervention in the economy must be in the general interest. For instance: Article 40 requires the public authorities to promote economic and social progress and a more equitable distribution of wealth; Article 128 recognises public initiative in economic activity and states that essential resources or services may be restricted by law to the public sector and that intervention in companies may be decided upon when the public interest so demands; 40 For an analysis of the economic parameters and models contained in the 1978 Spanish constitution, see Cassetti, L. (2002), 163-169. 41 Ru\u00edz Rico, G. (1994), 96-97 ",
        "401 Article 131 enables the state to plan economic activity in order to meet collective needs. There are thus numerous references to the social dimension of the economic constitution, perhaps expressed most forcefully in Articles 128 and 131 in general clauses widely sanctioning public intervention in the economy as a way of ensuring social justice. As regards territorial decentralisation, it should first be noted that the highly decentralised nature of the Spanish state does not impinge on the principle of market unity, which derives from the application of the principle of political unity (Article 2) to the system for distributing economic competences between the state and the autonomous communities (Articles 148 and 149). The unity of the national economic system is a sine qua non for ensuring that the distribution of economic competences does not hamper the achievement of balanced, even economic development at regional level 42 . This is underscored by Article 138 whereby \"the state guarantees the effective implementation of the principle of solidarity, safeguarding the establishment of a just and adequate economic balance between the different areas of Spanish territory\". This is an important economic provision which enables the state to intervene in economic matters of regional competence in order to ensure a similar level of socio-economic development throughout the country. This provision, together with those mentioned above, confirms that, in a market economy, public intervention is only acceptable when it is in the general interest. The general interest thus becomes a yardstick for assessing economic measures adopted by the state, and for justifying public intervention. Title VII of the constitution also contains detailed financial provisions concerning taxation, the budget and credit operations. As regards financial relations between the various tiers of government, Title VII sets out the general principles governing the 42 On the distribution of economic competences between the state and the autonomous communities, see Malaret, E. (1997), 4045-4079. ",
        "402 fiscal autonomy of territorial authorities, to be interpreted and applied in conformity with the relevant provisions of Title VIII. These latter provisions do not establish a full-scale territorial financing system 43 , but provide a general framework which the legislative bodies have wide discretion to flesh out. The constitution outlines the basic principles of the system, recognising the financial autonomy of the autonomous communities (Article 156(1)), self-government for the management of the respective interests of municipalities, provinces and autonomous communities (Article 137) and the provision of sufficient funds for them to perform the tasks assigned to them (Article 142). Although the principle of regional financial autonomy provides an important guarantee of self-government for the autonomous communities, it remains subject to the principle of coordination and solidarity. Article 156 stipulates that the autonomous communities are to enjoy financial autonomy for the development and exercise of their powers, in conformity with the principles of coordination with the state treasury and solidarity amongst all Spaniards. The requirement for coordination with state resources implies that the autonomous communities' financial activity must comply with general economic policy objectives guaranteeing stability and economic balance 44 . The principle of solidarity, recognised in Articles 2 and 138 of the constitution, explicitly prevents the autonomous communities, when exercising their powers, from adopting any provisions or decisions which run counter to the general interest and fail to take account of the community of interests which binds them. Similarly, the principles of local self-government and financial self-sufficiency, which are an important guarantee of the autonomy of local authorities, are subject to the same conditions as regional financial autonomy, as well as requiring prior implementation of the local decentralisation process. 43 There are many studies of the autonomous community financing system and its development. The most recent include those by Mart\u00ednez-Pujalte Lopez, V. (2000); Sanchez Sanchez A. (2001); Lago Montero J. M (2000); Garcia Morillo, J., P\u00e9rez Tremps, P. and Zornoza P\u00e9rez, J. (1998). 44 Constitutional court ruling 1986, 11 ",
        "403 Alongside the restrictions deriving from these provisions, the constitution places other conditions on the financial autonomy of subnational authorities, for example by limiting their capacity to levy taxes. Although Article 133(2) expressly recognises such a right by stating that the autonomous communities and local authorities may establish and levy taxes, it adds that this must be \"in accordance with the law\". This provision is further restricted by Article 133(1), which states that the primary power to raise taxes is vested exclusively in the state by law. It is thus clear that, although the constitution recognises local and regional tax-raising powers, the task of deciding subnational authorities' level of autonomy in the matter rests with the state. Indeed, Article 157(3) stipulates that the exercise of the financial powers of the autonomous communities, as enumerated in Article 157(1), may be regulated by an organic law. The financial powers of local authorities are also to be determined by national legislation, under Article 142 which expressly defines their sources of financing. As well as regulating financial autonomy and the limits thereof, the constitution establishes two mechanisms for interregional solidarity, with the aim of remedying regional economic imbalance. Article 158 establishes an interregional compensation fund for investment expenditure, designed to redress economic imbalances between regions and implement the principle of solidarity by promoting investment. The article states that parliament is to distribute the resources of this fund among the autonomous communities but does not specify the criteria to be used for this. In addition to this general instrument, the constitution states that the state budget may include an allocation to the autonomous communities \"to guarantee a minimum level of basic public services throughout Spanish territory\". Lastly, the constitution contains an additional provision recognising the historic rights of the territories with ' fueros ' (historic charters). This states that \"the general updating of the fuero system shall be carried out, when appropriate, within the framework of ",
        "404 the constitution and the statutes of autonomy\". The territories with fueros are the provinces of Guipuzcoa, Vizcaya and Alava, which make up the autonomous community of the Basque Country, and the province of Navarre, which currently forms an autonomous community termed a ' comunidad foral' . The additional provision underpins the special financing system of these two autonomous communities, which differs from the general system covering the other 15 autonomous communities. The general financing system for these 15 autonomous communities is governed by Organic Law 8/1980 on the financing of the autonomous communities (LOFCA), which was fully transposed into the statutes of autonomy. A similar finance and tax system thus applies to all 15 autonomous communities. However, this broad uniformity left some questions unresolved, with the result that, during the first 20 years of the autonomic state, it did not prove possible to establish a stable financing system. Although the LOFCA envisaged a transitional system which would apply for the first six years after the adoption of the statutes of autonomy and which would be replaced by a definitive system thereafter, the relevant provisions never actually entered into force. When the six-year period ended, negotiations were opened between central government and the autonomous communities, conducted via the main financial coordination body, the fiscal and financial policy council (CPFF). These negotiations led to the adoption of a financial agreement for the period 1986- 1991. Five-year agreements then became the legislative norm, and continued to be concluded until the adoption of the new financing system 45 . On 27 July 2001 the CPFF adopted a reform of the financing system which ended these ongoing five- yearly political negotiations and instead introduced an automatic mechanism providing a more stable system. The regions thus now have greater autonomy to manage those public services (such as health) which have already been transferred to 45 For an analysis of the three financial agreements adopted for the periods 1986-1991, 1992- 1996 and 1997-2001, see Rodr\u00edguez \u00c1lvarez, J.L. and Gonz\u00e1lez Alonso A. (1999), 221-227. ",
        "405 them or are likely to be in the future 46 . The agreement was implemented by Law 21/2001 of 27 December 2001 laying down fiscal and administrative measures for the new system for the financing of the autonomous communities covered by the common system and the cities with statutes of autonomy (LSFCA). This law provides for the introduction of automatic updating mechanisms and extends the application of the existing finance and tax system to the public sector in its entirety 47 . In the Basque Country and Navarre, the updating of the historic rights mentioned in the additional provision was enshrined in the statute of the Basque Country and in Organic Law 13/1982 on the reintegration and enhancement of the fuero of Navarre (LORAFNA). The Basque statute states that financial relations with the state are regulated by the traditional fuero system of economic covenants and agreements (Article 41(1)), while the LORAFNA states that Navarre's fiscal and economic powers are regulated by the traditional system of economic agreements (Article 45(1)) 48 . These stipulations were put into effect by Laws 12/1981 and 28/1990 respectively regulating the financing system for the economic covenant of the Basque Country and the economic agreement of Navarre. The special financing systems 46 There is provision for three different forms of financing: one for services of shared competence, one for health care and one for social services. 47 For an analysis of the new financing system, see the legislative text published in the Spanish official journal (BOE) of 31 December 2001 and available on the following website: www.noticias.juridicas.com. 48 The terms \"economic covenant\" and \"economic agreement\" refer to the traditional financing systems of the autonomous communities of the Basque Country and Navarre which, although they have been radically altered, still form part of the Spanish legal system. Historically, these systems were the result of a broad compromise between the state and the governments of the two communities, whereby the state gave these communities important tax privileges on condition that they returned a certain proportion of the revenue to the state. Over the last 20 years, these systems have been regularly updated in order to adapt them to the general financing system. Today, the Navarre agreement and the Basque covenant set out the rules governing financial relations between central government and the two communities. ",
        "406 which they established are not set in stone: they have been regularly updated and amended. The Basque economic covenant was recently reformed under Law 12/2002, which introduced a more stable fiscal and financial system for the autonomous community. The Navarre economic agreement has been amended several times in order to update and adjust the financial powers of this autonomous community to the new needs of autonomy policy. The legislative framework for the local government financing system has been built more slowly than the regional system. The broad outline was introduced by Law 7/1985 establishing the foundations of the local system (LBRL). Given the practical impossibility of establishing a permanent system, this law simply laid down basic rules for the financing of the new local government system. A full-scale financing system was only established three years later with Law 39/1988 of 28 December 1988 regulating local finances; this implemented the principles of autonomy and financial self-sufficiency enshrined in the constitution and recognised in Title VII of the LBRL. This law definitively removed local authorities from the financial tutelage of central government and gave local government bodies the possibility of playing an effective part in establishing and managing their financial resources. However, the ensuing finance system did not prove able to adapt to emerging demands for greater local financial autonomy. In order to address these, on 11 July 2001 a committee comprising representatives of the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces (FEMP) and of central and local government was set up with a remit to draft a proposal for reforming local finances. Their proposal was adopted, virtually unamended, as Law 51/2002 on the reform of local finances, which introduces a more stable financing system and gives local authorities greater autonomy and more shared financial responsibility. ",
        "407 3.2 Privatisation and economic regulation The adoption of the constitution in 1978 spurred rapid changes in the Spanish economy which, over a thirty-year period, has shed its relative backwardness and emerged as a leading player that is fully integrated in the international economy. This transformation is faithfully reflected in the degree to which the economy has opened up to foreign trade 49 and in the dwindling role of agriculture within the production system. With the development of its industrial and service sectors, Spain has ceased to be a predominantly agricultural country: the service sector is now the cornerstone of the Spanish economy 50 . At the same time, Spain has become a full member of the international economic system. The first timid move in this direction was the 1959 stabilisation plan, continuing after 1970 with the signature of a preferential agreement with the EEC and culminating in 1986 with the country's accession to the European Union. Since then, the main aim of Spain's economic policy has been real convergence with its European partners, particularly as regards per capita income and employment. This aim was amply achieved in the second half of the 1990s in a context of radical economic change, influenced by the effects of European integration and the liberalisation and privatisation policy that was de facto imposed by the EU in tandem with the setting-up of the single currency and the related requirement for macroeconomic convergence. After a brief period of recession in the early 1990s, the Spanish economy saw a further upturn. 49 As regards foreign trade, the Spanish economy is one of the most open in the western world. In 1990, imports and exports (goods and services) accounted for 33% of Spanish GDP; by 2002 the figure had risen to 63.5%. See the 2002 report drawn up by the Italian Foreign Trade Institute (ICE), available on the ICE website: www.ice.it . 50 The service sector accounts for 64% of productive activity, while manufacturing industry accounts for 36%, with the figure for agriculture and fisheries falling to just 4%. These figures are taken from the ICE's 2002 report on the Spanish economic situation, which can be found on the ICE website: www.ice.it. ",
        "408 The Spanish government's economic policy since 1996 has had three main strands: firstly, economic planning based on reducing the deficit through rigorous control of public spending, keeping a curb on inflation and cutting interest rates, made possible by the credibility of the government's budget policy; secondly, an ambitious liberalisation and privatisation programme for public undertakings, with the primary aim of making the economy more competitive and the private sector more dynamic; and thirdly, a more effective labour market, to be achieved through social dialogue, reducing labour costs, providing more stable employment and developing new paths to employment (on this point, see chapter 3.4 below). The economic liberalisation and privatisation process has thus been conducted during a period of strong economic growth, with the aim of increasing competition and making the business system more efficient. Spain has not adopted any general legislation on privatisation, preferring specific legislation for each sector. Some general guidelines are contained in Law 5/1995 on legal arrangements for the disposal of public shareholdings, although this only concerns privatised undertakings pursuing general interest activities, for which the law introduced prior controls based on the issue of administrative authorisations 51 . The state thus retains a form of control of privatisation operations when they involve companies in which the state shareholding acts as a guarantee of a precise public interest 52 . Against this backdrop, 51 An administrative reform took effect with Law 6/1997 of 14 April 1997 on the organisation and operation of the general state administration. This law rationalised and simplified the regulations governing the institutional administration of the state. It distinguished two separate categories of public body: firstly, autonomous bodies which supply or manage public services and which are regulated by public law; and secondly, public enterprises which supply and manage services and produce goods of public interest that have an economic value. These public enterprises are generally governed by private law, and are only governed by public law if they are granted administrative powers. See Nico, A.M. (2000), p.1311. 52 More specifically, if the state holding is more than 25% and the privatisation concerns more than 5% of the company's capital. ",
        "409 the privatisation process opened in 1996 when the government approved an ambitious privatisation programme laying down principles and guidelines for modernising state undertakings 53 . The programme stipulates that basic privatisation powers lie with the government and the agencies overseeing the privatisation process (SEPI, SEPPA and AIE \u2013 agencies put in charge of state-controlled industrial and other holdings). These agencies are responsible for drawing up the detailed privatisation proposals, in accordance with the agreement and with the government's guidelines. The advisory committee on privatisation then issues an opinion on the proposals. The proposal and the opinion are then forwarded to the deputy prime minister and the economics and finance ministers, who assess them and pass them on to the Council of Ministers for final approval. Following this procedure, the privatisation of public undertakings has adopted two separate paths: direct sale to other companies or private groups, generally in the same production sector, and indirect disposal via the public sale of shares in the company 54 . The first path has been used for the sale of lossmaking companies, and of subsidiaries of some public enterprise groups of lesser importance. With a view to rationalising the business system, small and medium sized enterprises have been sold, and those with no real economic development prospects have been wound up. Indirect sale has been used in the case of large companies occupying a strong position on the national market and offering the prospect of good profits. This has been the path followed for large companies in the electronics, telecommunications and energy sectors, considerably reducing the state's role in Spanish industry. 53 The principles cited in the document are: a) publicity, transparency and competition; b) economic efficiency; c) the need to separate ownership from management; d) all operations to be subject to controls; e) protection of general economic interests and of state assets; f) protection of shareholders' interests; g) continuity of the business plan of privatised undertakings; h) improvement in competence; I) extension of the capital market and of the companies' share base. For an analysis, see Pampillon (1997), 25-34. 54 As regards the practical arrangements for the privatisation process in Spain, see Nico, A.M. (2000), 1281-1311 and Troncoso Reigada, A. (2000). ",
        "410 The large-scale privatisations of the years 1997-2001 brought leading companies in key production sectors onto the stock market and provided a significant amount of revenue for the state. From 1996 to 1998, privatisation revenue accounted for 2.7% of GDP. In 1997 alone it yielded ESP 2,050 million, the equivalent of 77% of the previous year's deficit. After a brief pause in 2001, more privatisations were launched with the sale of six public companies and seven agricultural undertakings belonging to Expasa, yielding EUR 835 million that year. These figures show that the privatisations undertaken in the last ten years have played an important role in Spain's economic recovery; in the five years from 1996 to 2000 the country's growth was above the EU average. Privatisations have done much to help reduce the government deficit, bringing it below 3% of GDP and thus enabling Spain to meet the Maastricht stability criteria and become a founding member of the economic and monetary union. Although Spain has been feeling the effects of the world economic slowdown, its growth rates remain above the developed country average. Its per capita GDP currently stands at around 80% of the EU average. 3.3 The budget of regional and local authorities: the local authority share of national tax revenue Funding for the autonomous communities comes from three main sources: own resources, ceded taxes and transfers. The own resources come from local taxes and from revenue from credit operations and assets. Local taxes account for only a small part of local revenue because, although they can be levied on physical objects already taxed by the state, they must not create double taxation 55 . The same is true of additional levies on state taxes; following the 1997 reform, this concerns all taxes that 55 Constitutional court rulings 37/1987 and 186/1993 ",
        "411 can be ceded. Whilst these could potentially generate a considerable amount of revenue, the autonomous communities have made little use of them because they fear the political consequences of increasing tax pressure. Consequently, the only additional levies so far are those which eight autonomous communities have introduced on gaming 56 . Revenue from credit operations and assets provides an important source of income for the autonomous communities. Such revenue is derived from the sale of assets and from the communities' stake in commercial enterprises, and from the raising of loans. The autonomous communities have made widespread use of credit operations, even though these are restricted by the LOFCA (Article 14). This places a number of conditions on the nature and duration of loans and considerably limits public and foreign loans, which require prior state authorisation. A considerable proportion of autonomous community funding come from taxes ceded by the state; since the entry into force of the 1997 reform, these have formed the main source of finance. Until 1997 this only concerned a small number of taxes, but ceded taxes are now the cornerstone of the whole financing system. The 1996 and 2002 reforms of the LOFCA introduced two major changes in the ceded tax provisions which increase their importance: firstly, a proportion of personal income tax, value added tax (VAT) and most special taxes are ceded, and secondly, the communities are granted certain regulatory rights concerning the ceded taxes. Personal income tax is split into two parts, with 70% going to the state and 30% to the autonomous community in which it is levied. Each autonomous community thus obtains 30% of the personal income tax raised in its territory. As regards VAT and special taxes, the ceded portion must not exceed 35% and is calculated on the basis of consumption 56 It should however be noted that the single-province autonomous communities (Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, Madrid and Murcia) have introduced an additional levy on the municipal tax on economic activities, which was assigned to them under the local finance act (LOFCA). On this point, see Rodr\u00edguez \u00c1lvarez, J.L. and Gonz\u00e1lez Alonso, A. (1999), 231. ",
        "412 within each autonomous community. On the basis of these latter modifications, Article 11 of the LOFCA stipulates that the following state taxes may be ceded: a) up to 33% of personal income tax: b) tax on assets; c) tax on the transfer of assets and registration tax; d) up to 35% of VAT; e) inheritance tax and levies on donations; f) up to 40% of special manufacturing taxes; g) electricity tax; h) special tax on certain modes of transport; i) gaming taxes; j) tax on retail sales of certain fuels. The second change generally increased the autonomous communities' regulatory rights, although these vary with the tax concerned and must not affect the tax base. The autonomous communities are entitled to decide the proportion of personal income tax they wish to levy themselves, while, in the case of consumer tax, regulatory power remains in the hands of the state. The third \u2013 and for a long time, the main \u2013 source of autonomous community funding is financial transfers. This category includes sums returned to the autonomous communities by virtue of their contribution to national tax revenue, and transfers from the interregional compensation fund. The former sums have dwindled considerably since personal income tax was ceded in 1997, as this source of revenue is no longer included. Transfers from the interregional compensation fund have become more important since the adoption of Law 29/1990, which made the fund a more effective instrument of economic solidarity and coordinated its operation with that of the EU's Structural Funds (on this subject, see chapter 5 below). The fund has an annual endowment of 30% of state civil investment, and the monies are distributed among those autonomous communities whose per capita income is below 75% of the EU average. The 2002 legislative reform significantly restructured the system regarding contributions to national tax revenue and divided it into three main sections: a) a \"sufficiency\" fund, calculated on the basis of the difference between the spending needs of each autonomous community and its tax-raising capacity; b) top-up ",
        "413 allocations to those communities that are unable to guarantee the minimum level of spending considered necessary throughout the country for the provision of health and education services; and c) the interregional compensation fund to provide long-term support for structural investment in the less developed regions 57 . The level of these transfers is calculated using a number of socio-economic variables that are listed in the LFSCA and in the law establishing the interregional compensation fund. The two autonomous communities covered by the special financing system currently have broader taxation powers than the 15 \"general system\" autonomous communities. The former thus have regulatory and executive powers over all taxes except those deriving from tax monopolies, import duties and import obligations relating to VAT: these are the exclusive competence of the state. This means that the Basque and Navarre authorities are responsible for the regulation, management, settlement, collection, inspection and revision of taxes levied on their territory. They naturally also receive funding from the sources available to all autonomous communities (interregional compensation fund, EU funds). However, the tax-raising powers of these two communities are subject to specific limitations laid down in the laws enacting the Navarre agreement and the Basque covenant, in the constitution and in the statutes of autonomy. The first limitation derives from the territoriality principle, which is used to determine the distribution of taxation powers between the two communities and the state. In addition, the \"special system\" communities must comply with a series of specific obligations laid down in law or deriving implicitly from the constitution and the statutes of autonomy, such as the obligation to keep the overall tax burden in line with that of the rest of the country. Lastly, the two communities must transfer a certain sum each year to the state to finance their share of those services which they do not provide directly themselves. The exact sum of these transfers, known as the Cupo in the Basque Country and the Aportaci\u00f3n in 57 For an analysis of the new regional contribution system, see Rozas Vald\u00e9s, J.A. (2003), 609-611. ",
        "414 Navarre, is calculated according to a system agreed with central government and revised every five years 58 . The new financing mechanisms have increased the resources available to the autonomous communities in recent years, but these communities' share of public spending remains low, particularly when viewed in the light of the competences they have acquired. It is estimated that in 2003 they will handle 34% of public spending, while 53% will remain in the hands of the central authorities 59 . Local authorities' funding sources can be divided into two groups: own resources and transfers from the state. The first group includes revenue from local taxes, credit operations and smaller sums deriving from fines and financial penalties. The local tax system was radically streamlined by Law 39/1988, which modernised the local tax structure and endeavoured to make local taxation more effective. This led to the creation of three main taxes: property tax, a tax on economic activities and motor vehicle tax. The wider reform also led to the establishment of a tax on building and construction work, which completed the local tax system, together with the reform of the value added tax on urban land. The 2002 reform of local finance further rationalised the local tax system, introducing changes in the way local taxes are regulated. Law 51/2002 exempts most small and medium sized enterprises (around 2,200) from the tax on economic activities and establishes a financial compensation mechanism for local authorities. The property tax law redefines the categories concerned and gives local councils greater autonomy in administering this tax. The second group of funding sources involves local authorities' share of national tax revenue. This had always formed a very important part of the local finance system 58 For more details about the financing system of the Basque Country and Navarre, see De La Hucha Celador, F. (1995). 59 Source: Spanish Ministry of Finance ",
        "415 and has remained so since the 2002 reform, as it has to guarantee the principle of sufficient funding 60 . The mechanism established under Law 39/1988 for determining the local share of national tax revenue takes the form of a predetermined percentage which is index-linked to national tax revenue. It should be noted that the new legislation due to enter into force on 1 January 2004 will partially amend this system and give local authorities a larger share of state revenue. The main towns and cities (provincial capitals and the capitals of the autonomous communities, and towns with at least 75,000 inhabitants) are to have a dual financial structure determining (i) a share of those taxes with potentially high revenue that have been partly ceded to the autonomous communities (e.g. income tax, VAT, special taxes on beer, spirits and wine) and (ii) a percentage share of a supplementary financing fund which will be index-based. For other local authorities, the contribution model will take account of the criteria laid down in the 1988 law and other distribution criteria such as population and certain socio-economic variables. For provinces, single-province autonomous communities covered by the general system and the cities with statutes of autonomy, the contribution system is similar to that for the main cities. Although this reform considerably extends local authorities' financial powers, the percentage of public spending managed by them remains very low. It was estimated that, in 2002, only 13% of public spending would be managed by local authorities. 3.4 Public-private cooperation instruments. The intermediary role of the unions One of the most important forms of cooperation between public and private authorities is enshrined in Article 131(2) of the Spanish constitution, which confers 60 Guarantee of the principle of sufficient funding is one of the main objectives of the reform, explicitly laid down in the introduction to the new Law 51/2002 reforming Law 39/1988 regulating local finances. ",
        "416 on the state the ability to plan economic activity and entitles the socio-economic players to participate in the planning process. The article specifies that \"the government shall draft planning projects in accordance with the forecasts supplied by the autonomous communities and the advice and collaboration of trade unions and other professional, employers' and economic organisations\". Provision is thus made for institutionalised consultations ensuring that socio-economic interest groups play a part in state economic planning. Article 131(2) is closely tied in with Article 9(2), which promotes the participation of all citizens in economic life. These articles form the constitutional basis for official representation of interest groups and the participation of their representative organisations in the government's socio-economic decision-making process 61 . On the basis of these provisions, Law 21/1991 set up the Economic and Social Council as the most important body representing Spanish society. The council is not a cooperation body in the strict sense, but provides a permanent forum for dialogue which, through its advisory activity, enables the relevant groupings to participate in the framing and implementation of Spain's economic and social policy. This institutionalisation of social dialogue creates a culture of cooperation for defending the interests upheld by the socio-economic organisations, with the emphasis on compromise solutions and the prevention of disputes. As well as playing a key role in official cooperation bodies, Spanish trade unions play an active part in economic life through their participation in collective agreements. Over the last 20 years, the unions, government and employers' organisations have negotiated and signed a number of politically important agreements on economic and social matters. The 1980s saw the development of a centralised macro-consultation system, based on the signature of largescale agreements but not actually enabling the social players to participate in the framing and implementation of the government's 61 Montero P\u00e9rez (1999), 102-104 ",
        "417 economic policy objectives (1984 economic and social pact). The partial failure of this negotiation system downgraded consultations to such an extent that, for some time, they were not viewed as a necessary part of the regulatory process. The 1990s saw the development of a sectoral consultation system, focusing on specific objectives and based on bilateral and trilateral agreements depending on the issue at stake. In 1996, after the PSOE's electoral defeat, a new stage in social consultations began, taking the form of negotiated legislation derived from political/legislative negotiations between the state and the sectors concerned. Examples include agreements on vocational training, the 1997 Toledo pacts, which paved the way for social security reforms, and agreements on job stability and part-time work (1998). The most significant agreements came in 1997 and marked a sea change in Spanish employment policy with a move from fixed-term contracts to open-ended ones. This improved job stability and opened up new paths to employment, thereby also improving the operation of the labour market. The social stability secured by the new consultation system played an important part in the economic succcess mentioned in the second paragraph of this chapter. The social consensus between trade unions and employers as regards collective bargaining and employment conditions significantly encouraged the convergence process and helped to ensure the stability needed for economic growth. 3.5 European integration and economic development at regional and local level: management of the Structural Funds Spain's accession to the EU in 1986 played a crucial part in the rapid rise of the relatively underdeveloped Spanish economy. Twenty years of strong economic growth have now put Spain among Europe's leading economies. Since 1986, Spain has benefited significantly from EU financial support for the lagging regions. This has helped it to reduce the wide socio-economic gap between the different parts of the country and thus to achieve faster, more geographically balanced growth. ",
        "418 The EU's main socio-economic cohesion instrument is its Structural Funds. These funds are designed to redress the imbalances between Europe's most industrialised regions and those where development is lagging behind. The main financial instruments are the following: a) the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which seeks to reduce development imbalances by providing direct investment to improve infrastructure and promote local development, human resources and protection of the environment; b) the European Social Fund (ESF), which seeks to prevent and combat unemployment, develop human resources and facilitate their integration into the labour market; c) the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), which promotes rural development and adaptation of farm structures; d) the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), which seeks to achieve a sustainable balance between fisheries resources and their exploitation; e) the Cohesion Fund, which was set up specifically to promote the economic development of the four Member States with a GDP below 90% of the EU average, namely Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. Financing from the Cohesion Fund is only available for individual infrastructure projects regarding trans-European transport networks and the environment. The Structural Funds have focused on three objectives: a) assistance for lagging regions whose per capita GDP is less than 75% of the EU average; b) socio-economic conversion of areas facing structural problems; c) adaptation and modernisation of education and training systems. In Spain, the Structural Funds have provided an important source of finance for the autonomous communities. Many Spanish regions have benefited from Objective 1 funding, i.e. ERDF support for regions whose per capita GDP is less than 75% of the EU average. This funding, together with money from the interregional compensation fund, has considerably aided the economic recovery and structural conversion of such regions as Extremadura and Asturias, which were formerly far less economically advanced than Catalonia or the Basque Country, for example. The amount of funding ",
        "419 received varies from region to region, but on average accounts for 7% of autonomous community revenue. All regions of Spain are also entitled to financing from the Cohesion Fund for projects designed to improve communications or environmental infrastructure. For the 2000-2006 programming period, the EU has allocated Spain a total of EUR 43,087 million. In addition to the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, the following regions are eligible for this funding: Galicia, Asturias, Castilla-L\u00e9on, Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, Valencia, Andalusia, Murcia and the Canary Islands 62 . Spain is to receive EUR 26,591 from the ERDF, 87.7% of which will go to Objective 1 regions and the remainder to Objective 2 regions. Financing from this fund will be used to improve: competitiveness and production facilities (23.9% of the total), communications infrastructure and energy (23.2%), promotion of human resources and employment (18.7%), the environment and sustainable development (16.1%), local and urban development (10.1%), the knowledge-based society (7.9%). Spain will also receive EUR 11.60 million from the Cohesion Fund. These transfers, together with those from the state, enabled the country to launch some EUR 3,300 million of public investment in 2001; EUR 1,850 million of this will be used for transport projects and the remaining EUR 1,450 will be spent on environmental schemes. Overall transfers from the Cohesion Fund have led to the launch of some 281 projects involving over 150 towns and cities and 59 associations of municipalities. 62 Information on the use of the Structural Funds in the new programming period can be found in the report on financial relations between Spain and the European Union for 2003, drawn up by the Ministry of Finance.

LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES 4.1 Management of public services. The regional and local dimension of public services As well as enshrining many social rights, Chapter III of the Spanish constitution guarantees a public social security system for all citizens, with adequate social assistance and benefits for those in need, especially in cases of unemployment (Article 41). As a result, Spain has set up a comprehensive social security system which can be defined as \"solidarity-based\", offering universal coverage and a sufficient level of benefits, open to all, with cover not dependent on contributions (Law 26/1990 on non-contributory benefits) 63 . In the last twenty years, the social security system has pursued three broad aims: to guarantee the free, equal and open development of individual and collective rights; to offer sufficient resources to cover 63 Until 1990 the social security system only covered certain categories of employment. Law 26/1990 introduced non-contributory benefits and was thus an important step in securing universal social security cover. See Rodr\u00edguez Ramos, M.J., Gorelli Hern\u00e1ndez, J. and Vilches Porras, M. (2002), 150 et seq. ",
        "421 all social needs, inter alia through the payment of differentiated benefits; and to eliminate the causes of social exclusion. Social services are run by special national bodies and joint services such as the national social security institute, national health institute and national employment institute, whose task is to deliver the necessary benefits and services (social, health, economic) to the public. It should be noted that following the transfer of health matters to the autonomous communities, most of the duties of the national health institute are now carried out by the regional health services. The social security system also provides a series of specially tailored benefits and support for groups with particular needs (e.g. families, women, young people, certain categories of worker, people with physical or mental disabilities). For each category, government bodies approve a specific programme of measures and objectives, to ensure that the requisite services are available; these may be run by public national and local bodies or by private bodies that fulfil the technical and organisational conditions laid down in the relevant legislation. For the new programming period, the government has approved integrated programmes for family support (2001-2004) 64 , young people (2001-2003) and social integration (2001- 2005) 65 . Each programme sets out objectives and strategies to guide the future work of the public authorities. The social security system is not the only source of social services. Assistance is also available under the welfare system, which is quite separate and is run by the 64 The family support programme has four objectives: to improve the quality of family life; to promote solidarity between generations; to support the family as a guarantor of social cohesion; and to support families facing particular problems. For more details about this programme, see the website of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs: www.mtas.es/dgas/Familia/PlanIntFam/htm. 65 For an analysis of this programme, see the website of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs: www.mtas.es/dgas/InclusSoci/IIPlan. ",
        "422 autonomous communities 66 . The welfare system caters for specific needs which are not covered by social security; this form of support is defined in the autonomous community legislation as a \"form of generic protection for persons in a state of need, granted within the economic limits of the body providing it\". Over the last twenty years, the autonomous communities have drawn up an extensive corpus of legislation on social services, providing a comprehensive public system. They have taken exclusive responsibility for welfare support and have built up egalitarian systems promoting mutual support and free, full development for all 67 . To this end, the autonomous communities concentrated first on the planning of social, health, educational and cultural services, and secondly on coordination with the provincial and local authorities to improve service delivery. Among the benefits widely available in the autonomous communities, special mention should be made of the \"social wage\" provided under the legislation of all communities. This is a public service designed to facilitate the social reintegration of those who lack the economic resources to meet their basic needs. Recipients must be over 25 years old and under the legal retirement age, and must have been resident in the community for a specified period. They are also required to provide proof of their deprived circumstances. Payment of the social wage is then conditional on participation in activities to promote social and vocational reintegration. Some communities also provide special aid for particularly urgent cases and for wider community development programmes; in no cases, however, may these schemes offer more than the legal minimum wage 68 . The autonomous communities also provide special services for families, minors, young people and the elderly, people with disabilities, and other groups. Autonomous community legislation has shown particular concern for the situation of abandoned minors, and the autonomous authorities have been 66 The distinction between social security and welfare was addressed by supreme court ruling 146/1986. On this point, see also Garc\u00eda N\u00fa\u00f1ez Serrano (2002), 131-133. 67 Perze Sola, N. (2003), 148 68 See Galicia autonomous community Law 9/1991 on basic social integration measures. ",
        "423 assigned a number of competences regarding their care. These include responsibility for ascertaining abandoned status, issuing a reasoned declaration to that effect and an authorisation for taking the minor into care, and looking after him or her if legally so required. In practice, responsibility for minors always rests with the person acting in loco parentis , but in exceptional cases the autonomous authority has to step in. To complete the range of services available for minors, it should be noted that the autonomous and local authorities are also responsible for ensuring that they have access to healthcare, education and cultural services, providing special forms of assistance via specialist bodies and schools. For young people in general, the autonomous institutions have adopted a direct support framework with the setting-up of youth councils. These are public bodies which seek to encourage young people to contribute to the political, social, economic, cultural and sporting life of their local community. Lastly, for older people, a number of special services have been set up: day centres, subsidised meals, domestic help services and sheltered housing. Other services include free transport, social tourism, special healthcare and any other services designed to improve quality of life. Senior citizens' councils, which are public bodies legally entitled to represent their members, are active in this field. The autonomous communities have developed their own welfare systems, and the services are run in close cooperation with the local authorities. Article 25(1) of the Local Government Act (Law 7/1985 of 2 April 1985) stipulates that, to take care of their interests and in the context of their competences, the municipalities may promote activities and provide services that help to meet the needs and aspirations of the community. Article 25(2) goes on to state that the municipalities, in accordance with national and autonomous community legislation, are to exercise competences regarding the provision of social services and the furtherance of social integration. Article 26(1)(C) gives municipalities with over 20,000 inhabitants the obligation to provide social services. The main instrument for boosting cooperation between autonomous communities and local authorities in the delivery of social services is the ",
        "424 joint programme for local corporation provision of basic social services. Under this programme, national and regional authorities undertake to fund social welfare schemes which are then run by the local authorities. This covers all basic social services, which are run from specialist social service centres equipped with the requisite technical facilities and specialist staff. The centres provide the following basic services: information, advice and support, domestic help, and assistance with social integration. Thus, as regards the running of social services, the autonomous and local authorities provide services either directly or via specialist autonomous agencies. The latter are public bodies with their own legal personality and assets, governed by Law 6/1997 of 14 April 1997 on the organisation and operation of the general state administration. It should also be pointed out that the benefits provided under the state social security system may be supplemented by subscribing to private insurance schemes, which exist freely alongside the state system. 4.1.1 The impact of privatisation The large-scale privatisations of the years 1997-2001 brought leading companies in key production sectors onto the stock market (electronics, telecommunications, postal services, electricity, the coal industry) and transferred the management of many utilities either directly or indirectly to private operators. At regional and local level too, privatisation encouraged closer cooperation between the authorities and the private sector for the running of those public services which do not involve the exertion of authority 69 . One of the main avenues for privatising the running of these 69 The public services which can be managed indirectly, through cooperation with the private sector, are those which do not involve such expressions of authority as the power to dictate legal provisions, the use of force, a policing role or the guarantee of public wellbeing. On this point see Cerrina Feroni, G. (2002), 110-112. ",
        "425 services has been the setting-up of public-private joint stock companies. This can be done in one of two ways: either the regional authorities acquire a stake in existing companies so as to gain share capital, or new companies are set up with private capital, through share issues. As a rule, the operation of these companies comes under private law, which is why this form of organisation is chosen. The Spanish supreme court (ruling of 24 March 1987) has defined joint companies with local involvement as bodies entirely regulated by commercial law, with a separate legal personality which is distinct from that of their partners. Local authorities have exactly the same status in these companies as the other partners and cannot use their public nature to arrogate more powers than those explicitly laid down in the statutes and in commercial law. In addition to the formation of companies, a number of other forms of cooperation between the public and private sectors have been widely used for the running of public services. These involve such formulas as contracting out, \"interest-related management\" and leasing, all offering more flexible forms of public-private sector relations. Contracting out means that the local authorities hand over the management of a public service to a private party or body, through a contract in which the latter takes over the economic risk of the activity. Interest-related management refers to a special form of public-private management of a public service, whereby the company and the authority share in the exploitation of a service according to a breakdown specified in the contract. The company has a guarantee of cooperation from the authority and a fixed income enabling it to fully recoup its initial investment costs. In addition, if the profits exceed the guaranteed minimum, the company can receive a share of them, on condition that it uses them to develop its public service provision 70 . Leasing is a contract offering an entrepreneur the use of municipal facilities to provide a service. It may therefore cover services whose facilities have been 70 For a detailed explanation of interest-related management, see Cerrina Feroni, G. (2001), 825. ",
        "426 established by the local authority or are owned by it. The spread of such schemes has led to greater private sector involvement in the running of public services and extended the application of private law in this area. The exercise of these economic activities must fully comply with competition rules. Spain's competition law (Law 16/1989 on the protection of competition and Law 3/1991 on unfair competition) forbids unfair economic practices that would distort competition, and lays down mechanisms for controlling economic concentrations that have implications for the national market and could therefore be against the public interest. Two administrative bodies are responsible for upholding competition rules: the competition tribunal and the competition office. V. THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON REGIONAL AND LOCAL DEMOCRACY 5.1 Computerisation of public administration (projects, experience and results) Spain's public authorities have greatly increased their level of computerisation in recent years. The number of computer workstations (fixed terminals with keyboard and screen) is now 322,578, with 37.4% of these installed at the Ministries of Finance, Labour and Social Affairs, and Justice. The greatest number is found in the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. On average, the state authorities have around 63 workstations for every 100 employees. In 2001, they spent EUR 746,763,000 on the purchase of computer goods and services, representing around 2% of the state's ICT budget allocations 71 . 71 Report on Spain by the international observatory on information technology in public administration, pp. 17-18. ",
        "427 The main instrument for computerising the public authorities is the \"administrative intranet\" (IA) scheme, which aims to create basic communications infrastructure and telematic services and to facilitate the integration of existing IT systems. The network should link up all the state authorities, the autonomous communities and the European Union. The first steps in the scheme were made in 1998, and the launch was preceded by various other projects: the ISTMO message service (organisational support system for message processing), the \"one-stop\" portal, electronic contracting and tendering project and the interministerial communications network, which formed the initial core of the IA. The IA is based on a high capacity network guaranteeing data reliability and encryption in all transmissions. All ministries and directorates can connect directly with the main IA network through its connector areas, or can have their own territorial network. There are also plans for a remote access centre to link the authorities of the autonomous communities, local authorities and the European Union. Lastly, the IA is to provide a joint service centre to oversee the communications network and run centralised services (central DNS, e-mail, central directorate). The aims of the IA scheme are to rationalise the use of communication networks; increase the interoperability of the communications infrastructure, services and information systems of central government and of its local offices; guarantee infrastructure and service security; facilitate the implementation of sectoral and horizontal applications; and prevent technological obsolescence. 5.2 Procedures and safeguards for electronic voting. The role of electronic discussion forums. The rise of local television networks In Spain, the technical and legislative framework for devising and piloting new forms of \"e-democracy\" has changed considerably in recent years. The first parliamentary committee on the Internet and new information technologies, proposed by PP senator ",
        "428 Esteban Gonz\u00e1lez Pons, was set up in 1998. Four years later, on 11 July 2002, the Spanish parliament adopted Law 34/2002 (published in official journal 166 of 12 July 2002) on information society services and e-commerce. No major new legislation was introduced in the intervening four years, apart from a few initiatives on related matters such as electronic signatures. However, the application of new technologies to political and institutional life has led to important changes which open up new opportunities for increasing democracy. The Info XXI project presented by Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Maria Aznar in January 2000 with the aim of extending the information society throughout the population has not yet been fully implemented but has still had a significant impact. There have been major steps to increase the computerisation of the public authorities: installation of the first version of the Public Administration Ministry's \"citizens' portal\" 72 ; the launch of an ERDF operational programme on the information society 73 to promote cooperation between autonomous communities and local authorities in the implementation of online programmes and projects 74 ; promotion of new IT instruments in the health and public administration sector; and the launch of new programmes to create \"digital towns and cities\". In this context, there is growing political interest in exploring and applying new e-democracy tools such as electronic voting, online access to political information and telematic public discussion forums which give the public the opportunity to play a direct role in political life. 72 www.administracion.es 73 The project sets up the first pubilc enterprise body: www.red.es. 74 Other important initiatives in this field include the following: the electronic civil register; the health portal; the possibility of paying taxes directly via Internet using the webpage of the tax agency; and social security on the web. For a detailed analysis of these instruments, see a full report on the state of eGovernment at: www.cibersociedad/rediris.es/congreso. ",
        "429 The Law governing the electoral system (LOREG) makes no provision for any form of voting other than the traditional ballot paper and so implicitly excludes electronic voting. Any variant of electronic voting expressly runs counter to this law. Nonetheless, some companies have recently proposed electronic voting systems that would make it possible to computerise voting procedures without necessarily having to alter the ballot paper. An association formed by the government, the University of the Basque Country and a group of companies (Ibermatica, Ikusi and Hunolt) has presented a project entitled Demotek: Technology in support of democracy which proposes an electronic voting system with the undeniable advantage of retaining the traditional ballot paper and thus not infringing electoral law, as only the vote- counting and data-processing procedures are computerised. The absence of legislation on the matter makes it difficult to predict future developments. However, it should be noted that some forms of direct democracy have already been piloted at local and regional level, with the use of electronic procedures to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of a country-wide application. Electronic voting was first piloted in the Catalonia local elections on 19 December 1995, in two electoral wards in Barcelona and in the town of Angl\u00e9s (Girona), with a view to comparing the effects in two different types of area. Votes were cast in specially equipped polling stations, using electronic cards with a magnetic strip 75 . Two other major pilot schemes have been conducted in Catalonia. The first, which was launched in 1998, is Democracia.web , una experiencia de democracia electr\u00f3nica en Catalu\u00f1a 76 , a telematic public discussion forum in which members of the public can hold discussions in real time with their political representatives on topics being debated in parliament. The forum thus helps them keep up to date with parliament's legislative activity and gives them a regular discussion link with their 75 For more information about the use of electronic voting in Catalonia, see: Arnaldo Alcubilla, E. and D'Ambrosio i Gom\u00e1riz, A. (1998), 159-169. 76 www.democraciaweb.org ",
        "430 representatives. The second project, Consensus 77 , is a pilot scheme for developing Internet-based interactive communication between voters and their representatives, so as to inform and involve people in debates on issues of public interest. A further electronic voting trial was held in Galicia, in two electoral wards in Santiago de Compostela, using two different voting systems in order to ascertain which offered the greatest economic and practical benefits. Finally, the recent reform of electoral law in the Basque Country opens the way to new developments in this field, as this autonomous community will now be able to use electronic voting in its coming autonomous elections. Lastly, mention should be made of regional projects setting up \"digital towns\", designed to speed up the computerisation of smaller population centres. The Andalusia autonomous community offered the inhabitants of the town of Jun free Internet access throughout the year 2000, and the local council backed this up with a computer literacy course. This was followed by the town's first eGovernment initiative, on 28 May 2000, in which local people helped to prepare the agenda for a plenary meeting of the council, and were able to participate and speak in the meeting in a virtual manner. In November 2001, Jun also hosted the first world conference on teledemocracy, funded by the European Commission. In 1996, the community of Valencia chose the small town of Villana for a fullscale electronic voting trial, as part of a wider project designed to boost the computerisation of regional government. The whole of the town's electorate voted using special electronic facilities with an electronic card. Electronic voting was voluntary and was conducted in parallel with traditional voting; it had no legal effect. More recently, the Spanish federation of municipalities and provinces has launched a new project, in cooperation with the Ministry of Science and Technology, entitled ImNoTep , designed to ensure that 77 http://terrabit.icnet.es/consensus ",
        "431 75 Spanish municipalities with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants have access to the information society by 2006 78 . 5.3 Information technology and changing public services In Spain, the turning point in the strategy for developing the information society came with Info XXI: An information society for all , a paper drawn up by the state secretariat for telecommunications and the information society and adopted by the government in 1999. In implementation of this paper, on 16 January 2001 the interministerial committee on the information society and new technologies approved the Info XXI Action Plan , which sets out a wide range of initiatives for boosting the development of the information society 79 . The plan covers the information society and e-administration, and includes regulatory measures, activities and projects with specific objectives, timeframes, funding and human resources 80 . The plan's main objectives are: a) promotion of the ICT sector, completion of the deregulation process and promotion of competition; b) introduction and development of eGovernment; c) improvement of individual and business access to the information society. These three objectives have been pursued through 300 projects, 21 of which come under specific ministries. The eGovernment initiatives included in the 2002-2003 Action Plan have a budget of around EUR 13 million 81 . The main eGovernment projects are as follows: 78 For an analysis of this project see the website of the Spanish federation of municipalities and provinces: www.femp.es. 79 A full analysis of these initiatives and of the growth of the information society can be found in the detailed report on Spain by the international observatory on information technology in public administration. 80 For an analysis of the Info XXI Action Plan (2001-2003), see website www.infoxxi.es. 81 Report on Spain by the international observatory on information technology in public administration, page 6.

More particularly, the CSI carries out studies and draws up recommendations on IT issues 88 and sets general criteria for system and network safety. To this end, it advises parliament on the drafting of laws in this sector and proposes and disseminates technological requirements and standards for public systems. Political responsibility for the management and coordination of the government's eGovernment initiative lies with the Ministry of Science and Technology and the interministerial committee on the information society and new technologies, which monitors the progress of the projects. 88 The CSI issues a two-yearly progress report ( Iria ) on the computerisation of the public authorities and monitors the implementation of the Info XXI Action Plan by a) issuing an annual evaluation report on the implementation of the ministries' main eGovernment projects; b) issuing reports on developing projects (three-monthly); and c) keeping an updated database on the progress of the individual ministries' projects.

        "441 SWEDEN INTRODUCTION Sweden has an ancient constitutional tradition. Some accounts of the decision-making process date back almost to pre-history, and are evidence of a desire to subject the wishes of the monarch to some form of popular consultation 1 . While the authenticity of some of these accounts is open to question, there is firm documentary evidence of a written constitutional corpus from the 14 th century, when a Landslag (Land Law) was adopted (and revised in the following century). This was a sort of Royal Statute, containing provisions on the election of the monarch, his duties to the State, his right \u2013 under certain conditions \u2013 to raise taxes, and on the election of Councillors and the functions of the Council of State. The 16 th century saw the adoption of further documents \u2013 on matters of succession in particular \u2013 and these consolidated the monarchy as an institution, against a backdrop of growing conflict between the original principle of the division of powers and the centralisation of state power, which tended towards absolutism. Following the death of King Gustav II Adolph, the need to provide political guidelines for some court regents led to the adoption in 1634 of an Instrument of Government, under the supervision of the eminent statesman Axel Oxenstierna. This can be generally regarded as an administrative document which laid the foundations for the power system by incorporating the previous Royal Statute, yet without superseding it. The Instrument of Government was also applied later, during other regencies. In 1660 an important provision was added, stipulating that the four \"Estates\" of Parliament 1 More information on the constitutional history of Sweden can be found on the Riksdag website, in particular in the Introduction to the current Swedish Constitution, which comprises several texts: www.riksdagen.se/english/work/fundamental/introduction ",
        "442 had to be convened every three years. The Swedish Parliament ( Riksdag ) now became, for the first time, a regular organ of the State, and no longer a body that met only when the King happened to feel it appropriate. Making the Riksdag part of the institutional framework was an important step, as it managed to assert itself conclusively. However, for a time it was only able to mitigate the trend towards absolute autocracy, particularly under Carl XI and Carl XII, who tried to show that the monarchy was not bound by any Instrument, and could alter it arbitrarily. It was not until 1720 that the pendulum swung back towards the constitutional position of Parliament, in line with an anti-absolutist, enlightened mentality that was rapidly taking hold throughout Sweden. According to an Accession Charter of 1720, the King agreed to govern \"with, and thus not without, much less against, the advice of the Council\". He had two votes in the Council, plus a casting vote. If he found himself in a minority, he had to adopt the majority view \"as being in all probability the safest and best\". An embryonic form of cooperation \u2013 in the modern sense of the term \u2013 was established between the powers, insomuch as nominations for Council membership had to be made by an appropriate Parliamentary committee. Initially, the King could exercise freedom of choice, but this eventually lapsed. The form of government became even more parliamentary in nature when the Riksdag was given the power to dismiss a member of Council, thus enabling changes to the Executive to be made whenever there was a new parliamentary majority following an election (in the 1700s there was already an emerging distinction between two opposing groups of parliamentarians). In addition to its institutional organisation, Swedish constitutional history was also innovative in terms of rights. The first Freedom of the Press Act dates back to 1754, and it remains \u2013 albeit in a radically amended form \u2013 an integral part of the constitutional corpus of the nation. The Act established, inter alia , the principle of public access to official documents. The office of Parliamentary Ombudsman dates ",
        "443 back to the same year, when the Riksdag also decided that the Chancellor of Justice should be appointed by the Riksdag and not by the King. At the same time, a clear line was drawn for the first time between ordinary legislation and the Constitution \u2013 at least at procedural level \u2013 when it was established that amendments to the legislative acts composing the Constitution had to be approved by two consecutive parliaments. The happy, bloodless history of the Constitution outlined above was interrupted by a coup d'\u00e9tat carried out by Gustaf III in 1772. This turned the clock back towards autocracy and Sweden became embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars (as a result of which Finland had to be ceded to the Russian Tsarist Empire). The State took a more liberal turn in 1809, when the Regeringsform or \"Instrument of Government\" was adopted, and this remained in force until 1974, albeit with several major amendments. The initial reading of the instrument gave the King the lion's share of executive power, whilst his Council was relegated to a subordinate role (this was countered by a later development, whereby Ministers could not act without the confidence of parliament). Legislative power was shared between the King and the Riksdag in matters of constitutional, civil and penal legislation, while some administrative matters remained the sole prerogative of the monarch. Parliament, however, held sway over fiscal and budgetary matters. The 1809 Instrument marked the starting point for the by now inexorable transition towards liberalism, and \u2013 later on \u2013 towards democracy. From 1840, ministries were coordinated with a view to establishing a single constitutional government. In 1866, the old parliament of the Four Estates was definitively replaced by a two-chamber Riksdag (the single chamber system was only introduced in 1969, more than a century later). Between 1909 and 1921 suffrage was extended, finally becoming universal and equal (first male, then female), while the growth of party organisations made a proportional electoral model necessary. ",
        "444 While these acts were being successively adopted, the Regeringsform underwent a radical transformation in terms of its application, in particular via conventions that changed the original shape of a purely monarchical constitutional government into a parliamentary one 2 . During the 20 th century, and especially from the Second World War onwards, it had become clear that the changes in society and the political system underpinning it were putting pressure on the provisions of the 1809 text, and in the end, irretrievable breakdown was unavoidable. However, the constitutional reform process was lengthy and took place in fits and starts, starting in 1954 and ending with the new Regeringsform in 1974. Since the beginning of the 1970s, only some partial amendments have been possible. I. THE EVOLUTION OF FEDERAL/REGIONAL DYNAMICS. THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 1.1 The organisation of the State in the last thirty years. Historical profile Sweden is a consolidated democracy and has ancient constitutional traditions. In relatively recent times the unusual organisational structure of the State was confirmed as spreading all constitutional matters over four, and subsequently three, separate Acts, rather than bringing them together in one single Act. In Sweden, the \"Constitution\" refers to a package of legal acts comprising the \"Instrument of Government\" ( Regeringsform ), the Act of Succession, and the Freedom of the Press Act, whilst the Riksdag (single chamber parliament) Act is an important constitutional source text. In reality, however, most constitutional material is covered 2 Biscaretti di Ruffia, P. (1994), pp 274-275. ",
        "445 by the Regeringsform , adopted in February 1974 and which entered into force in 1975 (replacing the corresponding act dating back to 1809) 3 . From 1971, however, numerous changes began to be made to the shape of Swedish government, having matured slowly over previous decades. From that year, in particular, the old upper house of parliament was abolished, giving rise to the single- chamber parliament currently operating in Sweden, and the Riksdag 's electoral period was reduced to four years. The constitutional text of 1975 is particularly noteworthy for its reduction of the role of the monarch to a purely honorary, formal one, removing all the \"constitutional\" features of the Swedish monarchy and replacing them with a wholly parliamentary set-up. The extremes to which this was taken can be seen from the fact that the King no longer signs legislation; he does not even have the formal power to appoint the Prime Minister (who is appointed by the President of the Riksdag , and only on condition that the proposal is not rejected by an absolute majority of the Assembly); he no longer attends the Council of Ministers; he does not inaugurate Riksdag sessions by reading the \"Crown speech\", as was the custom in the past, along the lines of the British tradition. On the strictly normative level, then, Swedish government is a strongly parliamentary system in which the Riksdag predominates as the control centre for government activity. This does not imply some kind of \"assemblyism\", since it is in fact possible to have minority governments \u2013 as has indeed happened repeatedly \u2013 and the Riksdag can cause a government to fall, leading to the immediate dissolution of the government. 3 For an overview of recent Swedish constitutional events, see Holmberg, E, Stjernquist, N. (1985); Lauvaux, P. (1986). ",
        "446 Alongside the parliament, however, the political parties have \u2013 indirectly \u2013 a privileged position, which they must express through parliament itself. This major role can be found in Chapter III of the Constitution, which introduces proportional representation for Riksdag elections, and expressly provides that the seats must be allocated between the parties. This stable position afforded to the parties is, in fact, a key feature, and is a result of the extraordinary way the party system is anchored in the political history of the twentieth century. With reference to the party system, two apparently mutually exclusive phenomena have always coexisted: two opposing blocs (one on the left, dominated by the Social Democrats, and one comprising the three or four parties of the \"conservative\" bloc) both aspire to government in what appears to be a competitive model of democracy, yet this combines with consensus politics in that the consent of all parties \u2013 including the opposition \u2013 is required for fundamental decisions on governance, such as any revision of the Constitution. Moreover there has always been a strong neo-corporatist element to Swedish politics, whereby a large number of decisions, particularly in social and economic affairs, are only adopted following highly formal consultation procedures \u2013 including at the legal level \u2013 with the \"social partners\" (especially the trades unions). Finally, the impact EU accession has had on the way the Swedish State is organised cannot be ignored. Accession was the culmination of many long years of discussion and debate, but only came about in January 1995 as a result of the referendum held in November of the previous year (and won by a slim margin, with 52.2% voting \"Yes\"). Despite the fact that most parties have a generally favourable attitude towards European integration, it must be said that \u2013 for the moment \u2013 some aspects of the EU are not seen in an equally positive light. This is particularly true of joining the euro and the European Monetary System, when 56.1% of voters voted \"No\" in the September 2003 referendum. In Sweden it is widely believed that the main reason for ",
        "447 voting against the euro, alongside fears for the national currency, was that other aspects of residual national sovereignty would have been put at risk, especially welfare policy, although the latter was sized down after the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s. 1.1.1 The evolution of regionalisation/federalisation procedures and decentralisation processes. The most recent institutional developments Sweden has a long tradition of respect and consideration for its local authorities. This tradition has not focused so much on the regional level of devolution as on the municipal and county level (until only recently the City Council and the County were the only government authorities, in addition to the national parliament, to have deliberative assemblies elected by direct suffrage). The municipalities and counties were given important powers in the area of services of general interest, particularly when the welfare state was at its peak. The municipalities have been tasked with running the bulk of the school system and support services for childcare and senior citizens, whilst the counties look after healthcare in general, in addition to transport. Traditionally, the regions were viewed in an exclusively historical, cultural context, and have only been included in the institutional framework to a small extent. There is currently a comprehensive law governing the organisation of the municipalities and the counties (Local Government Act, Sfs 1991: 900, entered into force in January 1992, subsequently amended) 4 . In terms of devolution, this law still provides for the traditional division into Municipalities and County Councils (Art. 1). The legal basis for other forms of devolution is to be found in Art. 20 of the Act, which enables 4 This can be studied in more detail (also in English) on the Department of Justice website, www.justitie.regeringen.se/propositionermm/ds/pdf/ds2000_72.pdf. ",
        "448 Municipalities and Counties to set up \"federations\" of equal agencies in order to best perform the tasks entrusted to local government. These federations have their own statute and an Assembly elected by the assemblies of federation members, as provided for in the statute (Art. 23). The accession of Sweden to the European Union in 1995 seemed to require changes to the Swedish model of local government in order to adapt to the continental model. However, this operation has yet to be completed, and there is still controversy as to whether it should be done or not. In the second half of the 1990s, pilot projects were launched to identify new local government areas in the counties of Kalmar, Gotland, Sk\u00e5ne and V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland. The main objective of these projects was to encourage greater democratic participation at local level, but beyond the narrow municipal level. In 2001 the Swedish Parliament decided to continue the pilot projects until 2006, but limited to Sk\u00e5ne and V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland 5 . It can be seen, then, that an asymmetric model of local government had been taking hold in Sweden for some years, with some experiments in regionalism in one part of the country, while elsewhere the old system remained in force, most recently regulated by the Local Government Act of 1991. The Riksdag then decided to enable any other county that so wished to set up \"Regional Development Councils\", comprising all the municipalities in the area involved, and also \u2013 on a voluntary basis \u2013 the relevant County Council. However, rather than being pilot projects, these bodies are definitive in nature. On the basis of this plan, eight Regional Development Councils have since been set up, including the former pilot regions of Kalmar and Gotland. Efforts are currently underway to set up eight similar bodies. The areas covered by the Regional Development Councils (Kalmar, Gotland, Blekinge, Halland, \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, S\u00f6dermanland, Uppsala, Dalarna) enjoy a form of autonomy somewhere between that of the pilot regions and the traditional counties, in the sense that legally speaking they are statutory joint authorities ( Kommunalf\u00f6rbund in Swedish), but they do not have locally elected assemblies. It could therefore be 5 Cf. Regional Development in Sweden , www.lf.svekom.se/tru/RSO/Regional_development_in_Sweden.pdf ",
        "449 said that, while they have won areas of competence compared to the national controls that the old counties are subject to, they do not enjoy similar independence from their constituent parts (and from the municipalities in particular). The two pilot regions have, in the meantime, set up directly elected regional councils. Like the traditional provincial-type counties, they continue to manage medical and health services, but in addition they have full responsibility for regional development policies, which in the past had been \u2013 as they continue to be in the \"traditional\" provinces \u2013 the prerogative of a different type of body, i.e. the C ounty Administrative Board ). It should be said that the latter is not an offshoot of provincial government but rather a central government body that operates within the county, with a two- pronged remit of stimulating local development and of monitoring the policies adopted by the local authorities in their area of competence. It is clear, then, that the greater autonomy of the areas that have formed Regions (albeit still with \"pilot\" status) derives from the fact that certain powers have been devolved from the government authorities \u2013 particularly development policies \u2013 and from a partial relaxation of state control. 1.1.2 Relations between the central government and the regional/local levels of government It is commonly acknowledged in Sweden that central and local government \u2013 especially the municipalities and counties \u2013 cooperate continuously in a wide variety of ways and in a large number of areas. The local authorities exercise a wide range of powers, whilst remaining within the limits set by parliament and the national government, even if this often means resorting to consultation with the other institutions and social partners. Of particular note is the dual role of the County administrations, which are both a channel for central government and a voice for the local electorate. They include a County Administrative Board, which can be ",
        "450 considered a devolved arm of the government in that its governor, whose role can be compared to that of an Italian Prefetto , is appointed by the government, while the other members of the Committee are elected by the County Council. The counties are also an important link between constituents and their municipalities. The Swedish local government regime is, to some extent, covered by Chapter VIII, Article 5 of the Constitution (Acts of law and other provisions). Under the same provision, the State plays a guiding, supervisory role over the local authorities, in particular by means of traditional instruments such as legislative and regulatory instruments. The relevant agencies also monitor local and regional authority operations closely. Local powers are essentially concentrated in the fields of education, healthcare, urban planning and housing, within the limits established by national law (since these agencies lack legislative powers), with the specification that the municipalities must focus on schools policies, social welfare for senior citizens and people with disabilities, road works, and water and energy; while the counties are mainly responsible for larger budget items, from universal healthcare in the broad sense, to public transport and regional development, especially in the field of commerce, tourism and cultural activities. The dentistry strand of healthcare comes in for special attention, both in terms of prevention and treatment. An additional form of state supervision can be seen from the fact that a decision adopted at local level is always open to appeal \u2013 including from an individual \u2013 before a national administrative court. 1.1.3 Local authority cooperation and associations Sweden has long-established, consolidated forms of association between local authorities. The Swedish Association of Local Authorities 6 was founded in 1908. It 6 www.svekom.se ",
        "451 currently represents 290 primary authorities and its main statutory purpose is to support and develop the system of local self-government, to defend the interests of the local authorities, to promote cooperation between peer authorities, and to provide the local authorities with special consultancy services. The association holds a conference every four years, usually in the year following local elections. The conference elects a 21-member Executive Board and a president. There is also an Administrative Director, who answers to the Committee. At the end of the 1990s, the Association employed some 280 staff. Approximately half of its funding comes from local authority membership fees, while it funds the remaining half through its own expert, educational and outreach activities. The Swedish Federation of County Councils 7 also plays an important institutional role, and looks after the interests of these councils in their areas of responsibility (particularly healthcare and transport) 8 . 1.1.4 The evolution of the metropolitan government model: the role of the metropolitan cities Stockholm is the biggest of the Swedish municipalities. From the financial point of view, the municipality is able to pay its own way \u2013 with expenditure focusing on schools, care for the elderly, utilities and housing \u2013 thanks in part to the fact that it receives a direct percentage of income tax from city residents. The Swedish capital's administration is entrusted to a municipal council, elected by universal suffrage. Stockholm is also the county town of one of the twenty-one Swedish counties. The latter are the only intermediate administrative level between the State and the 7 www.lf.se 8 For types of cooperation, see points 1.1.1. and 1.1.2. ",
        "452 Municipalities 9 . But it is at this level that the devolved national administration has most contact points with the local authorities, since the municipal level has much more autonomy. The County of Stockholm has some 1,800,000 inhabitants, with an active population of 815,000 in paid employment. It covers an area of approximately 6,500 sq km, and stretches approximately 180 kilometres from north to south. The county's areas of competence partly overlap with those of the municipality, although the county is primarily responsible for healthcare and transport policies. The county's role is expanding and it competes increasingly with the municipality. Compared to the traditional Swedish model, it takes an innovative approach, for example by buying in services from the private sector. The County Council, with its 149 elected councillors, elects its own Executive Board. It should be mentioned that, despite the County of Stockholm's innovative strategic choices such as contracting out county activities to the private sector, it still has a large payroll of 50,000 employees, of which 38,000 work in the healthcare sector and approximately 10,000 in public transport, and is thus one of the biggest employers in the whole area. Healthcare accounts for approximately two-thirds of overall County expenditure \u2013 funded from a specific tax \u2013 while a fifth goes on transport. Although we have highlighted the greater degree of autonomy that Stockholm City Council \u2013 like all Swedish municipalities \u2013 enjoys from the government compared to the situation for the County Councils, it should be specified that the City Council's activities are subject to strict controls in terms of compliance with state legislation and regulations. Stockholm, with its 755,000 inhabitants, is clearly the biggest municipality in Sweden, and not only in terms of population. The 101 members of the City Council are elected every four years, in conjunction with County Council and national parliamentary elections. One of the most important roles of the City Council 9 For information on the way Stockholm is governed, see www.stockholm.se ",
        "453 is to set annual municipal tax levels and rates, and \u2013 more obviously \u2013 to approve the draft and final budget. By law, the City Executive Board comprises thirteen members, drawn from the parties represented on the City Council. According to a somewhat unusual practice, party representation on the Board is proportionate to the number of seats the party has on the City Council. The main task of the Board is to draft and forward proposals to the Council for adoption. However, in other areas, the majority principle prevails. There is, for example, a Council of Mayors to which the political parties in power appoint their own representatives. Each district of the city is headed by a member of the Council of Mayors, and has its own area of competence. Stockholm currently has a mayor and seven deputy-mayors, of which four are from the opposition. The Council of Mayors expresses opinions and prepares all the paperwork for submission to the Executive Board, and is chaired by the councillor responsible for the City Council's financial policy, who goes under the formal title of Mayor. Approximately two-thirds of Stockholm City Council expenditure is funded from taxation, according to arrangements established annually \u2013 usually in November \u2013 by the City Council. By way of example, in the 2003 budget approximately 65% of municipal expenditure was allocated to the 18 districts into which the city is divided up, primarily for school expenses and care services for the elderly and invalids, in addition to maintenance of infrastructure such as parks and roads. In May 1997, Stockholm City Council decided on a new strategy, with a view to promoting better quality services. The implementing arrangements for this provide for greater involvement of some categories of citizens \u2013 particularly those that have the greatest need for these services \u2013 in the dialogue with the institutions. Moreover, 1996 saw the launch of a decentralised decision-making process, which coincided ",
        "454 with the subdivision of the municipality into the eighteen districts referred to above. The districts were given the same powers and responsibilities as the other institutional bodies. The only difference lies in the specific geographical area in which the District Councils carry out their remit. Conversely, the only basic competences remaining with the central bodies are taxation and the budget (subject, however, to the binding principle of the fairest possible distribution of expenditure, taking into account the needs of the individual districts). Whilst acknowledging this effort towards further democratisation, it must be said that it does have some limitations. For example, it has been noted that the party basis for allocation of seats on the Stockholm District Councils corresponds to that of the City Council. Here the consensus model that typifies Swedish democracy is accompanied by a particularly narrow party conception of the way the public institutions are organised. The party organisations put forward the candidates they want to represent them in the individual District Councils, and these candidates are then elected as members of the City Council to cover their respective areas. From the point of view of their civic commitment, district councillors are not generally considered to be full- time politicians, but people from different walks of life who are prepared to dedicate some of their free time to these matters. Each District Council also has its own administration headed by an Administrative Director who presides over the work of the administration and is the main person responsible for implementing the instructions and resolutions adopted by the District Council. At all events, Stockholm City Council stresses that the purpose of this decentralisation is to strengthen democracy \u2013 by bringing the decision-making process one step closer to the people \u2013 with a view to improving council services and making more efficient use of tax receipts, three quarters of which are now directly allocated to the districts. ",
        "455 Finally, it should be pointed out that Stockholm City Council is considered to be the largest local authority owner of service provider companies. Since 1991, nearly all municipal companies have been incorporated into a single group, Stockholms Stadshus AB . This consolidation into a group that currently comprises 28 companies and branches has enabled the Council to wield greater influence over these companies, partly thanks to the fact that it can appoint the Board of Directors. The Council also establishes the criteria the companies must use for setting their prices to the public, especially as regards water supply and refuse collection. The parent company, in turn, is responsible for the general development of the group and for devising a strategy that enables optimum use of its financial resources. 1.2 The political and social players in the regionalisation/federalisation processes. The role of political parties and of other forms of associations As mentioned above, Sweden is a country in which the parties have strong roots, and this applies equally to relatively recent ones. Nevertheless, a general decline in active party membership has been noted over the last 20 years or so. However, parties have not always been equally important at national and local level, as the latter level was slower to become politicised. Until the 1920s, non-party lists were the norm when organising municipal political representation. From the 1930s, however, party politics became increasingly important in local government \u2013 starting with the major cities \u2013 and reached its peak some forty years later, when the parties no longer restricted themselves to electoral lists and began to intervene directly in the composition of municipal government. The fact that the parties play a part in the slow, cautious regionalisation process in Sweden can be seen from the parties that make up the Riksdag and the extent to which they are adequately represented. It must be said, however, that the ongoing ",
        "456 process of amalgamation and consolidation of the provinces into regions \u2013 launched in the 1990s and whose outcome is uncertain \u2013 was, in part, entrusted to the very authorities that are concerned by it. 1.2.1 Regional organisation of political parties and movements The strong position the parties enjoy is also partly due to their strong role within the local authorities, although it should be remembered that the local organizations of the major parties \u2013 particularly the social democratic party \u2013 have to work within a more centralised framework. 1.2.2 Regional parties There are no regional parties \u2013 in the European sense \u2013 that have managed to gather enough support to play any meaningful role, and even less so in the national parliament. However, particularly from the 1990s, and in conjunction with a reduction in the number of votes for traditional (national) parties, both the county and the municipal levels have seen a significant increase in the vote for local groupings that are confined to the local area, without necessarily being locally inspired. This was particularly the case in the counties of V\u00e4rmland and Norrbotten. The election results tables, available on the website of the Swedish Institute of Statistics (containing relevant archive data on previous elections), do not specifically refer to any such local groupings, including them under \"others\". ",
        "457 1.3 The importance of cooperation and social dialogue In Sweden a useful debate has developed around the theme of social capital 10 , or the contribution the voluntary sector can make in providing for the general interest. As is widely known, for decades the Swedish model has been characterised by a high level of public intervention in the economy and in various levels of social life, with a large share of public expenditure being allocated to the welfare system and a neo- corporatist approach to the adoption of specific policies. Generally speaking, compared to other countries the Swedish associative sector is more active in areas such as recreation, sport, culture, vocational training and adult education, while it seems weaker \u2013 precisely because of the involvement of the public authorities in these areas \u2013 in social services, health and compulsory education. Their increasing importance in the former has been particularly significant since the immediate post- war period as a result of declining participation in political and trade-union organisations. The argument most frequently advanced as a consequence of the above is that this omnipresent public intervention in Swedish society has become a disincentive to initiative, including in areas in which the voluntary and associative sectors would normally play a key role. It has thus been advanced that, unlike the British welfare system, the Scandinavian model \u2013 and in particular its Swedish prototype \u2013 was designed to satisfy the whole gamut of potential demand for social services without bothering to single out the most needy sectors. It has also been asserted that, unlike in other European countries, in Sweden the various types of voluntary associations have not been involved in providing such services, since education, health and care of the elderly have come to be considered \u2013 by the most popular political parties \u2013 as the joint responsibility of national government and local authorities. 10 See Teorell, J. (2003) ",
        "458 While there is no doubt that this massive public intervention has reduced excessive economic inequalities for individuals and families and eliminated extreme poverty, concern began to be voiced \u2013 particularly from the early 1990s \u2013 as to whether these electorally popular (and not just with the left), high-tax policies had not had the unexpected and unintended consequence of distancing people from their responsibility for various aspects of their own general welfare (it has also been asserted that the very strength of the social democratic Swedish welfare model could be the result of a society in which rigid norms of spontaneous control aimed to establish mutual confidence in the social system). Another feature that distinguishes the Swedish associative sector from other models, in particular the British model, is also the reason it is more often than not described as a perfect model, and is particularly relevant to the purpose of this paragraph. Scandinavian civil society organisations \u2013 be they trades unions, voluntary associations or ecclesiastical movements \u2013 have tended to be centrally organised and have only managed to emerge at local level if they were already firmly established as national entities. This is despite the fact that their local branches or sections are often remarkably efficient, particularly in terms of ensuring full participation for their respective central bodies. Consequently, it can be said that in Sweden participation levels in the various forms of voluntary service do not differ greatly from one local authority to another. In any case, since the epicentre of decision-making has fluctuated between a strong central government and strong municipalities \u2013 while the intermediate levels of government have always been weaker \u2013 it is at local level that the associative sector, as society's counterpart to the public administration, has found a more immediate, if not always the most independent, outlet. In quantitative terms, however, some recent empirical surveys have shown that in Sweden there is greater participation in voluntary service activities to help the sick, ",
        "459 the elderly or people with disabilities, compared to Great Britain, for example (with circa 22% at least occasional voluntary workers in Sweden, compared to 15% in Great Britain). These results were surprising, since in Sweden, the British experience in this field has long been considered a source of inspiration. This would seem to give the lie to the conviction that the greater public participation in social affairs, the less society will take responsibility. However, it should be remembered that such surveys \u2013 as the researchers themselves point out \u2013 often have the disadvantage of being partly invalidated by the different, subjective interpretations the questionnaires can give rise to \u2013also for linguistic reasons \u2013in different places. From the 1990s onwards, the Swedish conception of the social partnership came in for a radical overhaul. Until the 1980s, Sweden had one of the most neo-corporatist models for public interest decision-making at all levels, based on a strong trades union movement that wielded considerable influence over political life; on a centralised collective bargaining system; and on a market that concentrated on a small number of multinational companies. Since the beginning of the 21 st century, a new model has been said to be replacing the previous one. This is characterised by greater fluctuation in the quality of public policies as a consequence of changes to government coalitions; a stronger employer presence in political life than was previously the case; a change in bargaining methods, to the advantage of the decentralised level \u2013 and which was followed by an increase in confrontation between the partners; increasing privatisation of basic social services; an even more concentrated industrial structure than in the past. As this summary and the more in-depth analysis to be found later in this study will reveal, despite some brief attempts at reviving the previous methods, the interest groups that ",
        "460 make up Swedish society seem to be similar to those typical of the more individualistic and competitive societies 11 . II. DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AT REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL 2.1 Voting in national and regional/local elections As mentioned earlier, the current Swedish party system is firmly consolidated. It began to take shape between the 19 th and 20 th centuries and has remained fairly constant. Although most of the parties have roots going back centuries, it is only relatively recently that they have begun to wield a strong influence in local political life. This happened gradually, starting with the major cities. As to the electoral system, since the beginning of the 20 th century Sweden has had a system of proportional representation for its Parliament and for municipal councils. Universal suffrage has been applied since 1918-19. During the 1920s, non-party lists of candidates were the norm for local authority elections. From the next decade, however, in line with what was happening in other parts of Europe, party control over the way the lists were compiled became more common in the municipalities, too. Following the enactment of a law in 1950 that imposed a large-scale merger of existing municipalities, partly in reaction to demographic redistribution in the wake of the continuing process of domestic migration that had led to the depopulation of various areas \u2013 there were almost no municipalities whose electoral lists were not drawn up by the parties. According to the findings of a local government research group, published in 1966, it was by then an established fact that the parties were 11 See also Pestoff, V.A., Globalization, Business Interest Associations and Swedish Exceptionalism in the 21st Century? , in www.unc.edu/depts/europe/papers/010319pestoff.doc ",
        "461 responsible for selecting the municipal candidates. Party interference in municipal life probably reached its peak in the 1970s. It is widely accepted that increasing party influence in local elections has helped increase turnout, thus combining a generally unwelcome aspect (contamination of local administration with national politics) with another, desirable, one (more popular participation in elections). Until 1970, elections were held every four years, and kept separate from national legislative elections (always for a four-year term). From then on, the system was changed as part of a constitutional review that made the Riksdag the only parliamentary chamber in Sweden and established that legislative, municipal and county council elections would be held every three years. Turnout then increased, exceeding 90% in the early 1970s. The situation changed in 1976, when the right to vote was extended to resident immigrants (who can now elect local representatives if they have been officially domiciled in Sweden for three consecutive years prior to the election). In the following years, thanks to the fact that elections were held simultaneously for both levels, a discrepancy of between two and four percentage points in participation between national administrative and political elections (in favour of the latter) could be seen. This was clearly because immigrants had been less diligent about exercising their rights than Swedish citizens. At the same time, there has been an increase in party votes in all elections, rising from 6% in the early 1970s to 20% two decades later. The relative stability of the Swedish party system does not mean that there have not been important changes, including at local level. Small parties, whose area of influence can be considered more local than regional, have sometimes achieved a relatively high vote in local elections, while in the Riksdag they have only managed to make a fleeting appearance thanks to cartel agreements with larger blocs. In some cases, such as the Greens in 1985, local success was not matched by national success, but it did anticipate it by three years. The same happened with the right-wing protest ",
        "462 party, \"New Democracy\", whose local success in 1988 only bore fruit in the national parliament in 1991. In 1991 a local government law was passed (entered into force the following year) with a view to enabling citizens to monitor and influence the decision-making process and thus enhance democratic potential in this area. While it is not easy to assess the correlation between intention and results, it was decided that parties that win seats on locally elected bodies can receive subsidies \u2013 or alternatively enjoy free use of goods or services \u2013 from the Assembly to which they have been elected, subject to the discretion of the relevant body. Parties that are no longer represented can continue to receive this assistance up to one year after the last elections. Furthermore, support for party activities must not lead to unfair privileges or disadvantages for any parties. At any event, the merits of this system are clear, in that it provides the local level with the option \u2013 not the obligation \u2013 to fund political groups, helps to free them somewhat from their economic dependency on the State and thus makes local party organisations at least partly independent of their national headquarters. Moreover, in 1998 the old blocked list system was replaced, and voters are able to express an individual preference. The aim is to reduce party influence to the benefit of the electorate. The following are the results, as reported on the website of the Swedish Institute of Statistics 12 , of the last Riksdag elections, held in September 2002, and indicating in brackets the number of seats won and the percentage changes compared to the previous elections: Social Democrats (s) 39.8% (144 seats, +3.5%), Moderates (m) 15.2% (55 seats, -7.7%), Liberal Party (Fp) 13.3% (48 seats, +8.7%), Christian- 12 www.scb.se ",
        "463 Democrats (Kd) 9.1% (33 seats, -2.6%), Party of the Left (v) 8,3% (30 seats, -3.6%), Centre Party (c) 6.1% (22 seats, +1.1%), Green Party (Mp) 4.6% (17 seats, +0.1%), others 3%, no seats. The national level results of the last County Council elections, held at the same time, are as follows: turnout 77.5%. Moderate, or \"non-socialist\" bloc: Moderates, 16.6%; Centre Party, 7%; Liberals, 12%; Christian-Democrats, 8.2%. For the broad left bloc: Social Democrats, 38.5%; Left Party (former Communists), 8.4%; Greens, 3.9%. \"Others\" received 5.4% of the vote. Turnout was lower than for the legislative elections (80.1%), and a slow but constant common decline is confirmed (approximately 10 points less than the 1982 elections). Moreover, it has been noted that the parties of the non-socialist bloc \u2013 particularly the Centre Party and the Moderates (but with the exception of the Liberal Party) \u2013 frequently win a lower share of the vote in local elections than in legislative elections, while the reverse is true for the Social Democratic Party. The share of the vote obtained by parties classed as \"others\" in the official statistics is slightly higher in the administrative elections. 2.2 Forms and instruments of direct democracy The local government law enables each municipality to seek the opinion of the electorate on an issue of particular local interest. This can be done by means of a referendum or a local public opinion poll. Municipal referendums are always of a consultative nature. Thus far this type of referendum has been used in some thirty cases, and \u2013 as in Finland \u2013 with the main aim of sounding out residents' opinion with regard to changes to municipal boundaries. If at least 5% of the municipal or county electorate sign a petition the local assembly can be asked to call a referendum on a specific issue. If necessary, the relevant council can confine the referendum to a specific area of the authority. The council, however, is never obliged to hold the ",
        "464 consultation, as it may decide independently whether to rely on the opinion of its inhabitants or to resolve the matter within its own jurisdiction. 2.3 Community identification with regional and local government In Sweden there is limited identification with the regional dimension, whereas identification with the municipality runs deeper. This can partly be explained by the historical development of the country. From the 17 th century Sweden began to assert itself as one of the most centralised absolute monarchies in Europe. It was a State in which the administration was closely controlled from Stockholm, and left a small space open only to the municipalities, with no scope open to the intermediate level, whose regional dimension was almost completely lacking any recognisable individuality. This attachment to the municipal authorities developed further in the 20 th century, partly as a reaction of some local communities to the depopulation caused by economic migration \u2013 initially abroad, and later towards the cities and more industrialised areas. However, it is mainly due to the huge role attributed to these authorities in delivering welfare policies. Generally speaking, and notwithstanding some limited discontent, Swedes report high levels of satisfaction with their local administrators, compared to the European average. III. REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 3.1 The constitutional framework (economic and financial aspects) As stated earlier in chapter I, the Regeringsform or \"Instrument of Government\", adopted in 1974, is the backbone of the current Swedish constitution, and is spread ",
        "465 across a number of legal documents. It is a considerable document in terms of its size, and goes beyond the narrow concept of government to embrace a whole array of issues that can be deemed of constitutional importance. This act also articulates the constitutional principles governing the economy, in addition to setting out a number of provisions regarding the role of the State in this area. The importance attached to the economic aspect of the relationship between, on the one hand, individuals and, on the other, the authorities and political organisations, can be seen from a first glimpse of the document, i.e. Article 2 of the first chapter of the Regeringsform , on the \"basic principles of the form of government\" (it should be noted here that each of the thirteen chapters is numbered independently, and thus calls for greater precision when making legal references). It states that the personal, economic and cultural welfare of the private person shall be fundamental aims of public activity. The multitude of tasks \u2013 which could be defined as more social than economic in nature \u2013 entrusted to the public institutions (in the continuation of the Article) in order to meet the needs, including economic needs, show immediately that the Swedish constitution is skewed towards strong public intervention in the economy, while respecting inalienable values such as private property and competition. An analysis of this first provision shows that the socio-economic brief \u2013 at least as far as minimum provision of public services is concerned \u2013 is transferred from Government and the parliamentary majority to the public authorities. The latter are responsible for planning and implementing initiatives to promote the right to employment, housing and education, social security and the environment. In other words, these are citizenship rights, on a par with civil and political rights. That said, it should be pointed out the Swedish Constitution is less detailed on economic and social rights than on civil liberties and political rights, for example. The second chapter of the Regeringsform (\"Fundamental rights and freedoms\") comprises 23 articles, few of which contain any reference to the State's active ",
        "466 promotion of general welfare. In fact, the first seventeen articles are devoted exclusively to the proclamation of individual rights relating to civil liberties, arrangements for safeguarding them, and the (duly motivated and limited) circumstances in which they can be restricted. However, private property is widely safeguarded in Article 18, which is broadly similar to the protection afforded in other European constitutions, except that expropriation for reasons of public interest \u2013 with relevant fair compensation \u2013 is regulated in detail, as is compensation for a person whose use of buildings is restricted by economic or other public interest use. Finally, attention is also devoted to the right of public access to the natural landscape, thus partly encroaching upon the exclusive protection of private property. Also noteworthy is Article 20, which defines restrictions affecting the right to trade or practise a profession. These may be introduced only in order to protect \"pressing\" public interests and never solely in order to further the economic interests of a particular person or enterprise. However, there is much more detailed treatment of the regulation of public finances, to which the whole of Chapter 9 of the Constitution is dedicated, although the first article refers back to the previous chapter (on legislation) with regard to the State's power to levy taxes and duties. Various provisions contained in the chapter establish a saving clause for fiscal matters, both at national and local level. This a formal reserve power, and excludes government action by means of a statutory instrument. However, the executive can adopt provisions relating to the import or export of goods, money or other assets, manufacturing output, transport and communications, and credit and financial services policy. The ninth chapter's provisions on public finances and, in particular, the budget are fairly consistent with those of most other constitutions, from the government's sole right to propose changes to the budget during the course of the financial year (which ",
        "467 has only coincided with the calendar year since 1997), to the option to include in the budget appropriations covering different tax years from the current one. In order to safeguard the constitutional position of Parliament, the document stipulates that, unlike with other assets, assets intended for the Riksdag or for authorities under the Riksdag are not at the disposal of the Government. It also stipulates that the Government may not take up loans or otherwise assume financial obligations unless authorised by the Riksdag . The fact that the fiscal year must now coincide with the calendar year means that \u2013 by law \u2013 the budget must be ready by 20 September. Since September is traditionally an electoral month in Sweden, it has been agreed that the budget session must take place no later than one week after the inauguration of the new Parliament, and \u2013 where there has been a change of government \u2013 within ten days of the new Government taking over (but by 15 November at the latest). Furthermore, since 1999, the Government has been responsible for general currency policy matters. Other provisions concerning currency policy are enshrined in law. A special role, then, is attributed to monetary policy, which is managed by the central bank or Riksbank . In addition to organisational autonomy, the central bank also has sole authority over monetary policy (even though this, clearly, can impact on exchange rates, for which the Government is deemed to be responsible). However, it is important to note that the eleven members of the Governing Council of the Riksbank are elected by the Riksdag , which can help to dispel concerns about politicising the institution. Furthermore, the Council elects a six-strong Executive Board for a six year term. The Executive Board is the true executive of monetary policy, and it elects its own governor and a deputy. The Governing Council members' authority is further limited by the fact that they can be removed by the Riksdag , just as a Board member can be removed by Council members, albeit only if he no longer fulfils the requirements laid down for performing his duties or if he has been guilty of ",
        "468 gross negligence. The Swedish Constitution does not dwell further on the general aims of monetary policy, and the task of requiring the relevant institutions to guarantee price stability is left to ordinary legislation. 3.2 Privatisation and economic regulation Sweden has a highly diversified economy for a country of its population size. The end of the 1800s saw the beginning of extraordinary industrial development, particularly in heavy industry. This did not prevent development in innovative types of production, especially in the period following World War II. The most traditional areas of Swedish industry are those linked to the country's wealth of natural resources, especially timber and iron ore. Recent decades have seen growth in engineering and high-tech areas (from the automotive sector to aviation, civil nuclear applications to weapons and pharmaceuticals). More recent still, however, is Sweden's world-leading development in computer science and telecommunications (although the latter began much earlier, due in part to the need to address enormous distances between various localities in a vast, sparsely populated country). Such an advanced, varied industrial base could not have developed if the goods it produced had had to be sold on the domestic market only. Swedish industry has skilfully exploited external markets, thus enabling it to make economies of scale and spread its R&D cost over a larger production volume. Another feature of the Swedish economy is the fact that public authority service delivery has actually helped rather than hindered growth in the private economy, particularly industry. Keeping economic policy on an even keel has helped create more space for the female workforce and to focus on childcare, thus combining economic growth with social demands. ",
        "469 It is widely known that, in the post-Second World War period, the Swedish economy was one of the strongest, not just at European level but globally, managing to combine high per capita income with an acceptable rate of social inequality. Later on, however, and particularly in the last two decades, the gap with the other European economies has narrowed significantly. Between 1980 and 2000, Gross Domestic Product has not exceeded annual median growth of 2% (a result that contrasts with the averages for the 1950s and 1960s of 3.3% and 4.6% respectively). The above margin of advantage can be better understood if we consider the fact that in 1970, per capita income in Sweden was 24% higher than the EU-15 average (taking the cost of living into account), while this advantage had narrowed to barely 4% in 1999. During the 1980s, the Swedish economy took a significantly different course compared to the major European countries. Overall growth remained at similar levels to other European economies, but the labour policies adopted meant that the unemployment rate always remained lower than on the rest of the continent. At the same time, inflation was higher than the European average, with large balance of payments deficits. The early 1990s were, however, the worst phase for the Swedish economy (as was the case in other Nordic economies, such as Finland), and coincided with a severe recession. Between 1990 and 1993 GDP declined by 5%, while unemployment rose from 1.5% to 8%. During the same period, over 7% of the workforce was involved in government vocational training programmes. The crisis of the early 1990s coincided with an international recession, but it hit Sweden particularly hard. This was partly due to the tight monetary policy used to contain inflation. From 1993 until the end of the decade, the economy started to grow again at a rather high rate (an average 3.2% per year). A major devaluation of the Swedish crown in 1992 boosted the competitiveness of Swedish industry, giving rise ",
        "470 to a big increase in exports. Economic policy also played a part here. In particular, the fiscal policy adopted to deal with the recession, the lower interest rates and increased optimism of households induced the latter to save less and spend more. This contrasted with the public expenditure cuts that also led to civil service job cuts. For a certain number of years, improved output in the private sector was due exclusively to increased productivity and more hours worked per worker. While in the mid-1990s the moderate increase in private sector jobs was unable to compensate for the loss of public sector jobs, in more recent years overall employment levels have begun to rise again in both sectors. The current state of the Swedish economy is satisfactory in terms of GDP, employment and price levels. The link that has been established between economic performance and investment in education and entrepreneurship \u2013 especially in the industrial and high-tech sectors \u2013 is cause for particular satisfaction. Economic performance has not, at least thus far, been affected or weakened by the \"No\" vote in the September 2003 referendum on joining the European single currency. Without a doubt, the result of the referendum has repercussions extending beyond Sweden's national borders, and its implications for the euro have been contemplated. The analyses \u2013 particularly sociological \u2013 carried out after the vote all concluded that, rather than the European single currency or the impact of a \"yes\" vote on monetary policy, Swedes feared the more general repercussions that joining the euro might have on the economic and social model. For it is still the case that the Swedish social model, despite being considerably modified by the streamlining operations of the 1990s, is still characterised by its concern to protect large sections of the population, and by its ability to actually meet these requirements. Hence the concern to guard national autonomy jealously in this policy area, which is at odds with the fact that Sweden could easily satisfy \u2013 or would have satisfied \u2013 almost all the criteria for joining the euro (with the sole exception of certain aspects of the Central Bank's relationship with government). More recently, there has even been a marked ",
        "471 improvement in the financial health of the nation, given that in 2001 \u2013 which marked the high point \u2013 the national budget even recorded a GDP surplus of 4.8% (compared to the 12% deficit of 1993), while total national debt remains around 57.5% (against the 73% of the early 1990s). Privatisation is, however, a different matter. It is important to remember here that there has been no major industrial privatisation over the last few decades, given that there was no extensive system of public industry or public-backed industry. The privatisation process began later than in other countries, and took place in partly different circumstances. For the purposes of this study, it has particularly concerned public services and involved the local authorities because of the significant role they play in this area. The first stirrings of privatisation began in 1991, when a centre-right Government came to power. This Government encouraged private management, especially in education. This policy has been continued \u2013 in part \u2013 since 1994, when the Social Democrats made a stable return to government 13 . 3.3 The budget of regional and local authorities: the local authority share of national tax revenue In the last few decades, local government's increased responsibility for public services has led to a sharp increase in expenditure. As early as the mid-1990s it was estimated 14 that in Sweden local authority consumer expenditure was equal to 20% of GDP, and accounted for as much as 70% of public sector expenditure. This huge expansion started in the post-Second World War years and grew constantly until the second half of the 1980s. More particularly, the rapid increase in local government expenditure \u2013 in particular towards the end of the 1960s \u2013 was a result of the State 13 Committee of the Regions (1999), point 4.4. (Sweden) 14 Str\u00f6mberg, L., Engen, T. (1996), p. 257 ",
        "472 transferring responsibility for upper secondary education and psychiatric services to these authorities. In the last two decades the freeze and even occasional fall in overall expenditure was a result of the recession that hit the country in the early 1990s, forcing the Government to adopt an austerity policy. As mentioned above, Swedish local self-government is based on its independent tax- raising powers. Local taxes and transfers from central government are the main source of income. Other revenue comes from taxes levied to fund specific services, from business activity and from loans. The main source of local taxation comes from a proportional income tax levied on the residents of the relevant municipality. The tax rates are determined by the Municipal and County Councils. Over the last few decades, the overall local tax rate has risen in line with the increased responsibilities attributed to the local authorities, rising from 14.6% in 1960 to a more or less constant 30% to just over 31% from the early 1980s until 2003 15 . Within that rate, some 20% goes to the municipality of residence, with the remaining 10% going to the County. Although local taxation has remained essentially unchanged over the last few decades, municipal income has risen slightly, to the detriment of the Counties. Furthermore, the abolition of local taxes on legal entities in 1987 led to cuts in service funding, particularly in the major cities. The rising local tax burden, while inevitable, also persuaded central Governments to try and hammer out agreements with the representative associations of the local authorities, with a view to persuading them to curb their appetite. It is interesting to note that the Governments have, generally speaking, preferred to abstain from direct authoritative methods, preferring to use instruments of persuasion, although in some cases there were threats to cut central funding for any authorities who were abusing their own tax raising powers 16 . 15 For sources see www.scb.se 16 Committee of the Regions (1999), point 4.2. (Sweden). ",
        "473 Since, (as long as the principle of proportional taxation is respected) local authority tax legislation leaves the authorities some room for manoeuvre on tax rates, and since the authorities make wide use of this option, the national budget constantly has to allocate huge sums for transfers to compensate individual authorities (in 2003 the lowest local tax rate was 28.9% and the highest 33.7%). In the 1980s, however, compensatory transfers were made to almost all local authorities, thus losing their original intention. Moreover, unlike the rise in local taxes, central transfers to the municipalities and Counties stopped increasing in relative terms from the mid-1980s (while continuing to grow in absolute terms, given the increased local authority responsibilities). Since then they have remained at circa 26% of total local authority income, forcing them to rely more on their own resources, while independent county and municipal taxation now accounts for 48% and 68% of income respectively (with an increasing role played by ring-fenced taxes for specific services). The recession of the early 1990s caused problems in local authority funding. Central government transfers were frozen and the local authorities, unable to put up their own taxes, forced many municipalities to cut funding for some social programmes. The improved economic and financial situation then enabled the State, from 1997 on, to increase funding again, increasing the local authorities' financial resources by some 4.5%. Moreover, the central transfer system has played a crucial role in central Government supervision and control of the municipalities. The pros and cons of this type of state policy have long been debated. In recent years, state subsidies for specifically declared purposes have tended to be overtaken by non-specific transfers, thus confirming the trend towards devolution and more discretionary powers for the municipal authorities. ",
        "474 3.4 Public-private cooperation instruments. The intermediary role of the unions Experiments with innovative types of public-private cooperation really took off in Sweden in the early 1990s. This new way of interpreting public service provision had been preceded in 1984 by new legislation on the \"Free Municipalities\", which was later emulated in other countries. Under this legislation any municipalities that had asked for more autonomy \u2013 and had demonstrated their ability to comply with certain criteria \u2013 were granted greater organisational independence (especially as regards the structure of the Municipal Executive, but also more flexible management of available resources) and allowed to establish a more communicative relationship with the public by, for example, allowing parents to play a greater role in the decision-making process in schools. This system created a limited, controlled form of local authority deregulation. It did not mean exempting administrative matters from any form of regulation, but rather bringing the forum for making regulatory decisions closer to the level for which it was intended. Initially, central government was somewhat reticent to devolve these powers, but in the wake of the reasonably positive results of some pilot projects, many of the features that had been tried out in some municipalities since 1984 were incorporated into the new local authority law \u2013 which entered into force in January 1992 \u2013 and thus extended to all municipalities. This was, however, only a partial administrative devolution, implemented more for \"community\" reasons than out of a desire to step up public-private cooperation. The results of another experiment of the early 1990s were somewhat different, however. This consisted in the introduction of a purchaser-provider model in the provision of certain services, with the municipal administration being split into two distinct sectors, one political (as a purchaser) and the other productive (as a provider). This resulted in greater competition since, from then on, contracts could also be agreed with the private sector. Even municipalities that have not formally adopted ",
        "475 this organisational model have largely contracted services out to the private sector. In the mid-1990s, contracts with non-municipal providers accounted for more than 10% of municipal expenditure in Sweden. Important changes have also been made in terms of union activities in the local authorities over the last few decades. Union rights had been increasing since the 1960s when workers were allowed to make collective agreements and to strike as a last resort in cases of conflict. But the most important boost to the unions came in 1976 when, with the law on co-determination, the public sector's occupational bargaining power became almost as strong as that of the private sector. Co- determination legislation consists of two distinct strands. The first is collective bargaining, while the second brings in rules on negotiation, information and interpretation of collective agreements. The employer is obliged to launch negotiations on any significant changes, whether they involve an individual employee or the organisation as a whole. Generally speaking, the law on co-determination introduces into Swedish labour law a bargaining system that significantly strengthens the trade unions' hand in the decision-making process. A consequence of this legislation is the huge increase in the amount of information that has to be given to the unions. The resulting system therefore puts the decision-making process under pressure in terms of time and resources. On the other hand, the system has generally helped to improve relations between the unions and the local administration, despite the fact that the original reasoning behind it, i.e. to find new forms of cooperation and boost administrative efficiency, has proven difficult to achieve. None of the above can disguise the fact that, as an inevitable consequence of the serious economic and financial crisis that hit Sweden in the early 1990s, since that time there has been a return to the trend towards containing the unions at all decision- making levels. The anti-corporatist thinking of the neo-liberal government has undoubtedly left its mark, with public sector union representatives now getting less of ",
        "476 a say. However, their considerable influence has not disappeared completely. Workers' organisations are still active, although there are now fewer formal contacts with policy-makers and administration. The involvement of interest organisations in all areas of government policy-making \u2013 except for foreign policy and constitutional policy \u2013 is now considered an inalienable right, especially as regards education, social security and housing policy, in addition to tax policy 17 . Although \u2013 naturally enough \u2013 the most important decision-making process remains the link between Government and Parliament, it should still be remembered that all of the policy areas mentioned must take the local dimension into account, since in Sweden this level is tasked with major responsibilities. Some empirical studies have shown 18 that local government is still consulted, within the framework of its own activities, by a high percentage of labour organisation representatives, ranging from 43% to 46% (depending on whether they are officials or politicians). These percentages are only just below those for trade union contacts with Parliament, while only contacts with government departments exceed 60%. On the other hand, it is important to point out that the average figure for employer organisation contacts with the local authorities is under 20%, while employer contacts with government departments are on a similar level to that of the unions. 3.5 European integration and economic development at regional and local level: management of the Structural Funds Sweden is, of course, one of the more recent Member States of the European Union, having joined in 1995. The local authorities were affected from the very outset by the extension of Community structures to Sweden. At local level, twinning Swedish cities with others abroad had marked the opening up of Sweden to the outside world, 17 See Svensson, T., \u00d6berg, P. (2002), 297 et seq. 18 Svensson, T., \u00d6berg, P. (2002), 307 ",
        "477 although it should be said that this was mostly with other Nordic countries. It was only in the last few decades that this was extended to other areas of Europe. In the years immediately preceding accession, this open doors policy was stepped up and began to yield results in more tangible areas. For example, while Sweden proved to be one of the most willing countries to adopt the acquis communautaire before accession and to implement the resulting jointly-decided policies, it was also thanks to the success of the Community policy training courses organised in cooperation with the European Union, and rolled out across the local level. There was also a fairly close correlation between the percentage of \"yes\" votes in the 1994 referendum on accession to the EU and certain socio-economic characteristics of the individual voting areas. In particular, most in favour of joining the EU were densely populated municipalities, which were often those with the highest employment/working age population employment ratios, and with the highest service sector employment rates. Municipalities with the opposite characteristics generally tended to be those most against Sweden joining the EU. Naturally, a more varied, complex discussion is required of the various structural aid policies in Sweden, and particularly the regional and local dimension of these 19 . Following EU accession, the regions most in need of support \u2013 generally those in the north of the country \u2013 saw their potential stymied by the economic and, especially, technological changes that had taken place during the same period. The whole Nordic area was deeply affected by the structural transformation of their national economies from industrial societies to societies based on services and information. One of the first consequences of this structural change was increased migration towards a smaller number of selected city centres. It should be said that, from at least the mid- 1990s onwards, this affected the Nordic countries much more than other European countries. Around the end of that decade, internal migration in these countries had 19 Detailed, useful information on regional aid policies in the Nordic countries can be found in Hanell, T. (2002). ",
        "478 reached levels that had never been seen in almost three decades. New and somewhat unexpected demographic problems then became urgent agenda items in these countries, requiring different policies from those implemented previously. Here, regional policies \u2013 as many European Union policies are \u2013 can be particularly helpful in meeting the new requirements. National aid policies were cut back following EU accession, although they have not yet been banned completely. European competition legislation forbids, in principle, state aid to businesses, although some exceptions are allowed. As far as the Nordic countries \u2013 Sweden in particular \u2013 are concerned, partial exceptions are allowed for the northernmost regions, the relatively poorest, and also the most sparsely- populated. At the beginning of the century, however, Sweden was noted for being the country with the lowest population percentages receiving state aid, with barely 15.9% of the population residing in economic aid zones (the figure for EU 15 was 46.7%). As mentioned earlier, state aid policy in Sweden has traditionally focused on the northernmost regions, which are characterised by their geographic remoteness, high unemployment and demographic decline within a huge area. Swedish regional policy has its roots in its famous welfare policies. Regional aid policy has a considerable budget, and differs in two respects from that in the other Nordic countries. The first is that nearly all the economic aid and development plans come under a block grant assigned to the Swedish Business Development Agency (NUTEK) and to the County administrative boards. The second is generous support for transport for businesses in the less-developed north, based on a system of reimbursement of transport costs. Several Structural Funds programmes have been implemented in Sweden since its accession to the European Union in 1995. With reference to the programming period 2000-2006, a distinction should be made between Objective 1 and Objective 2. The former, which absorbs the most European funding per capita, targets regions that are ",
        "479 lagging behind the Community average, but \u2013 as far as the Nordic countries that joined in 1995 (Sweden and Finland) are concerned, they were extended during negotiations to all sparsely populated areas (Nordic Objective 1). Objective 2 concerns manufacturing regions undergoing structural change, but also rural regions. As far as Sweden is concerned, it also covers economically weak regions not covered by Objective 1. Objective 1 areas The Norra Norrland region, comprising the huge counties of Norrbotten and V\u00e4sterbotten, comes under Objective 1. This is an enormous area of 154,000 sq km, with a population of scarcely 512,000 inhabitants (with a density of circa 3 inhabitants per sq km). The population is concentrated around the coastal area, towards which some inland residents migrate. The inland areas are experiencing a significant fall in the numbers of younger inhabitants, and in 2001 the unemployment rate for the whole area was 6,7%. Priority areas for the Structural Funds programmes (apart from technical support) can be summarised as follows: 1) development of infrastructure (including IT); 2) development of commerce and industry; 3) development of the workforce; 4) rural development; 5) support for the environment, culture and the human environment; 6) support for the local Sami population. For the period 2000-2006, total appropriations amount to circa EUR 1 billion 40,000, of which 391 million come from the EU. Objective 1 also applies to S\u00f6dra Skogsl\u00e4n, which includes the counties of J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4sternorrland and part of the counties of G\u00e4vleborg, Dalarna and V\u00e4rmland. This is a smaller area (95,000 sq km) and with a similar population (443,000 inhabitants). The problems are quite similar to those of the above areas, particularly the contrast between coastal and inland areas. Furthermore, there is a lack of qualified labour in the hi-tech sector. In this area, programmes target the ",
        "480 following: 1) development of commerce and industry; 2) long-term learning and development of human resources in working life; 3) development of rural areas, agriculture, forestry and fisheries; 4) development of the human environment and infrastructure; 5) programmes for the Sami population. For the period 2000-2006, total appropriations amount to circa EUR 1 billion 86,000, of which 356 million comes from the EU. Objective 2 areas There are currently four Objective 2 areas in Sweden. The Norra (North) Region has 635,000 inhabitants in an area of 32,000 square kilometres. Unemployment is above the national average, while education levels are below average. Businesses in this region find it particularly difficult to adapt to globalisation, and there is therefore a need to open up more to the outside world and for an innovation-friendly environment, particularly in IT infrastructure. Consequently, the programmes focus on developing industry and on information-based productivity. For the period 2000- 2006, total aid amounts to EUR 628 million, of which 185 million comes from the EU. The S\u00f6dra (South) region, part of which is covered by Objective 2, has a population of 363,000 inhabitants in an area of 19,000 sq km. Here migration towards more developed parts of the country is producing an ageing population. GDP is 20% below Community average. Aid programmes focus on developing the human environment (particularly education and entrepreneurship), with a budget of EUR 320 million, of which EUR 83.5 million comes from the EU. Objective 2 also involves part of the V\u00e4stra (West) Region, which was hit particularly hard by the recession of the early 1990s. Its population of 519,000 inhabitants is spread over an area of 25,000 sq km. The Structural Funds aim to revive a spirit of ",
        "481 enterprise and cooperation between businesses and educational institutions, with a view to the successful conversion of manufacturing industries. Funding of EUR 430 million has been allocated, of which 124 million from the EU. Finally, there is the island area \" \u00d6arna \", off the eastern and western coasts of Sweden, with a population of barely 87,000, and mostly concentrated on the island of Gotland. The area includes a large number of small islands which are sparsely populated and have inadequate services. The programmes focus on developing local services and infrastructure, and EUR 101 million has been allocated under the Structural Funds for the period 2000-2006, of which 30 million from the EU. IV. LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES 4.1 Management of public services. The regional and local dimension of public services Compared to many other countries, Sweden has a relatively fair distribution of income and total wealth. This is partly a result of high fiscal pressure on the one hand, and the high rate of public intervention in the economy, particularly in services, on the other. Towards the end of the 1990s, the civil service employed nearly a third of the workforce, while the public sector redistributed 27% of GDP in transfers. A significant proportion of public expenditure is funded directly from central government, in particular for pensions, childcare and housing. Through the social security system, the State also distributes additional benefits such as for sickness, unemployment and parental leave. A feature of the Swedish model is the fact that it is universal, compulsory and mainly funded through general taxation. However, as mentioned earlier and as will be discussed in the next paragraph, it should be ",
        "482 remembered that this service model is largely entrusted to the local authorities, which are responsible for paying out welfare benefits to individuals whose income is below the poverty line. However, the problems that fiscal pressure creates for the sustainability of the model need to be discussed. In an increasingly open economy such as the Swedish one, the nation's ability to maintain \u2013 largely unscathed \u2013 high levels of income redistribution not only depends on the quality of the services offered, but also on tax competition, involving a risk of capital transfers to lower fiscal pressure systems. In Sweden, a considerable number of public services are provided by its 289 municipalities and 20 counties, in addition to the bodies that have been established thus far under the ongoing regionalisation process 20 . The local/municipal dimension of public services focuses mostly on education, care for the elderly and childcare, whereas the counties concentrate on health policy and public transport at regional level. For a better grasp of the importance of the regional and local dimension of public services in Sweden, one needs to consider that most of the civil service operates at that level, involving almost a quarter of the active population. Investment by successive governments in the local authorities increased continuously in the first decades of the post-war period, slowed down in the 1980s and stopped sharply in the early years of the following decade, following a serious financial crisis and recession. It was not until the end of the 1990s that Parliament was once again able to increase transfers to the local authorities, which nevertheless continued to have a certain degree of autonomy thanks to their tax-raising powers. However, since in previous years lower incomes combined with almost unchanged fiscal pressure had led to reduced income for the municipalities and the counties, an injection of additional national funds in the second half of the 1990s enabled these authorities to avoid 20 Relevant information can be found on the Swedish public sector website: www.sweden.se ",
        "483 layoffs, and their staff numbers increased again by approximately 2% between 1997 and 2000. Turning to the local dimension of services from the point of view of expenditure volumes, towards the end of the 1990s the figures were 29% for schools and education generally, 15% for childcare programmes, 28% for care for the elderly and the disabled, 9% for individual and family support, with the remaining 19% earmarked for other services. Schools are thus a key area of responsibility for Swedish local authorities (with the partial exception of cultural and scientific education at academic level). It is important to highlight here the importance Sweden places on cultural and long-term education, with courses often targeting older people. In the schools sector, significant changes have been made in recent years: new knowledge requirements have emerged, and the development of IT technology has made an enormous amount of new information available. A nationwide pact was signed with teachers in 1996, making a partial break with the centralised contractual model of education and paving the way for new, different working methods. As a result, schools came under municipal control and the municipalities began to take more responsibility for their own structures and the way they operate. On the other hand, there is once again a perception that the State needs to re-engage in the sector, but without losing sight of the fact that any revitalisation must come from the schools sector itself, with teachers as the driving force. An important part of the process outlined above are the different career opportunities open to teachers who are prepared to take on more responsibility for running the school. In this context, it seems that the Association of Swedish Municipalities sees the State's vital contribution to upgrading the schools system as inadequate to cover local authority commitments. ",
        "484 Another crucial area of responsibility for Swedish local authorities is social and healthcare services. More specifically, the bulk of healthcare services are currently used by people over eighty years of age. Statistics-based estimates have shown the risk of mushrooming costs and increased pressure on local authority healthcare services generally when the 1940s generation reaches that age. Some preparations to deal with this are already underway, for example moves to take some of these services out of hospitals and directly into patients' homes. However, while such moves would ease the burden on hospitals, they would increase it for municipalities and counties. These authorities are already facing an increasing burden in terms of providing homecare services for people in their twilight years and for those with disabilities. A third crucial area of local authority responsibility should also be mentioned: urban and local community planning and the environment. The local authorities are currently focusing on developing technology infrastructure, especially IT. The infrastructure sector is relatively well protected from economic shocks such as those of the previous decade as it is funded directly through cost-price contributions rather than through general taxation. 4.1.1 The impact of privatisation The end of the 1980s saw the first signs of a deterioration in the Swedish economy, slowing down what had, until then, been continuous expansion of local authority public expenditure, both in terms of their own taxation powers and of State transfers. The freeze on the latter, in addition to legislation designed to block any increase in fiscal pressure, forced the Swedish local authorities either to look for alternative ways of funding their services, or to pursue an austerity policy. Furthermore, in 1990 the social democratic government froze local taxes at the maximum levels reached the previous year. The ensuing fiscal crisis forced the municipalities to reduce ",
        "485 expenditure on staff and even gradually cut staffing levels. They also failed to renew contracts with third parties, and proceeded with privatisations and organisational changes, ushering in management solutions more typical of the private sector. This process was taken even further by the following \"non-socialist\" (centre-right) government from 1991. This was the beginning of the strategy, mentioned in Chapter III above, to contract out to third parties a significant number of services that had previously been delivered by the local authorities themselves. This is particularly the case with technical services, although there has been a recent trend towards tendering out some social contracts such as housing, care for the elderly and child support. In 1992 the Riksdag even decided to grant funds to independent schools, making the municipalities responsible for the content and funding of the services supplied by these schools. However, unlike in some other European countries, municipal services have not been privatised wholesale in Sweden. It has been observed 21 that this new organisational trend has transformed the role of local politicians, in the sense that they have ceased \"to govern\" the administration or in matters of service provision, and become a sort of guide for the citizen-consumer. As for the purchaser-provider system, given that it seems to involve the administration more than the elected local council whose political remit it ought to be, it has been subject to a review on several occasions. 21 Str\u00f6mberg, L., Engen, T. (1996) 267. ",
        "486 V. THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON REGIONAL AND LOCAL DEMOCRACY 5.1 Computerisation of public administration (projects, experience and results) A look at the websites of the associations of the municipalities and of the counties (www.svekom.se and www.lf.se) gives a good idea of the extent of IT penetration in Swedish local authority offices. All the Swedish local authorities are widely represented with their own websites, which are generally well designed both in terms of the wealth of information they provide and their user-friendliness. There are almost as many pages in English as in Swedish, and some information is provided in other languages. Sweden was one of the first EU countries to computerise its civil service and exploit the possibilities offered by data transmission networks. In Sweden it has also been found that IT in public services, and particularly in the health service, is still underexploited. With a view to facilitating internal management and coordination of public service provision, all Swedish counties, the few recently established regions and some other bodies have been connected to Sjunet , an internal network connecting the intermediate level, municipalities and the State. Sjunet also provides common technical infrastructure for agencies that provide certain services together. The local authorities have asked for more government help in promoting this technology in the healthcare sector, as they feel they are unable to manage this alone. This does not mean that they have just sat back and waited for government help over the last few years: in 1997, on the initiative of the Swedish County Councils and under the auspices of the Government, an R&D programme known as ITHS was launched, with an initial investment of approximately SEK 500,000. The overall objective is to give patients a greater say in their treatment and improve their ",
        "487 quality of life. There was a total of 479 project funding applications, 112 of which were successful. 5.2 Procedures and safeguards for electronic voting. The role of electronic discussion forums. The rise of local television networks Sweden is one of the most active countries in trying to promote IT as a means of increasing public interest and involvement in politics. Naturally, if the debate on the use of this technology in local democracy is not to be seen as a contradiction in terms, one of the first things to ensure is that the maximum possible number of citizens have access to it. This would avoid any new type of discrimination arising in the decision- making process, the effects of which would be similar to those that used to occur with the Census, but this time arising from the accepted problem of the digital divide 22 . With reference to this problem, a committee set up to look into democracy in local government released the results of a survey carried out in 2000 by Statistics Sweden , which showed that 80% of the population between 18 and 64 years of age had Internet access, either from home or at least from their place of work or study (90% of those following a study course). In the spring of 2001, the Webbarometern published research showing that 22% of those with Internet access had connected to municipal websites between December 2000 and March 2001 (whereas barely 4% had tried to connect to county websites). According to this research age differences were negligible, as were those for gender, education levels and profession. The only 22 For a more in-depth analysis see Ros\u00e9n, T., E-democracy (a paper for the Association of Swedish Municipalities, which can be found at www.svekom.se/skvad/E-democracy- en.pdf). ",
        "488 difference was between the three main cities and the rest of the country (to the advantage of the rest of the country). In this context, some Swedish municipalities have introduced \u2013 on an experimental basis \u2013 procedures for consulting their fellow-citizens online on topical municipal issues before the relevant departments draw up their plans. Clearly, a cautious approach is adopted in this direct public involvement. To date, the most significant example of IT-based public consultation has been in Kalix, which in the autumn of 2000 launched a public consultation regarding plans to reorganise the town centre. The municipal council organised a two-week consultation period during which the public could provide input for consideration in the next deliberation phase. Quite rightly, participation was limited to residents of the municipality, and a password was assigned to those who wished to take part. This enabled people to voice their opinion on the municipal website, while ensuring that no-one could vote more than once. Furthermore, those without Internet access were able to express their opinion by telephone, fax or letter (minors in their last year of compulsory education were also able to take part). The consultation was based on four different proposals, and the final level of participation was approximately 8% of those eligible. While the decision to provide alternative voting arrangements for those without Internet access was a welcome initiative, the overwhelming majority (82%) did in fact use this medium. Following the Kalix experiment, there were similar trials in terms of procedure and objective in the Municipality of Bolln\u00e4s and the Norrmalm area of Stockholm. In these cases, however, non-residents were also allowed to vote, in order to get as wide a sample of opinions and suggestions as possible. The advisory nature of these consultations was more pronounced in the case of Kalix, although in the case of the Norrmalm area of Stockholm an even more specific question was asked (i.e. whether ",
        "489 to build an underground multi-storey car park, accompanied by detailed information, including two-dimensional diagrams of the plans). The success of these paved the way for new electronic voting trials with an even more specific focus. With the technical aid of a private firm called Votia, new consultations were held between the end of 2001 and the first months of 2002, once again in Kalix and then in Nyk\u00f6ping, where the public was asked to decide on the crucial issue of municipal taxes. In both cases the voting procedure \u2013 which lasted for about a week \u2013 was preceded by an extended information campaign on the issues submitted to the public and the arrangements for taking part (postal voting was also allowed as a precautionary measure). Participation was very high in both cases, involving 50% and 53% of the electorate respectively. Finally, in the city of Lule\u00e5 \u2013 once again in partnership with Votia \u2013 some 27,300 out of 58,700 eligible voters (46.5% of the total) amended an urban traffic regulation decision previously adopted by the City Council. Clearly, unlike when the public is consulted at a more advanced stage of the decision- making procedure, in a consultative operation such as the first trial in Kalix the final decision taken by the authorities may differ greatly from the proposals put forward by the public. The fact that a local referendum is not binding in Sweden does not alter this. In spite of the highly democratic nature of such initiatives, which are little more than experimental at the moment, it seems possible to conclude that the local authorities do not generally feel that the time has come for electronic voting to play a greater role in decision-making. Since the 1980s in Sweden the local authorities have been keen to step up opportunities for discussion between the respective administrations. This has happened in conjunction with progress in IT capability and a decline in public participation in the traditional instrument of democracy, i.e. political party ",
        "490 membership. Widespread interest in instruments such as electronic discussion forums has grown out of the increasing focus on \"single issues\" and the movements they have given rise to. In committing themselves to the new challenges of the Information Society, the Swedish local authorities were amongst the first in the world to provide their employees and politicians with public domain email addresses, in order to facilitate communication with the administration. However, it seems that most administrative email has circulated internally, while the public has made only very limited use of this resource. In order to address this problem, a large number of Swedish local authority websites have for some years had open-access \"electronic dialogue systems\" that provide a communication instrument for members of the public, and an interface between citizens and the public administration. Experience has shown, however, that this type of interaction is more problematic than merely asking the public to answer Yes or No to a specific question. Unlike in the rare instances of a formal request for a vote \u2013 albeit consultative \u2013 in the case of the discussion forums participants were asked to consider a wider range of issues, with a wider range of choices both for administrators and citizens. The ground rules are relatively more rigid \u2013 e.g. deadlines for replying \u2013 for administrators. In order to encourage maximum participation levels, every effort is made to reduce the formalities for accessing the forum. There is now a sufficient range of examples to establish a picture of the growth and use of electronic forums in Sweden. The municipality of Bolln\u00e4s, for example, used this instrument to sound out residents' opinions about erecting a monument and rebuilding an art gallery that had been destroyed by fire. It also used it in connection with raising taxes \u2013 for which electronic voting has been used elsewhere \u2013 specifically with a view to increasing public expenditure on care for the elderly. The \"Karlskrona 2\" plan took a somewhat more playful approach: planned under the ",
        "491 auspices of the City of Karlskrona in an effort to secure greater public involvement in selecting administrators, it used a digital \"virtual\" copy of the city with simulations of municipal life and asked the public to make the relevant decisions. In other cases, such as in the municipality of Tyres\u00f6, the municipal public forum was inspired by prior experience of contact between administrators and citizens, following an initiative from the latter. Forums that are officially open to proposals from the public are slightly more common than those where there is continuous direct interaction between the two parties, but administrators are not required to enter into a discussion of the issues raised. 5.3 Information technology and changing public services Empirical surveys carried out thus far reveal that Sweden is ahead of its European partners in this field. The analysis in www.itsweden.com 23 begins with a reference to the main IT centres where the public can contact Swedish public institutions, from the national to the local level. The foremost of these centres is SverigeDirekt, which provides the main portal for the Swedish public sector. Proof of the attention the Swedish authorities pay to higher education can be found at www.studera.nu, which provides students with a one-stop-shop for up-to-date information on all national education programmes. The existence of the Guldl\u00e4nken (Golden Link) prize, which is awarded annually to the best public administration website, confirms awareness of the need to establish active online communication between the administration and citizens. In Sweden there is a strong trend towards facilitating online legal transactions such as online payments and invoicing. Computers are used increasingly for such matters, particularly in view of the fact that it lowers the cost of each transaction. 23 Schagerstr\u00f6m, T. (2003), 164 et seq. ",
        "492 IT is also widely exploited in the health service under the Telemedicine or Telecare system. The benefits include: a) a broader range of expertise available to the entire healthcare system; b) access to a wider variety of equipment in the different areas; c) faster, safer diagnoses; d) less need for patients and their relatives to be physically transported for diagnosis and therapy. Furthermore, the following benefits have been identified for the patient: a) greater choice of options for communicating with the health service; b) more opportunities to organise meetings with all stakeholders throughout the various stages of treatment; c) cost reduction in contacting staff; d) better, faster access to up-to-date medical information. Telecare can also operate in different ways, e.g. by enabling stakeholders to perform a search through databases and registries of health service information; connect directly to staff training programmes via videoconference; download information for later use; or simply ask questions by email. However, certain obstacles to the introduction of these innovative healthcare delivery arrangements should be considered: organisational difficulties, problems involved in delegating responsibility to third parties and training staff in new working practices, and even difficulties winning acceptance for the new arrangements. Telecare services were already in use in almost 75% of Swedish hospitals as early as 1998, in particular for consultations (unspecified), followed by ambulance and emergency services, therapy programmes and test results. With regard to the departments for which IT programmes had been provided, the percentages were as follows: radiology 21%, pathology/cytology 14%, emergency/ambulance 13%, ENT 10%, cardiology 9%, neurology 6%, general and environmental medicine 6%, plastic surgery 5%, ophthalmology 4%, dermatology 3%, oncology 3%. ",
        "493 There are uneven results in the use of Telecare as a cooperation instrument between the different institutions. The highest percentage (36%) was achieved in cooperation between provincial and regional hospitals. As mentioned above, healthcare provision in Sweden is a specifically regional (i.e. county) responsibility. This does not mean, however, that the municipalities are completely free of responsibility, and they too have exploited IT potential in this field. As many as 274 of the 289 Swedish municipalities agreed to participate in a Carelink survey on IT use in the health service. According to the results of this systematic analysis, thirty municipalities (circa 11% of respondents) have set up telecare/telemedicine projects. Generally speaking, however, the municipalities still feel they need much more IT support in their work, especially for healthcare and childcare services. In addition to the 11% of municipalities that have prepared or implemented IT projects in these departments, a further 80% have planned them or at least think they would be worthwhile. More specifically, the results of the survey reveal that: 9% of municipalities say telecare is already up and running in their own administration; 12% have plans to launch telecare services; and 59% think they are worthwhile. The percentages for providing healthcare information by email were 6%, 11% and 62%, while for exchanges of information using methods other than e-mail, the figures were 18%, 12% and 52% respectively. Since December 2001, on an initiative of the County Councils, the medical portal V\u00e5rdguiden has been providing information on the main types of disease that require treatment, but also on treatment and services offered at national level, their cost and insurance options. An e-prescription service is also being developed. These prescriptions are transmitted automatically from the clinician to the national pharmaceutical system. This system is more secure, since transmission by personal computer reduces the likelihood of ",
        "494 mistakes. Success rates in general practice and outpatients departments have been better in this area than in hospitals, as the latter are less flexible. All public pharmacies are already equipped to deal with e-prescriptions. In the first half of 2002, approximately 1,200,000 e-prescriptions were processed by public pharmacies, out of a national total of 30,800,000 medical prescriptions. ",
