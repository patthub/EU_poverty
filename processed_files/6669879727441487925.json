        "3 Abstract The Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) jointly organized an International Conference on Quantitative Methods for Integrated Food and Nutrition Security Measurements. The conference provided a platform for researchers, academics, professionals and decision- makers to define the state of the art for quantitative measurement of food and nutrition security (F&NS). It was a great opportunity to identify the main practical challenges, share innovative methods and modelling techniques, and explore best practices to scale up multi- and cross-sectoral F&NS collaboration and coordination at country, regional and global level. Moreover, in hosting an interdisciplinary forum, the conference offered the opportunity for participants to forge innovative partnerships for the development and promotion of improved methodologies to support evidence-based F&NS policies and decision-makers.

        "4 1 Introduction Food and nutrition security is the foundation of a decent life. However, both remain under stress in many parts of the world due to multiple factors, including erratic rainfall patterns, other forms of climate variability, land degradation, violence and conflict, natural disasters, diseases, price volatility and urbanization, among others. As adopted by the 1996 World Food Summit, \u201cFood security exists when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.\u201d This definition is still widely used and quoted today by professionals, academics and researchers. It encompasses four pillars of food security: availability, accessibility, utilization and stability. After the World Food Summit, however, the term \u201cnutrition security\u201d became more prominent, in attempting to highlight the way food is actually used by the body, affecting health outcomes. As the broad definition of food security should embody key determinants of good nutrition, the term \u201cfood and nutrition security\u201d (F&NS) has been used to combine the two concepts described above. Therefore, food security actions should ensure that food systems provide all households with stable access to sufficient, appropriate and safe food, while nutrition-oriented action should ensure that households and individuals have the knowledge and supportive health and environmental conditions necessary to obtain adequate nutritional benefit from the food they consume (FSIN TWG, 2014). In line with the definition above, academics, researchers and other professionals, such as development practitioners, have developed theoretical and empirical methodologies addressing individual, household, national and regional levels of vulnerability to food and nutrition insecurity. Recently, resilience to food insecurity has further been raised as a key concept, from both the point of view of donors and decision makers. However, none of the proposed definitions and methodologies for measuring vulnerability or resilience to food and nutrition insecurity has evolved into an approach that is unanimously accepted. Consequently, since definitions are not even agreed upon, analysing F&NS is challenging and at least potentially contentious. From a purely academic perspective, methodologies related to measuring F&NS tend to be unidimensional, as it becomes more complex to address the four pillars of food security as defined by FAO (1996), plus nutrition outcomes in the same modelling exercise. As such, even though a plethora of academic and research papers exist on vulnerability to food and nutrition insecurity, most of these papers provide a partial view of the problem. More specifically, such exercises tend to consider food security analysis through the use of proxy variables, such as comparing caloric intake per day with a threshold, measures related to anthropometric measurements (stunting, wasting), food prices, crop production, or anomalies of biomass (NDVI anomalies). Fewer papers attempt to address food and nutrition insecurity by combining the variables related to different pillars. Therefore, in some cases, conclusions and findings from research into F&NS may lead to misinterpretations, as one pillar may be considered to the expense of the others. The 2015 joint report (FAO-IFAD-WFP, 2015) on the State of Food Insecurity in the World reported that for developing regions taking as a whole, the share of undernourished people ",
        "5 in the total population had decreased from 23.3 percent in 1990\u201392 to 12.9 percent. Though there had been substantial progress, still almost 795 million people were undernourished globally in 2015. However, the 2017 joint report (FAO-IFAD-WFP-UNICEF-WHO, 2017) 1 on the State of Food Insecurity in the World reported that the number of chronically undernourished people in the world was estimated to have increased to 815 million, up from 795 million in 2015 although still down from about 900 million in 2000. After a prolonged decline, this recent increase could signal a reversal of trends. The food security situation has worsened in particular in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, South-Eastern Asia and Western Asia. However, the apparent halt to declining hunger numbers has not yet been reflected in the prevalence of stunting that fell from 29.5% to 22.9% between 2005 and 2016, although 155 million children under five years of age across the world still suffer from stunted growth. Consequently, it is worth noticing that many countries have failed to reach international hunger targets, and the report cited above highlights that natural and human-induced disasters or political instability have resulted in protracted crises with increased vulnerability and food insecurity affecting large parts of the population. Today, the evidence based and technical consensus approaches like the Integrated food security Phase Classification (IPC) and the Cadre Harmonise (a French acronym meaning the Harmonized Framework used in West Africa and the Sahel region) are well established to assess the situation of food insecurity in specific countries. In addition, the IPC recently included a tool to measure nutrition insecurity. Those specific tools inform decision makers to take timely decisions to respond to F&NS challenges. Although those methods are useful, they present some limitations due to the nature of the large set of data needed to inform many indicators with well-defined thresholds. On one hand, the final findings depend on the quality of data availability, as the principle behind those approaches is to use the data available on the ground. On the other hand, some components like assessing the livelihood changes and estimation of the population in different phases of food insecurity have still weaknesses to be addressed. With new international commitments related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), new ideas related to data collection and methodological tools, especially of the quantitative type, are urgently needed. They can help to strengthen the qualitative tools (IPC and CH) from the components described above, and contribute to objectively assess and monitor timely the food and nutrition situation for policy support and decision-making. 1 FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2017.

        "6 2 Conference goal and objectives Jointly organized by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the conference on \"Quantitative Methods for Integrated Food and Nutrition Security Measurements\" was an opportunity to discuss and explore innovative quantitative methods used in Food and Nutrition Security (F&NS) measurements. This international conference was organized under the framework of the Global Network on Food Crises initiated last year by different partners in the humanitarian and development domains and it was a great opportunity to generate discussion about best practices related to the promotion and expansion of multi- and cross-sectoral collaboration at household, country, regional and global levels regarding F&NS. The International Conference on Quantitative Methods for Integrated Food and Nutrition Security Measurements pursued the following goal and objectives: 2.1 Goal The conference aimed at providing an interdisciplinary forum for researchers, academics, practitioners and professionals to discuss the most recent methodologies for F&NS measurement, as well as trends, gaps in knowledge, limitations, and methods to overcome practical challenges in F&NS measurement. 2.2 Main Objective The International Conference on Quantitative Methods for Integrated Food and Nutrition Security Measurements aimed to foster increased understanding of the key role that best practices related to assessment methodology should play in improving F&NS, especially in developing countries. 2.2.1 Specific objectives The specific objectives of this conference were: 1. Highlight new quantitative methodologies and approaches that contribute to F&NS measurements; 2. Identify key challenges and bottlenecks to combining different variables related to the pillars of the F&NS concept in one model; 3. Explore innovative and transdisciplinary approaches and opportunities to increase recognition of the importance of combining variables from different fields of study, in order to improve F&NS measurement; 4. Share experiences in F&NS measurement using both spatial analysis and modern modelling techniques. The International Conference on Quantitative Methods for Integrated Food and Nutrition Security Measurements brought large diversity topics of current interest to scientist in the field of F&NS measurement. In this section, the topics that are of focus of the conference are highlighted and organized in the themes of interest: Nutrition, Food Security and joint measurements; main advancements, and outstanding challenges and gaps mentioned during the presentations and discussions of the conference. ",
        "7 3 Highlighted themes 3.1 Nutrition Measurements In the past decades, nutrition scientists and practitioners have managed to increase awareness of nutrition topics at policy levels and into research agendas. Currently, important advancements are made in the nutrition field and its links to food security, agriculture, and socioeconomic development. However, the long disciplinary divide that existed in nutrition and food security has not be easy to bridge and several long-standing challenges remain to be addressed to make findings and methodologies more integrated and applicable in order to advance the overall F&NS knowledge base. At the same time, more pressure to advance in F&NS field comes from the urgency to address malnutrition trends. Several current trends were highlighted by keynote speakers and presenters in the conference, from which is important to highlight that: \uf0b7 Nowadays, diet factors are the top risk factor for morbidity and mortality globally; \uf0b7 Diets are changing but the current trends in diets modification are going towards unhealthy foods; \uf0b7 Some progress has been achieved towards malnutrition reduction worldwide, but still there are 34 countries that concentrate most (90%) of the malnourish people. \uf0b7 Socio-economic inequalities still play a major role in hindering progress in nutrition and the unequal distribution of wealth has widen making a large difference in malnutrition trends according to socioeconomic groups. It is important that development and economic policies attempting to tackle malnutrition have this into account. 3.1.1 Outstanding challenges and research questions The measurement of nutrition outcomes remains controversial at some levels. While the use of height for age measure remains uncontested as a proxy for stunting, the anthropometric measures to diagnose acute malnutrition are still under discussion. The weight for height indicator has historically been the gold standard measurement for acute malnutrition, although the Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measure has also been accepted for individual diagnosis or screening programs. In recent times, the MUAC measurement has been proposed as an estimate for acute malnutrition at population level, despite its limitation of not being adjusted not by age nor by sex. A work presented in this conference showed that MUAC could not be used as a population estimate for acute Dr. Suneetha Kadiyala in her keynote highlighted current world's nutrition facts, advancements and gaps in nutrition research, while several presentations brought state of the art knowledge in nutrition measurements ",
        "8 malnutrition, as results are not consistent across populations. Further work is needed on these indicators before a definitive answer is provided to the scientific community and field practitioners. In addition, more research is needed on the spatially explicit determinants of diet diversity and nutrition as little is still known about how much and to what extend food environments are key to determine people\u2019s food security and even less about their influence on nutrition in developing countries. On the other hand, nutrition research has not been closely linked to food security aspects as the two fields of inquiry often worked separately, particularly in developing countries context. Thus, little research exists to understand the seasonality of wasting and malnutrition trends in comparison or in relation with food security seasonality aspects. Finally, while it is estimated that 2 billion people worldwide present micro-nutrient deficiencies, monitoring interventions and understanding causes is challenging as the issue of assessing micronutrients sufficiency at large scale in developing countries is an outstanding problem due to the lack of field friendly and practical methods or indicators of micronutrient biomarkers. Because of these and other challenges in nutrition research, science in Nutrition field have not been able to demonstrate the impacts of agriculture interventions on malnutrition reduction. While development agendas have increased the demand for nutrition sensitive interventions and development goals are emphasizing advancement in reduction of malnutrition of any form, food security policies are still largely focused on agriculture and production outcomes. Without the link of impact of agriculture on nutritional status improvements, it remains difficult to continue advocating for increasing support to agriculture in developing countries. 3.1.2 Advancements Some of the actions to advance in the integration of nutrition measurements in integrated F&NS analyses during the conference were: - To focus on individual food consumption indicators, which can link the food security information related to food availability and access to the nutrition adequacy interpretation at the individual level, like the Minimum Dietary Diversity for children presented for Rwanda and Burundi or the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) presented for Mali during the workshop. - To apply econometric techniques to the monitoring of nutrition indicators at national level (the \u201cStunting Gap\u201d example). Discussions on this indicator posed the idea of going beyond monitoring, to the generation of information that can actually inform policy, such as combining the Food Poverty Index and the Stunting Gap indicator to assess the children falling under malnutrition and calculation the cost of the diet to avoid it. - To include nutrition sensitive price monitoring schemes and develop new indicators based on those data. In this conference, the experience of Ghana was presented as one of the leading countries implementing this type of improvements to the price monitoring system, with some of the indicators developed being: The cost of Nutrient Adequacy (CoNA), Cost of a Recommended Diet (CoRD), Nutritious Food Price Index (NFPI), and Cost of a Diverse Diet (CoDD). The use of this type of data and indicators can inform decision making for fostering more nutritionally balanced food systems. ",
        "9 3.2 Food Security Measurements The goal of the conference was to provide a platform for researchers, academics, professionals from all regions to present their advancements in innovative metrics for integrated FS&N. Consequently, some scientific papers and studies presented have shown advancements on the measurement of food security that move towards the goal of reaching more integration of various dimensions of food security. 3.2.1 Outstanding Challenges and research questions Keynote speakers emphasized the prevailing gender gap in F&NS researches. The gender aspect is still not well addressed, particularly in terms of intra-household food consumption patterns and nutrition outcomes. On this topic, a study entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s behavior in the field of food insecurity in the central south region: Bezega province of Burkina Faso\u2019\u2019 was presented in this conference. This study found out that while women undertakes the load of domestic activities, they also employ several alternative livelihood activities for supplementing households food and also for supplying during scarcity periods; they often prioritize food allocation to male head of household, thus the study found significant differences in the patterns of intra household food allocation, particularly in protein rich foods. Study found that even during lean season the majority of available food goes to the male head of the family. Similarly, another study presented investigated the relationship between indicators of women food security (Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women - MDD-W), farm production diversity score (FPDS) and household\u2019s food security. The findings provided evidence that there is a relationship between women\u2019s dietary diversity, household food security situation and farm production diversity. Independently of the \u201chousehold\u2019s food security situation\u201d and wealth level, a large proportion of women (above 70%) are at risk of not reaching an acceptable MDD-W, particularly in households facing moderate and severe levels of hunger in which 80% or more don\u2019t reach an acceptable MDD-W. In contrast, women living in households with greater farm production diversity were associated with higher odds of reaching acceptable MDD-W, particularly when farm production diversity score (FPDS) is above four and five. A high percentage of women (above 60%) still do not attain acceptable MDD-W. 3.2.2 Advancements There have been some advancements in the development of frameworks for understanding the agricultural systems and their linkages to food systems, food security and nutrition. Some efforts in this direction, such as the ICRAF Climate-Agriculture-Nutrition Framework are already in place. However, these are still at early stages in becoming more Some presentations addressed advancements in new concepts, and applications for food security measurements that aim at integrating the various dimensions of food security and highlighted key gaps in food security research such as gender aspects, food security in urban areas, resilience, migration, ........ ",
        "10 comprehensive framework, and more research and interdisciplinary work are needed for advancing in the development of a holistic framework. A study from Burkina Faso, presented evidence on the importance of \u201cgender\u201d sensitive food security measurements, as women often are less food secure than the other members of households. Studies like this allowed providing recommendations of strategies at household level that could likely improve women food security. Better conceptualization of \u201cfood environment\u201d and great advancements in these topics are happening in recent years. However, most studies were conducted in high-income countries. Thus, in developing regions, a paucity of food environment measures exists and the methods and concepts so far developed do not apply well, as more complex value chains characterize them. The methods and techniques for measuring food environments were improved to conduct an evaluation of a development program: the \u201cMarket place for Nutritious Food\u201d (MNF) in Kenya, Rwanda and Mozambique. This program provides support to small and medium enterprises to produce nutritious food, to improve availability and affordability of nutritious foods. Study found the proposed market food environment framework was effective at guiding data collection, but also identify remaining challenges: spatial and modeling approaches to measure food environments need more development, the fact that measuring impacts of interventions at market level requires longitudinal data and not only cross-sectional information is sufficient to estimate impacts. The study proposes several metrics for consumer, vendor, market and mapping and concludes that using these three levels measurements resulted in a very informative way of collecting data and offered opportunity to triangulate information. A compendium of methods and metric to measure \u201cmarket level food environment\u201d was presented at the conference. This paper highlighted that \u201cmarket level food environment\u201d matters for nutrition, and may shape diets in the rural populations. The food environment is a new concept that aims to capture the links between different value chains as well as the desirability and convenience dimensions that are not captured in the value chains analysis. Some proposals for improving \u201cprice monitoring\u201d to enable food and nutrition market environment were highlighted: -Methods for analyzing market prices; -Going beyond market food environment (FE) and addressing the \u201cpersonal\u201d FE in research; -Linkages between individual food security indicators, households food security and farming; -The role and application of Bayesian models. Despite progress observed in many countries, where agricultural technologies and access to them have been improving, still other basic technologies important for assuring the role of agriculture in food security are lagging behind. For example, lack of food storage still an important limiting factor for food security. A paper presented at the conference, assessed the impact of cereal banks on food security during a drought year in a region where seasonal hunger is of concern. Drawing data from 41 villages with no previous intervention history, a quasi-experimental design was implemented with pre and post evaluations and control groups. Findings suggest that the intervention (use of storage structures) decreased the price of cereals at village level. Study could not show that households consume more or better food, but showed better nutritional outcomes. These findings highlight the relevance of better food availability to improve food security. The study also found that remote areas are the ones that benefit the most from interventions such as cereal banks. ",
        "11 3.3 Joint Measurement of Food Security and Nutrition 3.3.1 Challenges Currently more interdisciplinary work is needed to address many of the research challenges in food systems and nutrition. Today, some examples are implemented like the Innovative Methods and Metrics for Agriculture and Nutrition Actions (IMMANA program). This program is led by London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and aims to accelerate the development of a robust scientific evidence base needed to guide changes in global agriculture and food systems to feed the World\u2019s population in a way that is both healthy and sustainable. As food security and agriculture have been traditionally interlinked in terms of research topics, there is more data and evidence linking agriculture to improvements in food security, although showing this link is still challenging and research presented in the conference suggest that there are also inconsistent results. However, making the link of positive impacts of agriculture interventions on nutrition is a much more under research topic. One study presented at the conference highlighted this gap and showed initial results of agriculture and food aid influence on reduction of children stunting. This study look at agricultural and food aid statistics from 90 developing countries between 2002-2014, and their potential effects on general child stunting prevalence. Results show the relationship between increase agriculture aid and reduction on child stunting prevalence. Around 10% increase on agriculture aid is related to 0.5% decrease of stunting prevalence, while the same increase in food aid is linked to a reduction of 2.1% of stunting prevalence. 3.3.2 Advancements and new methods One of the advancements in joint efforts of assessments that integrate food and nutrition security is the Joint Approach in Nutrition and Food Security Assessment (JANFSA), an initiative between two major humanitarian agencies WFP and UNICEF that is a first step in the efforts to pilot a guidance for joint assessment. After several years of work, a basic and practical guidance from current practice in both fields (FS&N) is put together into a manual for practitioners that can guide the preparation of joint assessments. Addressing research aspects from a practical perspective, this document includes key aspects of the process from sampling design, data collection preparation, choice of indicators, practical aspects of implementation, database organization, data analysis, results presentation and dissemination. During the conference, the discussions highlighted the need to avoid being too prescriptive regarding what analysis are relevant when analysing data and to encourage researchers joint creativity and interdisciplinary thinking in this largely unexplored aspect. The idea of offering over simplistic presentation of results for policy makers is a widespread idea but the F&NS field have to be very careful on the transmission of misleading messages that can be assumed from such presentations by layout stakeholders. The concept of food poverty was brought up by various presenters as a new way of looking at the linkage between food security and nutrition. Current efforst, projects and examples of joint measurements of F&NS were presented, highlighting the challenges and early advancements ",
        "12 In relation to that one index that takes into account how typical diets meet or fail to meet nutritional requirements was presented and proposed as an indicator that can serve to monitor and evaluate how healthy are local diets and as a measure of food poverty that focus on quality. The Healthy Food Diversity Index for India was proposed, to aid identifying the cut-off points of a healthy diet in specific context, examine how typical diet of certain \u201cgroups\u201d meets or not the requirements for each food group with regards of a healthy diet standards. Researchers used the example of Indian diets to illustrate how the index can better reflect food poverty line as compared to other food security indicators based on caloric requirements goals. Findings suggested that Indian diets are exceeding the caloric intake and reflects on the connection with the country\u2019s food security policy that focuses on subsidizing cereals for achieving food security based on caloric requirements, thus promoting increase in caloric intake. Thus, the index can allow working in urban context on diet evaluation. It can also be used to re-estimate the food poverty line; and finally it can reflect how food poverty is higher than when estimation is based on calorie-based indicators. In addition to new indicators, new technologies and methods that can be used in F&NS are also shaping new research ideas in the field. One international food aid agency that is advancing in innovative methods is WFP. At this conference, this agency presented their field experience and efforts to apply cutting-edge technology to conduct food security and nutrition assessments. For example, advancements in using very high-resolution imagery for estimates of crop production in conflict areas, evolution of IDP camps (increase and decrease of population, etc; Using Call Detailed Records to estimate population movements after a natural hazard suing SIM card movement and population data to make the estimates). Examples from Hurricane Mathew evaluation in the Caribbean, and the earthquake in Nepal were shown. In addition the mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (mVAM) which aims at delivering real-time food security data through mobile technology; employing phone conducted surveys with households members data can be captured fast, synchronized and cleaned, stored and analysed by a stats engine and results re shared with wide audience to inform decision making. Besides new indicators or methods and technologies, some of the advancements in F&NS are the combination of methods effective at distinct levels of analysis. As the study of nutrition and food security can involve metrics and measurements at distinct levels of analysis (individual, households, regional, national) combining methods from these levels is another way to conduct joint assessments. A study presented in this direction as a Multi- level analysis from Rwanda and Ethiopia were presented as own ways of conducting joint F&NS assessments. Application of multilevel analysis methods for identification of spatial patterns of diet diversity and nutrition were presented. A study from two African countries showed that an important part of the variation in the children\u2019s diet in Rwanda and Burundi is determined by the residential community. Similarly, a study from Ethiopia showed how multi-level analysis could be used for combined assessments. An application \u201cA Multidimensional Food and Nutrition Security Measurement\u201d from Rwanda, highlighting that the use of this methodologies as an effective ways of combining F&NS information. The added value of this kind of methodology is that you come up with some hidden population in severe condition in need for assistance. A case from of South Sudan showed that integrating nutrition and food security measurements broadens the picture and saves costs but quality checks for the food security indicators are needed (the same way that they exist for the nutrition indicators). Key lessons learnt with recent joint F&NS analysis were highlighted during the conference. There is relatively less quality checks for food security measurements in comparison with nutrition data and metrics. This is an important barrier to effective joint assessments as ",
        "13 the results discrepancies and disagreements between food security and nutrition indicators are then not well understood and eliminating methodological problems and shortcomings of indicators is imperative before attempting to interpret results from Food Security and Nutrition joint assessments. There is a great need to use well developed and validated indicators for both Food Security (FS) and Nutrition (N), an imperative step for advancing in the joint assessments. There are many methods and indicators available for both FS and N but many of them have limited testing and validation conducted before they are widely used. This is a barrier that has to be overcome and taken into account when planning joint assessments. The strengths, weaknesses and limitations of each indicator have to be well studied and known for selecting the best option or proposing improvements to current indicators. The need for conducting more comprehensive data collection that can allow for different types of analysis to make joint assessments. Partnerships between governments and development or humanitarian agencies is essential to advance in this regard, so that shared databases can be constructed with capacity of data aggregation and disaggregation to any level of analysis. There is a great need for the generation of clear guidelines for compatible sampling methods, data analysis and results reporting as key components that could advance joint assessments. As the ultimate goal of advancing scientific knowledge in F&SN should be for supporting intervention and monitoring activities, the development of tools that can be used for both targeting and monitoring would be ideal when developing joint measurements. The most advancements in F&NS currently come from developed countries and there is great need for more cross-cultural application or advancing in methods that can be widely applied. Some of the work presented in this conference shows that in FS research, there is a need to move away from the calorie measures and focusing more on the nutrient density of consumed foods, which is key for allowing assessments that are more integrated.

        "14 3.4 Emerging topics Due to the wide variety of participants, several emerging topics were highlighted during presentations and keynotes. Many of these have been subject of research in other fields of inquiry, but their importance and recognition as topics that are having more attention from F&SN researchers and practitioners was evident during the conference as many debates were raised around these topics including their relevance to FSN field. 3.4.1 Migration and F&NS Due to the recent high migration from many developing countries, this one topic has emerged with great importance for F&NS. In fact, migration has several implications for food and nutrition security of the populations affected and the hosted areas. Through the presentations and discussions on the topic in the conference, several issues were highlighted about conducting research on migration and its links to F&NS. Some of the challenges cited were: - Scarcity of data : there is scarce data on migration in general, coming either from research studies or from population census. Migration census are not accurate in terms of migrant\u2019s place of origin, activity at place of origin, etc. Furthermore, as this is a recently an emerged topic in F&SN, in general there is lack of migration data linked to F& SN eligible to conduct research on potential linkages between the two dimensions. - The long causal chain of migration makes it especially challenging to assess the association with F&SN through research. Effect of remittances on food security and nutrition and in agriculture in general are worth studied. - Lack of understanding of the migration patterns and their causal factors is an important limitation to understand the links with F&SN. Without sufficient understanding on the patterns of migration and their causes, the implementation Several topics that have gained focus in the fields of F&NS were highlighted by keynote speakers and presentations: migration, urbanization, gender, conflicts, impacts assesments, resilience and new digital technologies in the fields of F&NS Highlights \u2022 Great data gaps for studies addressing effects on FNS \u2022 Challenging research due to long causal chain of effects \u2022 Uncertainty about pattern and causal factors \u2022 African countries experiencing migrations conducting research ",
        "15 of policy interventions that alter regular patterns of migration can actually harm people\u2019s capacity to address shocks, as migration is often identified as a risk management strategy. - Need of clarity on the differences between seasonal versus permanent-long term migration. In a review on the topic by IFPRI, they looked at all kinds of migration but better distinction of these migration types could yield some additional insights. Despites challenges in some areas in the world, like West Africa, the issue is being explored, suggesting that migration may have a negative impact on agriculture, as most migrants are the young, leaving farming to elders and children. Overall, national level data also show that there is a clear economic incentive for migration, as the agriculture vs non-agriculture productivity gap is high, meaning that salaries in urban areas can be up to three times higher than agricultural salaries. However, even if macro-level economic incentive for migration exists, should policies encourage people to leave rural areas? Many pros and cons can be argued against such conclusion: loss of rural labour and its effects on farming, the possibilities of getting extra income from remittances, labour patterns changes at household levels can lead to shifting crops, more investments in durable housing and improving leaving conditions. Research on these topics is urgently needed. 3.4.2 Urbanization and F&NS Global trends of nutrition indicators in rural and urban populations showed the known disparity with rural areas presenting higher stunting prevalence as compared to urban ones in most developing countries, although it was also shown that a new trend is evolving to see increasing stunting prevalence (above 20%) in many urban areas of the developing world. In addition, the increasing trends in overweight and obesity concentrate in the urban areas, making the double burden challenge more specific to urban areas. A study presented in the conference highlighted the need to stratify urban populations by subgroupings according to community endowment conditions. They had gathered data from 2,000 urban areas in Africa, and had developed a novel method for filtering populations belonging to three groupings: slums, severe slums and non-slum. They concluded that urban slums need urgent attention in terms of F&SN as the levels of undernutrition are close to those found in rural areas while overweight and obesity were also at alarming levels on those populations. These findings also highlight the fact that the indicators and methods for studying malnutrition in urban areas have also to be adapted as different manifestations of malnutrition are expected in urban areas. The impacts of urbanization on food security were also discussed with the presentation of a study on household food security in the Delta Region of Nigeria, which showed that urbanization has a negative effect on food security and highlighted some of the factors Highlights \u2022Urban areas increasingle affected by stunting and overweight \u2022Methods for large scale assesment of nutrition in urban population were presented ",
        "16 influencing food security in urban areas: education, distance to market, income, and credit access. 3.4.3 Development and F&NS The topic of development and food security has been subject of debate and research for many years. Current trends on this topic were presented at the conference, such as: the labour share of agriculture being low in countries with high GDP and declining in developing countries that is more labour is moving out of agriculture in these countries, while slight economic (GDP) growth is observed. On the other hand, in relation to nutrition outcomes, current evidence shows that there is correlation between economic growth and the reduction of stunting, but it also a that economic growth is associated with increases in overweight in a faster rate than the reduction of stunting. As mentioned earlier, the large socioeconomic inequalities are persistent and increasing in developing countries. The FS&N indicators show that although nutritional problems are mainly found in the lowest wealth quintile of the populations, in developing countries they can also be found in the highest wealth quartiles. The relationship between roads and transportation aspects in food systems were also topics presented at the conference with a specific case from Nigeria. 3.4.4 Conflicts and F&NS Recent trends in protracted and numerous armed conflicts occurring in the world have led to considerable food and nutrition crisis as it has been stated in the two recent Global Food Crisis reports. In this conference, couple of studies have represented the topic of conflicts and food security. One study that looked at relationship between food insecurity and income shocks and conflict, assessing several potential causes, concluded that the impacts of droughts is evident on the excluded groups (in heterogeneous societies like most African countries). In addition, the study found that commodity price shocks are always closely linked to social unrest and conflict areas, in particular where ethnic fragmentation is high and its impacts are quantitatively large. Another study on Cameroon presented the effects of internally displaced populations (IDPs) on local food and nutrition security. Although evidence presented in this topic was still preliminary, it is clear that research in the aspects of conflict and FNS are an imperative as to contribute to better response to conflict situations. ",
        "17 3.4.5 Gender aspects on F&NS Despite the recognition that considering gender aspects in F&NS research is extremely important, methodologies for gender sensitive F&NS research are scant. Thus, there is great need to develop methodologies for more gender sensitive studies in F&NS. With the increased focus on nutrition and the long-standing recognition that women\u2019s role on household\u2019s food security makes them key to the assurance of nutrition of households members it is imperative to foster the advancement of scientific research in this aspect of F&NS. In this conference, a study on Burkina-Faso emphasized the key and determinant role of women in the nutritional status of the family, and in particular during food security crisis when women search for possible coping strategies to help households overcome food insecurity periods. With so many ongoing food crises in the world, this suggest there is a greater need now than ever before to give more importance to gender issues in the long run fight against food insecurity. A study conducted in Mali showed the relevance of measuring the adequacy of women's diets with the new indicator on Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women, to monitor and evaluate nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions. 3.4.6 Resilience and F&NS In spite of the recent advancements achieved with the application of the \u201cresilience\u201d concept into other scientific fields, in food security the concept has still many conceptual challenges hindering its measurement. In this conference, some presentations in this topic highlighted such gaps; in particular, the construct of resilience capacity of food systems was seen as not yet properly defined and lacking proper metrics and indicators. A study presented from Kenya used Household Hunger Score indicator to assess food security impacts of the biodiversity at farm level, finding that crop diversity was associated to lower levels of food insecurity, and that increased crop diversity allowed for withstanding climate variations. The conclusion was the need for countries to guide the monitoring of agrobiodiversity, as a process of climate change adaptation. Another study from Senegal assessed the resilience aspect of the food system to climate shocks such as declining rainfall, high temperatures, and poor temporal distribution of precipitation. This study used Food Expenditure Ratio indicator, and Food Consumption Score as food security measurements against many socio-economic factors that can be taken as determinants of resilience. The results showed that in Senegal access to basic services is a key for households\u2019 food security resilience. In addition, the study found that the \u201cresilience capacity index\u201d showed significance for climate shocks and not for other shocks like death in the household, job loss, main production tool loss and decreases in income. However, one of the largest challenges in resilience research in social systems is the measurement of adaptive capacity as resilience construct. In the Senegal study proxies of Highlights \u2022Increasingly recognition of women key role in FNS \u2022Methods for gender sensitive food security assesments are greatly lacking \u2022MDDW as a recently developed indicators addressing women's nutrition ",
        "18 the adaptive capacity used were dependency ratio, welfare perception, household head education level, adaptation strategies index, community priorities. This selection of proxies included are limiting in the study\u2019s ability to capture \u201cadaptive capacity\u201d construct Discussions in the conference highlighted the fact that many limitations still prevail in resilience studies, one of which is the lack of longitudinal data that would be needed to demonstrate how systems are changing in their state when a shock occurs. Most of the existing studies in resilience of social systems use only cross sectional data to understand the fluctuation in the state of the system, which hinders the interpretation. 3.4.7 Impact Assessments accounting for F&NS Progress achieved by the Global Panel for Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition was also presented. Now agriculture is seen as fundamental to structural transformation of economies and to poverty reduction. However, the pathways to improved nutrition are diverse and interconnected. In addition, gender aspects and women role in agriculture have been highlighted as essential. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture projects and the methods have also been the focus of research studies in F&NS presented at the conference. This is a case of the utilization of micro-economic modelling optimization techniques to assess the potential impacts of agricultural technologies on food and nutrition security at the household level. In addition, the use of the minimum dietary diversity for women indicator (MDD-W) as a nutrition proxy to assess the impact of farm production diversity has been presented. This last indicator is suggested as an indicator for monitoring nutrition sensitive interventions in agriculture. On the other hand, agriculture and food systems sustainability under multiple stressors are also a focus of current research as several interrelated challenges are having concomitant effects in F&NS in many areas of the world. A keynote speaker highlighted the fact that rapid changes are affecting the underlying and basic determinants of nutritional status (food security-agriculture and food systems, feeding and care practices health services access and hygienic environment). These rapid changes include climate change- environmental fragility, conflict and migration, rapid urbanization and rural transformation, changing food systems governance, production and distribution. One study presented at the conference tackle the question of impacts of farm agrobiodiversity on food security in rural households in selected sites of Eastern Kenya representatives of lower midland zones and upper midland zones. Results showed that high crop richness, diversity was predominant in the lower midland zone, and this was a determinant factor in preventing food insecurity related to climate change. Diversification of farming through livestock and indigenous crops can improve diets and income to smallholder households. 3.4.8 New digital-Information technologies and F&NS Mobile phone technology as a data collection tool is one of the cutting-edge methods currently under testing and development by agencies like WFP. They tested its reliability using test/retest design and comparing phone interviews on food consumption with face- to-face surveys, finding somehow contrasting results for different variables being scrutinized. Improvements of data collection and organization for food security datasets was presented by the project 'Ontology for food security and nutrition dataset\u2019s which has elaborated a prototype for food security datasets organization, naming conventions and centralized storage, in order to facilitate analysis, timing and reutilization of the data.

        "19 As examples of the use of remote sensing technologies, the ASAP early warning decision support system developed by JRC, which can support FS analysis, was shown. Remote sensing was also shown to be useful in scrutinizing the biophysical success of restoration interventions, a fundamental information to evaluate the impact on FS of such type of rural interventions. In addition, the use of GIS technologies in relation to malnutrition assessment was presented with a study mapping malnourished children with GIS in Ethiopia. ",
        "20 4. Conclusions Some progress in the development of food and nutrition security metrics has been achieved in recent years. Large humanitarian agencies are investing resources into this route and generating new technologies and methods for assessing jointly food security and nutrition. Although these efforts are still at a preliminary stage, they offer some basic principles and a point of departure to continue in the advancement of F&NS measurement and assessment. New promising technologies for large-scale assessments are starting to appear such as mobile-phone-based surveys and remote sensing with high resolution imagery. The need to conduct more joint work between the two fields FS and N, has brought about the identification of several remaining challenges in both fields, which have to be addressed before any advancement in joint measurement can occur. Some of the most salient topics that have emerged in recent years in the field of FNS are: migration and its linkage to F&NS, gender aspects of F&NS, urbanization and the challenges of assessing F&NS in urban areas, conflicts and their interlink with natural hazards when looking at F&NS.
