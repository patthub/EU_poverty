        "6 Our Neighbours Setting the Scene As identified by President Juncker in his July 2014 speech to the European Parliament, and as re-affirmed in his State of the Union speech in September 2015, the European Union needs a stronger and more assertive foreign policy. As the conflict in Ukraine, developments following the Arab Spring in the Middle East, and the current refugee crisis have made urgently clear, there is the need of a common foreign policy that can first and foremost contribute to stabilising the EU\u2019s neighbourhood. The EU\u2019s foreign policy mainly consists of soft power tools. Development aid, trade policy, EU\u2019s participation in international financial institutions and the European neighbourhood policy and enlargement all work in concert to foster stability and prosperity. The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was launched in 2004 to help the EU support and foster stability and prosperity in the countries closest to its borders. In the South, the ENP partners are Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine 1 , Syria (suspended) and Tunisia. In the East, the partner countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. The ENP is chiefly a bilateral policy between the EU and each partner country. It is further enriched and complemented by regional and multilateral co-operation initiatives: the Eastern Partnership (launched in Prague in May 2009), the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EUROMED) (the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, formerly known as the Barcelona Process, re-launched in Paris in July 2008), and the Black Sea Synergy (launched in Kiev in February 2008). The means of the ENP have been the progressive integration, including economically, of neighbourhood countries, through the implementation of demanding political, economic and institutional reforms, as well as commitment to shared values of democracy, rule of law, good governance and human rights. This has mainly been implemented through Association 1 This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.

        "7 Setting the Scene Agreements and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements between the EU and the neighbourhood countries. However, in the past 12 years, the European neighbourhood, eastern as well as southern, has witnessed radical changes. While there have also been positive developments, North Africa and the Middle East have been tormented by violent conflicts, rising extremism and radicalisation, and human rights violations, which has resulted in major migration flows of people seeking safety. In the East, an increasingly assertive Russian foreign policy is destabilising the neighbourhood and is putting strains on EU \u2013 Russia relations. In light of this, the purpose of the review of the ENP in 2015 has been to consider how the EU can build more effective partnerships in the neighbourhood. It has become increasingly clear that the ENP must be better tailored to meet the varying circumstances, conditions, needs and aspirations of the neighbourhood countries, and not least that it must be developed in line with the EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and the Common Foreign & Security Policy (CFSP). As the EU\u2019s own stability is built on democracy, human rights and the rule of law, also the new ENP will take stabilisation as its main political priority. Stability is promoted though cooperation in security sector reforms, in disrupting organised crime, in dealing with protracted conflicts, in tackling terrorism and preventing radicalisation, and in crisis management linking together humanitarian aid, early recovery and development assistance. A main component of the EU\u2019s contribution to stabilising the neighbourhood is also promoting economic development and prosperity by granting access to the EU market, supporting sustainable economic growth, assisting in improving the employability of the local workforce, and focusing on the creation of opportunities particularly for the young. It is also promoted through migration cooperation, including promoting mutually-beneficial mobility through visa agreements and Mobility Partnerships, ensuring protection for those in need as the EU\u2019s wider neighbourhood contains several major protracted crises and hosts close to 40% of the world\u2019s ",
        "8 Our Neighbours refugees and internally displaced populations, and through working together with the wider neighbourhood to tackle irregular migration. EU funded social sciences and humanities research projects covering several of the above-discussed issues continue to contribute to the evidence base and sound understanding of the external environment that the EU operates in, in particular when it comes to understanding the cultural complexity of the EU\u2019s partners. Research projects addressing how to maximise the integration capacity of the European Union as well as the interactions of neighbourhood countries with the EU in terms of people, capital, trade, knowledge, and innovation have informed the recent review of the ENP. Ongoing research projects assess the root causes of instability as well as the connections between security and democracy in the eastern neighbourhood and the EU\u2019s opportunities to respond to this. Other ongoing research projects analyse the root causes of the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 as well as empirically examine what are the political ideals (e.g. democracy and gender equality), social values, economic conditions and perceptions of security prevailing among youth, focusing also on youth empowerment and inclusion in the region. Other ongoing research projects focus on migration, taking stock of the nature and transformative character of temporary transnational migration; evaluating the effectiveness, pros and cons of recent initiatives and policies promoting circular/temporary migration as an alternative to permanent migration, and analysing empirically perceptions of the EU in non-EU countries and how these perceptions impact on people\u2019s aspirations to migrate to Europe. In the present publication is presented the various finalised and ongoing social sciences and humanities research projects covering the above mentioned issues as well as presentations of future calls and topics under Horizon 2020 relevant for the European Neighbourhood Policy.

The public perception and political debate, however, do not acknowledge the positive effects of enlargement. Moreover, during the Eastern enlargement the EU did not have tools at hand that would have helped the Central and East European economies to match domestic developmental needs with the requirements of honoring the rules of the single market. Also, the EU lacks tools to \u2018lock-in\u2019 political change in the new member states. The EU\u2019s policy towards the Eastern neighbourhood countries has often ignored the interests of dominant, rent-seeking domestic coalitions and underestimated the paradoxes and dangers of embedded local leaders abusing and distorting EU policies to allow charging their political opponents with corruption. Moreover, the EU lacks measures to pay-off high short-term adoption costs, particularly for the three associated countries, with short-term incentives. ",

Major paradigmatic shifts in scientific debate are also considered. While state borders are the basic frame of reference, our approach emphasises the social significance and subjectivities of state borders while critically interrogating \u201cobjective\u201d categories of state territoriality and international relations. The project is not only focussed on more general and abstract levels of conceptual change but also investigates concrete impacts of borders. EUBORDERSCAPES compares and contrasts how different and often contested conceptualisations of state borders (in terms of their political, social, cultural and symbolic significance) resonate in concrete contexts at the level of everyday life.

Though important for the future of the SEM, this phenomenon still escapes the main frames of analysis used by academic research. POWER2YOUTH aims at filling this important knowledge gap by offering a comprehensive multi-level, interdisciplinary and gender-sensitive approach to the understanding of youth in the SEM region. Building on a conceptualisation of youth that gives prominence to youth as potential agents of change, the project starts out from the assumption that youth exclusion is the result of unequal power relations in society. The project also posits that effective youth inclusion can only be fostered by the bottom-up process of addressing the systemic inequalities that lead to exclusion in the first place. From this premise comes the project\u2019s emphasis on the study of the potentially transformative impact of individual and collective youth agency viewed as part of a wider social dynamics. ",

Incidence of temporary and circular migration The available data suggest a relatively low incidence of repeated immigration among both national emigrants and foreign-born immigrants in EU countries. Higher incidence of circulation is associated with short geographical distance, no language difference between origin and destination, legal facilities to enter and circulate, and short-term migration. B. The role of policies Temporary forms of migration are not well articulated, since return enforcement measures are either inexistent or extremely weak. Moreover, real opportunities for legal circulation are almost inexistent. There is no guarantee for temporary migrants who fulfil their commitment to return that they will be allowed to re-enter legally the country later on, which stimulates transitions to permanent statuses with scattered irregular stays. C. Selection into return and impacts in countries of origin For Moroccan and Sub-Saharan Africans in Spain, Italy and France we found no evidence of negative educational/skills selection into return, which should weaken some of the concerns about brain drain that dominates much of the debate on South-North migration in both EU and origin countries. However, the behaviour of the most highly educated/skilled workers remains a bit more heterogeneous. ",

There is no commonly accepted definition of what is meant by temporary migration and who is qualified as a temporary migrant, and in many cases no statistical data are available, or the categories of existing statistics do not match the categories of temporary migration. Despite the shortcomings in the existing statistics, the findings indicate that temporary migration between the EU and Asia is on the increase.

At the macro level, the overall socio-economic situation of the country proves to impact on migration aspiration; at the meso level the project identified the relevance of living in a migration impacted region, belonging to transnational family networks - which are arguably forceful instruments of feedback; and at the micro level, the material wealth of the household, age, gender, marital status, having children, previous migration experience and educational level are proven to have an impact on migration aspirations.

        "The Social Sciences and Humanities comprise a range of scientific disciplines examining the relations between humans in their societal contexts. While the Humanities deal particularly with history, culture and various forms of human behaviour, Social Sciences tend to focus on the social interactions of individual human beings and groups. They address questions such as: How do people live and work together in contemporary societies? Why do individuals organise themselves into communities and want to share the same future? What do Europeans think about globalisation and how do they react to it? Why and how do citizens engage in or abstain from electoral and other forms of political participation? Addressing such far-reaching questions, the Social Sciences and Humanities play a critical role in anticipating and accompanying the evolution of societies, while satisfying humanity\u2019s deep-rooted interest in reflecting on life. Consecutive European Union Framework Programmes for Research have acknowledged the significance of Social Sciences and Humanities research and have supported it at EU level over the past decades. Horizon 2020 recognises Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) as an ensemble of separate disciplines and highlights their particularly high aptitude to fruitfully collaborate with other disciplines in tackling major societal challenges.
