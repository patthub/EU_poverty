Ref H \u03b7 is the efficiency reference value for separate heat production. CHP E \u03b7 is the electrical efficiency of the cogeneration production defined as annual electricity from cogeneration divided by the fuel input used to produce the sum of useful heat output and electricity from cogeneration. Where a cogeneration unit generates mechanical energy, the annual electricity from cogeneration may be increased by an additional element representing the amount of electricity which is equivalent to that of mechanical energy. This additional element does not create a right to issue guarantees of origin in accordance with Article 2414(10). Ref E \u03b7 is the efficiency reference value for separate electricity production. (c) Calculations of energy savings using alternative calculation Member States may calculate primary energy savings from a production of heat and electricity and mechanical energy as indicated below without applying Annex III to exclude the non-cogenerated heat and electricity parts of the same process. Such a production can be regarded as high-efficiency cogeneration provided it fulfils the efficiency criteria in point (a) of this Annex and, for cogeneration units with an electrical capacity larger than 25 MW, the overall efficiency is above 70 %. However, specification of the quantity of electricity from cogeneration produced in such a production, for issuing a guarantee of origin and for statistical purposes, shall be determined in accordance with Annex III.

Methods for calculating energy savings other than those arising from taxation measures for the purposes of Articles 87, 97a and 107b and Article 28(11)20(6). Obligated, participating or entrusted parties, or implementing public authorities, may use the following methods for calculating energy savings: (a) deemed savings, by reference to the results of previous independently monitored energy improvements in similar installations. The generic approach is termed \u2018 ex ante \u2019; (b) metered savings, whereby the savings from the installation of a measure, or package of measures, are determined by recording the actual reduction in energy use, taking due account of factors such as additionality, occupancy, production levels and the weather which may affect consumption. The generic approach is termed \u2018 ex post \u2019; (c) scaled savings, whereby engineering estimates of savings are used. This approach may be used only where establishing robust measured data for a specific installation is difficult or disproportionately expensive, e.g. replacing a compressor or electric motor with a different kWh rating from that for which independent information about savings has been measured, or where those estimates are carried out on the basis of nationally established methodologies and benchmarks by qualified or accredited experts that are independent of the obligated, participating or entrusted parties involved; (d) surveyed savings, where consumers' response to advice, information campaigns, labelling or certification schemes or smart metering is determined. This approach may be used only for savings resulting from changes in consumer behaviour. It shall not be used for savings resulting from the installation of physical measures. 2. In determining the energy savings for an energy efficiency measure for the purposes of Articles 87, 97a and 107b and Article 28(11)20(6), the following principles apply: \uf0f2 new (a) Member States shall demonstrate that the policy measure has been implemented for the purpose of fulfilling the energy savings obligation and achieving end-use energy savings pursuant to Article 8(1).

To determine the savings that can be claimed as additional, Member States shall have regard to how energy use and demand would evolve in the absence of the policy measure in question by taking into account at least the following factors: energy consumption trends, changes in consumer behaviour, technological progress and changes caused by other measures implemented at Union and national level;. (cb) sSavings resulting from the implementation of mandatory Union law shall be considered to be savings that would have occurred in any event, and thus shall not be claimed as energy savings for the purpose of Article 87(1). By way of derogation from that requirement, savings related to the renovation of existing buildings may be claimed as energy savings for the purpose of Article 87(1), provided that the materiality criterion referred to in point 3(h) of this Annex is ensured.

Within a given geographical boundary the assessment shall take into account the planned installation and any appropriate existing or potential heat \uf0f0 or cooling \uf0ef demand points that could be supplied from it, taking into account rational possibilities (for example, technical feasibility and distance). The system boundary shall be set to include the planned installation and the heat \uf0f0 and cooling \uf0ef loads, such as building(s) and industrial process. Within this system boundary the total cost of providing heat and power shall be determined for both cases and compared. Heat \uf0f0 or cooling \uf0ef loads shall include existing heat \uf0f0 or cooling \uf0ef loads, such as an industrial installation or an existing district heating \uf0f0 or cooling \uf0ef system, and also, in urban areas, the heat \uf0f0 or cooling \uf0ef load and costs that would exist if a group of buildings or part of a city were provided with and/or connected into a new district heating \uf0f0 or cooling \uf0ef network. The cost-benefit analysis shall be based on a description of the planned installation and the comparison installation(s), covering electrical and thermal capacity, as applicable, fuel type, planned usage and the number of planned operating hours annually, location and electricity and thermal demand. \uf0f2 new Assessment of waste heat utilization shall take into consideration current technologies. The assessment shall take into consideration the direct use of waste heat or its upgrading to higher temperature levels, or both. In case of waste heat recovery on-site, at least the use of heat exchangers, heat pumps, and heat to power technologies shall be assessed. In case of waste heat recovery off-site, at least industrial installations, agriculture sites and district heating networks shall be assessed as potential demand points. ",
