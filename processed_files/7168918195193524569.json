        "Empowering women on the Internet ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 5 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \uf0b7 The advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs, i.e. Internet, mobile telephony, social media, blogs, etc.) represent a revolution in the way people interact among each other, access information, communicate, access services, work, live, by acting as a facilitator for easier, faster, wider communication and access to information, at all levels (local, regional, national and international). These developments have a strong potential for the empowerment of women , as well as for citizens as a whole. At the same time, new challenges emerge in terms of risks/threats posed, that need to be identified and addressed appropriately by policy makers and society as a whole. \uf0b7 The United Nations have played a ground-breaking role by drawing international attention to the positive - and negative - sides of the Internet in relation to the empowerment of women. The 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action has included among its main Areas of concern that of \"Women and the Media\", including new technologies of communication. The World Summits on the Information Society (WSIS) of 2003, 2005 and 2015 and related outcome documents and Agendas have also promoted the role of women in the digital world. \uf0b7 The European Union has focused on activities in the fields of education and training of girls and women to foster employment and entrepreneurship in the ICT sector , which is a promising field with opportunities for women. It has also recently focused on finding ways to ensure that trafficking in human beings and violence through the Internet can be fought in the on-line world in the same way as in the real world. \uf0b7 A report by the Fundamental Rights Agency has notably raised the issue of whether current legislation on violence against women is well-suited to fight cyber- stalking and cyber-harassment and on whether service providers should be called to better prevent and fight against perpetrators, as well as assist victims, of these acts. The Council of Europe Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence already foresees an obligation for State parties to prohibit stalking, including cyberstalking , as well to encourage the participation of the private sector and the media in preventing and combating violence against women. EU Member States are in process of ratifying the Convention, while the EU might also accede and ratify it. \uf0b7 A wide range of goals have been identified in key to promote the empowerment of women in the digital world, such as guaranteeing access to information through the internet; supporting education, training and literacy in ICTs; involving women in the decision-making in the media sector; promoting employment and entrepreneurship of women in the media and ICTs; fighting violence against women through and trafficking in human beings through the internet; countering stereotyping of women in the media and the internet. Different measures have been suggested or implemented to realise these goals, such as awareness raising campaigns, targeted actions, codes of best practices, improved law enforcement authorities cooperation, better collaboration with the private sector, and legislative action. The challenge is that of finding, beyond the proclaimed objectives, the most appropriate means to achieve concrete change , which is an issue that remains a subject for political discussion. ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 6 GENERAL INFORMATION The FEMM Committee has requested research on the issue of \" Empowering Women in the Digital Age \" with the aim of examining the opportunities, risks/threats and challenges for women in relation to the digital world and the Internet, notably in the areas of employment, entrepreneurship, cyber-activism, stereotyping, harassment and sexual violence, trafficking and modern slavery and relation with the real world. The advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs, ie Internet, mobile telephony, social media, blogs, etc.) represent a revolution in the way people interact among each other, access information, communicate, access services, work, live, by acting as a facilitator for easier, faster, wider communication and access to information, at all levels (local, regional, national and international). These developments have a strong potential for the empowerment of women , as well as for citizens as a whole. At the same time, new challenges emerge in terms of risks/threats posed, that need to be identified and addressed appropriately by policy makers and society as a whole. This in-depth analysis looks into what has been done by international and European institutions to empower women in the digital world and what is in the pipeline for the years to come, providing background information drawn from grey literature and official documents. This research can be useful in providing references for FEMM reports on the matter, notably for the Own-Initiative report on gender equality and empowering women in the digital age . 1 The present In Depth Analysis distinguishes between (1) actions taken at international level and (2) actions taken at European level , with sub- chapters by institution or agency leading the specific action. The briefing also underlines in which specific field the actions were taken (employment/entrepreneurship, cyber- activism, stereotyping, harassment and sexual violence, trafficking/modern slavery, relation with the real world) 2 . Table 1 provides a snapshot of the information illustrated in the analysis. 1 See Own-Initiative report on gender equality and empowering women in the digital age, 2015/2007(INI), rapporteur Terry Reintke, EP Legislative Observatory webpage: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=&reference=2015/2007(INI) 2 It has to be noted that the issue of cyber activism and of relations with the real world could be the subject of a separate briefing eventually, as it does not seem that the UN, the Council of Europe or the EU have worked on these issues, which are more of an \"activist\" or academic nature, not of institutional nature.

        "Empowering women on the Internet ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 7 7 1. ACTIVITIES AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 1.1. United Nations The United Nations have worked extensively on women and new ICTs, playing a ground- breaking role by drawing international attention to the positive and negative sides of the Internet in relation to the empowerment of women. a) Access to information, decision-making in media, employment/entrepreneurship, stereotyping, participation/activism The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , adopted at the 4th World Conference on Women in 1995, has among its main Areas of concern that of Women and the Media (J) , with two specific strategic objectives, one on the Increase the participation and access of women to expression and decision-making in and through the media and new technologies of communication (J.1) and one with actions that aim to promote a balanced and non- stereotyped portrayal of women in the media ( J.2) 3 . The list of action to be taken under J.1 can be summarised as follows. In point 239, governments are asked to ensure women's equal access and participation in all levels of the media and aim at gender balance in the appointment of women in the media. States should support research into all aspects of women and the media and encourage the increase in the number of programmes for and by women . 4 Point 241 asks governments to support the development of educational and training programmes for women in the area. New communication systems should be used as means of strengthening women's participation in democratic processes . Furthermore, governments should also encourage the participation of women in the development of professional guidelines or a code of conduct to promote balanced and non- stereotyped portrayals of women in the media. National and international media systems and NGO's are also requested to develop regulatory mechanisms that promote balanced and diverse portrayals of women in the media. 5 Point 242 asks NGOs to monitor women's needs in the media. 6 New ICTs are recognised in the outcome document of the 23rd special session of the General Assembly in 2000 as achievements providing new opportunities for women's empowerment, but also as obstacles 7 . 3 On media to be interpreted as including also new ICTs, see Recasting the Beijing Platform for Action through the Information Society Lens - A Conceptual and Action Framework, by Anita Gurumurthy with Parminder Jeet Singh and Anja Kovacs, IT for Change, Input into the UNESCAP High-Level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Review of Implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, http://www.itforchange.net/sites/default/files/ITfC/The _Information_Society_Context-Paper_for_UNESCAP%20.pdf 4 The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, Strategic Objective J1, point 239. 5 The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, Strategic Objective J1, point 240. 6 More detailed information about the actions to be taken can be found in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, Strategic Objective J1, points 239,240,241,242. Actions to be taken for objective J2 can be found in points 243,244 and 255. 7 See http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/ress233e.pdf : 28... The development of information and communication technologies, especially the Internet, has provided improved communication opportunities for the empowerment of women and girls, which has enabled an increasing number of women to contribute to knowledge sharing, networking and electronic commerce activities. The number of women\u2019s media organizations and programmes has increased, facilitating the aims of increased participation and promotion of positive portrayals of women in the media. 29. Obstacles . Negative, violent and/or degrading images of women, including pornography and stereotyped portrayals, have increased in different forms using new communication technologies in some instances, and bias against women remains in the media. Poverty, the lack of access and opportunities, illiteracy, lack of computer literacy and language barriers, prevent some women from using the information and communication technologies, including the Internet. Development of and access to Internet infrastructure is limited, especially in developing countries and particularly for women. ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 8 In November 2002, an expert group meeting took place in Korea, where the issue of \" Information and communication technologies and their impact on and use as an instrument for the advancement and empowerment of women \" was discussed 8 . On the basis of a UN General Assembly Resolution 9 , a World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was organised in two phases. The first phase took place in Geneva from 10 to 12 December 2003 and a \" Declaration of Principles \" on \"Building the Information Society: a global challenge in the new Millennium\" was adopted. It affirms that the common \"challenge is to harness the potential of information and communication technology to promote the development goals of the Millennium Declaration, namely... promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women ; reduction of child mortality; improvement of maternal health\" (point 2) and that \" development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for women , who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the Information Society. We are committed to ensuring that the Information Society enables women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis on equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes. To this end, we should mainstream a gender equality perspective and use ICTs as a tool to that end\" (point 12); it also states (point 29) that \"each person should have the opportunity to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge in order to understand, participate actively in, and benefit fully from, the Information Society and the knowledge economy. Literacy and universal primary education are key factors for building a fully inclusive information society, paying particular attention to the special needs of girls and women . Given the wide range of ICT and information specialists required at all levels, building institutional capacity deserves special attention\" . 10 The related Geneva Plan of Action, adopted on the same occasion, refers to women in relation to the following issues 11 : first, capacity building is addressed by calling for the removal of gender barriers to ICT education and training to ensure that equal access is guaranteed, while young girls should be targeted and encouraged to take up these courses in order to increase the number of women in ICT careers. Secondly, governments should make ICT policies which create an environment in which entrepreneurship, innovation and investment are encouraged, especially for women. Thirdly, in relation to E-health, governments should facilitate access to medical knowledge and should encourage the adoption of ICT systems to improve health care and health information. Fourthly, in order to improve E-employment, governments should encourage the development of best practices for e-workers and e-employers which should include gender equality. Furthermore, governments should promote teleworking in order to increase employment opportunities for women and allow citizens to work and live anywhere, as well as programmes in science and technology that target young girls . Fifthly, with regard to cultural diversity and identity, gender-sensitive educational programmes should be made for the education. In the media, women and men should be portrayed in a balanced and diverse way . A Digital Solidarity Agenda should furthermore be developed and launched, with the aim of using human, financial and technological resources to include all men and women in the Information Society. Gender- (current challenges)...40. Science and technology, as fundamental components of development, are transforming patterns of production, contributing to the creation of jobs and new job classifications, and ways of working, and contributing to the establishment of a knowledge-based society. Technological change can bring new opportunities for all women in all fields, if they have equal access and adequate training. Women should also be actively involved in the definition, design, development, implementation and gender impact evaluation of policies related to these changes. Many women worldwide are yet to use effectively these new communications technologies for networking, advocacy, exchange of information, business, education, media consultation and e-commerce initiatives. For instance, millions of the world\u2019s poorest women and men still do not have access to and benefits from science and technology and are currently excluded from this new field and the opportunities it presents. 8 http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/ict2002/documents.html#EP 9 UN General Assembly Resolution 56/183 (21 December 2001) 10 Document WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E of 12 December 2003 available at http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html 11 http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/poa.html ",
        "Empowering women on the Internet ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 9 9 specific indicators should be developed in order to test the participation of women in the Information Society. 12 The second phase of the WSIS took place in Tunis , from 16 to 18 November 2005 . During the latter, a particular focus was put on Gender equality and ICT : most UN bodies prepared documents on the subject that showed significant and increased interest on the issue 13 , which helped other institutions, States and regional organisations, including the EU, to follow up UN action and implement it at other levels. On that occasion the Tunis Commitments and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society were adopted. The Tunis commitments 14 \"recognize that the ICT revolution can have a tremendous positive impact as an instrument of sustainable development. In addition, an appropriate enabling environment at national and international levels could prevent increasing social and economic divisions, and the widening of the gap between rich and poor countries, regions, and individuals\u2014including between men and women\" (point 13), as well as \"that a gender divide exists as part of the digital divide in society and we reaffirm our commitment to women\u2019s empowerment and to a gender equality perspective , so that we can overcome this divide. We further acknowledge that the full participation of women in the Information Society is necessary to ensure the inclusiveness and respect for human rights within the Information Society. We encourage all stakeholders to support women\u2019s participation in decision-making processes and to contribute to shaping all spheres of the Information Society at international, regional and national levels \" (point 23). The Tunis Agenda for the Information Society , which details financial and international mechanisms to implement the WSIS agendas, also underlines in the chapter on implementation and follow up that work at all levels should be done with the aim of \"building ICT capacity for all and confidence in the use of ICTs by all - including youth, older persons, women , indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, and remote and rural communities - through the improvement and delivery of relevant education and training programmes and systems including lifelong and distance learning\" and of \"implementing effective training and education, particularly in ICT science and technology, that motivates and promotes participation and active involvement of girls and women in the decision-making process of building the Information Society \" (point 90, letters c and d); the Agenda also underlines that \"the development of ICT indicators is important for measuring the digital divide\" , refers to the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development and to its efforts to \"develop specific gender-disaggregated indicators to measure the digital divide in its various dimensions\" (letter d of point 114) 15 . The Tunis Agenda also established an Internet Governance Forum (IGF) (point 72) to allow stakeholders to discuss public policy issues on the Internet, which can be used by policy makers as an input for their decisions. In November 2015 , a forum for the IGF will be held in Brazil. At this forum, amongst others, the best practices countering the abuse of women on the Internet will be discussed. 16 Representatives of the Council of Europe, the European Commission and the European Parliament will take part in this forum. 17 A High Level WSIS Event to prepare for the WSIS + 10 meeting took place in Geneva in 2014. The outcome of that meeting was the endorsement of a Statement on the Implementation of WSIS outcomes and of a related WSIS+10 Vision for WSIS Beyond 2015 18 . During the WSIS Event it was stated that while ICT provides possibilities for empowering women, a gender divide in the ICT still persists. Therefore, gender equality and women empowerment should be promoted and encouraged in the field so that women, as a vulnerable group, become a full and integral part of the Information Society. This must be accomplished via the created Action Lines, which include among others the creation of 12 http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/poa.html, paragraphs 11 (g), 13 (i), 18,19, 23 (h), 24 (e), 27, 28 (d). 13 See http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/wsis2005/ 14 WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/7, see http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/7.html 15 WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/6 (rev. 1), see http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/6rev1.html 16 http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/best-practice-forums/4-practices-to-countering-abuse-against-women-online. 17 http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/igf2015-participantslist 18 See http://www.itu.int/wsis/implementation/2014/forum/inc/doc/outcome/362828V2E.pdf ",

The challenges that the implementation of the Action Lines will have to address are also recognised. Finally, the statement on the Implementation of WSIS outcomes recalls \" the need to fully integrate gender equality perspectives in WSIS related strategies and facilitate their implementation as referred to in the Preamble to ensure that the Information Society enables women\u2019s empowerment and full participation on the basis of equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes.\" 19 On 25-29 May 2015, the WSIS Forum on \"Innovating Together: Enabling ICTs for Sustainable Development \" took place at the headquarters of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva . It was co-organized by ITU, UNESCO, UNDP and UNCTAD, together with other UN bodies. A delegation of the EP FEMM committee took part in the event. The WSIS Forum addressed the issues of ICT and women, digital inclusion of women, gender equality and mainstreaming, girls and ICT, women and information society, technological innovative women entrepreneurs. 20 At the conference the 2014 WSIS Action Lines were combined with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) , so to enhance synergies between these global strategies. 21 The outcome document calls for the following actions: \uf0b7 enhance the use of enabling technology , in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women : by removing gender barriers to ICT education, by using the growing demand for ICT skills to provide opportunities for girls/women, empowering women's entrepreneurship through ICTs and by making women aware of the involved risks and receive the necessary education to protect themselves on the Internet; \uf0b7 achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls : use ICT to include women in policy making via e-voting, e-learning and participation in discussion forums; make women entrepreneurship possible via education, raise awareness against violations against women on the Internet and provide education about health issues via the Internet; \uf0b7 ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life, by removing ICT barriers to education and training and by making education accessible via E-learning; \uf0b7 by 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status: teleworking could increase employment opportunities for women and for those with disabilities; \uf0b7 end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere: by empowering users of digital platforms to report and combat all forms of gender based intolerance, bullying, profiling discrimination and other on-line threats; \uf0b7 by 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for vulnerable groups: use early 19 See http://www.itu.int/wsis/implementation/2014/forum/inc/doc/outcome/362828V2E.pdf, C: 2. 20 https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2015/Content/doc/ocp/outcomes/WF15_OCP_Outcomes.pdf 21 For more detailed information about the combination of the 2014 Action Lines and the Sustainable Development Goals see Table 2 and the WSIS 2015 outcomes document:http://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2015/Content/ doc/outcomes/WSISForum2015_OutcomeDocument_ForumTrack.pdf ",

In December 2015 , there will be a high level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the WSIS outcomes . 22 This meeting will review the implementation of the WSIS outcomes since 2005 and will determine the future course of the WSIS and whether a next WSIS Forum can be held from 2-6 May 2016. UNESCO has also been active in relation to media, ICT, Internet and gender issues. It has notably published a Scholarly Agenda for the Global Alliance on Media and Gender in 2014 . This agenda is based on a Forum held in December 2013, which took the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action as reference document. The discussions also led to the establishment of a Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG) , which aims at ensuring constructive dialogue between media partners and civil society and at enabling stakeholders to promote gender-inclusive media, thereby allowing women's access to expression and decision-making in the media. 23 In the Scholarly Agenda for the Global Alliance on Media and Gender, the impacts of the Internet in relation to women rights and gender equality are described. For example, stereotypes on women diffused on the Internet can foster violence against women; trafficking of human beings has developed so to exploit the possibilities provided by electronic means; the Internet and ICTs provide new possibilities for women employment, but at the same time a digital gender gap persists and needs to be filled in, while Media and Information Literacy (MIL) can be used for the empowerment of women. The Agenda explores four main areas of action: gender-based violence, media and information; women\u2019s access to media; gender and media policy and strategies; gender, education, and media and information literacy. b) Harassment and sexual violence, trafficking/modern slavery The UN has sponsored the so-called Palermo Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which does not mention explicitly the Internet. In November 2014 , the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon referred on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women to the issue of \"the continued bullying of women on the Internet \" 24 . 22 See http://unpan3.un.org/wsis10/GA-High-Level-Meeting and the General Assembly Resolution 68/302 http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N14/490/46/PDF/N1449046.pdf?OpenElement. 23 UNESCO, Scholarly Agenda for the Global Alliance on Media and Gender, 2014, p.7. 24 See http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8227 ",

The Council of Europe The Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence is an important international law instruments from the Council of Europe, which can offer protection for women in the digital world. There are two articles related to women and the Internet. Article 34 of the Convention obliges parties to the convention to prohibit stalking, including cyberstalking . 25 Article 17 focuses on the participation of the private sector and the media in preventing and combating violence against women. The article contains two obligations. Firstly, Parties to the convention must encourage the private sector, the ICT sector and the media, to participate in the development and implementation of policies to prevent violence against women. Each involved company can determine which actions it takes to execute these policies. Secondly, Parties are required to encourage the private sector, the ICT sector and the media to set guidelines and standards. These guidelines must enhance respect for dignity of women and therefore contribute to the preventing of violence against them. In the case of the ICT sector and the media, they can include a duty to refrain from using gender stereotypes. 26 In September 2014 , the Council of Europe participated in the Internet Governance Forum that took place in Istanbul, an event organised within the framework of the Tunis Agenda (see above). The Forum also discussed issues related to human rights of Internet users, Internet contents and equality between men and women. Objectives were set in order to prevent violence and discrimination of women on the Internet, such as the introduction of a gender perspective in the discussion on Internet content regulation; ensuring equality between men and women in the electronic media; promote women's participation in the Internet industry, especially in the decision-making; encourage the use of non-sexist language and images in the media and on the Internet; encourage states to promote training, education and to launch awareness campaigns to combat sexist stereotypes. 27 In 2013, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe had also adopted a recommendation on gender equality and the media . The recommendation stated that women should have an equal visibility, empowerment, responsibility and participation in the media and communication sector as men. 28 It also highlighted that the media can hinder gender equality by using stereotypes or due to the lack of female opinions or female experts. In order to ensure gender equality Member States should adopt an appropriate legal framework, which respects the principle of human dignity and the prohibition of discrimination based on sex in the media. The recommendation also calls on media organisations to adopt internal codes of conduct on gender equality, to prevent the use of gender stereotypes and to strive for a balanced participation of women and men in the media, including in management posts. 29 25 Council of Europe, Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, 2011, article 34 and Istanbul Convention Explanatory Report, article 34 http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm . 26 Council of Europe, Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, Explanatory Report, article 17, paragraph 106 and 107, http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm . 27 http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/internet-and-equality 28 Council of Europe, Recommendation CM/Rec (2013) of the Committee of Ministers on gender equality and the media. 29 http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/internet-and-equality ",

ACTIVITIES AT EU LEVEL The EU has concentrated its actions in relation to women and the Internet on the possibilities created for women in ICTs , promoting education, employment and entrepreneurship; and on how criminal activities such as trafficking in human beings (THB) and sexual exploitation of women, as well as harassment and stalking, are carried out through electronic means and the Internet (via email, websites, online classified sites, social networks, chats, spam, dark web, etc.), so to develop actions and cooperation to detect and counter them. In this field, the EU has adopted legislative measures to fight trafficking of human beings, i.e. Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA. The Internet is mentioned in the Directive as a means to carry out targeted awareness-raising activities. 2.1. The European Commission a) Education, employment/entrepreneurship The Strategy for Equality between Women and Men 2010-2015 includes a series of actions related to women and the Internet, notably ICTs 30 , such as: Under the Priority Area 1 - Equal Economic Independence, a Key Action focusing on \" Youth and Education \" aims to \" Promote gender equality in education and training related initiatives\u201d , particularly those initiatives taken to alleviate gender imbalances in literacy, to tackle early school leaving, to promote women adult learning and scientific career choices and the initiatives taken to improve media literacy (cf. reduce the 'digital gap' as mentioned in the Europe 2020 'Digital Agenda'); the action covers the years 2010-2015 and is to be taken by the Education and Culture DG. The mid-term review of the Strategy elaborated by the Commission 31 explained that a series of actions have been taken, which are described briefly below. Under the Priority Area 2 - Equal Pay for Equal Work and Work of Equal Value, a Key Action focusing on \"Participation of women in ICT\" has the following aims: \"Conduct an awareness-raising campaign on shadowing days in companies across Europe and monitor the progress and identify best practices through the existing group of stakeholders; set up platforms to encourage networking such as the European Directory for Women in ICT ; promote digital literacy and eSkills specifically for women through the Digital Agenda; promote the Code of Best Practices for Women in ICT in as many as possible stakeholders as well as update and refine it\"; the action covers the years 2010-2015 and is to be taken by DG Information Society / Connect. The mid-term review also highlighted that Digital Agenda for Europe (which is one of the seven flagships of the Europe 2020 Strategy), A Europe 2020 Initiative, Growth and Jobs, Action 60: Increase participation of women in the ICT workforce is dedicated to encouraging young women to take up an ICT-related career . A series of political and public events took place in 2011, 2012 and 2013, promoting national Digital Champions appointed by the Member States. An International \" Girls in ICT day \" has also been 30 See the Commission Staff Working Document, Actions to implement the Strategy for Equality between Women and Men 2010-2015, SEC(2010) 1079/2 31 See the Commission staff working document, Mid-term review of the Strategy for equality between women and men (2010-2015), SWD(2013) 339 final, Brussels, 16.9.2013, http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender- equality/files/strategy_women_men/131011_mid_term_review_en.pdf ",

Within this framework, a hearing in the EP and a social media campaign were launched. The Commission also launched a study to devise a policy toolkit to boost the participation of women in the ICT sector and revisit and refine the Code of Best Practices for Women in ICT. 32 In 2014 an action was launched within Action 60 to encourage women to take up ICT- related careers and increase the share of women in the ICT sector 33 . The action is based on a 2013 study on Women active in the ICT sector , revealing that there is a drop in the already low share of ICT female graduates, notwithstanding the fact that the entry of more women in the sector would boost a market where labour shortages are foreseen. The same study affirms that if women participated in the EU digital sector at the same rate as men, the gain for the European GDP each year would be around 9 billion EUR. 34 b) Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Exploitation (Commission, in cooperation with other EU bodies and agencies) In relation to the issue of trafficking in human beings, the European Commission has adopted a EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings 2012-16 . The Strategy highlights that the Internet plays a key role in facilitating THB and increases the challenges for law enforcement authorities 35 . Priority C, Action 1 charges national multidisciplinary law-enforcement units with the responsibility of addressing the use of the Internet in this field, notably \"the recruitment of victims of trafficking in human beings and advertising of their services on the internet\". Action 3 of Priority E (Increased knowledge of and effective response to changing trends in trafficking in human beings) focuses on \"understanding Online Recruitment\" and states that \"In 2014 the Commission will, under the safer internet funding programme, support projects that aim to increase knowledge of recruitment over the internet and via social networks \u2014 including recruitment done with the help of intermediaries. The internet reaches a broad audience, offering numerous possibilities to recruit victims. It offers employment opportunities (most often promoting attractive jobs abroad, for models, dancers, cabaret performers, etc.) which are accessible via simple search engines or pop-ups, chat rooms and spam mail. Social networking tools are becoming increasingly popular as recruitment tools.\" 36 The mid-term report by the Commission on the implementation of the Strategy states that \"because of the relative anonymity it provides, the internet is used for recruitment through false job advertisements and also plays a crucial role in the sale of services provided through the exploitation of THB victims. According to Europol\u2019s 2013 Executive Report on Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA 2013), the internet will be an even more important marketplace for illicit commodities and criminal services in the future. Criminals advertise facilitation services to potential migrants online, recruit THB victims and connect to customers in destination countries. Social media, dating sites and online forums are becoming increasingly prominent in online child sexual exploitation, THB and fraud respectively.\" 32 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/code-best-practices-women-ict 33 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/women-ict 34 http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/women-active-in-the-ict-sector- pbKK0113432/?CatalogCategoryID=CXoKABst5TsAAAEjepEY4e5L 35 The Council of Europe worked on the issue of Internet as a means used by criminal organisations for THBs, see Misuse of the Internet for the recruitment of victims of trafficking in human beings prepared by Athanassia P.

        "Empowering women on the Internet ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 15 15 THB is one of the 9 priority areas of the EU Serious and Organised Crime Policy Cycle starting in 2014 and COSI (Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security) and Europol will facilitate, promote and strengthen the coordination of Member States\u2019 operations including through intelligence gathering, the use of financial investigations, the use of the Internet and new technologies, joint investigation teams and cooperation with EU agencies and bodies and other stakeholders (furthermore, to mark the Seventh EU Anti-Trafficking Day, the Lithuanian Presidency organised a Conference in Vilnius in October 2013 focusing on the role of the Internet in THB; for Council of the EU actions in other areas, see the following chapter). As envisaged in the EU Strategy, the Commission has started work on a report to increase knowledge of the use of Internet and social networks for recruitment for all forms of THB. 37 Europol also organised an expert meeting - attended by experts from Eurojust, Frontex and CEPOL - on THB and the link with Internet and e-commerce on 4-5 June 2014, since human trafficking networks increasingly exploit \u2018online market places\u2019 to their benefit, for example in the recruitment of victims and to synchronise \u2018traditional\u2019 THB investigations and specialised cybercrime investigations. The EU Anti-trafficking coordinator monitors the implementation of the Strategy against THBs and the related actions. In 2014 the Commission also issued a Communication on \" An open and secure Europe: making it happen \" listing its priorities for the post-Stockholm Programme multiannual agenda in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. One of the proposals is that of establishing a post-2016 Strategy on THB covering prevention, assistance to victims, safe-return and reintegration, as well as the role of the Internet 38 . This aspect was not taken into consideration when adopting the 2013 EU Cyber-security Strategy or by the Europol Cybercrime Centre (as the latter 2014 report does not focus on THB). A recent policy briefing by CEU and others underline that further robust empirical research is needed in the field to verify and understand the use of the Internet for THB and sexual exploitation, as currently this is lacking 39 . The briefing highlights that attempts by policy-makers to legislate on online behaviours have often been problematic and that the Internet provides opportunities for instance for civil society organisations to campaign against THB, or for law enforcement agencies to detect criminal behaviours linked to THB or sexual exploitation. 2.2. The Council of the European Union In 2013 , the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council adopted conclusions on \"Advancing Women's role as decision-makers in the media\" . In these conclusions, the Council set three indicators, which must aid to 37 Mid-term report on the implementation of the EU strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings Brussels, 17.10.2014, SWD(2014) 318 final, {COM(2014) 635 final}. The Commission report on the use of Internet and social networks for recruitment for all forms of THB was expected by mid-2015. However, the report has not been published yet. http://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/commission_staff_working_document_-_mid- term_report_on_the_implementation_of_the_eu_strategy_towards_the_eradication_of_trafficking_in_human_bein gs.pdf 38 http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/basic- documents/docs/an_open_and_secure_europe_-_making_it_happen_en.pdf 39 See http://pasos.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cps-policy-brief-upkat-human-trafficking-and-online- networks-2014.pdf ",

These indicators focus on the proportion of women and men in decision-making posts in media organisations and on the boards of media organisations in the EU, as well as on the policies to promote gender equality in the media. 40 The Greek Presidency of the Council organised a conference in April 2014 on \" Women and Girls go Digital \" 41 , with the aim of promoting e-Skills, Gender Diversity and ICT as a key factor for economic growth based on the creation of digital jobs and the dissemination of good practices at European level. The Council recognized on 16 May 2014 in its (EPSCO) Council Conclusions on \" Women and the economy : Economic independence from the perspective of part-time work and self-employment\" that \" The Europe 2020 Strategy identifies a number of priority growth areas, including in the white economy and the science and technology sectors. In order to fully tap Europe\u2019s growth potential in these areas, it is important to overcome gender stereotypes and combat educational and occupational segregation \". 42 The EPCSO Council of 11 December 2014 adopted conclusions on the 20-year review of the implementation by the member states and the EU institutions of the Beijing platform for action where it called on MSs and the Commission \" to increase efforts and funding, where necessary, to support existing and/or new measures and strategies to combat all forms of violence against women and girls by applying a comprehensive policy that includes measures for prevention, protection and punishment, and also tackles emerging forms of violence such as those linked to the Internet and social media ; and to involve men and boys in the prevention of and fight against violence against women and girls\". 43 2.3. The European Parliament The EP has sponsored legislation and actions in the field of women's rights and gender equality that take into proper account the role of the Internet and ICTs, both as an opportunity and as a challenge for women empowerment. For instance, in June 2015, the Parliament has adopted a resolution on the EU Strategy for the equality of women and men post 2015 , calling the Commission and the Member States to take further action to achieve equality between women and men in the EU. The Resolution also mentions both violence against women on the Internet and the representation of women in the media and on the Internet. The Parliament notably calls on the Commission to devise actions to deal with forms of violence against women on the Internet such as cyber-harassment, cyberbullying and cyberstalking . The Commission should also carry out evaluations on this topic with the help of civil society organisations. Furthermore, the Parliament calls on the Member States and media regulators to promote and use a balanced, non-stereotyped image of women, especially on the Internet. 44 Until now the EP and the FEMM committee have not had the opportunity to focus on women in the digital world in a specific dedicated report addressing the issue of women 40 Council of the European Union, Council Conclusions of 20-21 June 2013 on Advancing Women's role as decision- makers in the media, para. 19, http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/lsa/137546.pdf. 41 http://www.womengodigital.eu/index.html 42 See 16 May 2014 EPSCO Council Conclusions on \"Women and the economy: Economic independence from the perspective of part-time work and self-employment\" http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&f=ST%209711%202014%20INIT 43 see point 20 (e) http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&f=ST%2016304%202014%20INIT 44 The European Parliament, Resolution of 9 June 2015 on the EU Strategy for the equality of women and men post 2015, P8_TA-PROV(2015)0218, recommendations 23 and 62 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+P8-TA-2015- 0218+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN.

The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) In 2013 European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) issued a report on the \" Review of the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action in the EU Member States: Women and the Media \u2014 Advancing gender equality in decision-making in media organisations \" 45 . The report, although focusing mainly on traditional media, addresses also issues related to new media and ICTs. It concludes that it is necessary to \"extend the scope of research to online, digital...media sectors...Understanding the potential of the Internet as a source of employment, a vehicle for women\u2019s visible empowerment, but also a medium through which sex-based discrimination continues to be played out, is an important aspect of any future research agenda\" . EIGE Director underlined during her speech at the Greek Presidency event Women and Girls go Digital that \" the current underrepresentation of women as developers, users and beneficiaries of the technology means that we are risking a strong digital gender gap if a technology policy is not implemented with a gender perspective. Nowadays women only make up approximately 32% of the total work force in the ICT sector; they are underrepresented in decision making positions, and in entrepreneurship in this area. Gender segregation in education and employment is an important issue in EIGE\u2019s research, tackled in several Beijing reports and the Gender Equality Index. The evidence shows that horizontal segregation has had a tendency to shift towards fewer differences over time, with an increase in the proportion of women in most sectors. However, some sectors, such as science and technology, still lag behind. Women also tend to use the computer and the internet less than men. If code is the most important language of the 21st century, women are mostly passive consumers instead of curators and creators of the internet. This has a direct impact on their access to information.\" EIGE also underlined that women and men make different use of computers and the Internet, in relation to E-commerce (women spend more time than men browsing shopping websites; the type of products bought and the forms of payment used differ between women and men; the perception of safety in online purchases is also distinct for both sexes); called for EU-wide indicators of digital competences and media literacy (the digital behaviour and skills are different between women and men and establishing EU-wide indicators is important for assessing the situation); and brought attention to \u201cAmbient Assisted Living\u201d (the gender dimension in ageing and the impact on women\u2019s access to technologies). New social media \" might also magnify gender stereotypes and promote new forms of violence, which might affect more one sex than the other, or in different ways. Stereotypical representations of women and men are broadly accessible in the World Wide Web and online social networks. The internet magnifies the negative impact of these stereotypical representations because they are so easily accessed and transmitted .\" 46 The EIGE report on the Gender Equality Index highlighted that \"new ways of working, the rise of new Internet technologies ( allow) for a greater permeability between the private and public spheres. The greater need for flexibility on the part of organisations has given rise to an increase in low-paid and less secure types of employment, often on a part-time or temporary basis, with positions that are filled by more women than men ...This is gendered, as it often entails that women become disproportionately involved in non- standard and/or precarious work\" 47 . 45 http://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/MH3113742ENC-Women-and-Media-Report-EIGE.pdf 46 See http://www.womengodigital.eu/files/langbakk_pres.pdf 47 http://eige.europa.eu/rdc/eige-publications/gender-equality-index-report ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 18 2.5. The European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) The FRA report on \" Violence against women: an EU-wide survey\" of 2014 examined how the Internet can be used for perpetrating acts of violence against women 48 . It revealed that Cyberstalking , i.e. stalking by means of email, text messages or the Internet is a worrying phenomenon hitting women, notably of young age. Of all 18- to 29- year-old women, 4 % have experienced cyberstalking in the 12 months before the survey interview, compared with 0.3 % of women who are 60 years old or older. The report analysed the role of the Internet and social media and FRA expressed the opinion that \" Internet service providers and social media platforms should take steps to proactively assist victims of stalking to report abuse, and should also proactively address perpetrators' behaviour \". It also noted that: 49 \uf0b7 Twenty-three per cent of stalking victims indicate that they had to change their email address or phone number in response to the most serious case of stalking. Rather than victims having to change their behaviour, the onus should be on internet service providers to address cases of repetitive abuse or stalking in order to protect the victim and inform the perpetrator that they cannot act with impunity, and ultimately to change the perpetrator\u2019s behaviour. This approach was considered by Twitter in the summer of 2013 after a prominent woman campaigner in the UK received repetitive threats via Twitter; thereupon, Twitter indicated it would simplify its \u2018report abuse\u2019 function. \uf0b7 Harassment and stalking online - cyberstalking- is a particular problem for young women because of their greater use of and expose in these mediums. Where cyberstalking exists, operators of social media platforms should ensure that victims have quick and effective resource to assistance if they are targeted by repetitive abusive behaviour. This is particularly important for young people, who may not be in a position to easily stand up to a deluge of abuse that can be in the form of sexual threats and 'hate' in the form of misogyny. \uf0b7 Social media could do more to highlight and respond to abusive behaviour by focusing on the responsibilities of perpetrators and by outlining where online comment becomes threatening and abusive behaviour under the terms of the law and has little to do with the fundamental right of freedom of expression. The report also addresses the issue of Cyber-harassment (covering unwanted sexually explicit offending emails or SMS messages; inappropriate and offending advances on social networking websites such as Facebook, or in Internet chat rooms; the sending or showing sexually explicit offending pictures, photos or gifts that made): it notes that \" ...the risk of young women aged between 18 and 29 years becoming a target of threatening and offensive advances on the internet is twice as high as the risk for women aged between 40 and 49 years, and more than three times as high as the risk for women aged between 50 and 59 years.\" The report also highlights in chapter 6.3.3. that \"Denmark and Sweden (both 18 %), and Slovakia and the Netherlands (both 17 %) show the highest prevalence rates (Figure 6.7). The lowest rates are in Romania (5 %), and in Lithuania and Portugal (both 6 %)\" which is related to the rate of Internet access in these countries. 48 See http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2014-vaw-survey-main-results-apr14_en.pdf 49 European Fundamental Rights Agency, Violence against Women: an EU-wide survey, 2014, p. 93. ",
        "Empowering women on the Internet ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 19 19 The FRA opinion is that \" EU Member States need to review the existing scope of legislative and policy responses to sexual harassment in recognition that it can occur in various settings and can use different mediums, such as the internet . 50 The report calls on EU Member States to evaluate and, where necessary, review definitions of sexual harassment in existing legislation (e.g. employment legislation, criminal law, anti- discrimination law) and to review relevant codes of conduct or guidelines that encompass sexual harassment, also on the basis of the fact that \u201c the survey results indicate that sexual harassment against women involves a range of different perpetrators and can include the use of 'new' technologies . The results indicate that one in 10 women (11 %) has experienced inappropriate advances on social websites or has been subjected to sexually explicit emails or SMS messages. These modes of sexual harassment disproportionally affect younger women. Therefore, the scope of current EU and Member State legislation on sexual harassment could be considered too narrow with respect to its focus on workplace and educational settings. The Council of Europe Istanbul Convention provides a broad definition of sexual harassment (Article 40). In turn, as illustrated by the survey findings, recognition should be given to the fact that this type of conduct can also take place in formal and informal educational settings and in relation to healthcare and leisure facilities. The realities of sexual harassment- as the survey-indicates- also extend to the virtual world, which is not dependent on location or context \". 50 European Fundamental Rights Agency, Violence against Women: an EU-wide survey, 2014, pp. 117-118.
