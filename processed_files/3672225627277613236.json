        "EN 3 EN I NTRODUCTION This working document contains snapshots of the activities of the committees in each policy sectors and includes the relevant data for all the committees in a sector for the year 2008. All individual committees under the responsibility of each Commission department are listed (whether they are active or not). This approach provides for transparency in the policy sector activities. In addition, the textual comments below each table highlight important changes in the organisation of the committees (e.g. creation, transfer or abolition of committees and procedures etc.) as well as cases referred to the Council (in the event of an unfavourable opinion or absence of opinion of the committee) and cases, subject to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, in which the European Parliament or the Council have opposed the adoption of a measure, during the year in question. Explanatory remarks: The following explanations are intended to help the reader to better understand the statistical data, and in particular, why the total number of favourable opinions may differ from the total number of measures adopted in a specific sector: Opinions delivered by the committees may concern various types of measures: they may concern draft Commission acts (directives, regulations), decisions designed to regulate a specific legal situation or decisions to approve financial projects in the context of one of the many Community programmes. In the event of a favourable opinion , the rule is that the Commission adopts the implementing measure; under the management procedure it may also adopt an implementing measure in the absence of an opinion (shown in the \u2018no opinion\u2019 column, although a formal voting has taken place 1 ) and under the advisory procedure , it may also adopt an implementing measure in the event of a negative opinion of the committee. Only if there is an unfavourable opinion or no opinion under the regulatory procedure and the regulatory procedure with scrutiny is a proposal relating to the measure submitted to the Council, which then has the power to decide ( referrals to the Council). In addition, under the regulatory procedure with scrutiny , the European Parliament or the Council can oppose the adoption of a draft measure, even where there is a positive opinion of the committee. Furthermore, the total number of favourable opinions delivered by committees can be different from the number of implementing measures adopted by the Commission in a given sector when opinions are delivered one year but the instruments are not adopted until the following year. In certain cases committees are required to deliver opinions on matters which will not be the subject of a draft implementing measure until some time later. Therefore, in light of the above, there may be considerable discrepancies between the total number of opinions and the number of implementing measures adopted by the Commission. A number of committees had no activity at all in the reporting year. This is indicated by the figure \u201c0\u201d in all columns. It is, however, possible that a committee did not meet at all in the reporting year, 1 This situation occurs if neither the necessary quorum for a favourable , nor for an unfavourable opinion has been reached as a result of the vote.
