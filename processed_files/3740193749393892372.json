        "P8_TA(2018)0010 Energy efficiency ***I Amendments adopted by the European Parliament on 17 January 2018 on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency (COM(2016)0761 \u2014 C8-0498/2016 \u2014 2016/0376(COD)) ( 1 ) (Ordinary legislative procedure: first reading) (2018/C 458/16) Amendment 1 Proposal for a directive Recital 1 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (1) Moderation of energy demand is one of the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy adopted on 25 February 2015. Improving energy efficiency will benefit the environment, reduce greenhouse gas emis- sions, improve energy security by reducing dependence on energy imports from outside the Union, cut energy costs for households and companies, help alleviate energy poverty and lead to increased jobs and economy-wide economic activity. This is in line with the Union commitments made in the framework of the Energy Union and global climate agenda established by the Paris Agreement of December 2015 by the Parties of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change. (1) Moderation of energy demand is one of the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy adopted on 25 February 2015. Improving energy efficiency through - out the full energy chain, including energy generation, transmission, distribution and end-use, will benefit the environment , improve air quality and public health , reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy security by reducing dependence on energy imports from outside the Union, cut energy costs for households and companies, help alleviate energy poverty and lead to increased competitiveness, jobs and economy-wide economic activity thus improving citizens\u2019 quality of life . This is in line with the Union commitments made in the framework of the Energy Union and global climate agenda established by the Conference of the Parties of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) held in Paris in December 2015 (\u2018the Paris Agreement\u2019), committing to holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 o C above pre-industrial levels and to pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 o C above pre- industrial levels. . 19.12.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 458/341 Wednesday 17 January 2018 ( 1 ) The matter was referred back for interinstitutional negotiations to the committee responsible, pursuant to Rule 59(4), fourth subparagraph (A8-0391/2017).

        "Amendment 2 Proposal for a directive Recital 2 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (2) Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 9 ) is an element to progress towards the Energy Union, under which energy efficiency should be treated as an energy source in its own right. The \u2018energy efficiency first\u2019 principle should be taken into account when setting new rules for the supply side and other policy areas. The Commission should ensure that energy efficiency and demand side response can compete on equal terms with generation capacity. Energy efficiency needs to be considered whenever energy system relevant planning or financing decisions are taken. Energy efficiency improvements need to be realised whenever it is more cost-effective than equivalent supply-side solu- tions. This should help to exploit the multiple benefits of energy efficiency for Europe's society , in particular for citizens and businesses. ( 9 ) Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Direc- tives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1). (2) Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 9 ) is an element to progress towards the Energy Union, under which energy efficiency should be treated as an energy source in its own right. The \u2018energy efficiency first\u2019 principle should be taken into account when setting new rules for the supply side and other policy areas. The Commission should prioritise energy efficiency and demand side response over increased generation capacity. Energy efficiency needs to be considered whenever energy system planning and finan- cing decisions are taken. Investments to improve final energy efficiency need to be realised whenever it is more cost-effective than equivalent supply-side solutions. This should help to exploit the multiple benefits of increasing in energy efficiency at all stages of the energy chain and thereby improve the welfare of Europe's society . To unlock the full potential of those benefits, and allow for the successful implementation of the intended policy measures, the Commission and the Member States should work together with local and regional author- ities, cities, businesses and citizens across the Union to ensure that the increase in energy efficiency as a result of technological, behavioural and economic changes go hand in hand with increased economic growth .

        "Amendment 4 Proposal for a directive Recital 2 b (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (2b) Member State measures should be supported by well- designed and effective Union financial instruments, such as the European Structural and Investment Funds, the European Fund for Strategic Investments and the European Investment Bank, which should support energy efficiency investments at all stages of the energy chain and use a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis using a model of differentiated discount rates. Financial support should focus on cost-effective methods for increasing energy efficiency, which would lead to a reduction in energy consumption. Reaching an ambitious energy efficiency target requires barriers to be removed such as the recent clarification from Eurostat on how to record energy performance contracts in national accounts in order to make it easier to invest in energy efficiency measures. Amendment 5 Proposal for a directive Recital 3 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (3) The European Council of October 2014 set a 27 % energy efficiency target for 2030, to be reviewed by 2020 \u2018having in mind an Union level of 30 %\u2019. In December 2015, the European Parliament called upon the Commis- sion to also assess the viability of a 40 % energy efficiency target for the same timeframe. It is therefore appropriate to review and consequently amend the Directive to adapt it to the 2030 perspective.

        "Amendment 102 Proposal for a directive Recital 4 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (4) There are no binding targets at national level in the 2030 perspective. The need for the Union to achieve its energy efficiency targets at EU level, expressed in primary and final energy consumption, in 2020 and 2030 should be clearly set out in the form of a binding 30 % target. This clarification at Union level should not restrict Member States as their freedom is kept to set their national contributions based on either primary or final energy consumption, primary or final energy savings, or energy intensity. Member States should set their national indicative energy efficiency contributions taking into account that the Union\u2019s 2030 energy consumption has to be no more than 1 321 Mtoe of primary energy and no more than 987 Mtoe of final energy. This means that primary energy consumption should be reduced by 23 % and final energy consumption should be reduced by 17 % in the Union compared to 2005 levels. A regular evaluation of progress towards the achievement of the Union 2030 target is necessary and is provided for in the legislative proposal on Energy Union Governance.

Amendment 7 Proposal for a directive Recital 4 a (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (4a) The principle of equity among Member States should be applied when determining national energy efficiency targets. Energy is an essential commodity and minimum levels of energy consumption are therefore inevitable, a fact that should be properly taken into account when setting national targets. In general, countries whose energy consumption per capita is below the Union average should be given more flexibility when setting their targets.

        "Amendment 8 Proposal for a directive Recital 4 b (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (4b) The operational efficiency of energy systems at any given moment is influenced by the ability to feed power generated from different sources \u2014 with different degrees of inertia and start-up times \u2014 into the grid smoothly and flexibly; improving that efficiency will enable better use to be made of renewable energy, such as wind power combined with gas turbines, to avoid overloading networks served by conventional large power units that have significant thermal inertia. Amendment 9 Proposal for a directive Recital 4 c (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (4c) The Commission and the Member States need to ensure that the reduction in energy consumption results from greater energy efficiency and not macro-economic circumstances. Amendment 10 Proposal for a directive Recital 4 d (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (4d) Member States should identify cost-effective energy efficiency potentials on the basis of bottom-up calcula- tion for each sector separately, as those are dependent on the energy mix, economy structure and pace of economic development. 19.12.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 458/345 Wednesday 17 January 2018 ",
        "Amendment 11 Proposal for a directive Recital 5 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (5) The obligation on Member States to establish long-term strategies for mobilising investment in the renovation of their national building stock and notify them to the Commission should be removed from Directive 2012/27/ EU and added to Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 10 ) where it fits with long term plans for nearly zero energy buildings and the decarbonisation of buildings. ( 10 ) Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (OJ L 153, 18.6.2010, p. 13. (5) The obligation on Member States to establish long-term strategies for facilitating the renovation of their national building stock and notify them to the Commission should be removed from Directive 2012/27/EU and added to Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 10 ) where it fits with long term plans for nearly zero energy buildings and the decarbonisation of buildings.

Amendment 12 Proposal for a directive Recital 6 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (6) In view of the climate and energy framework for 2030 the energy savings obligation should be extended beyond 2020. Extending the commitment period beyond 2020 would create greater stability for investors and thus encourage long term investments and long term energy efficiency measures, such as the renovation of buildings. (6) In view of the climate and energy framework for 2030, the energy savings obligation should be extended beyond 2020. Extending the commitment period beyond 2020 would create greater stability for investors and thus encourage long term investments and long term energy efficiency measures, such as the deep renovation of buildings with the long-term objective of achieving a stock of nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs) . The energy savings obligation has been key in leading to the creation of local growth and jobs, and should be continued to ensure that the Union can achieve its energy and climate objectives by creating further opportunities and reduce dependency of energy con- sumption on growth. Cooperation with the private sector is important to assess on which conditions private investment for energy efficiency projects can be unlocked and to develop new revenue models for innovation in the field of energy efficiency.

        "Amendment 13 Proposal for a directive Recital 6 a (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (6a) Energy efficiency improvements also have a positive impact on air quality, as more energy efficient buildings reduce the demand in heating fuels, especially also solid heating fuels. Energy efficiency measures therefore contribute to improving indoor and outdoor air quality and help achieving, in a cost effective manner, the objectives of Union\u2019s air quality policy, as established in particular by Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the Eur- opean Parliament and of the Council ( 1a ).The reduction of energy demand in buildings should be considered to be an element of air quality policy, in general and in particular in Member States where achieving Union\u2019s limits on emissions of air pollutants is problematic and energy efficiency could help attain those goals. ( 1a ) Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC (OJ L 344, 17.12.2016, p. 1). Amendment 14 Proposal for a directive Recital 7 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (7) Member States are required to achieve a cumulative end- use savings requirement for the entire obligation period, equivalent to \u2018new\u2019 savings of 1,5 % of annual energy sales . This requirement could be met by new policy measures that are adopted during the new obligation period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 or by new individual actions as a result of policy measures adopted during or before the previous period, but in respect of which the individual actions that trigger energy savings are actually introduced during the new period. (7) Member States are required to achieve a cumulative end- use savings requirement for the entire obligation period, equivalent to \u2018new\u2019 savings of at least 1,5 %. This requirement could be met by energy savings that stem from policy measures provided that it can be demon- strated that those measures result in individual actions that deliver verifiable energy savings after 2020. Savings in each period should build cumulatively upon the amount of savings to be achieved in previous period(s) . 19.12.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 458/347 Wednesday 17 January 2018 ",
        "Amendment 15 Proposal for a directive Recital 9 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (9) New savings should be additional to business as usual, so that savings that would have occurred in any event may not be claimed. In order to calculate the impact of measures introduced only net savings, measured as the change of energy consumption that is directly attributable to the energy efficiency measure in question, may be counted. To calculate net savings Member States should establish a baseline scenario of how the situation would evolve in the absence of the policy in question. The policy intervention should be evaluated against this defined baseline. Member States should take into account that other policy interventions may be undertaken in the same time frame which may also have an impact on energy savings, so that not all changes observed since the introduction of the policy intervention being evaluated can be attributed to that policy measure only. The actions of the obligated, participating or entrusted party should actually contribute to the achievement of the savings claimed to ensure the fulfilment of the materiality requirement.

        "Amendment 17 Proposal for a directive Recital 10 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (10) Energy savings which result from the implementation of Union legislation may not be claimed unless the measure in question goes beyond the minimum required by the Union legislation in question, whether by setting more ambitious energy efficiency requirements at national level or increasing the take up of the measure. Recognising that renovation of buildings is an essential and long term element in increasing energy savings, it is necessary to clarify that all energy savings stemming from measures promoting the renovation of existing buildings can be claimed if they are additional to developments that would have happened in the absence of the policy measure and if the Member State demonstrates that the obligated, participating or entrusted party has actually contributed to the achievement of the savings claimed from the measure in question. (10) Energy savings which result from the implementation of Union legislation may not be claimed unless the measure in question goes beyond the minimum required by the Union legislation in question, whether by setting more ambitious energy efficiency requirements at national level or increasing the take up of the measure. Buildings present a substantial potential for further increasing energy efficiency, and renovation of buildings is an essential and long term element with economies of scale in increasing energy savings. It is therefore necessary to clarify that all energy savings stemming from measures promoting the renovation of existing buildings can be claimed if they are additional to developments that would have happened in the absence of the policy measure and if the Member State demonstrates that the obligated, participating or entrusted party has actually contributed to the achievement of the savings claimed from the measure in question. Amendment 18 Proposal for a directive Recital 10 a (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (10a) The effective management of water can make a sig- nificant contribution to energy savings. The water and wastewater sector account for 3,5 % of electricity use in the Union ( 1a ). Moreover, water demand is expected to increase by 25 % by 2040, mainly in urban areas. At the same time, water leaks account for 24 % of the total amount of water consumed in the Union, resulting in energy and water losses. All measures aiming to achieve more effective water management and a reduction in water use therefore have the potential to make a significant contribution to the Union's energy efficiency objective ( 1b ).

Amendment 21 Proposal for a directive Recital 10 d (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (10d) The water and wastewater sector can also contribute to the production of renewable energy and the reduction of fossil energy supply. For instance, the recovery of energy from sludge produced through the treatment of waste- water, makes it possible to produce energy on site.

        "Amendment 22 Proposal for a directive Recital 12 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (12) Improvements to the energy efficiency of buildings should benefit in particular consumers affected by energy poverty. Member States can already require obligated parties to include social aims in energy saving measures, in relation to energy poverty , and this possibility should now be extended to alternative measures and transformed into an obligation while leaving full flexibility to Member States with regard to the size, scope and content of such measures. In line with Article 9 of the Treaty, the Union's energy efficiency policies should be inclusive and there- fore also ensure accessibility of energy efficiency measures for energy poor consumers. (12) Improvements to the energy efficiency of buildings should benefit all consumers and in particular low- income households, including those affected by energy poverty . Each Member State may define energy poverty and what constitutes a low-income household in accordance with its specific national circumstances .

Amendment 23 Proposal for a directive Recital 12 a (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (12a) Reacting to daytime and night-time demand for electricity is an important instrument for improving energy efficiency, since it significantly increases energy saving opportunities for consumers by allowing them to make decisions based on information indicating the possibility of optimising energy consumption when energy is in demand, including at peak times, so as to enable better use of transmission networks and productive resources. 19.12.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 458/351 Wednesday 17 January 2018 ",
        "Amendment 24 Proposal for a directive Recital 12 b (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (12b) Low energy bills should be achieved by assisting consumers in reducing their energy use via reduction of energy needs of buildings, improvements in the efficiency of appliances, availability of low energy transport modes integrated with public transport and cycling. Improving building envelopes and reducing energy needs and uses are fundamental aspects to ameliorate health conditions of low income segments of the population. Amendment 25 Proposal for a directive Recital 12 c (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (12c) It is crucial to raise awareness and provide accurate information about the benefits of increased energy efficiency and its possible implementation to all Union citizens. Increased energy efficiency is also crucial for geopolitical position and security of the Union through lowering its dependency on import of fuels from third countries.

        "Amendment 26 Proposal for a directive Recital 12 d (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (12d) Around 50 million households in the Union are affected by energy poverty. Energy efficiency measures must therefore be central to any cost-effective strategy to address energy poverty and consumer vulnerability and are complementary to social security policies at Member State level. To ensure that energy efficiency measures reduce energy poverty for tenants sustainably, the cost- effectiveness of such measures, as well as affordability to owners and tenants should be taken into account, and adequate financial support for such measures should be guaranteed at Member State level. The Union's building stock will need to become, in the long term, NZEBs, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Present building renovation rates are insufficient and buildings occupied by low-income citizens affected by energy poverty are the hardest to reach. The measures laid down in this Regulation with regard to energy savings obligations, energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures are therefore of particular importance. Amendment 27 Proposal for a directive Recital 12 e (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (12e) The costs and benefits of all energy efficiency measures taken, including pay-back periods, should be made fully transparent to consumers. 19.12.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 458/353 Wednesday 17 January 2018 ",

Articles 9 to 11 and Annex VII of Directive 2012/27/EU should be amended to provide for frequent and enhanced feedback on energy consumption. It should also clarified that rights relating to billing and billing information apply for consumers of heating, cooling or hot water supplied from a central source even where they have no direct, individual contractual relationship with an energy supplier. Therefore, for the purposes of these provisions, the term \u2018final user\u2019, should cover final customers purchasing heating, cooling or hot water for their own use as well as occupants of individual units of multi-apartment or multi-purpose buildings where such units are supplied from a central source. The term \u2018sub- metering\u2019 should refer to measuring consumption in individual units of such buildings. By 1 January 2020 newly installed heat meters and heat cost allocators should be remotely readable to ensure cost-effective, frequent provision of consumption information. The new Article 9a is intended to apply only to heating, cooling and hot water supplied from a central source. (14) As part of the measures set out in the Commission's Communication New Deal for Energy Consumers, in the context of the Energy Union and the Heating and Cooling strategy, consumers' minimum rights to accurate, reliable, clear and timely information about their energy consumption need to be strengthened. Whilst individual metering should continue to be required where it is technically feasible and cost-effective in terms of being proportionate in relation to the potential energy savings, Articles 9 to 11 and Annex VII to Directive 2012/27/EU should be amended to provide for frequent and enhanced feedback on energy consumption , taking into account the availability and capabilities of measurement devices, with the aim to optimise energy use. Member States should also take into account that the successful implementation of new technologies for measuring energy consumption require enhanced in- vestment in education and skills for both users and energy suppliers . It should also be clarified that rights relating to billing and billing or consumption information apply for consumers of heating, cooling or hot water supplied from a central source even where they have no direct, individual contractual relationship with an energy supplier.

However, con- sidering that bill-related disputes are a very common source of consumer complaints, a factor which con- tributes to persistently low levels of consumer satisfac- tion and engagement in the energy sector, it is necessary to make bills simpler, clearer and easier to understand, while ensuring that separate instruments, such as billing information, information tools and annual statements, provide all the necessary information to enable consumers to regulate their energy consumption, compare offers and switch suppliers. 19.12.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 458/357 Wednesday 17 January 2018 ",

        "Amendment 37 Proposal for a directive Recital 16 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (16) Reflecting technological progress and the growing share of renewable energy sources in the electricity generation sector, the default coefficient for savings in kWh electricity should be reviewed in order to reflect changes in the primary energy factor (PEF) for electricity . Calculations of the PEF for electricity are based on annual average values. The Physical energy content accounting method is used for nuclear electricity and heat generation and the Technical conversion efficiency method is used for electricity and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass. For non-combustible renewable energy, the method is the direct equivalent based on the Total primary energy approach. To calculate the primary energy share for electricity in CHP the method set out in Annex II of Directive 2012/27/EU is applied. An average market position is used rather than a marginal one. Conversion efficiencies are assumed to be 100 % for non-combustible renewables, 10 % for geothermal power stations and 33 % for nuclear power stations. Total efficiency for cogeneration is calculated based on the most recent data from Eurostat. As for system boundaries the PEF is 1 for all energy sources. Calculations are based on the most recent version of the PRIMES Reference Scenario. The PEF value is based on the projection for 2020. The analysis covers the EU Member States and Norway. The dataset for Norway is based on ENTSO-E data . (16) Strictly limited to the objectives of this Directive and reflecting technological progress and the growing share of renewable energy sources in the electricity generation sector, the default coefficient for savings in kWh electricity should be carefully analysed and possibly reviewed in order to reflect changes in the primary energy factor (PEF) for electricity , reflecting the energy mix of the respective Member State by way of a comparable and transparent methodology . 19.12.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 458/359 Wednesday 17 January 2018 ",

Amendment 39 Proposal for a directive Recital 16 b (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (16b) The primary energy factor (PEF) should be used as a tool to reduce the consumption of and dependency on fossil fuels and increase energy efficiency as well as the further expansion of renewable energy resources. In this regard, the default coefficient for savings in kWh electricity should be adapted when technological, economic or social developments demonstrate the need for a lower default coefficient. The Commission should analyse, and, if appropriate, present a legislative proposal to amend the default coefficient of the PEF by 2024.
