        "5 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P INTRODUCTION The Factories of the Future Public-Private Partnership (FoF PPP), launched under the European Economic Recovery Plan, addresses the development of the next generation of produc- tion technologies that will be applied from 2015 onwards. The overall budget contribution to the initiative amounts to \u20ac1, 200 million between 2010 and 2013, to be equally shared between the European Commission and the private sector. This Strategic Multi-annual Roadmap has been prepared by the industrial representatives in the Ad-Hoc Industrial Advisory Group for the Factories of the Future Public-Private Partner- ship (AIAG FoF PPP), which was created in March 2009 with the goal to help define the research content of this initiative. The present document lays out industrial research priority ar- eas for the implementation of the FoF PPP covering the period from 2010 to 2013. The European Technology Platform on \"Future Manufactur- ing Technologies\" (\u2018MANUFUTURE\u2019) has strongly supported this process, together with its national Manufuture platforms, working groups and sub-platforms, namely Agriculture Engi- neering Technologies (\u2018AET\u2019), Clean Environmental Technolo- gies (\u2018CET\u2019), European Concept, Foot Wear including Sports, Micro Nano Manufacturing (\u2018MINAM\u2019), Rapid Manufacturing (\u2018RM\u2019) and European Tooling, following in this way a cross- sectoral and cross-disciplinary approach. The preparation of this document is also based on a wider stakeholders consultation, including the input from the Euro- pean Technology Platforms on Advanced Engineering Materi- als and Technologies (\u2018EuMat\u2019), European Steel Technology Platform (\u2018ESTEP\u2019), Future Textiles and Clothing (\u2018FTC\u2019), Pho- tonics21 (\u2018Photonics\u2019), Sustainable Chemistry (SusChem), Food for Life (FOOD), European Robotics Technology Plat- form (\u2018EUROP\u2019), Networked European Software and services Initiative (NESSI), European Platform on smart systems Inte- gration (\u2018EPoSS\u2019), European Nanoelectronics Initiative Adviso- ry Council (\u2018ENIAC\u2019) and Advanced Research and Technology for Embedded Intelligence and Systems (\u2018ARTEMIS\u2019). The focus of this PPP initiative is to support collaborative research projects on innovative enabling technologies of multi-sectoral benefit and oriented towards industrial factory application. Therefore, the research priority areas also include industrially-relevant demonstration elements especially for the benefit of SMEs, which are important stakeholders because they represent the large majority (above 90%) of manufactur- ing enterprises in Europe. Increased demonstration activities are foreseen towards the end of the four-year period. Project results are expected to be implemented as improve- ments in production processes shortly after the conclusion of the funded projects, with commercial solutions leading to wealth creation through a competitive market position and added value generation. BACKGROUND This Strategic Multi-annual Roadmap for research and tech- nological development in the field of manufacturing has been developed taking into consideration the main social, techno- logical, environmental, economic, political and market drivers for the manufacturing sector. Thus, the Roadmap identifies the research needed by European industry to meet its goals and face up to the challenges of the coming years. Industrial research in Europe under this initiative is expected to comply with the following two main requirements: its achieve- ments should make a significant contribution to the sustain- ability of economy and society in Europe and the results of 1.

        "7 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P the research should start to provide an economic return within around two years after the conclusion of the projects. A sus- tainable European manufacturing industry needs to consider sustainability not only in terms of energy and resource efficien- cy but also regarding the social issues related to employees. There are many companies in Europe, mainly family owned and SMEs, that have functioned very successfully according to these concepts over decades. A factory is more than a smart combination of autonomous machines and processes that can easily be shifted to any other location in the world. It is an entity which focuses on intelligent person-machine co- operation in which advanced technology is as important as a sound ethical basis for stabilising local and global manufactur- ing. All this will directly impact on the sustainability of the Eu- ropean manufacturing industry and its most important social benefit will be to keep manufacturing-related jobs in Europe. Technology, even though it plays an important role, is only one term in the equation that leads to economic success and sus- tainable growth for Europe. Human skills, the organisational structure, the medium- and long-term strategic goals and the rules for financial decisions are at least as important. Knowl- edge-based innovation in processes, products, and systems is the key concept: innovation leading to new life-cycle based product-services, manufactured in a sustainable way, and responding to the demands of customers and society. Technology development needs to be placed into such a global context and this can require a re-thinking of internal strategies in enterprises. The European manufacturing industry needs to change its approach from cost-cutting to knowledge-based value adding, in order to achieve sustainable and competitive growth. The \u201cFactories of the Future\u201d PPP initiative is part of the European response to the current economic crisis, plac- ing sustainability alongside competitiveness, profitability and employment as strategic goals. This has led to formulate \u201cThe Factory made in Europe\u201d as a product of the future, address- ing simultaneously the economical, environmental and societal challenges, in line with the aims of this PPP. As a result of many workshops and strategic discussions within the European stakeholders from manufacturing industries and the related research community, it has been determined that the successful development of high added value technology should con- sider the following strategic sub-domains: > Sustainable manufacturing > ICT-enabled intelligent manufacturing > High performance manufacturing > Exploiting new materials through manufacturing In the following pages, the content of these sub-domains is further elaborated and specific priorities are identified, to be taken as input when preparing the call topics in the annual or biannual Work Programmes governing the FoF PPP Calls for proposals. All the research areas described in this document are expected to satisfy the following criteria: a clear enabling character, a specific focus on production technologies and, last but not least, an evident cross-sectoral application po- tential. By developing this public-private partnership, there is a com- mitment from both the public and the private sides to invest in new technologies and innovation that will sustain busi- nesses in the medium term. The main aim of this Multi-annual Roadmap is to inspire industries to develop and demonstrate knowledge-based innovations leading to sustainable and competitive manufacturing in Europe.

        "9 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P Europe is one of the main players in the global economy and both process and discrete manufacturing industries contrib- ute to a large extent to this situation. In the globalised world of the third millennium the following Social, Technological, Environmental, Economical and Political (STEEP) factors are among the main drivers for the current and future economy: globalisation of the economy, climate change, scarcity of stra- tegic raw materials, overpopulation, employment, security of energy supply, ageing population, public health for all, poverty and social exclusion, loss of bio-diversity, increasing waste volumes, soil loss and transport congestion. In this context, many enterprises are struggling to survive in the currently turbulent markets, whilst some are leaders in gain- ing new markets and effectiveness by putting their future in new products and services, and in emerging technologies, having their focus already on technical innovation and strong customer-orientation. The latter are known worldwide as high performing manufacturers and deliverers of high-quality techni- cal products and/or services. All of these enterprises need to be orientated towards the strategic development of factories (including high added value manufacturing in general as well as the specific changes to the particular factory system). This makes it necessary to implement the \u201cFactories of the Future\u201d initiative and to share experiences on the structural changes required to facilitate the transition from the factory system of the past to more competitive and sustainable factories. From the manufacturing R&D perspective, the above-mentioned global drivers lead to a new vision for the future, the so-called Com- petitive and Sustainable Manufacturing (CSM), which: > embraces the Social, Technological, Economical, Envi- ronmental and Political (STEEP) context; > generates wealth, which in turn sustains high quality jobs, and manages human and physical resources (including skills development); > concerns High Added Value products, processes and product based-services sustaining their life cycles, bu- siness models and the stakeholders involved through the supply chain; > relies on stakeholders ranging from the customer-base to industry to research institutes, universities, Euro- pean, national, regional public authorities and interme- diate organizations, implementing the research inno- vation market value chain; and > sustains knowledge generation, diffusion and use. CSM promotes the transformation of the European manufac- turing industry into a high added value and knowledge-based industry, which is competitive in a globalised world. CEE.pdf 11 25/03/10 15:43 ",
        "10 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P The strategies envisaged are targeted at: > transformation of enterprises due to the needs of customisation and sustainability, thus increasing the chances of success and global leadership; > boosting the level of technologies for products and processes towards global leadership; > making Europe a global leader as both the producer and operator of factories and factory equipment (lead markets) with intelligent products, processes and new business models; and > activating the potential of novel enabling technologies and developing solutions for emerging markets. The Manufuture European Technology Platform has devel- oped the necessary Strategic Intelligence: the Vision 2020, the Manufuture Porto Manifesto with its action lines (stimulate private R&D investment, foster collaboration within a research network, prepare appropriate standards and regulations, overcome fragmentation in EU R&D and leverage EU\u2019s sci- ence and research potential), the Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) and Roadmaps and related implementation framework. Within the research activities of the European Economic Recovery Plan, the new \u201cFactories of the Future Initiative\u201d is building on the work of the Manufuture European Technology Platform and related European Technology Platforms and Sub-platforms in the field of manufacturing. The development and implementation of the \u201cFoF PPP\u201d is linked to: > a Strategic Intelligence: Vision, SRAs, Roadmaps, as provided by Manufuture and related Platforms; > a Reference Model for action, taking into account STEEP conditions, deriving potential \u201cFactory System\u201d concepts at given time horizons and defining the Ena- bling Production Technologies necessary to implement them; > human, infrastructural and financial resources; > continuous revision of the above, following a \u2018rolling approach\u2019, taking into account the evolution in STEEP conditions and changes in European policy.

        "11 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P In line with the goals set out in the European Economic Recovery Plan, it is hoped that this Factories of the Future PPP Strategic Multi-annual Roadmap (2010-2013) will provide the research tools to help EU manufacturers, in particular SMEs, across sectors, to adapt to global competitive pressures. This will be achieved by improving the technological base of EU manufacturing through the development and integration of the knowledge-based enabling technologies of the future, such as engineering technologies for adaptable machines and in- dustrial processes, ICT, and advanced materials, covering the production value-chain from raw materials to semi-finished and to final products and their related services. To account for the complexity and make optimum use of the work done by the Manufuture Platform and other European Technology Platforms, this Roadmap has been structured into the four already mentioned sub-domains: > Sustainable manufacturing > ICT-enabled intelligent manufacturing > High performance manufacturing > Exploiting new materials through manufacturing CEE.pdf 13 25/03/10 15:43 ",

        "13 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P In order to face the challenge of global competition, the Eu- ropean manufacturing industry will increasingly be forced to concentrate on specific issues providing a large competitive advantage through long-term innovation at the factory level. A key factor to strengthen European leadership in product and process engineering and in the development of manu- facturing systems, both discrete and continuous, will be the ability to achieve cost efficiency (including factors such as material supply, transportation, and cost of manpower), high performance and enhanced robustness, in a context of in- creasing product variability and continuously changing pro- duction volumes. In the present scenario of global market competition, the R&D challenges to achieve a higher competitiveness of the manu- facturing systems should be considered in terms of general evolution drivers, such as: a) cost efficiency , with extensive adoption of standards in production machinery, equipment and controls and mas- sive use of the lean approach; b) optimised consumption of resources through the use of energy and material efficient processes and machin- ery , renewable power sources, and smart energy man- agement with extensive recovery of heat and dissipated energy; c) short time-to-market (from the concept to new prod- ucts on the market), enabled by ICT applications, which will increasingly be relevant in manufacturing industries; d) increased focus on high added value components/goods through the use of enabling processing technologies and enhanced materials ; e) adaptability/re-configurability through a modular ap- proach in production systems, in order to maximise au- tonomy and interaction capability of machinery and con- tinuous re-use of existing infrastructures; f) higher and more stable product quality through increased process robustness and accuracy, while ensuring an easy process maintainability; g) higher productivity under enhanced safety and ergo- nomics conditions , through an upstream integration in factory design of workplace optimisation for human well- being; h) increased reusability of production systems towards global interoperable factories , which are able to provide services and develop products anytime and anywhere, independently of the technologies, culture or language in use in the different production sites; i) new products , requiring new manufacturing technologies adapted to new features. Manufacturing research should focus on the transformation of the present factories, towards re-usable, flexible, modular, intelligent, digital, virtual, affordable, easy-to-adapt, easy-to- operate, easy-to-maintain and highly reliable \u201cFactories of the Future\u201d. 3.1 Sustainable manufacturing For European industry, sustainability needs to be today a stra- tegic objective. The competitiveness of European industry can be enhanced by implementing key knowledge for new applications in different technologies and disciplines. Howev- er, the manufacturing industry needs to be able to design and produce goods using a sustainable approach. \"Sustainable\" in production terms means energy efficient with a minimal environmental impact, compliant to the regulatory constraints and fulfilling the safety and health requirements, while ensur- ing profitability for economic growth. Support for \"de-manu- facturing\" or advanced recycling of products and production process waste is equally required. CEE.pdf 15 25/03/10 15:43 ",
        "14 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P European manufacturers have taken up the challenge of de- signing sustainable production systems that have a minimal unfriendly effect for environment and society. Sustainability is now at the centre of industrial R&D. Environmental chal- lenges such as climate change and resource scarcity are the source of both constraints and opportunities for technologi- cal development. Research has to satisfy both environmental and customer needs, generating high added-value products, related processes and technologies to meet functionality re- quirements as well as growth conditions, public health, occu- pational safety and environmental protection concerns. The following approaches should be developed: > New Eco-Factory model (short-term impact): op- timised utilisation of energy streams, reduction of environmental impact and improvement of resource efficiency will be the basis of the new advanced green manufacturing. > Green Products Manufacturing (medium-term im- pact): application of an integrated preventive environ- mental strategy to processes and products in order to increase the overall efficiency by the conservation of resources and energy, towards the elimination of emissions and wastes by point source treatment and recycling. Sustainability, balancing environmental friendliness, eco- nomic growth and social well-being, will be assured through enhanced environmental awareness in production systems design, sustainable manufacturing processes and an eco- friendly supply chain. The new approaches of Eco-Factory models and Green Products Manufacturing should provide the means to: > design and produce sustainable products with drasti- cally reduced resource utilisation, and > develop advanced manufacturing processes based on renewable resources, if possible, and on safety and ergonomics for operators and users. These approaches will address at the same time: > Environmental friendliness : specific solutions to minimise the environmental impact and resources consumption with optimised costs; > Economic growth : technological solutions to achieve cost reduction by means of optimised resource mana- gement and efficient production processes; > Social well-being : safety and ergonomics of current and new manufacturing facilities as well as new ways of interaction between machine and human beings which redefine the human role in the manufacturing environment. The main research areas related to sustainable manufacturing are listed in the following sections, taking into account which of the three elements above is the closest to the centre of gravity of the research: (a) Environmental friendliness The new Eco-factory model, using technologies for resource efficiency and cleaner manufacturing, can make large cuts in energy consumption by monitoring the process conditions and the resources used in production, replacing and up-dat- ing equipment, configuring systems according to differenti- CEE.pdf 16 25/03/10 15:43 ",
        "15 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P ated processing needs, employing multi-functional devices and even by simply ensuring equipment is turned off after use. The main objectives are the following: (a1) High efficiency and near-to-zero emissions in man- ufacturing processes. Optimised self-adaptive and fault tolerant strategies, which lead to higher productivity and reduced energy consumption and process emis- sions (dust, air, water, noise, waste, etc.). Control-inten- sive applications with high effectiveness and usability of the integrated automation and control systems. Energy- efficient production equipment able to improve energy recovery, harvesting and scavenging capabilities, as well as self-cleaning production systems (proposed for 2011). (a2) Alternatives to energy-intensive processes based on advanced production and manufacturing sys- tems. Production solutions enabling low resource input, low emission, products tailored for different applications, surface treatments and functionalisation, painting, coat- ing and joining, development of compact processes, ensuring high process productivity while reducing envi- ronmental impact (proposed for 2011). (a3) Improved use of renewable resources at factory level. Development of new solutions for green house gases emission reduction, in particular by using alter- native materials and/or energy sources and innovative technology application (proposed for 2012/13). (a4) Production using environment-neutral materials. Growing use of alternative materials in the production environment (e.g. use of renewable materials, bio-proc- esses, heavy metals control, fossil resources control), adequate management of hazardous materials (meas- urement methods, treatment standards) and increased use of bio-renewable materials. Development of new technologies for processing, recycling and recovery of materials and energy from waste, producing secondary materials with a high degree of purity and re-workability at lowest energy consumption (proposed for 2012/13). (b) Economic growth Improvement of product sustainability through new processes and technologies, incorporating at the same time the cus- tomer requirements. The focus will be on solutions with high potential in terms of cost reduction supported by advanced decision making tools and correlated to optimisation of resource and equipment efficiency. (b1) Methodologies and tools for sustainable mainte- nance of production equipment. Smart and agile maintenance approaches that may increase the lifetime and energy efficiency of the production equipment and reduce its maintenance cost. At maintenance process level, research should address maintenance flexibility, conflict handling in volatile production environments, pre- dictive maintenance planning and scheduling, use of ad- vanced embedded information devices, integration with the appropriate software (i.e. Manufacturing Execution Systeme - MES) and remote control systems. At equip- ment level, R&D should aim at increased lifetime of criti- cal components and reliability, higher resistance against failure, reduced energy consumption, minimised wear or corrosion, etc. (proposed for 2012/13).

        "16 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P (b2) Innovative re-use of equipment and integrated factory lay-out design with higher cross-sector stand- ardisation and modular approach. Proactive modu- larisation and re-use strategies for the development of the future machinery and production systems and their integration in old, new or renewed factory buildings. A new approach should leverage all potential synergies between concurrent process and building design, as well as best practices for de-manufacturing, dismantling, recycling and value chain extension, integrated with in- formation related to the recovery of the product with envi- ronmental policies at the product design stage. A further approach should focus on flexible, low-cost assembly solutions to aim at a high penetration of the machine component supplier market by developing low weight and mobile solutions (e.g. flexible grippers), as well as visual systems for object recognition and environment detection/interpretation (proposed for 2012/13). (b3) Decision support methodologies for the design of manufacturing systems based on integrated prod- uct-process approaches and economic/technical risk analysis. Risk assessment in the design of manu- facturing systems based on the knowledge-based engi- neering concept linked with re-usable CAD/CAE based solutions, methodologies to evaluate risks associated with a complex and/or innovative technological equip- ment design (e.g. Technology advisor, Cost advisor and LCA advisor), fast integration of machines and control systems capable of switching from producing one mod- el to another to meet fluctuating and diverse demand (proposed for 2011/12). (c) Social well-being The main objective of this section is to develop new forms of interaction between process, machinery and human beings in such a way that future factories can be operated profit- ably and at the same time provide a stimulating environment for the employees, and make the most from their skills and knowledge through life-long learning and training. The his- tory of product manufacturing proves that the cultural back- grounds of people in a factory are also a determining factor for its success. In the new Eco-factory the environment for humans will provide the best conditions for coping with prod- ucts with a short cycle time and a high variability, for handling possible ups and downs in economic cycles, for quick ad- aptation of manufacturing capability and for the development of knowledge. (c1) Adaptive and responsive human machine inter- face. Innovative solutions have to be developed on how a factory can be run profitably and, at the same time, to provide satisfactory work places for the employees. Advanced adaptive and responsive technical devices enable the creation of such environments (proposed for 2012/13). (c2) New human-robot interactive cooperation in ad- vanced factory environments. Development of tools for a manufacturing environment that interlink the per- sonal skills of humans with machines in such a way that human intuition and learning are enhanced and chang- ing working conditions are optimally met. Effective col- laboration between robots and humans requires the use of an efficient interface whereby a human can communi- cate and interact with a robot almost as efficiently as he would with another human. Human-robot collaboration CEE.pdf 18 25/03/10 15:43 ",

By aiming to shorten ramp-up times and increase machine availability, the development of intrinsic machine safety concepts for increasing human-robot and human\u2013machine interaction is required for reliable protection for machine operators and maintenance personnel (proposed for 2012/13). (c3) The new human-centred production site. Method- ologies for enhancing flexible smart automation while maintaining a level of employment with highly satisfied and highly skilled workers. Research is necessary to guarantee an efficient transition from current to future situations in relation to the definition of future worker skills (multidisciplinary involvement of single workers in operations, maintenance, logistics and quality control), enhanced ergonomics (optimisation and personalisation of working conditions and methods based on worker\u2019s age, experience and physical state) and integration of the European Factories of the Future in its social and urban environment (urban transport, parking, shopping and en- tertainment centres, support to families, etc.) (proposed for 2012/2013). (c4) Development and adaptation of organisational structures and leadership for sustainability. His- torical management structures and industrial business models need to be radically expanded in order to take into account sustainability requirements. New key per- formance indicators that include sustainability parame- ters need to be developed, as well as new management strategies and ways to deal with cultural differences will be needed in order to support sustainable competitive- ness. To make such knowledge more tangible for the day to day operation of an enterprise, new forms of inter- disciplinary research are needed, to understand the cor- relation of such areas as financial decision mechanisms and ethical business strategy with continuous business success (proposed for 2012). 3.2 ICT-enabled intelligent manufacturing The contribution of Information and Communication Technol- ogies (ICT) to manufacturing aims to improve the efficiency, adaptability and sustainability of production systems and their integration within agile business models and processes in an increasingly globalised industry, requiring continuous change of processes, products and production volumes. Also the further integration of any newly developed ICT into the pro- duction lines and the industrial environments requires com- plementary research and innovation efforts. These integration aspects will play a key role for generating and using smart production systems for factories in different industrial sectors. ICT is a key enabler for improving manufacturing systems at three levels: > agile manufacturing and customisation involving pro- cess automation control, planning, simulation and op- timisation technologies, robotics, and tools for sustai- nable manufacturing ( smart factories ); > value creation from global networked operations invol- ving global supply chain management, product-service linkage and management of distributed manufacturing assets ( virtual factories ); > a better understanding and design of production and manufacturing systems for better product life cycle management involving simulation, modelling and CEE.pdf 19 25/03/10 15:43 ",

The main research areas related to ICT-enabled intelligent manufacturing should include: (a) Smart Factories: Agile manufacturing and customisation Future production sites for a large variety of sophisticated prod- ucts will offer flexible, short cycle time and variability controlled manufacturing capability. These manufacturing approaches ensure energy-efficient, reliable and cost-effective produc- tion as well as production set-up/ramp-up with reduced cost and time through lean and simpler ICT. Important develop- ments in automation are foreseen from the increasing conver- gence of machine control and personal computer technology. Related industry-driven R&D activities should include: (a1) Adaptive and fault tolerant process automation, control and optimisation technologies and tools. Novel large-scale control-intensive applications for high yield performance and energy efficiency, in order to vali- date and benchmark the effectiveness and usability of the integrated automation and control systems, e.g. by means of fully integrated interfaces from Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) to shop floor level or knowl- edge management of process data with shop floor rel- evance (proposed for 2011).

Related industry driven R&D activities should include: (b1) Increasing management efficiency of global net- worked manufacturing. Enabling technologies under the emergent Internet of Things (IoT), meaning a network of devices such as RFID, wireless sensor networks, and machine-to-machine communication, significantly con- tributing to increased logistics efficiency, real-time moni- toring of material flows and resource use. Integrating the IoT with an Internet of Services (IoS) in order to enable new rea-time network visibility for global manufacturing and logistics network (proposed for 2011). (b2) ICT for sustaining the value of products. ICT tools supporting the production of smart industrial goods, al- lowing advanced maintenance technologies and serv- ices (e.g. predictive and remote equipment maintenance simultaneously and across different sites), addressing challenges such as product quality and reliability, re- ducing waste and energy demand, enhancing safety and supporting fully automated life-cycle management, including product upgrades, re-manufacturing, recycling and disposal (proposed for 2012/13). (b3) Product/service systems. Supporting the manufactur- ing industry in its transition towards providing customer value via product-linked services and solutions based on integrated product/service systems and the co-creation of value (proposed for 2012/13). (b4) Managing volatile manufacturing assets. Market related manufacturing knowledge is essential to the glo- bal success of Europe's industry. Effective networked manufacturing requires the inclusion of virtual factory and multi-level supply chain elements related to economic factors, such as real-time asset management methods (e.g. for materials & high-tech commodity costs, rout- ings, inventories), skills, IPR and value sharing which are distributed across production sites, stakeholders and machinery (proposed for 2011). (c) Digital factories : Manufacturing design and product life cycle management Addressing the front-end stages of manufacturing, in particu- lar early concept modelling, simulation and evaluation, as well as the transformation of the knowledge-time curve, thus en- suring greater acquisition of knowledge earlier so that better informed manufacturing decisions can be taken. The handling of uncertainty is also a crucial area. The R&D focus is on: (c1) Knowledge and analysis. Comprehensive engineer- ing platforms that enable cross-disciplinary information sharing and the capture and transfer of industrial design knowledge (e.g. innovative methods for knowledge cap- turing, innovative access to new and existing knowledge on product-services, effectively supporting re-use of knowledge and collaborative work on product/design/ manufacturing/usage) across stakeholders and through- out the lifecycle, for example drawing knowledge from customer use to improve design (proposed for 2012/13). (c2) Enhanced, interoperable models for products and processes. More intelligent models providing details of design intent, as well as with better predictive capabilities to help reduce the need for physical prototyping or the erection of pilot plants. Modelling encompassing material and component properties and variations of these, and helping to identify impacts of corrosion, stress, tempera- ture, etc. (proposed for 2012/13). (c3) Design environments. Self-organising, collaborative design environments able to adapt to the needs of differ- ent sectors and industries, including facilities for product modelling, decision-making (e.g. needs/requirements CEE.pdf 21 25/03/10 15:43 ",

Location- and context-aware design environments with filters that direct selected information to users according to their roles and needs (proposed for 2012/13). (c4) Lifecycle management. In addition to the technical data management perspective, product lifecycle management for all design information and analysis results requires syn- thesis methods and tools to adequately design products. As sustainability assessment includes economic and so- cial as well as environmental issues, classical lifecycle as- sessment (LCA) methods and tools may prove inadequate for a holistic LCA approach based on a consistent set of information on products, components and energy. The re- sults of the LCA need to be digested and made available to product designers to effectively shape future products. Decision makers should be able to weigh environmental and economic impacts against each other along the com- plete product lifecycle (proposed for 2012/13). 3.3 High performance manufacturing The economic crisis is having a strong effect on new industrial investments in production and process equipment, in particu- lar for SMEs, since the return on investment must be thor- oughly justified. Therefore, there is a need for manufacturing systems that are flexible enough and, at the same time, are robust, reliable and cost effective. This cannot be achieved through advanced technology alone. Optimisation of such complex manufacturing systems increasingly relies on human workers, advanced machinery, ICT and use of resources. The aim would be to allow improvements through succes- sive investments in production equipment, as well as an easy reconfiguration from small to large production series, or small to large production capacity using flexible technologies such as modular production units. Furthermore, the new solutions should bring the integration of the necessary ICT support pro- viding simplification and real user friendliness. The main research areas relevant to high-performance manu- facturing fall into four domains: (a) Flexible adaptive production equipment, systems and plants for rapid (re)configurations and optimal energy use The current industrial market is characterised by a turbulent and uncertain demand for highly customised products, of a complexity which is in constant increase. Compared to the past, customers require higher quality, faster delivery times, and shorter times between successive generations of prod- ucts. Two additional aspects must be considered: the current financial situation pushes manufacturers to reduce invest- ments in production resources over time and sustainabil- ity issues impose that machines are able to efficiently and ecologically support the production of new future products without being substituted. All this requires high flexibility and permanent adaptation of machines, process equipment and production systems to products and process evolution, with special consideration to traditional industries. The research activities should include: CEE.pdf 22 25/03/10 15:43 ",

New equipment, machines and production systems requiring less shop-floor space, by means of reduction of peripherals, optimisation of cycles and proc- ess planning (proposed for 2011). (a2) Plug and produce components based on intel- ligent materials or combinations of passive and active materials (engineered materials) to increase the adaptability of production systems.

(a3) New hybrid production systems for manufacturing and assembly/disassembly, based on improved ro- botics and/or automation technology for coopera- tive production tasks between humans and robots. These systems will be developed considering the spe- cific needs of SMEs (proposed for 2012/13). (a4) Adaptive machines and production systems for optimal energy consumption. Flexible adaptation of energy resources for high performance machine drives. Concepts such as obtaining energy on demand and feed-forward strategies should be exploited, with special attention to high energy footprint industries (proposed for 2012/13). (b) High precision micro-manufacturing machines and systems Future manufacturing technologies will move towards the manufacturing of topologically 3D optimized parts with com- plex internal structures such as conductive or cooling channels and material gradient structures. Miniaturisation of products and production appliances and integrated compact systems design will be key issues for future manufacturing. High quality and high performance manufacturing, parts consolidation and simplification, multiple materials and the reduction of manu- facturing and assembly costs must be addressed.

(c) Tools for production planning and in-situ simulation for open reconfigurable and adaptive manufacturing systems New high performance processes, machines and produc- tion systems will require new methods and tools for ma- chine design and operation monitoring. Considering the need of production systems to evolve in line with products and processes, new ways to manage initial and ongoing system configuration are needed. During operation, knowl- edge based tools supporting production planning should be developed, and simulation methodologies should be introduced in Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and on board in the machine, integrated with process control. Using the input by sensorial supervision and monitoring and with the actual load, it will be possible to predict the process behaviour and, if necessary, to compensate de- viations of precision and accuracy or to control manufac- turing processes by learning for the future. These systems must be smooth (smart and fault tolerant) in their interaction with human workers. (c1) Methodologies and tools for reconfigurable manu- facturing systems design for healthy, green and safe products. Methodologies that define the set of resources and the control system architecture having characteristics and performance that optimally match the demand and the process plan over time. Developed production system solutions should also address inter- nal uncertainty, such as unforeseen events, by continu- ously tuning process parameters and production flows (proposed for 2011). (c2) Knowledge based tools for process planning. Platforms integrated in the information and execution system of factories should be developed for non-linear process planning. By considering local production and outsourcing, these tools will allow the optimisation and monitoring of manufacturing processes, wherever in the world these are performed (proposed for 2012/13). (c3) Integrated shop-floor simulation. Modelling tools working in an integrated way on different shop-floor levels (process, machine, cell, line and factory). The interaction with the machine and the system control should allow simulation to start from the real current status. Simulation results will allow multi-level decision support systems to support workers\u2019 tasks (proposed for 2012/13). (c4) Advanced interactive graphical user interface. Tools allowing workers to deal with the increased complexity of simulation and decision systems embedded in machines and production lines (proposed for 2012/13). (d) Zero-defect manufacturing Customisation and reduction of lot sizes even down to \u201cmake to order\u201d dramatically increase production cost because of the additional costs linked to set up, changing processes and ad- aptation of the production equipment. For example, innovative solutions are needed in support of customization and \"make to order\" strategies in automotive and electric and electronic com- ponents industries, improving methodologies through quality control and the increase of efficiency in manufacturing. New quality monitoring methods are needed based on supervision and control of the process parameters and on pre-processing prognosis and proactive controls. This includes sensors for process diagnostics and process monitoring and visualisation, integrated with cognitive systems for intelligent and self-opti- mising manufacturing and production systems.

This is needed to achieve a sustainable manufacturing base when moving to high added value products and customised production. New materials pose new challenges for cost effi- cient manufacturing to shape, handle and assemble complex structures that can involve macro-micro-nano scale, multiple material combinations such as sandwich structures and com- posites and smart materials involving integration of sensing and actuation technologies within a material (e.g. smart tex- tiles). In other cases, there is a need to work with bio-inspired materials to integrate them more effectively with conventional and new materials, in order to meet the needs of new bio- industries and environmental targets. Recycled materials are also relevant in this domain, due to their large potential both for cost and environmental impacts. Most industrial sectors of importance to European manufac- turing have a requirement for new and improved processes to deal with the need to exploit new materials through manu- facturing. In the transport sector key changes are required to achieve a greater use of light-weight materials, such as CEE.pdf 25 25/03/10 15:43 ",
        "24 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P composites, and the efficient use of high value added metals, such as high strength steels and nickel based alloys. New composites are also used by industry in the drive towards renewable energy sources, where components need to be manufactured at volumes and costs not previously anticipat- ed, whilst ensuring that waste is minimised. In the textile and footwear sectors new approaches such as 3D shaping and drapability in new automated factories are needed for mass customisation and increased product functionality. Integration of electronics, e.g. using improved sensing and control systems, and customisation of smart products, such as in intelligent packaging, also demand new manufacturing methodologies, e.g. an increased use of laser technologies and roll-to-roll manufacturing. For the bio-inspired industries, there is a need to incorporate new multifunctional materials into products that span a biological-physical interface and to introduce good manufacturing practices (automation, quality control and traceability) for such products. The use of materi- als that provide a micro/nano-scale functionality, particularly in volume manufacturing within a safe environment, requires the development of new micro/nano-manufacturing processes that encompass design, assembly, joining and reliability is- sues (e.g. for new nano-coatings on traditional substrates). The main areas where research is needed to ensure that nov- el manufacturing processes can efficiently exploit the poten- tial of new materials for all these industrial applications should include: (a) Net-shape manufacturing for advanced structural and functional materials Net-shape manufacturing technologies have gained industrial significance to produce structural parts made of a wide range of materials, namely metals, ceramics and polymers. Transfer- ring traditional low-cost net shape manufacturing processes to novel material classes, such as advanced metallic materi- als (e.g. intermetallics), functional ceramics (e.g. bioceramics) or structurally reinforced composites (e.g. metal-ceramic or polymer nanocomposite materials) will lead to completely new possibilities in the design of components and to significant savings in materials and processing costs. (a1) Complete manufacturing chains for nanophased components. Development of high throughput proc- esses (e.g. extrusion, forming, casting, coating and quick sintering) able to produce net-shape or semi-fin- ished products as well as coatings, using nanotechnolo- gies and nanomaterials. Novel supply chains to provide the nanophase to a micro- or macro-component need to be included. (proposed for 2011). (a2) Manufacturing of engineered metallics and com- posite materials. Development of new and innovative technologies aiming at increasing the reliability and re- producibility of smart composites and metallics, and for further integration of functions (proposed for 2011). (a3) Up-scaled systems for high performance manu- facturing of fibre-based structures for high value added and very large size applications. Tailor-made solutions in the field of fibre-based structures and high value-added net- or near-net- shaped 3D products, pro- duced at varying volumes (proposed for 2013). (b) New material functionalities through manufacturing processes The interaction between new manufacturing processes and new materials can have a considerable influence on the qual- ity and functionalities of new products, providing significant added value. The development of new manufacturing plat- forms able to transfer laboratory processes to high and/or customised volume production is required. (b1) Roll-to-roll manufacturing of large area and high throughput flexible plastics electronics. Manufactur- ing of products such as OLED for lighting, displays and technical textiles, organic PV, organic sensor arrays us- ing new organic functional polymers and hybrid materials (proposed for 2011).

(c) Manufacturing strategies for renovation and repair Extending life of existing and new structures as well as design- ing in re-use or ease of renovation requires smart approaches for the incorporation of advanced materials. Integrated design and manufacturing for re-use (renovation and repair) as well as increased ability to track material/product use to recover added value from new materials and components should be simultaneously addressed to optimise life cycle manufacturing and supply chains (proposed for 2012/13). (d) Product design using sustainable material processing technologies New materials bring new challenges in sustainable manufac- turing that require new approaches for low resource consum- ing processes and process intensification, integrated with hybrid processes, as well as knowledge-based processes exploiting advanced modelling and simulation techniques. These new materials include, among others, \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d materials as well as materials for improved product quality, weight saving and improved behaviour and functionality. This will then significantly reduce undesirable processing emis- sions and provide new methods to process micro-nano- materials (minimising the potential impact on the environment and human health). There is also a need for the development of manufacturing technologies for sustainable production and recycling of process residuals that are suitable for new ma- terials.

The dialogue in the framework of the Ad-hoc Industrial Advisory Group with European Commission officials from DG Research and DG INFSO already allowed the provision of industrial input for the preparation of the FP7 Work Programme 2010. DG Research and DG INFSO launched in this way a dedicated cross-thematic Coordinated Call of \u20ac95 million in July 2009, which is expected to raise around \u20ac65 million of private R&D investment. This would result in a total R&D investment of around \u20ac160 million in the Factories of the Future PPP in the year 2010.

        "29 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P The Factories of the Future PPP has been launched in order to have a direct economic impact on innovation and research in manufacturing. This public-private partnership will promote research focused on the needs of European manufacturing companies, especially SMEs. The main goal is wealth crea- tion through a competitive market position and adding value. The research and development results will be applicable across many industrial sectors and the new production meth- ods, processes and technologies are expected to reach in- dustries across all of Europe and beyond. An additional expected benefit is linked to the cooperation, in line with the Factories of the Future PPP objectives, between the academia/research institutes and the European industry. There will also be benefits at regional level since manufac- turing industries in Europe, which are largely dominated by SMEs, are characterised by the existence of regional clusters of interconnected companies that provide to their specific regions very significant employment and wealth. Regarding the international aspects of the globalised econo- my, two main positive impacts are expected. The export share of the European manufacturing and process equipment in- dustry will be reinforced as a result of the achievement of the Factories of the Future PPP objectives because technological improvements combined with better environmental perform- ance will lead to competitive advantage. Moreover, the supply of this equipment to third countries will also lead to a reduced worldwide environmental impact. Impact of achieving the objectives in the sub-domain on \u201cSustainable manufacturing\u201d The first sub-domain, Sustainable Manufacturing, addresses objectives related to the reduction of material resources and emissions and the increase of safety in manufacturing. Achiev- ing these goals will lead to direct economic impacts such as: > Impact on competitiveness of the European manu- facturing industry: with a growing concern of informed consumers and increasingly demanding legislations worldwide, the European manufacturing sector, as both providers and users of manufacturing equipment and processes, needs to reach more ambitious envi- ronmental goals in order to keep its competitive advan- tage over other regions; > Savings in energy consumption and related operating costs in more efficient European factories by means of the use of more energy-efficient manufacturing sys- tems. Decrease of the CO 2 footprint and of the NO x and hazardous materials emissions of European pro- duction equipment life-cycle and factory processes worldwide when incorporating \u201cEuropean Factory\u201d concepts; > Reduction of costs related to emissions (air, water, noise, etc) by means of applying self-cleaning systems and emission-free production. With the support of the public authorities to implement sus- tainable manufacturing, and as an additional side-effect, the rest of the manufacturing industry in Europe will follow the trend set by the first industries applying the results from the Factories of the Future PPP in the Sustainable Manufacturing sub-domain. Impact of achieving the objectives in the sub-domain on \u201cICT-enabled intelligent manufacturing\u201d The application of Information and Communication Technolo- gies (ICT) to manufacturing contributes significantly worldwide to economic growth. Europe, however, seems to be still lag- ging behind major players in this area, such as the USA or CEE.pdf 31 25/03/10 15:43 ",
        "30 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P Japan, and this PPP, through its contribution to intelligent manufacturing, will help European industry to catch up on competitiveness. Smart Factories: Advanced automation and control are key technologies to help all manufacturing sectors become more competitive, energy-efficient and innovative. Industrial robots have moved away from traditional tasks like welding to han- dling and assembly operations. The focus of activities should shift from heavy to light industry, which until now has been \"robot-resistant\", e.g. co-worker robots in the food industry or \u201capprentice\u201d robots in small and medium-sized enterprises. Future production sites with a large variety of sophisticated products will have to offer flexible, short cycle-time manufac- turing capability. This will result in: (a) a higher level of intelli- gence on the shop floor through context-aware, fault-tolerant, adaptable, re-configurable interoperable, wireless and robust ICT tools and systems; (b) opening-up of new market areas for next-generation automation equipment and advanced in- dustrial robots providing a boost to both the European indus- trial automation and robot suppliers and the end-user industry worldwide; (c) development of an early European market for advanced technologies as applied to electronic and photonic devices, automation equipment, and robot systems. Virtual Factories: ICT also plays an increasingly important role as a business value proposition differentiator in global networked operations. Research activities in this domain will result in: (a) improved efficiency of (embedded) product in- telligence enabling advanced product-centric services (e.g. product authentication, IPR security, ICT-facilitated diagnosis and repair/resetting, remote performance/energy monitoring and logistics); (b) new business models and capabilities for improved management of global networked operations. Digital Factories: R&D efforts addressing the front-end stages of manufacturing, in particular early concept model- ling, simulation and evaluation, as well as the transformation of the knowledge-time curve, will ensure greater acquisition of knowledge and earlier and better handling of uncertainty so that better-informed manufacturing decisions can be taken. This will result in maintaining Europe's leadership in provid- ing knowledge-driven platforms, tools, methodologies and lifecycle orientation to product development and manufactur- ing (e.g. planning, optimisation and monitoring of processes, plant configurations and assets in real time, as well as web- based engineering). Impact of achieving the objectives in the sub-domain on \u201cHigh performance manufacturing\u201d With the growing importance of manufacturing SMEs within the European economy in terms of GDP and number of jobs, increase in competitiveness and production flexibility have be- come critical aspects for the survival of European manufactur- ing in the changing and uncertain global scenario. For most manufacturing factories, activities such as material handling, scheduling, part or process setup or changeover times still occupy too large a fraction of the total time that materials are \u201cin process\u201d.

Reducing this wasted throughput time is and will continue to be a major driver for improvement in productivity. The reliability of machines, equipment and production sys- tems is paramount for efficient low-cost production. The key goal is to have maximum availability of machinery, producing high-quality zero-defects parts and in-specification materi- als at highest production rates. As an example, mechatronic strategies based on adaptronic systems, intelligent materials or vibration damping systems can compensate deviations from initial accuracy requirements detected by the continuous monitoring and control systems. The achievement of more reliable and efficient manufactur- ing systems (e.g. machine tools, fixtures, cutting tools, proc- ess and peripheral equipment), integrating process modelling and part quality prediction, is expected to give rise to benefits such as: > Reduction of the number of rejected components or products and the amount of raw material used; > Reduction of the cost and weight of manufactured as- semblies or the cost of manufactured product; > Increased throughput, tool and equipment life and pro- ductivity maintaining repeatability and accuracy; > Reduction of the waste, power consumption and num- ber of finishing operations; > Minimisation or even elimination of the use of services such as coolants (dry cutting); > Extension of maintenance intervals. Impact of achieving the objectives in the sub-domain on \u201cExploiting new materials through manufacturing\u201d The demands of society for an ever-increasing use of renew- able energy sources, higher standards of living, constantly changing markets and highly customised goods, as well as the risks posed by increasing energy costs and depleted re- sources are still unanswered. These topics are driving forces which increase markets for goods involving innovative materi- als with improved properties. The Factories of the Future PPP is expected to facilitate the development of cost-effective, safe, affordable and friendly technology and production equipment for processing these new materials, such as: > Composite material manufacturing processes (tape laying, fibre placement) and the recycling of these ma- terials after end of life; > High strength and light weight metal components in- cluding hollow, foam and sandwich structures; > Functional surfaces obtained by micro-texturing: it has long been known that the functional performance of tools, workpieces, solar cells, aero-engine blades, me- dical implants, prostheses and components for many industrial sectors can vary depending on the surface features, e.g. controlled porosity on a tribological surface can contribute to friction reduction at sliding contact interfaces; > Development of new manufacturing technologies to handle, process and validate new materials for the ups- cale production of renewable energy sources, such as fuel cells, photovoltaic solar cells, thermal concentra- tion solar systems or wind energy systems; > Developing and characterising high throughput pro- cesses for length scale integration (micro / nano) and manufacture of components and devices with com- plex 3D features in a single material; > Micro- and nanomanufacturing systems: design, mo- delling and simulation tools. Intelligent, scalable and adaptable micro- and nanomanufacturing systems (processes, equipment and tools integration); > Scaling-up of production processes of nanomaterials and coatings for multifunctional applications in nano- medicine, energy, transport and electronic devices; and > Manufacturing process improvements to increase effi- ciency, safety and performance of light materials, such as magnesium and Al-Mg alloys, for instance to reduce weight and emissions in transport.

        "33 F a c t o r i e s o f t h e F u t u r e P P P This \"Factories of the Future\" PPP strategic multi-annual roadmap should not be seen as representing the perspec- tive of only one group of stakeholders, nor as having being realised through narrow, highly specialised approaches. The knowledge of the wider community of stakeholders, embrac- ing all the relevant manufacturing sectors (users, customers, researchers, environmentalists, etc.) is expected to be inte- grated together for this initiative, including: > The European manufacturing industry: large compa- nies, SMEs (including knowledge-intensive SMEs), as well as the Trade Associations. This includes both supplier companies for production technologies and customer companies. > The European research and education sectors: univer- sities and polytechnic schools, basic research centres, applied research organisations, technology centres and technology brokers. > MANUFUTURE and its European, National and Regio- nal Technology Platforms, and related Sub-Platforms. > Other European Technology Platforms (ETPs). > EFFRA \u2013 The European Factories of the Future Re- search Association. Moreover, the research areas identified in this FoF PPP Stra- tegic Multi-annual Roadmap can deserve action on a global scale. In that context, it is worth exploring if joint activities in- volving partners from outside Europe would lead to win-win situations. Where appropriate, international bi- /or multi-lateral collaborations might be envisaged to maximise the benefit for European industry and society. In this sense, the Intelligent Manufacturing Systems initiative (IMS) and, in particular, the IMS2020 coordination action, should be taken into account. CEE.pdf 35 25/03/10 15:43 ",

        "Manufacturing continues to be the driving force of the European economy, accounting for around 20% of all jobs. The European Economic Recovery Plan, launched in December 2009 to address the current crisis, includes a new Research Public-Private Partnership (PPP) aimed at helping EU manufacturing enterprises, in particular SMEs, to adapt to global competitive pressures by improving their technological base. The \"Factories of the Future\" (FoF) initiative is a \u20ac 1.2 billion programme in which the European Commission and industry will support the development of new enabling technologies for EU manufacturing which have cross-sectoral benefits and contribute to greener production. Achieving continued growth and sustainability depends on a long-term shift from cost-based competitive advantage to an approach based on high added value. In this Strategic Multi-annual Roadmap for the FoF PPP, four major priority areas have been identified: (i) Sustainable manufacturing, (ii) ICT-enabled intelligent manufacturing, (iii) High performance manufacturing and (iv) Exploiting new materials through manufacturing. The public-private efforts to support research in these areas will contribute to a successful European strategy for industrial growth in a greener economy.
