Objective To contribute to human security by supporting the implementation of the Maputo Action Plan 2014-2019 adopted by the States Parties at the Third Review Conference of the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (\u2018the Convention\u2019), in the framework of the European Security Strategy and in line with relevant decisions of the international community. 2. Description of projects 2.1. Mine clearance: support for the implementation of Action III of the Maputo Action Plan including national planning and reporting in up to five affected States Parties 2.1.1. Project objective Up to five States Parties to the Convention are supported in the implemen \u00ad tation of the mine clearance aspects of the Maputo Action Plan. 2.1.2. Project description \u2014 Support will be provided by the ISU to up to five States Parties in facilitating national stakeholder dialogues. Eligible States Parties have upcoming mine clearance deadlines in 2018, 2019, 2020 and beyond. The Convention's Committee on Article 5 Implementation will be involved in the selection of the recipient States Parties. \u2014 The national stakeholder dialogues will be facilitated by the ISU, in collaboration with stakeholders, such as relevant government officials, representatives from mine-affected populations, mine action donors, including relevant Union entities, mine clearance organisations, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (\u2018ICBL\u2019), UN agencies and the GICHD. As appropriate, those key actors will be directly involved in the implementation of the project subject to the conditions to be developed in the budgetary impact statement. The dialogues will produce a detailed outcome document highlighting geographically specific information on remaining areas requiring survey and clearance, methodologies to address remaining areas and challenges faced in fulfilling mine clearance obligations and recommendations on overcoming those challenges as well as milestones to address identified challenges. The national stakeholder dialogues will incor \u00ad porate gender and diversity aspects of mine clearance at the design, management and implementation levels. \u2014 Follow-up actions, in up to five instances, will be undertaken in response to recommendations contained in the outcome documents. Those follow-up actions will provide additional technical support by the ISU (e.g. for drafting/updating of national demining action plans, the development of a project proposal or proposals, etc.). 2.1.3. Project results \u2014 The stakeholder dialogues will provide a detailed outcome document setting out the remaining challenges, with objectives, timelines and recommendations for further action. \u2014 The States Parties selected for the national stakeholder dialogues will be able to articulate the status of implementation of the Convention and the Maputo Action Plan as well as to improve their annual \u25bc B ",

Beneficiaries \u2014 States Parties to the Convention which are in the process of implemen \u00ad ting their mine clearance obligations under the Convention. \u2014 Women, girls, boys and men whose lives are affected by the presence or suspected presence of anti-personnel mines, as well their families and communities. \u2014 National experts working on issues relevant to mine clearance. \u2014 States and organisations supporting mine clearance efforts. 2.2. Victim assistance: support for the implementation of the Victim Assistance actions of the Maputo Action Plan in up to five affected States Parties 2.2.1. Project objective The Maputo Action Plan states that victim assistance should be integrated into broader national polices, plans and legal frameworks related to the rights of persons with disabilities, health, education, employment, devel \u00ad opment and poverty reduction. The project will support up to five States Parties to embed the victim assistance aspects of the Maputo Action Plan in a broader context of national policies on human rights and the rights of persons with disabilities. The project aims at empowering those who are injured by mines or other explosive remnants of war, survivors, indirect victims such as family members of people killed by anti-personnel mines and people living in mine-affected areas, to become active agents in their own development. The national stakeholder dialogues will incorporate gender and diversity aspects of victim assistance at the design, management and implementation levels. 2.2.2. Project description \u2014 Support will be provided by the ISU in up to five affected States Parties to convene national stakeholder dialogues in States Parties that either: (a) have engaged little with victim assistance and therefore would benefit from a stimulus to begin doing so; or (b) have engaged in the effort to implement the victim assistance actions of the Maputo Action Plan and would benefit from a national stakeholder dialogue to promote those implementation efforts. The Convention's Committee on Victim Assistance will be involved in the selection of the recipient States Parties. \u25bc B ",

The national stakeholder dialogues will also result in the drafting of a detailed outcome document, developed in consultation with stake \u00ad holders, in which challenges and gaps in the implementation of the Maputo Action Plan's victim assistance commitments will be ident \u00ad ified, recommendations made to overcome them and objectives set. \u2014 Follow-up action in up to five instances will be undertaken in response to recommendations contained in the outcome documents. Those follow-up actions may involve the provision of additional technical support by the ISU, for example for the revision of national plans, the development of a project proposal or proposals, etc. \u2014 Decision 2012/700/CFSP supported a global conference that was held in Medellin, Colombia, in April 2014, entitled \u2018Bridges between Worlds\u2019 that aimed to advance the international community's under \u00ad standing regarding the place of victim assistance in broader contexts. As a follow-up, this Decision will enable an international conference for national experts to be organised by the ISU, in collaboration with key actors such as the UNOHCHR, the relevant Union entities, and ICBL-CMC and disabled persons' organisations, to explore challenges and good practices in integrating victim assistance into the broader contexts of disability and development at the national level. In particular, the international conference will aim at strengthening linkages with efforts to implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (\u2018CRPD\u2019) and planning processes to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The international conference will build upon the work of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention's Committee on Victim Assistance and representatives of other relevant bodies such as the Victim Assistance Coordinators of the Cluster Munitions Convention (\u2018CCM\u2019) and Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War to the Convention on the Prohibition or Restriction on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects (\u2018CCW\u2019). 2.2.3. Project results \u2014 National stakeholder dialogues will result in a detailed outcome document identifying challenges and gaps which will provide the selected States with recommendations and concrete steps it can take to address identified challenges in implementing their Maputo Action Plan victim assistance commitments. \u2014 The outcome document will support national policy development and facilitate the dialogue and cooperation with donors and implementing agencies. \u2014 Follow-up actions, in up to five States Parties, to support efforts to overcome the challenges and gaps identified during the national stake \u00ad holder dialogues will result in increased capacity of the States Parties to fulfil their Maputo Action Plan commitments for example the revision of national plans, the development of a project proposal or proposals. \u25bc B ",

Beneficiaries \u2014 States Parties to the Convention which have reported responsibility for significant numbers of landmine survivors. \u2014 Women, girls, boys and men who have fallen victim to landmines and other explosive remnant of war, as well as their family and commu \u00ad nities. \u2014 National experts working on issues relevant to victim assistance. 2.3. Universalisation of the Convention 2.3.1. Project objective In order to advance towards universalisation of the Convention, the Decision will support the Presidency of the Convention and a High Level Task Force to engage non-party States at a high level. In this effort, barriers to adherence to the Convention are defined and addressed and updated information on ratification and accession status is acquired. 2.3.2. Project description \u2014 A High Level Task Force on the universalisation of the Convention will be supported by the ISU, including support from high-level personalities to engage with the leaders of up to five States not party at the ministerial or higher level regarding accession to the Convention and/or adherence to the Convention and its norms. \u2014 Updated first-hand knowledge on barriers to accession from States which are not parties to the Convention will be sought with a view to that information contributing to substantive documents prepared for the Fourth Review Conference in 2019, including through a compre \u00ad hensive report regarding what progress has been made on universa \u00ad lising the Convention and its norms as well as the scope for further progress. \u2014 The study on border security initiated under Decision 2012/700/CFSP will be further developed, in collaboration with partners such as the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP) or the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF), into a tool for universalisation aimed towards States that still consider anti- personnel mines an indispensable tool for border security. 2.3.3. Project results \u2014 Up to five non-party States will be engaged at the ministerial or a higher level regarding adherence to the Convention. \u25bc B ",
