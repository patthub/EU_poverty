        "The relevance of gender in tourism Little attention has been paid to how the tourism industry impacts women and men differently. How\u00ad ever, tourism presents both opportunities and chal\u00ad lenges for women and must subsequently be exam\u00ad ined through a gender lens. Grey literature on tourism What is grey literature? It is literature produced by non-commercial publishers, such as public institu- tions, universities, research institutes and civil soci- ety. It contains a lot of useful content, but is often hard to find as it is scattered across different loca- tions. EIGE has collected grey literature on gender equality and you can access our collection through a simple search interface. EIGE\u2019s collection of grey literature is available in several EU languages and documents come from all EU Member States. Grey literature in EIGE\u2019s library EIGE\u2019s library hosts one of the largest collections on gender-related literature related to tourism. The col\u00ad lection presents good practices of current policies throughout Europe as well as gender indicators aimed at assessing gender equality in tourism. Several resources focus on the ways in which the EU has main\u00ad streamed gender into policy processes for tourism. You will also find research reports and statistical documents providing data on key gender issues relat\u00ad ed to tourism. Gender inequalities in the tourism industry Women are well represented in the tourism industry. However, they often work in low-skilled and poorly paid jobs . For example, women are over-represented in housekeeping and customer service. Within the library you will find resources highlighting the structural and cultural factors which determine the role women play in the tourism sector. Resources also highlight the ways in which women\u2019s opportunities in the tourism sector can be enhanced. Library resources deal with issues such as occupational sex segregation in the tourism sector , wage par- ity , career opportunities , the role of women with\u00ad in micro\u00adenterprises and/or in the informal hotel/ catering/tourism economy . \u00a9 M .

        "European Institute for Gender Equality Grey literature on tourism Print ISBN 978-92-9482-224-6 doi:10.2839/174090 MH-04-19-243-EN-C PDF ISBN 978-92-9482-223-9 doi:10.2839/349013 MH-04-19-243-EN-N Gender differences in leisure tourism Travel decisions are largely related to gender, life cycle and economic status. Factors such as work, family and household obligations determine the amount and quali\u00ad ty of time available for leisure and tourism and, in some instances, act as constraints. Within the library you will find resources on gender and tourism which show that these constraints are higher for women than for men. Economic resources, care duties and societal norms most commonly influence how much women travel and how much enjoyment they are able to take out of it . You will also find resources stressing the different choices in tourism destinations made by women and men as well as resources showing how women are more environmentally friendly than men. The role of women in economic growth Tourism policies are linked to economic growth and pov\u00ad erty reduction. In this context, tourism development can increase women\u2019s empowerment and offer women con\u00ad siderable employment opportunities. Within the library, resources show how tourism can con\u00ad tribute to economic growth, poverty reduction and com\u00ad munity development, presenting both opportunities and challenges for gender equality and women\u2019s empower- ment . Another set of resources also looks at whether or not gender is a significant explanatory variable for tourism growth and how one can drive change in the tourism sector by empowering women through the involve- ment of local communities and by engaging them as key stakeholders.
