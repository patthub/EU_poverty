Introduction The public consultation supports the preparation of the EU Action Plan \u201cTowards a Zero Pollution Ambition for air, water and soil\u201d . 1 The Action Plan, which is to be adopted by the European Commission in 2021, intends to: \uf0b7 Prevent and remedy pollution from air, water, soil, and consumer products \uf0b7 Mainstream the zero pollution ambition into all policy developments \uf0b7 Further decouple economic growth from the increase of pollution \uf0b7 Strengthen the links between environmental protection, sustainable development and people\u2019s wellbeing. The public consultation was conducted from 11 November 2020 to 10 February 2021. Using EU Survey, the consultation was available in all official EU languages and targeted the following stakeholders: \uf0b7 Citizens; \uf0b7 Competent authorities in EU Member States and other EU Institutions; \uf0b7 EU and national consumer organisations; \uf0b7 NGOs and other civil society organisations (notably in areas such as health, environment, transport and climate); \uf0b7 Academia and research institutes working on EU environment and climate policy; \uf0b7 Businesses and professionals (notably SMEs) operating in key sectors (e.g. environment, transport, climate, agriculture, water, health, aquaculture and fishing, food, energy, other industries including extractive and energy-intensive ones, etc.); and \uf0b7 Financial institutions, especially those engaged in green finance. 1 https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en ",
        "2 Overview of respondents A total of 706 responses (and 77 documents annexed to responses) were received from all 27 EU Member States and 11 non-EU countries. 2 Data was screened and cleaned in line with the Better Regulation Toolbox. 3 Upon careful inspection, no duplicates and no clear-cut campaigns could be identified. Therefore, the final number of responses for the analysis amounted to the full 706 responses submitted. A total of 175 respondents indicated France as their country of origin, followed by Germany (102), Belgium (92) and Romania (53). The figure below provides a detailed disaggregation of the respondents by their country of origin in descending order. Figure 1 Number of respondents by country of origin (EU and non-EU) n= 706 2 From non-EU countries, there are responses from Argentina, Brazil, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and Uzbekistan. 3 According to Better Regulation Toolbox 54, the minimum threshold should be 10 or more identical responses (across all closed questions) to count as a \u2018campaign\u2019. 29 1111 223344 8810 10 11 12 13 15 15 16 16 27 36 36 53 92 102 175 0 50 100 150 200 Non-EU Latvia Faroe Islands Cyprus Croatia Malta Lithuania Luxembourg Denmark Ireland Greece Slovakia Estonia Finland Bulgaria Slovenia Czechia Poland Portugal Hungary Sweden Austria Netherlands Italy Spain Romania Belgium Germany France ",

        "4 Overview of the feedback provided The first section on General awareness of pollution and related policies aims to collect information on the knowledge of respondents on EU environmental pollution and related policies in Europe. The section further seeks to gather information about knowledge of the effects of pollution on people and the environment. A majority of respondents appear concerned that the current levels of pollution have negative effects on health and the environment. More than 80% of respondents completely agree that the current levels of pollution have negative effects on the wellbeing of residents of specific locations of the EU as well as biodiversity. Agreement is less pronounced for the statement that pollution has negative effects on the economy, while about two-thirds of respondents still completely agree and somewhat agree. Figure 4 To what extent do you agree with the following statements about the impact of pollution through air, water and soil? n= 706 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Pollution has negative impacts on the wellbeing of the population in specific locations in the EU Currently, pollution has general negative impacts on the environment and particularly biodiversity Currently, pollution has negative impacts on the environment and particularly biodiversity in my immediate surroundings Current levels of pollution have a negative impact on my health or the health of those immediately around me Current levels of pollution have negative impacts on the health of the overall population in the EU Current levels of pollution have general negative impacts on the economy Completely agree Somewhat agree Neither agree nor disagree Somewhat disagree Completely disagree I don't know ",
        "5 More than half of the respondents (over 50%) completely agree that pollution is an issue of concern worldwide, in the EU, and in the respective country of the respondent. Yet, less than half of the respondents (45%) completely agree that pollution is an issue in their municipality. Over half of the respondents (53%) completely or somewhat disagree that pollution is an issue of concern primarily outside the EU. Respondents do not appear to feel sufficiently informed about pollution and its health consequences in the area where they live, as the share of respondents who completely agree is the smallest (both 11%). Figure 5 To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements? n= 706 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Pollution is an issue of concern worldwide Pollution is an issue of concern in the EU Pollution is an issue of concern in my country Pollution is an issue of concern in my municipality Pollution has been reduced in the last decade where I live Pollution is an issue of concern primarily outside of the EU I feel sufficiently informed about health consequences of pollution where I live I feel sufficiently informed about pollution where I live Completely agree Somewhat agree Neither agree nor disagree Somewhat disagree Completely disagree I don't know ",
        "6 With respect to the impact of pollution on different population groups, 36% of the respondents completely agree and 29% somewhat agree that children and elderly suffer more from pollution, that people living in poverty/at risk of poverty are more exposed than others, and that people living in cities are also more exposed to pollution. Conversely, 16% completely disagreed and 39% somewhat disagree that everyone in society is equally exposed to pollution. Only 7% somewhat agree and 1% completely agree that people living in rural areas are the most exposed to pollution.

        "7 With respect to the level of knowledge on EU initiatives addressing pollution, 30% of the respondents feel very well informed on EU water policies, followed by EU policies on chemicals (25%) and the EU\u2019s Biodiversity Strategy (23%). Conversely, well over half of the respondents feel not at all informed (34%) or not well informed (29%) on EU policies on medicines. 4 Figure 7 Have you heard about the following EU initiatives addressing pollution? If so, how much do you know about them? n= 706 Shortened answer options: *EU Water policies such as the Water Framework Directive, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, the Drinking Water Directive and the Bathing Water Directive, the Nitrates Directive; **EU Clean Air policies such as the Ambient Air Quality Directives and the National Emission reduction Commitments (NEC) Directive; ***EU policies limiting air pollution at source, such as Euro standards for cars, buses and trucks, or eco-design rules for heating appliances; ****EU policies on medicines (also known as medicinal products), such as directives or regulations, and the 2019 EU Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment 4 Two associations specified that they selected \u201cNo opinion\u201d as they preferred not to take a position on the question asked. 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% EU Water policies* EU policies on chemicals, such as the REACH Regulation and regulation on pesticides Biodiversity Strategy EU Clean Air policies** EU policies limiting air pollution at source*** EU policies on industrial emissions, notably the Industrial Emissions Directive Farm to Fork Strategy EU policies addressing pollution from waste, such as from persistent organic pollutants (POPs) EU Soil policies such as the Soil Thematic Strategy or the Sewage Sludge Directive EU Noise policies such as the Environmental Noise Directive Other EU policies on pollution EU policies on medicines (also known as medicinal products)**** Very well informed Moderately informed Not well informed Not at all informed No opinion ",
        "8 The second section on Views on the state of pollution and related policies explores the views of stakeholders on the state of pollution, and the importance of pollution in the wider context of environment policy. More than 3 in 4 of the respondents (79%) indicate that it is very important to address pollution of rivers, lakes, and ground water, followed by marine pollution (76%) and ambient air pollution (74%). There is less agreement on noise pollution, where 41% of the respondents indicate that it is very important to address it, while another 35% indicate that it is important. 5 Figure 8 How important is it to address the following pathways and depositories of pollution at the EU level. n= 706 5 One association specified that they selected \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d as they preferred not to take a position on the question asked. 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Pollution of rivers, lakes and ground water Marine pollution Ambient air pollution Soil and sediment pollution Indoor air pollution Noise pollution Other types of pollution Very important Important Neither important nor unimportant Not a priority Irrelevant I don't know ",
        "9 With respect to the impact of pollution by the type of activity, more than half of the respondents (50% and above), indicate the following as highly polluting: energy production from fossil fuels (76%), air transport (69%), road transport (66%), accidental release of hazardous substances (65%), mining and extraction of raw materials (65%), industrial production (61%), agriculture: animal farming (58%), littering (55%), and waste landfilling (51%).

        "11 In terms of the level of government most appropriate to address pollution in the EU Member States, 40% of the respondents consider EU level authorities to be the most appropriate, followed by 26% for national level authorities, and 15% each for regional and local authorities. EU-level authorities are considered as the most appropriate to address marine pollution (50%), ambient air pollution (38%), rivers, lakes and ground water pollution (33%), and soil and sediment pollution (30%). After EU-level authorities, respondents rank national level authorities as the second most appropriate to address the different types of pollution. The only exception is noise pollution, where 28% of the respondents consider local authorities to be the most appropriate, which is the highest share for this type of pollution. 7 Figure 11 Which level of government is the most appropriate to address pollution in the EU Member States?

        "13 The third section on Ways forward to address pollution focuses on ways to address the issue of pollution in the future. Consistently, over 60% of the respondents completely or somewhat agree with the listed ways of tackling pollution. Formal education gains the biggest support with a 62% share of the respondents who completely agree, followed by stepping up international action on pollution (61%), and overall better implementation of pollution-related legislation (60%). Figure 13 In your opinion, how effective would the following ways of tackling pollution be? n= 706 Shortened answer options: *Formal education: Integrating pollution-related issues more into education curricula, e.g. training activities on the interplay between pollution, climate change, and public health, on sustainable consumption of products and energy, on sustainable mobility; **Influencing behavioural change (e.g. through social media, culture, sports,\u2026) to shift to a \u2019zero pollution mentality\u2019, by informing citizens more, e.g. on the interplay between pollution, climate change and public health, on sustainable consumption of products and energy, on sustainable mobility; ***Financial incentives to address pollution (e.g. taxes and subsidies favouring less- 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Formal education* Stepping up international action on pollution Securing an overall better implementation of pollution-related legislation Influencing behavioural change** Financial incentives to address pollution*** Better monitoring of pollution levels More research on pollution**** Enhancing cooperation between stakeholders Introducing heavier fines for breaches of pollution-related legislation Increasing awareness on pollution***** Additional EU law on pollution, e.g. on soil pollution Modernising existing EU law on pollution Easier access to justice and other tools for civil society****** Better anticipating how pollution may develop in the future (e.g. using modelling) Ensuring a more positive impact of the banking and insurance systems on pollution Social innovation******* Greater powers to national authorities to sanction breaches to EU legislation on pollution Other Very effective Somewhat effective Neither effective nor ineffective Somewhat ineffective Completely ineffective I don't know ",
