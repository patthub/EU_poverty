        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 638.435 2 Safe, secure and sustainable energy Energy-efficiency and renewable-energy legislation \u201cEnergy efficiency remains a priority. The principle \u2018energy efficiency first\u2019 should be taken seriously across the board. Improving the energy performance of buildings and speeding up renovation rates can be a game changer. The obstacles are well known, but we can explore new solutions, especially in financing. Good examples in local and social housing can be found in many member countries.\u201d \u201cI am convinced that a genuine Internal Market brings significant benefits and is essential in promoting renewable deployment.\u201d \u201c[...] we also have to do more to accommodate renewables: we have to invest into research and innovation for providing storage for renewables.\u201d To speed up the deployment of clean energy \u201cThe thousands of people who take to the streets in Europe and around the world remind us constantly that there is nothing more urgent than climate and energy action. This is the number one concern of European citizens. That is why the President-elect has identified the European Green Deal as a flagship priority for her Commission. Energy policy will be essential to deliver on this priority. I know from personal experience \u2013 I was the Minister for Economy and Infrastructure, also responsible for energy \u2013 how challenging it is to work in this field. I know how important the task ahead is and how enormous the responsibility it entails.\u201d \u201cI embrace the mission of making Europe a climate neutral continent by 2050.\u201d \u201cI can confirm to you that this Commission will be very committed to our climate targets, not only at my level \u2013 responsible for energy, but this is the commitment of the President-elect. This is the overarching priority. This will be the main responsibility for Vice-President Frans Timmermans, who is responsible for the Green Deal.\u201d \u201cThere will be a climate law and there will be a clear action plan, but my responsibility as the Commissioner responsible for energy is also to ensure that, in fulfilling all those targets, we still stay in the position where our energy security is good, our customers will have affordable prices and our industry will remain competitive compared to other regions in the world.\u201d Regional cooperation \u201cIf appointed Commissioner, I intend to mobilise energy policy in the service of the climate neutral objective by further developing an integrated, interconnected and properly functioning Single Market.\u201d \u201cIn the electricity market we need a power system largely based on renewables with improved energy storage and increased interconnectivity. There are still too many blockages to cross-border trade and bottlenecks that need to be removed. We must make sure that interconnectivity targets are reached and that 70% of interconnector capacity is available to the market. I will endeavour to strengthen regional cooperation, in particular the existing four high-level groups and make them work in greater synergy.\u201d Liquefied natural gas \u201cTalking about gas, we also have to keep in mind that it is very important to diversify the different sources.\u201d \u201cThere is indeed a paragraph in my mission letter about promoting liquefied natural gas (LNG) and I do see it as a way of securing our energy security that our gas supplies will come from diversified sources and to different parts of the European Union.\u201d Energy Taxation Directive \u201cAbout energy taxation, this is also mentioned in my mission letter, and I will closely cooperate with Commissioner-designate Gentiloni about that. It is true that the Energy Taxation Directive that is already 15 years old doesn\u2019t help us in the way it could to reach our energy and climate targets. I do especially believe the difficulty is that it still allows tax exemptions in some ways for fossil fuels, and that makes competition between fossil fuels and renewables difficult. We should address this issue.\u201d Enhancing nuclear safety and safeguards \u201c Nuclear power will be part of the energy mix and the energy mix is decided by each Member State. ",
        "Commitments made at the hearing of Kadri Simson 3 PE 638.435 So I know that right now we have countries who are phasing out their nuclear power and there are Member States who are planning to build new plants to replace phasing-out coal power plants \u2013 there is Finland, which has just opened the new Olkiluoto power plant.\u201d \u201cSo it is a decision for every individual Member State as to how will they use their energy mix and what will be the sources. At EU level we have to secure that nuclear power plants are safe, that the waste management is safe for our environment \u2013 and not only inside [the] European Union, but also in our close neighbourhood.\u201d \u201cSo what can we do about new nuclear power plant sites that are built in third countries? We can provide assistance so that the building and maintenance will take place under the highest security standards. We can provide also financial assistance to the sites in third countries so that these procedures are made, and of course we can insist that all their test results will be taken very seriously.\u201d Empowering people and regions Consumers at the heart of our energy system \u201cWe can do more for the open and competitive market: if there are many providers, then the prices should be more affordable for consumers and enterprises. And if our markets are interconnected \u2013 and they are not yet; there are missing links and bottlenecks \u2013 but if they are interconnected then this helps to provide renewable energy for larger markets. This was the main goal of the green energy package: that consumers will be in the heart of the energy market and the price will stay affordable.\u201d \u201cBeing responsible for energy, I will have to ensure that in parallel to those ambitious climate targets, we secure our consumers and our businesses with affordable and competitive energy. For that we have to invest in our energy networks, but at the same time we have to make use of the existing framework.\u201d \u201c[...] I will be attentive to energy prices and costs on consumers and businesses and, in particular, to the impact that climate transition has on energy- intensive industries.\u201d \u201cIt is also important to show that consumers can benefit from this transition and we have to take advantage, too, of all the newest innovation. So this might also be part of the European Innovation Initiative \u2013 like solar tiles that provide both insulation and renewable energy.\u201d \u201cWell, energy consumers will be at the heart of our energy policy. My task is to provide affordable energy by diversifying our sources, by making policies that all energy grids, DSOs and providers will be very transparent, by making investments that will help to upgrade our grids, and by building the missing links and interconnections.\u201d Just Transition Fund \u201cThe Just Transition Fund will indeed be very close to my heart, because this is the tool that we can use to secure that during our transition towards carbon neutrality, no region, no country will be left behind.\u201d \u201cThe President-elect has committed to establish a Just Transition Fund to support coal and carbon- intensive regions and islands affected by the transition. [...] I see this Fund as a way to enable regions to develop and finance concrete projects, which can transform economies and create jobs.\u201d \u201cWe can build on the existing Coal Regions in Transition Initiative to make the Fund a success. To me, fairness also means a renewed fight against energy poverty.\u201d \u201c[...] I see that the Just Transition Fund will build on the project for coal regions in transition, and it will also help small islands which do not have connections with the mainland. This should help each region to be better prepared for the transition from fossil fuels towards renewables. The exact amount of this fund is under negotiation, but because it will be part of [the] next MFF, it is an initiative that will be on our table in the first weeks of the next Commission\u2019s mandate. So I predict that, by the end of November, there will already be concrete answers. But I will do my best to make sure that it will be big enough to support those regions to prepare for the transition.\u201d Energy Poverty Observatory \u201cIt is not acceptable that 8% of the European population \u2013 this is 50 million people \u2013 are unable to properly heat their homes, and many more Europeans than this struggle to pay energy bills. ",
        "IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies I want to use the Energy Poverty Observatory and rapidly implement the legislative provisions on energy poverty. I intend to engage more with the Member States and the Covenant of Mayors. The report by Theresa Griffin presented last year has laid the groundwork for this.\u201d \u201cYes, I do agree that energy provides social inclusiveness and that\u2019s why it is a very needed service. At the same time when we are talking about energy poverty, we are not talking about energy as a commodity, as such, we are also talking about taxes, levies, grid tariffs and this all together has to be under our attention and you asked what we can do concretely for those people who are in trouble paying their heating bills. We can provide more efficient ways for heating. This is not something we can do everywhere tomorrow, but there are different technologies that will bring down heating costs and of course once again the renovation of a building stock plays an important role too.\u201d Disclaimer and copyright.
