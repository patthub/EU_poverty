Highlights how dynamic the Pacific Alliance \u2014 comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru \u2014 is, and calls for the Vice-President / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR) to look into the possibility of the EU participating in the Alliance as an observer, as a number of EU Member States already do; 20.9.2018 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 337/75 Wednesday 13 September 2017 ",
        "9.

Stresses that even having experienced a significant economic development, which has led to poverty and inequality levels falling, inequality remains a significant obstacle to the LAC region\u2019s development, where 175 million people are living in poverty and exclusion, especially women and minors; stresses that economic growth, inclusive social development, the fair distribution of wealth and the universal provision of essential public services are the key to addressing this issue; 11.
