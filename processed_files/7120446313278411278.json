        "4 Introduction The present brochure provides comprehensive and concise information on public health actions funded under the 2008 Call for Proposals, published in the framework of the second Programme of Community action in the fi eld of public health. The second Programme is the European Commission\u2019s main instrument for implementing the EU\u2019s health strategy and aims to improve the level of physical and mental health and well- being of EU citizens and reduce health inequalities troughout the EU. The total budget of the Programme 2008\u20132013 is 321.5 million euro. In order to receive a European grant, actions have to contribute to at least one of the 3 main objectives of the second Programme: To generate and disseminate health information and \u2022 knowledge To promote health, including the reduction of health \u2022 inequalities To improve citizens\u2019 health security \u2022 These are all public health objectives that are considered to be better tackled by fostering cooperation among public authorities, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations, as well as commercial entities across the EU. The implementation of the second Programme, entrusted by the European Commission to the Executive Agency for Health and Consumers (EAHC) is mainly done in the form of annual work plans adopted by the European Commission, which sets the priorities and allocates the resources for a given year. These annual priorities are in turn supported through the fi nancing of four types of diff erent actions: projects, conferences, joint actions and operating grants. Those actions intend to have a special European dimension, meaning that a minimum of varios partners of diff erent European Countries have to be involved in the project plan. The present report gives a summary of each project\u2019s objectives, strategic relevance, methodology and expected results, along with details of its duration, the EU fi nancial contribution and the contact details of the main benefi ciary. This easily accessible information is useful for public heakth professionals, researchers, and future grant takers as well as for other persons interested in the European dimension of public health. More information about both the specifi c actions managed by the Executive Agency for Health and Consumers (EAHC), as well as the health programme as a whole is available on the EAHC website, at http://ec.europa.eu/eahc 120522_Health Report 2008_A4_INH_gp.indd 4 22.05.2012 16:55:04 Uhr ",

General Objectives The aim of the project is to develop a sustainable environmental health monitoring system of a set of sub-national indicators to improve public health across Europe and facilitate the comparability of health status data and identify policies and interventions that deliver positive health outcomes e.g. reduction in mortality from road traffic accidents. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme The project will assess the applicability of the ENHIS indicators for environmental health policies and produce Europe\u2019s first set of regional indicators which will be the basis of a harmonised system for the collation of environmental health information at a sub-national level and will complement the core set of 26 indicators. 3. Methods and Means The ENHIS indicators will be assessed for application at a regional level in participating European countries and any other environmental health information collected will be examined and where possible and practical, indicators will be developed to form a core set of sub-national indicators for Europe. 4. Expected Outcomes The expected outcome is a standardised system for collating and reporting environmental health information at a regional level across Europe. 120522_Health Report 2008_A4_INH_gp.indd 8 22.05.2012 16:55:09 Uhr ",

General Objectives The general objective of the project is to identify and validate a set of Day Surgery (DS) indicators and to develop the Information Systems on DS in Europe. This project proposes to analyse DS data and health indicators both at international organisations and MSs level. It will also identify and test potential indicators. DS development represents a priority being an important opportunity for health systems reorganisation. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme Strong evidence suggests that DS is the best option for 80% of elective surgical operations providing a safe, high quality and cost-effective approach. There is great potential for further expansion of DS in Europe. Available DS data and indicators present important constraints hindering DS growth and development. The project\u2019s strategies and results will be fully applicable to the European context and congruent with the EU effort in the development of information and knowledge systems. 3. Methods and Means Main Methods and means will include the review of existing DS indicators at international level and the assessment of DS data and indicators in participating MSs. Most promising candidate indicators will be empirically tested through a pilot study in a selected group of participating MSs. Comparability of data will also be ensured through recoding of DS procedures. A minimum and ideal list of indicators will be constructed on the basis of a literature review and results of the pilot study. The project will also devise guidelines for the presentation, interpretation and utilization of indicators. The project will work in strict collaboration with ECHI and other relevant European initiatives. The expected outcome is a streamlined and standardized DS information system integrated into the EU indicators framework, used by health care policy-makers, DS managers and providers to expand DS and continuously improve its quality, efficiency and equity. A streamlined DS information system represents one of the most important preconditions for improving whole DS systems and their components, such as a network of DS clinics.

General Objectives This project aims to improve the health and wellbeing of children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) in all countries within Europe. It aims to do this by developing guidance on best practice for the care of children with CP for use by both health professionals and lay carers (e.g. parents), and by improvements in the collection, recording, description and use of clinical and epidemiological data. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme The project addresses promotion of best practice amongst professionals for childhood conditions which impose a heavy burden on families. The work takes advantage of an already existing European surveillance network (SCPE group) which provides essential and comparable epidemiological data on CP; this collaboration is ideally placed to now study inequalities in quality of care of CP (3.3.2) and to extend surveillance to other childhood impairments,- \u201ca sustainable health monitoring system\u201d (3.4.1). The collaborating partners will ensure wide dissemination of knowledge across European regions. 3. Methods and Means Review of practices and establishing standards to monitor variation in key health care issues will be undertaken by subgroups of partners; directed to neuro-imageing practice, surgical management, nutrition status and language function; with emphasis on understanding variation by socioeconomic status. Data quality will be enhanced in existing registers. Implementation and/or extension of registers will be undertaken for CP and other childhood impairments, in collaboration with European networks. A one-stop- shop website will be developed to ensure dissemination of information according to findings of a consultation process with nongovernmental organisations and professionals caring for those with CP.

General Objectives We propose a study that will assess the potential for reduction of inequalities in health outcomes and risk factors in Europe. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme Previous EU sponsored projects, particularly the Eurothine project, have shown that health inequalities were substantial throughout the European Union in the 1990s, but that there were important variations between countries in the magnitude of health inequalities. This suggests that there is great scope for reducing health inequalities. 3. Methods and Means We will collect and present data on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality, self-reported morbidity, and risk factors for the period 2000\u20132005 in all European Union countries with available and comparable data. Mortality data will be census-linked, and inequalities in Healthy Life Years and loss of Disability-Adjusted Life-Years will be calculated. We will then carry out analyses with several types of \u201ccounterfactual\u201d distributions of socioeconomic determinants and specific risk factors, in order to assess the potential for reduction of health inequalities in the European Union. These \u201ccounterfactual\u201d scenarios will be derived from the intervention evaluation literature as well as from observed variations between countries. We will collaborate with the Global Burden of Disease Study group to take advantage of their methodologies, and to be able to use their updated analyses of the impact of risk factors on specific diseases in our estimates.

        "I . H E A L T H I N F O R M A T I O N 18 ABSTRACT 1. General Objectives EuroNeoStat II mission or strategic goal is that all Very Low Gestation (VLGA, gestation < 32 wks) and Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW, birthweight < 1501 g) infant born in Europe, receive the best possible health care no matter where born by preventing existing inequalities and that all Neonatal Units use the indicators developed, to assess the quality of care provided and implement strategies to improve outcome. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme Overall, perinatal, neonatal and long-term care of VLBWI is one of the most demanding health problems in Europe, draining increasingly large health resources. Currently, to evaluate perinatal and neonatal care, EU countries collect and report data for overall neonatal mortality, prematurity, Low- and Very-Low Birth- Weight rates, along with perinatal-related statistics. The project is of strategic relevance since it adds value to the existing public health knowledge that so far does not cover the topics of nosocomial infection and safety incident resolution for VLGA/VLBW infants cared for at NICUs at European level. There is evidence that different interventions based on risk factors can decrease the hospital-acquired infection rate like the improvement of the hand-washing and the implementation of catheter management protocols. 3. Methods and Means Prematurity is a significant and increasing health problem in Europe, and those infants have a high risk for mortality and short- and long-term morbidity, and its care consumes large health resources. Until EuroNeoStat was funded, no systematic recording of health data for those infants existed at a European level. This project expands the aims of the previous one and has significant added value at EU level Prospective, multicentric descriptive cohort study designed as an information system to assess risk factors and outcomes of annual cohorts of 6,000 to 8,000 this high-risk infants/year. Three new subsets of indicators will develop: maternal socio-economic status, hospital-acquired infection and develop a structured educational preventive package, and a reporting system for patient safety incidents. 4. Expected Outcomes This project\u2019s main outcome is related to regional neonatal unit\u2019s indicators comparison, being possible to know where they could improve their work and thus reduce infant\u2019s morbidity.

General Objectives Implementing ECHI Indicators in all Member States \u2022 (MSs) Improving, documenting and maintaining ECHI \u2022 Indicators Maintaining a network of national health indicator \u2022 experts for ECHI Indicators and their collection. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme Joint Action for ECHIM implements the core tasks of the Health Programme and its Work Plan 2008 (point 3.4.1.2.). It is the backbone for implementing comparable health indicators in MSs and at EU-level. It will result in comprehensive and comparable information on health in all MSs. Without its efforts the EU would continue to have very uneven data on health in different MSs without any comparability. National Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (THL) (following the merger of National Public Health Institute of Finland (KTL) and National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES) as of January 1st of 2009) will lead the work divided between several R&D centres and led by a Core Group. In each MS local experts will carry out the work. The R&D work and the bilateral negotiations with MS experts result in country specific implementation plans guiding the work of national experts and key persons in the MS administrations. The existing international network of health indicator experts will support both the development of indicators and their implementation in all countries. 3. Expected Outcomes New releases of the ECHI shortlist at 2\u20133 year intervals; a formal method to evaluate and update the ECHI shortlist; country specific guidelines for ECHI shortlist indicator implementation; an ongoing process for implementing health indicators to be implemented in most MSs by 2013; enhanced data and methods for analysing and presenting comparable health indicators in Europe; the first joint analyses and reports on data based on ECHI shortlist indicators by 2011; a website containing all relevant information on ECHI Indicators; an interim Joint Action for ECHIM report on health indicators and their implementation by 2011. Indicators and data will be available through the EC HEIDI System as well as the HEIDI data-tool.

General Objectives As general objectives, the DOVE project aims to collect, describe, compare and analyze documents on policies and practices directly addressing domestic violence that are being implemented throughout the involved states. Simultaneously, DOVE will describe the domestic violence experiences of women and men aged 18\u201364 years living in urban centres of 8 European Member States, regarding its magnitude, characteristics, determinants and its consequences in terms of health and quality of life. Overall, the project contribution focuses on the development of evidence- based policies, research and practice strategies to early detection and prevention of DV against women and men, as well as existing practices of support, care and rehabilitation of victimized women and men and management of perpetration. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme DOVE will contribute to improve citizen\u2019s health security, increase awareness of domestic violence (DV) issues and promote knowledge exchange. The project will not only allow comparative analysis of scientific data, but will also promote exchange of legislation and dissemination of good practices procedures according to overall strategic approach to promote mental health across different EU cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds. 3. Methods and Means DOVE will pursue its aims based on a randomly selected, representative, proportionally stratified, census based sample of the total population (women and men aged 18\u201364), living in 8 EU States. Trained interviewers will assess the magnitude, characteristics and determinants of DV, as well as health and quality of life outcomes, using specific and adequate tools, previously adapted and back-translated. Additionally, multidisciplinary teams of scientists will gather, analyze and comprehend existing documents, legislation, national plans and practices for each EU State involved, ensuring the reliability of data collected and the comparability of DOVE\u2019s findings.

        "I . H E A L T H I N F O R M A T I O N 32 ABSTRACT 1. General Objectives Results of comprehensive monitoring of alcohol marketing will allow the European Commission and the Member States to formulate advices in order to improve the existing regulations of alcohol marketing on MS and EU level. The objective is to improve these regulations in terms of content and process given different national circumstances. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme Alcohol marketing is not yet monitored systematically by NGOs in most of the Member States of the European Union although the topic commercial marketing is an important one in the EU Alcohol Strategy. This became clear in discussions in the Task Force Alcohol Marketing of the Alcohol and Health Forum of DG Sanco. 3. Methods and Means The AMMIE project proposes to monitor alcohol marketing practices in a comparable and systematic way in several, regionally divided, Member States. This monitoring will be implemented by independent national NGOs based on the experience of the Dutch Foundation for Alcohol Prevention (STAP), who has been doing this since 2002 commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports. Denmark, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria and the Netherlands are included in the proposed project. Although these Member States differ in terms of drinking pattern as well as alcohol marketing regulation systems, in this project we develop a systematic monitoring tool that can be implemented in all selected countries. Other Member States are invited during the course of the project to join the project. NGOs are trained for these monitoring task by STAP in advance and they will be advised how to implement the monitoring work in their daily tasks. The content of the alcohol marketing practices are recorded and analysed. Questionable ads will be put into the jurisdiction systems of the national advertising bodies, the decision process as well as the result of this process will be documented, analysed per country and analysed as a whole. Completely new is the fact that the same ads will be rated by national youth panels. These panels are recruited and coordinated by the European Youth Forum, based on existing scientifically proved rating systems. Also new is that within this project national statistics are gathered in order to define the percentage of young people in the specific countries that are exposed by alcohol marketing practices in order to compare these figures with the regulations about this in the national self regulation systems. This could lead to an advise about the existing regulations in order to protect young people towards the effects of exposure to alcohol marketing. All the results will be presented for consultation and recommendation to the project partners and two scientific experts. The EASA (European Advertising Standards Alliance), who does not use youth panels and who only does monitor and assess radio and tv-commercials is also an invited expert and they are prepared to comment on the results as well. EASA is no project partner. The project will be evaluated by Prof. Hastings of the University of Sterling (Scotland) and the final deliverables will be disseminated by EUROCARE towards all relevant NGOs, commercial and political stakeholders.

Expected Outcomes This project will clarify how existing regulations regarding alcohol marketing are functioning in practice in different Member States given different alcohol regulation systems. It identifies possible major differences in the functioning of the marketing regulations between Member States. The AMMIE project will also show possible differences in opinions between the judgement of young people towards alcohol advertisements on the one hand and national Alcohol Advertising Committees on the other hand with regards to the attractiveness of these advertising practices for young people. Finally, the proposed project presents figures about the percentages of young people (below 18) in the participating countries that are exposed to alcohol marketing practices in order to test the existing correspondent regulations regarding alcohol exposure in the national regulatory codes and to recommend about regulations how to better protect young people. The project will develop a best practice model for monitoring and delivers recommendations regarding self regulation of alcohol marketing on national and on EU level in order to protect young people against the impact of alcohol marketing on their drinking behaviour. Independent systematic monitoring is seen as vital in order for alcohol marketing regulation to be seen as credible and as effective as possible. 120522_Health Report 2008_A4_INH_gp.indd 33 22.05.2012 16:55:18 Uhr ",

General Objectives The objective of ENGENDER is the creation of an online inventory of good practice of policies and programmes that promote gender equity in health. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme The premise is that the creation of a documentary database of good practice promoting gender equity in health will contribute to more effective and equitable health policies for women and men. There is a lack of information and knowledge on effective policies and programmes that may improve gender equity in health. There is a lack of specific guides available to policy makers to assist informed policy decisions that will improve gender equity in health. 3. Methods and Means The ENGENDER partnership will review examples of good practice, policies and interventions that have successful, positive impacts and provide equal opportunities for both women and men to live a healthy life. The range includes legislation against sexual harassment at work, equal pay for equal work, prevention of work related injuries, sanctions against violence against women, increasing women\u2019s participation in decision making at all levels, health promotion programmes to reduce e.g. smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet, lack of exercise, and measures to create equal availability of prevention or rehabilitation programmes, accessibility to health care. It will focus on structural dimensions of gender inequality; gender stereotypes that directly harm the health of women and men; different exposures and vulnerabilities for women and men; the \u201cgendered\u201d politics of health systems: health research; and supportive structures, incentives, and accountability mechanisms.

General Objectives The EURHOBOP project is intended to provide the European Community with valid standardised monitoring systems that permit European hospitals to follow their trends in outcomes, based on the proposed adjusted indicators, and benchmark themselves in a European ranking. The main focus of EUROHOBOP project is to define a set of in-hospital outcome indicators that determine the quality of health care in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients who are diagnosed at discharge with myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina (UA), in the following procedures: coronary angiography, thrombolysis, percutaneous intervention (PCI) and general management of the two conditions. These indicators were obtained from European population-based MI-UA patient registry databases of more than 27,000 cases (Euro Heart Surveys ACS-I & II, ACSIS 2003 & 2005 and MASCARA 2005). This information permitted us to fit several functions to benchmark hospitals according to their actual in-hospital case-fatality as compared to their expected outcome rates, i.e., those adjusted for country, hospital and average patient characteristics in the index hospital assessed. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme This proposal adheres to general HP objectives regarding health promotion, including the reduction of health inequalities, and generation and dissemination of health information and knowledge in cardiovascular disease. It also addresses the necessity of analysing, and making proposals to correct, differences in outcome between the sexes. 3. Methods and Means We will consider in-hospital case-fatality as the outcome indicator in patients admitted for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who receive a discharge diagnosis of MI or unstable angina (UA) and undergo coronary angiography, thrombolysis, or percutaneous revascularisation (angioplasty with or without stenting) for general MI and UA patient management. We will validate several risk functions (GLM multilevel models) with different levels of adjustment, developed in EUPHORIC DG SANCO project 2004\u201308, and we will develop new ones. The validation will be performed on a sample of 200 consecutive MI or UA patients from 10 hospitals per participant country (70 in all).

Mission and Vision of the Operating Grant Holder Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable and progressive disease of the central nervous system affecting the quality of life of more than 500.000 Persons with MS, their families and their carers across Europe. To date, no cure has been found for this complex, chronic and disabling condition. The European Multiple Sclerosis Platform (EMSP) is the Pan European association working for and with more than 30 MS national member associations/ organisations to achieve its goals. Being part of a worldwide community of Persons with MS (PwMS), we are committed to dialogue with, respect for and collaboration with other stakeholders in the field of MS, particularly the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF). Our Vision Throughout Europe, Persons with MS have equal access to the highest quality treatment and support they need to live their lives to the full. Our Mission \u2026 is to ensure the development and implementation of high quality standards of treatment and support for PwMS, their families and their carers throughout Europe, to allow them to lead their life independently and to recognise them as equal members of society. The EMSP work priorities to achieve this mission are: to influence EU institutions and other decision- \u2022 making bodies to improve the quality of life of PwMS to network with other European organisations in \u2022 which the patient is central to provide MS member associations with information \u2022 on relevant EU draft legislation and projects to develop and promote recommendations for \u2022 improved medical treatment and rehabilitation to be implemented in the EU member states and other countries to encourage research of all kinds aiming at the \u2022 benefit of PwMS to initiate and implement cross-border projects to \u2022 improve the living conditions of PwMS, e.g. in the fields of therapies, employment, social security, infrastructure \u2026 to act as an information platform by exchanging \u2022 information and best practices relevant to the work of the national MS member associations to enhance a general awareness on multiple \u2022 sclerosis by informing and educating external audiences to support national MS societies both recent or \u2022 long-established in Europe. 2. Strategic Objectives and Specific Activities Strategic Goal I: Equal Access To The Best Quality Healthcare And Services In Europe For PwMs, Their Families and Their Carers to develop and promote recommendations for \u2022 improved medical treatments and rehabilitation to be implemented in the EU member states and other countries to encourage research of all kinds aiming at the \u2022 benefit of PwMS to enhance a general awareness on multiple \u2022 sclerosis by informing and educating external audiences. Strategic Goal II: Strengthening The Legitimacy And Effectiveness Of EMSP As The European Voice Of PwMs to initiate and implement transnational projects to \u2022 improve the living conditions of PwMS, e.g. in the fields of therapies, employment, social security, health infrastructure \u2026 to act as an information platform by exchanging \u2022 information and best practices relevant to the work of the national MS member associations to support national MS societies in accordance to \u2022 their needs. Strategic Goal III: Empowerment of PwMS to influence EU institutions and other decision- \u2022 making bodies to improve the quality of life of PwMS To encourage patient- centred healthcare policy and \u2022 delivery of direct benefit to PwMS to network with other European organisations \u2022 promoting patientcentred healthcare.

General Objectives The main objective of the Conference is to provide relevant outcomes that can be used in the processes by which EC MS incorporate ethical considerations in their Pandemic Planning. 2. Expected Achievements The organisation of a meeting at a European level is an opportunity for important progress in the dialogue on sensitive matters and to emphasize the convergences and the divergences in the ethical approach, both locally and at European level. Taking into consideration that the discussions are still in progress in most of the countries and that final choices haven\u2019t been made yet, it is hardly possible today to make a precise comparison between the different options. This is the reason why this meeting is going to be a workshop for exchanges, drawing parallels, allows for confrontations and proposals. The speakers, representatives of several countries, will be invited to discuss ethical issues so to enrich the political argumentations. Participants (speakers and attendants) will be invited from all 27 MS as specified above. One month before the meeting, a specific thread will be opened in the Ethics And Pandemics \u2013 Espace \u00c9thique Of The Assistance Publique \u2013 H\u00f4pitaux De Paris Community On Europa Sinapse (http://europa.eu/sinapse/) managed by the organizers Espace \u00e9thique/AP-HP.

General Objectives The general objective of this project is to identify socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in census tracts of 14 European cities at the beginning of the XXI century (over a span of 5\u201310 years centred around 2005) and also to compare the social and health policies undertaken in these cities (including policies using EU structural funds) to address inequalities, in order to contribute to the improvement of methods to tackle health inequalities in cities. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme Inequalities in health are a major concern for public health in the EU. Within all EU Member States, the most disadvantaged population groups have worse health and higher mortality. These inequalities have widened over the years. To tackle health inequalities and consider interventions and policies directed to these populations, it is important to describe mortality inequalities. In the last 2 decades, the number of studies indicating geographical area as a health determinant has increased. However, intra- urban inequalities in mortality have been infrequently analysed in European contexts, and interventions to tackle health inequalities at urban level have hardly been described. 3. Methods and Means The project will apply a cross-sectional ecological design using mortality data of census tracts in 16 cities in 13 EU Member States. The leading causes of death and the main causes of avoidable mortality for men and women will be studied, looking at the expected number of deaths in each small area using age-specific European mortality rates. Smoothed Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMR) will be estimated through Bayesian methodology, using generalised linear models, assuming a Poisson distribution for the observed deaths. The estimated SES indicators and mortality indicators will be related in each city using BYM-type models to obtain the measures of association (Relative Risk) between the SES indicators (including indexes of deprivation) and mortality. Social and health policies to reduce and tackle health inequalities at city level will be reviewed using a review of the published literature and documents produced by the city\u2019s authorities (\u201cgrey literature\u201d), and a questionnaire. The documents will be analyzed with a critical and comparative policy perspective in order to evaluate and compare the commitment of local authorities to reduce health inequalities; compare their respective strategies, objectives, methods and results; pinpoint the lessons learned from the successes and failures of past policies; and give recommendations about further policies to be implemented and compared between European cities. An inventory of social and health interventions using EU structural funds in the last 15 years will also be made. From these programs, three will be selected for further investigation, based primary on the criterion of transferability.

Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme The elements provided, and the information gathered, will allow each volunteer region to introduce and further evaluate interventions and policies at the end of the project, e.g. through the use of EU structural funds. Only an initiative at European level can bring about real impact in this field, rather than isolated actions of Member States. This project aims to significantly assist EU Member States and their regions to tackle health inequalities. In time, benefits and improvements to health and the reduction of health inequalities could lead to new interventions and new financing mechanisms in primary care settings. 3. Methods and Means A review of action on reducing health inequalities in primary care settings including policies at regional level will be carried out. This work will include Equity studies (Wagstaff and Van Doorslaer) and Eurothine studies (Mackenbach and Kunst). European projects, Closing the Gap and Determinate have developed an important database of good practices and innovative approaches to reducing health inequalities. The other main method that will be used is a survey, in the form of \u201ca qualitative questionnaire\u201d. A qualitative semi-structured questionnaire will be developed to gather information about actions which contribute to reduce the health inequalities through the primary care settings in the regions of the EU. The questionnaire aims to identify actions targeted at specific populations. This information will be collected in all regions of the EU. A summary of the different approaches will be produced.

        "I I . H E A L T H P R O M O T I O N 62 ABSTRACT 1. General Objectives The PASEO project intends to strengthen capacities for the promotion of health through physical activity among sedentary older people in 15 nations. Nations are represented by a scientific institution (associated partner) and (in most nations) a (non-) governmental institution (coll. Partner). Capacity strengthening will focus primarily on building intersectoral structures and intraorganisational means for the promotion of physical activity among sedentary older people. Mechanisms to strengthen capacities are intended to be sustained after the project has ended. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme PASEO will assist in co-ordinating and standardising efforts for the promotion of physical activity among sedentary older people in the EU. Especially relevant, PASEO might assist in balancing physical activity promotion efforts across the life-span. Also, PASEO will contribute to mutual learning among the participating nations. 3. Methods and Means Means of strengthening capacity are: assessing \u2022 existing capacities through qualitative interviews with experts and policy-makers setting up national alliances (or, alternatively, \u2022 extending existing alliances) with relevant governmental and nongovernmental organisations through bilateral talks developing and implementing actions to \u2022 strengthen capacities through a cooperative planning process with the national alliances in each participating nation monitoring the impact of the implementation of \u2022 these actions on capacities through qualitative interviews, document analysis, and data collection based on the evaluation framework proposed for the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health of the WHO. 4. Expected Outcomes PASEO expects to succeed in setting up national alliances (or extending existing alliances), which will attempt to agree on and implement actions to strengthen capacities for the promotion of physical activity among sedentary older people.

Mission and Vision of the Operating Grant Holder Extract from the Statutes of the European Health Management Association (also available at www.ehma.org): \u201cThe aim of the Association shall be to improve health management and health policies through the development and exchange of both ideas and practices among academics, researchers, managers, clinicians, policy makers and consumers throughout Europe. The aim of the Association is met through pursuit of the following objectives: The provision, development and improvement of \u2022 education and training in health management. The development and improvement of health \u2022 management practice. The encouragement and support of research \u2022 and development among the members of the Association and the exchange of their findings. The transfer of research findings into practice \u2022 through publications and through collaborative activities amongst the membership, and particularly between researchers and managers. Collaboration, on behalf of the members, with the \u2022 European Union and its affiliates and agencies, the World Health Organisation and its agencies, and other international and national organisations which have an influence on health in Europe.\u201d 2. Strategic Objectives and Specific Activities The overall strategic aim of this work programme is to promote health in Europe through pursuing excellence in health management. The programme will pursue the following objectives: Building a peer network in Central and Eastern Europe: health systems in CE Europe face challenges to reduce health inequalities and modernise systems. Stakeholders within our membership have identified an international network focusing on building capacity in this area as a significant need. The CEE Network will be made up of 40 senior health managers and policy makers. It will meet twice a year, for a 24 hour event at which issues of particular importance for health systems of the region, such as informal payments and change management, will be discussed. Each meeting will host a networking dinner to build links between the participants. The network will also be built on a virtual forum, through which participants will be able to exchange ideas and contacts, and peer mentoring will be offered to participants. The network meetings will also include specific sessions for women managers, looking at gender and leadership issues in a CEE context.

H E A L T H P R O M O T I O N 65 Each member of the network will be given free EHMA institutional membership and a subscription to the Journal of Management and Marketing in Healthcare for their institution, in order to spread the impact of the network to a wider audience. Access to health care \u2013 connecting evidence and policy: the recently published HealthQUEST study, led by EHMA, has identified evidence of the link between poor access to health care and health inequalities. A forum is now needed to further explore the policy implications. Three policy seminars will be held in Brussels to bring together policy makers at both EU and national levels to discuss the implications of HealthQUEST\u2019s findings for each of the disadvantaged groups that it considered: people with mental disorders, migrants and older people with functional limitations. Position and discussion papers will be published as a result of these seminars in order to disseminate the findings to a wider audience. Connecting European leaders: CEOs within Europe\u2019s health systems face common challenges as they manage complex issues such as cross-border care, workforce planning and cross-sectoral collaboration. This key group currently lacks a dedicated forum for Europe-wide knowledge exchange and capacity building. The European CEO Taskforce will be a forum for these Chief Executives to meet together and share their experience in meeting the challenges of leadership, as well as to learn and exchange knowledge. The forum will meet twice a year for a 24 hour event in Brussels. The forum will be addressed by leading policy and management experts on key subjects, including financing mechanisms, health inequities, cross-border care and workforce management. Each 24 hour event will also include a networking dinner to build inter- group contacts. The forum will aim to recruit 30 Chief Executives, with balanced geographical coverage. The taskforce will be heavily subsidised for CEE and Balkan CEOs, but a fee will be charged for EU15 members. Each subsidised member will be given free EHMA membership and a subscription to the Journal of Management and Marketing in healthcare for their institution as part of the taskforce package. Exchanging good management practice across Europe: EHMA members have identified a specific need for an accessible forum for managers to share good practice. The Management in Practice database will collect examples of management practice on a number of themes, and in a range of sectors (including primary care, mental health, specialist care and public health), so that managers can learn from the experiences of others across sectoral and national boundaries. The database will be focused on practical, real experience of health management, and will aim to build the capacity at an operational level. 120522_Health Report 2008_A4_INH_gp.indd 65 22.05.2012 16:55:34 Uhr ",

        "69 ABSTRACT 1. Mission and Vision of the Operating Grant Holder ENSP is an independent, international non-profit association, which aims to develop a common strategy, amongst organisations active in smoking prevention and tobacco control in Europe, by sharing information and experience and through co-ordinated activities and projects. Our vision is of a future where our fellow Europeans will not suffer the distress of ill health and early death because of tobacco. We want our children to be able to grow up without being targeted with messages that seek to lure them into a lifetime of addiction. We want all Europeans to be able to breathe clean air unpolluted by tobacco smoke. As we increasingly communicate more freely and cross country borders more frequently, we realise that our individual countries do not stand alone; we feel the reverberations of change throughout Europe. Therefore, ENSP undertakes to use the best evidence of effectiveness in policy and practice to work together towards our common goal. 2. Strategic Objectives and Specific Activities 1. Raise awareness amongst decision-makers and ensure that a comprehensive, evidence-based tobacco control policy is in place or will be elaborated reflecting the articles of the FCTC and being mindful that the Preamble to the FCTC requires measures to be gender- sensitive, particularly by: Supporting the legislative processes and \u2022 developments towards a smoke-free environment. Focus will be put on the EU Member States which have not yet started or finalized their smoke-free legislative process, in compliance with the coming Council Recommendation and the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC on workplace safety & health. A special attention will also be given to the recommendations made in the ENSP/INWAT report \u201cExposing the Evidence-Women and Second Hand Smoke in Europe\u201d (2008) Identifying the enforcement organisations \u2022 throughout Europe, how tobacco control legislation enforcement is organized, the needs in the different countries, and making the necessary recommendations to ensure that legislation is supported by appropriate compliance monitoring schemes Following up the FCTC and ENSP recommendations \u2022 on health and pictorial warnings, and encourageing those concerned EU Member States to take the necessary steps to initiate or speed up their current legislative process. Supporting the current process of revision of \u2022 the tobacco products taxation and promote the European Commission\u2019s proposals. 2. Build or increase ENSP coalition members\u2019 capacity by: Collecting and disseminating via a regular news \u2022 bulletins and newsletters up-to-date tobacco control alerts, information, good practices, members\u2019 news, policy developments at the EU institutions\u2019 level and other available information. Organizing information and motivational seminars \u2022 on tobacco control, networking and advocacy at regional, national and European levels. Organizing one strategic and coordination European \u2022 meeting, and one network meeting, promoting and tightening the relationship and collaboration between the members.

        "71 ABSTRACT 1. Mission and Vision of the Operating Grant Holder The Smokefree Class Competition Network was founded in order to contribute to the reduction of smoking among children and young people in Europe. The network\u2019s activities are dedicated to: strengthening co-operation among European \u2022 professionals working in the field of tobacco prevention continuing with the Smokefree Class Competition in \u2022 as many countries as possible evaluating and disseminating the results of the \u2022 Smokefree Class Competition nationally and internationally. The network partners are multi- disciplinary and have wide experience in the field of smoking prevention among children and young people. This fosters learning from each other and the sharing of best practice. 2. Strategic Objectives and Specific Activities Planning, organisation and implementation of the SFC in up to 17 European countries. Each of the countries develops a full set of print or download materials for participating classes for example a class contract, confirmation brochure for teachers, information leaflets for parents, newsletters for stakeholders. All countries give prizes to the successful classes. Updating the international website IFT-Nord will contact the partner countries on a regular basis to compile information from Europe regarding the competition. Additionally, contact details from the European partners and participating classes will be placed on the site. Network meeting IFT-Nord will organise a network meeting for network members and interested partner countries (invitation, booking of hotel and conference room, agenda, report). Developing a best practice guide for countries wishing to introduce the SFC In the previous years, experience and best practices were assessed from the partner countries and compiled. The information are addressed mainly to countries already participating in the SFC in order to improve their activities and organisation of the competition in the countries, which have already experience in conducting the competition. So the main target group for this document are the countries that do not conduct the competition so far in order to enable them to take up the competition idea and to join the network. The manual will include drafts of materials and questionnaires. Integrating more network partners. The network strengthens co-operation of professionals on a European scale. There are other countries or regions showing interest in joining in the (e.g. French part of Belgium, Bulgaria and England). The interested countries receive all information concerning the competition by IFT-Nod and will be invited to the network meeting. They will also ask to assess the quality of the SFC website and manual. Smokefree Class Competition Network (SFCN) Project No 20083276 II .

The general objective of the project evolved into generating and applying evidence about how to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of direct health system investments using Structural Funds. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme EUREGIO III contributed to the priority action 3.3.2 of the Work Plan 2008 that aimed at reducing health inequalities in the EU. It also addressed basic principles of \u201cTogether for Health\u201d (e.g. Principle 2 \u201cHealth is the Greatest Wealth\u201d) and priorities in the pending Health for Growth strategy for 2014\u20132020 and the EIP-AHA Strategic Implementation Plan. 3. Methods and Means The underlying method & structure for EIII followed the logic of the Policy Action Cycle: Assessment, Policy Development, Assurance and Evaluation. This included stakeholder analysis, capacity building audits and case studies linked to a programme of active dissemination (training workshops, master classes). During the course of the project it became evident that development of case material needed to be a more dynamic process to respond to rapidly changing circumstances in the health landscape: demographic, epidemiological technological, economic and need to introduce healthcare reform measures to reconcile these changes. This led to the reshaping of case studies to those that offered relevant and important precedents and learning experience for the future in relation to forthcoming SF programme guidelines and underpinning Europe 2020 principles. 4. Expected Outcomes The project was timely and relevant to evolving EU health priorities and exceeded the outcomes predicted when it started. Evidence from EUREGIO III helped shape the Hungarian EU Presidency programme content and was given in a presentation to the informal meeting of EU health ministers (Godollo, Hungary, April 2011).

General Objectives The main goal of the project is to improve the quality of life of people with double/triple diagnosis (HIV/ addiction/mental illness) in new EU member countries (Poland, Estonia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia) by increasing awareness of the relation between HIV/AIDS and mental health problems among professionals in relevant sectors and disseminating best practices existing in old EU member countries in the area of integrated approach towards mental health and HIV/AIDS (e.g. Dutch multidisciplinary treatment team model). 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme Mental illness is inextricably linked to HIV/AIDS, as a casual factor and as a consequence, while treatment of mental disorders and support for people living with HIV/ AIDS is key to both improving their quality of life and preventing the further spread of the infection. The issue is of particular concern to new EU member countries, where the AIDS epidemic is growing while rates of mental illness are also rising, and the limited resources and facilities available to treat both conditions in an integrated way pose major challenges. The severity of AIDS, in spite of the recent innovations in treatment, often leads to serious mental health problems for those infected as well as for their \u201csignificant others\u201d (carers, relatives). In addition, persons with mental illness or a mental handicap run additional risks of becoming infected with HIV. However, the relation between HIV/ AIDS and mental health problems are often overlooked or ignored. 3. Methods and Means The MAIDS project propose to fill the gap between existing services in the field of HIV/AIDS and mental health and it focuses on a series of initiatives in the area of research on HIV/AIDS and mental health, education (7 module training course on various aspects of mental health and HIV/AIDS with various modules aimed at various target groups, including medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, NGO activists, PLHA and their carers) and advocacy. The MAIDS project comprises as well the establishment of expert centres on mental health and HIV/AIDS due to which is sustainability after three years will be ensured. Ideally, the project will lead to inclusion of mental health component into national, regional and European HIV strategies and policies. In addition, it will also disseminate as a best practice the model of a HIV/ AIDS Mental Health Expert Centre and Multidisciplinary Treatment Team.

General Objectives The IMPALA project pursues the general objective to identify, implement, and disseminate good practice in the planning, financing, building, and manageing of local infrastructures for leisure-time physical activity. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme IMPALA will assist in concerting efforts for the development (existing policies and mechanisms) of local infrastructures for leisure-time physical activity in EU member states. Potentially, this will help reduce inequalities in access to infrastructures for leisure-time physical activity within and across nations. 3. Methods and Means IMPALA will collect information on existing policies and mechanisms through qualitative interviews with experts and policy-makers on national levels. A dialogue on existing good practice will be established through a two-day workshop meeting. Good practice will be identified by generating a checklist of quality standards and assessing existing national policies and mechanisms against this checklist in participating nations. Results will be disseminated and implemented through national workshops with experts and policy- makers. 4. Expected Outcomes IMPALA shall result in a checklist of quality standards for policies and mechanisms for the development of local infrastructures for leisure-time physical activity. Furthermore, it shall result in an assessment of practice in the participating nations against this checklist. On the national levels, IMPALA shall stimulate a dialogue among scientists, experts, and policy-makers on these quality criteria.

General Objectives The project aims to develop and disseminate guidelines for generic training and education with respect to Mental Health Promotion and Illness Reduction, and in addition implement specific applications with respect to the prevention of suicide, depression, and alcohol and drug abuse. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme With the implementation of the European Green Paper on Mental Health, and the development of the Mental Health Pact, the strategic importance of Mental Health Promotion and Illness Reduction as keystones of Europe-wide mental health policy and practice has never been greater. The recent implementation of the Mental Health Pact has strengthened the significance of this initiative. Added value is supplied through collaboration with European level health and social service professional bodies, university networks, civil society organisations and non-traditional actors. 3. Methods and Means Project actions include consensus finding stakeholder consultations, achieved through the development of a carefully selected set of scientific committees. These will be systematically evaluated through goal attainment scaling. A specific innovation is the involvement of mental health service users as non-traditional actors who will build on previous work by developing multi-disciplinary training guidelines and training programmes with a special emphasis on positive mental health, healthy living, diet and exercise. 4. Expected Outcomes The European health inequalities agenda is addressed through ensuring a dissemination focus which embraces Southern Eastern and Baltic European areas. Outcomes are an integrated and comprehensive set of training guidelines and model training programmes accessed through an interactive website, endorsed by European level professional body and university networks.

General Objectives This project seeks to increase the awareness within municipal policy makers and \u201cprofessional practitioners\u201d on how the socio-cultural context within the local settings, where municipalities can intervene with health promoting activities has an effect on healthy lifestyle choices and the health status within families. The increased awareness will increase these groups\u2019 ability and willingness to develop and implement activities which are specifically developed in relation to the socio cultural context, where they are supposed to have an effect. The general objective of this project is therefore to ensure that health promoting activities, focusing on overweight, obesity and healthy lifestyle choices especially within young people and their families, has a better and long lasting effect. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme The project gives a substantial contribution to the EU\u2019s strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity related health issues, as it deals with e.g. the social dimension of the issue, actions on local level, systematic monitoring, early childhood intervention and family approach, which are all important issues to deal with if EU should succeed with the implementation of the strategy. 3. Methods and Means The objective will be reached through an \u201caction research\u201d approach, where the partners develop, test and disseminate conceptual frameworks and recommendations on how to qualify local health strategies, programmes and implementation practice, based on a substantial collection and analysis of comprehensive initiatives and good practice examples from 12 pilot municipalities.

General Objectives The project is to study innovative approaches, such as industry involvement and public-private partnership initiatives, to counteract obesity and overweight in Europe, particularly through reformulation of manufactured food. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme This proposal contributes to the \u2018Promote health\u2019 objective under the Nutrition, overweight and obesity related health issues aspects of the Health Programme. Its assessment of good practices in programmes involving retailers brings the project in line with the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health. 3. Methods and Means A review of the regulatory regimes in all member states, to identify research programmes, labels, programmes for schools and hospital, codes of conduct and in-store marketing, will be followed by in-depth research in four areas: the Anglo-American zone; the Mediterranean, the Nordic zone, and Eastern Europe. Face-to-face interviews with officials, manufacturers and retailers, as well as with civil society and academics, will allow us to map partnership initiatives and their outcomes. A stakeholder conference will present the results to a wide range of stakeholders. 4. Expected Outcomes Best European practices of public-private partnership in reformulating manufactured food will be identified. From that, a platform for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of public-private partnerships will emerge.

General Objectives The FOOD project concentrates on health promotion at the workplace and aims at changing bad habits and lifestyles of the employees during their lunch break by strengthening the interaction between the offer and the demand sides. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme By promoting healthier menus at the workplace, FOOD is a direct contribution to Nutrition, overweight and obesity related health issues priority 3.3/3.4 of the 2008 WP. 3. Methods and Means To meet these objectives, FOOD actions will be led through original networks that are often forgotten but essential: restaurants and companies. A unique and rare channel of communication between both will be built, and a consortium crossing public and private expertise will develop simple and playful tools adapted to the target groups: pedagogical guides, trainings, conferences and a dedicated DVD to raise awareness among restaurant owners, give them the means to act, inform employees and give them access to balance menus. The consortium also wishes to develop a strong analysis and adapted recommendations, while maintaining a scientific line. 4. Expected Outcomes It is expected that the project will improve employees\u2019 nutrition by strengthening the interaction between supply and demand sides. Further, it will improve the nutritional quality of the offer and facilitate the choice of informed consumers.

General Objectives The European Network for Traumatic Stress \u2013 Training and Practice (TENTS-TP) aims to widely disseminate and implement evidence based practice for those affected by traumatic events to promote social inclusion throughout the entire European region. This will be achieved by developing guidelines that effectively integrate mental health promotion and disorder prevention into the training and practice of professionals in mental health and social services. TENTS-TP will integrate the work of other European projects in the field. The final aim is to raise levels of knowledge and expertise of the end users of this project (mental health and social service professionals) which will result in improved services to those affected by traumatic events. Professionals responsible for teaching and training in this field will be identified, provided with evidence based practice teaching package and equipped to implement this in a sustainable manner in partner countries. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme The strategic relevance of TENTS-TP lies in the added value that integrated guidelines on post-trauma psychosocial care will bring to the existing knowledge and practice of mental health. As a result, TENTS-TP will improve resiliency within member and partner countries by enabling them to appropriately manage the psychosocial consequences of traumatic events. 3. Methods and Means The project will achieve its aims by developing guidelines that effectively integrate mental health promotion and disorder prevention into the training and practice of professionals in mental health and social services. Methods include systematically reviewing the field to establish the evidence base, the Delphi process to achieve consensus, and mapping and needs analysis to inform the development of comprehensive educational resources.

Mission and Vision of the Operating Grant Holder \u201cThe members of the ENWHP work together towards the vision \u2018healthy employees in healthy organisations\u2019. They are committed to the mission of developing and promoting good workplace health practice, which in turn contributes to a high level of health protection and sustainable economic and social development in Europe\u201d (Article 1). This vision is part of two broader visions at European policy level: The EU Lisbon Agenda identifies the goal for this decade to develop the EU region \u201ato become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\u2019. In this context workplace health promotion is part of the concept of quality in work with impacts on productivity, employment and social cohesion. The second vision, although not on the same level on the EU agenda, is to develop a Europe of Health. European health policy supports the development of the national health care systems in the frame of established rules of subsidiarity, with a view to meeting the expectations of European citizens. With its vision and mission, ENWHP contributes especially to the reduction of health inequalities, to the development of a European health information system and to improving important health determinants with impacts on all relevant settings in working and non- working life. 2. Strategic Objectives and Specific Activities According to its general mission and vision statement ENWHP seeks to achieve two core goals. All ENWHP member countries should have access to supportive WHP infrastructures at national level. To significantly increase the number of European employees who work in enterprises and other organisations committed to practices and policies for promoting health. In order to pursue these goals ENWHP developed a strategy which is formed as a framework with three strands (strategy triangle): National Forums for WHP This strand focuses on \u2022 the development of supportive infrastructures for the dissemination and implementation of the knowledge-base by facilitating the establishment of national platforms for WHP open to all interested stakeholders. In this way ENWHP contributes to reducing the gap between action at European and national level, improve the access to good practice knowledge across Europe and shift workplace health higher on the various political agendas (see also 2.1. d)). The Case for WHP This strand focuses on the \u2022 arguments which demonstrate the contribution of WHP investments to core targets. Of particular importance is the case for WHP investments in the field of private sector companies because this setting challenges the contribution of health and social investments to economic performance.

The toolbox contains programmes, projects and instruments across a wider range of workplace health issues and settings. It can be accessed as a database on the website of the network. All three strands are continuously developed by the activities and initiatives of the ENWHP. The envisaged work programme for 2009 described above (see 2.1.) specifically contributes to this strategy and its enhancements. 3. Expected Outcomes Increased awareness of WHP among the various \u2022 stakeholders at enterprise and supra-enterprise level. Improved standard of knowledge of WHP among \u2022 the various stakeholders at enterprise and supra- enterprise level. Improved commitment of the various stakeholders \u2022 at enterprise and supra-enterprise level to invest in WHP. Establishment and development of sustainable \u2022 networking at national as well as at European level will be supported and strengthened.

To analyse current policies in all Member States \u2022 with regard to smoking in movies, and to develop policies to reduce exposure to smoking in movies that can be applied at the local, national, EU, and international levels (WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control). 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme Tobacco marketing is linked with youth smoking initiation. Therefore, most Member States have introduced a ban on tobacco marketing. However, a comprehensive ban on tobacco marketing would not limit entertainment media from projecting billions of favourable images of smoking to adolescents in the EU. The focus of this proposal is to incorporate smoking in movies into the European anti-tobacco strategy. Tobacco in film is part of the work plan 2008; thus, the current proposal clearly addresses this work plan priority. 3. Methods and Means Current policies on smoking in movies (e.g., whether \u2022 movie smoking figures into the movie rating system) in all Member States will be described and analysed. A content analysis of films released in European \u2022 cinemas will be conducted. From 6 EU countries, a representative sample of top movies (250 per country) will be analysed with regard to smoking. A population estimate of movie smoking exposure \u2022 in European adolescents will be carried out, based on the results of a survey of 13800 European students recruited in 6 EU countries. A follow up survey will be conducted one year later \u2022 to investigate the impact of smoking in movies on current smoking and smoking initiation among baseline never smokers. Based upon findings of these studies, policy options \u2022 will be developed. 4. Expected Outcomes Increased knowledge on the amount and effect of \u2022 smoking in movies on smoking in European youth. Policy options at local, regional, EU, and international \u2022 level to address the problem.

Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme It addresses Health Program objectives by complementing EU policies on smoking prevention and cessation, bringing additional knowledge about smoking prevention and cessation in adolescents. 3. Methods and Means It seeks to create a culture of prevention by promoting the benefits of smoke free environments, de-normalizing smoking and facilitating efforts for cessation. Adolescents and their families are approached in key educational and entertainment settings and with their participation the project develops, implements and evaluates innovative, evidence based and easily transferable interventions for the prevention of smoking and the enhancement of smoking cessation efforts. Many countries in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe are just now adopting a national strategy against smoking. What is particularly alarming for these countries is that adolescent and youth rates of smoking are very high and have been increasing. Therefore, FAQT is implemented in countries in the early stages of the smoking epidemic. 4. Expected Outcomes It is expected that participating stakeholders will greatly benefit from skills-building processes. The project will contribute in the development of strategy plans through the involvement of policy makers.

General Objectives The Alcohol Policy Youth Network aims at becoming a capacity building network for youth organisations from across Europe and to empower them to be active and valid players in the field of alcohol policy and alcohol harm reduction. The platform will be a service provider to youth organisations and young people as such from across Europe (pan-European project) developing tools and spaces for the empowerment of young people to become active players in the definition, advocacy, implementation and evaluation of alcohol policies and programmes at the local, national, regional and European levels. APYN will also serve as a gathering platform of youth organisations from across Europe and will promote youth participation through accountable, democratic, transparent, bottom-up youth networks and structures with the aim of reaching as many young people as possible and allowing for as many young people as possible to be able to participate not only in the internal activities of APYN but also in the ongoing political processes and programmes addressing alcohol related harm and alcohol harm reduction strategies. The network does not intend to reproduce existing structures but rather complement existing ones such as Eurocare or the European Youth Forum at the same time as allowing for more youth voices and projects to be identified, developed and brought forward at the European level. This project is the follow-up to the work developed by the European Youth Forum and Eurocare in 2005/2006 and has a mandate follows the recommendations of the 2001 WHO Ministerial Conference on Alcohol and Young People, the European Council recommendations on the drinking of alcohol by young people of 2006 and the European Youth Forum\u2019s Position Paper on Alcohol related harm from 2007. APYN will also be following up on the APYN Strategy for 2008 and 2009, a document developed by youth organisations identifying the priorities for their work in the field of alcohol policy and setting the network\u2019s needs for the coming years. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme APYN aims at involving young people in the formulation, definition, advocacy, implementation and evaluation of alcohol programmes and policies across Europe. \u201cYoung people in the EU are particularly at risk, as over 10% of female mortality and around 25% of male mortality in the 15\u201329 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption.\u201d (Alcohol in Europe A public health perspective, P Anderson and B Baumberg).

General Objectives The general objective of the project is to gain knowledge on how to motivate young smokers to take part in smoking cessation interventions and to transform this knowledge into concrete recommendations for cessation practice. Therefore, national networks shall be established fostering the collaboration between various stakeholders in teen (health) development. In order to display promising access ways, the project output consists of a best practice catalogue as well as guiding principles on how to reach young smokers for cessation interventions. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme The results of the project should enable relevant stakeholders to (1) better understand adolescents\u2019 motivation to participate in smoking cessation interventions, (2) take adequate action to increase recruitment and retention rates of cessation programmes, and (3) improve the interplay between stakeholders of various professional backgrounds in the field of smoking cessation. 3. Methods and Means National stakeholders relevant to the topic will be identified and organized within national networks. Each participating country will assess best practice models based on the experiences of national providers of smoking cessation. These experiences as well as the results of an international literature review will lead to the development of guiding principles. In order to discuss possible strategies for future implementations of the results and to develop recommendations for concrete actions, a European conference will be organized. 4. Expected Outcomes By identifying best practice and experiences with recruitment strategies for cessation programmes this work will help to increase the impact of these programmes as more participants will be reached. In the long run, this has the potential to decrease the smoking prevalence in youths and thus prevent the tremendous negative health consequences of smoking in the European Union.

General Objectives The objective is to contribute to the reduction of smoking-related morbidity and mortality by supporting tobacco product regulation. Directive 2001/37/EC prescribes amongst others that part of the data on tobacco ingredients, submitted by manufacturers, must be disseminated to the consumers. To inform the public well, authorities are obliged to make an understandable description of the different tobacco ingredients. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme This project is directly related to the priority action on Smoking prevention and tobacco control: Tobacco control in all policies. The aim is to produce information documents on 14 tobacco ingredients which have the highest health hazard regarding their nature and amount in which they are generally added. 3. Methods and Means Documents will be prepared by the key group of two MS, translated by all partners and disseminated on national websites to inform consumers throughout Europe. Topics to be addressed are the nature, toxicity, dependence potential and hazard classification of the chemical compounds that are added to tobacco products. Tobacco industries cannot make these documents because they may not be objective in describing the data or neglect negative results and properties of the ingredients they use. 4. Expected Outcomes The public will be better informed in a comprehensive way and in lay language about the manipulation of products by the tobacco industry to make products more attractive, and the fact that considerable amounts of chemicals are added to the tobacco products they consume, which become toxic or even carcinogenic upon combustion/pyrolysis. Based on this new information, the consumer may decide to never start or to stop smoking.

General Objectives The general objective of this project is to assist in reducing the significant public health burden of radon related lung cancers in EU Member States (MS). The effectiveness of the various existing radon prevention and remediation strategies in the MS will be assessed with the objective of improving them. The assessment of potential conflicts between EU energy conservation objectives in buildings and radon control technologies will be an important objective of this project. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme By means of its deliverables it is expected that this project will heighten awareness both of the public and of decision makers of the health burden of radon in the EU and of the technical means available to control radon. An important aspect of this project will be the transfer of this information to new and accession Member States where radon control strategies are presently almost non-existent. Previous studies on the response to dealing with the radon problem have shown the great complexity of the issue. Their findings suggest the need for a new and bigger effort to understand this subject. It is clear that only a joint European effort can provide the necessary experience and diversity of circumstances to provide an insight into this complex problem and in how to deal effectively with it. 3. Methods and Means Existing radon control strategies in EU Member States will be critically reviewed. A model of sufficient flexibility to permit different Member States to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a range of possible radon prevention and remediation strategies will be developed in the project. Radon risk communication strategies targeted at policy/decision makers, the general public and high risk groups such as people in high-radon areas, smokers and former smokers will also be developed.

General Objectives The conference on eHealth organized by the Presidency countries and the European Commission is a new milstone in the process launched with the Commission Communication \u201ceHealth \u2013 making healthcare better for European citizens. An action plan for a European eHealth Area\u201d COM (2004) 256 and the commitment of member states to work together to facilitate learning and promote wider deployment for successful eHealth applications. The ministerial conference eHealth for Individuals, Society and Economy will support the exchange of good practices and a forum involving National and Commission high level representatives to discuss progresses on deployment and future direction of ehealth policy. 2. Expected Achievements The organisation of this ministerial Conference also strives to support some of the objectives stipulated in \u201cDecision No 1350/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 establishing a second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008\u201313)\u201d, such as improved safety of the health of citizens, health promotion, dissemination of health information, increasing general awareness about healthcare, the collection, analysis and evaluation of healthcare information, etc. Widely discussed topics in eHealth such as interoperability or ICT tools will be included in the programme of the conference. 3. Target Audience State delegations will be invited to participate by means of an invitation. The invitations will be addressed to the ministers of health of individual countries with a recommendation to invite also a representative of other departments and target groups (patient associations, healthcare providers, health insurance companies, professional chambers and associations, the academic community) involved in eHealth issues in the relevant country to participate in the conference. Not all countries have the same strategy of division of powers in the area of eHealth, and that is why MoH has opted for this solution.

Central hypoventilation syndromes (CHS) are extremely rare disorders of central autonomic respiratory control and global dysfunction of autonomous nervous system. CHS include a heterogeneous group of not fully characterized diseases. Severe chronic central hypoventilation is the hallmark and the most life-threatening feature. Treatment requires advanced techniques of ventilation support (positive pressure ventilation, chest shell ventilation, phrenic nerve pacing, diaphragm pacing) during lifetime. However, currently large disparities exist in access to diagnosis and treatment across Europe while long-term outcomes are unknown. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme The European CHS community will benefit from better understanding of physiopathology of the extremely rare CHS. 3. Methods and Means Implementation of a European CHS register (ECHS register), as a critical mass of patients is required for high-quality epidemiological and clinical studies. Patients with CHS will be identified in the 14 participating European countries. More partners from more countries are to be recruited in order to expand the network towards Eastern Europe and Northern Europe. Data will be collected through a secured web- based register. European standards and guidelines for diagnosis \u2022 and treatment of CHS will be determined The state of existing services for CHS in Europe will \u2022 be provided for A multi-lingual website will facilitate information \u2022 dissemination and communication between patients and health professionals.

General Objectives The main objective of ENERCA 3 is the establishment of a European Reference Network (ERN) of Expert Centres (EC) in Rare Anaemias (RA). Identify appropriate centres of expertise (Expert Centres) throughout each national territory involved in ENERCA 3 Project is one of its most important goals. The ERN will establish a link between the ECs and will serve as a platform for foster their participation respecting the national competences and rules in regard of their authorisation or recognition. Once established the ERN will be responsible of organize healthcare pathways for patients suffering from rare anaemias through the establishment of cooperation with relevant experts and exchange of professionals and expertise within country or from abroad when necessary. The ECs will include in their plans or strategies the necessary conditions for the diffusion and mobility of expertise and knowledge on order to facilitate the treatment of patients in their proximity. One of the most important tools for ENERCA activities will be the Web site (www.enerca. org), established by ENERCA 1 and consolidated by ENERCA 2. The Website will be also very useful for giving support to the use of information and communication technologies such as telemedicine where it is necessary to ensure distant access to the specific healthcare needed. 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme All these measures, together with the European Comission will be essential to ensure, through appropriate funding and cooperation mechanisms, a long-term sustainability of infrastructures developed by ENERCA in the field of information, research and health care for rare anaemias. 3. Methods and Means The methods to be undertaken are focused on: analysis of the legal framework for patient\u2019s referral \u2022 and samples and/or clinical data exchange between MS establishment of consensus criteria to be fulfilled by \u2022 an Expert Centre in RA consolidation of the existing links between experts \u2022 in RA in order to promote the harmonization of procedures and to create a European Epidemiological Registry in RA preparation of guidelines for the clinical care of \u2022 patients with RA development of educational and training activities \u2022 for specialists and other professionals such as workshops, medical courses, e-learning and material distribution for expanding the knowledge of RA to public in general. The project will be undertaken by 48 partners, 24 associated partners and 24 collaborating partners, covering the majority of MS. Most of the partners have been working together since 2002 and all of them are well known and recognized experts in their respective field. A solid and professional management structure has been created to allow the smooth running of the project, with each WP leader coordinating his/ her activities. All partners have expressed their full commitment to the project and will be contributing with the necessary resources. In order to achieve the Project\u2019s goals, six governing transversal Work packages (WP) have been defined and structured, three horizontal: WP1 \u201cNetworking of expert centres\u201d; WP2 \u201cQuality of patient care\u201d and WP3 \u201cEducation and training\u201d and three focused on public health issues and management of patients with Rare Anaemias (RA) classified into three main categories: WP4 \u201cSickle Cell Disorders\u201d; WP5: \u201cThalassaemia\u201d and WP6 \u201cVery European Reference Network of Expert Centres in Rare Anaemias (ENERCA 3) Project No 20081210 120522_Health Report 2008_A4_INH_gp.indd 142 22.05.2012 16:56:03 Uhr ",

General Objectives The objective is to promote action on the prevention of rare diseases (RD) and to provide analysis and technical assistance in support of the development or implementation of a policy in the area of rare diseases and orphan drugs (OD). 2. Strategic Relevance and Contribution to the Public Health Programme Most RDs are life-threatening and chronically debilitating conditions and the vast majority of them are genetically determined. The individually low prevalence requires special combined efforts to address these diseases, with the aim of improving diagnosis, care and prevention. Though it is difficult to develop a public health policy specific to each rare disease, it is possible to have a global rather than a piecemeal approach in the areas of scientific and biomedical research, drug research and development, industry policy, information and training, social benefits, hospitalisation, and outpatient care. This global approach is provided by the present project. Scientific support for the activities of the RDTF by identifying already documentable indicators that are relevant to RD and then collecting further data on a yearly basis; disseminating political and scientific information to all stakeholders through ad-hoc reports and an electronic newsletter, including information on national and EU initiatives and incentives; liaising between EU agencies and services and major stakeholders to enhance collaborations and maximise input and outcomes; developing methods for assessing the EU added-value of networks of centres of expertise for rare diseases, including those currently funded; providing further assistance to the RDTF on other scientific issues that may be identified in the course of this project. The objective is also to improve the traceability of RD in health information systems by assigning International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD10) to all rare diseases; proposing changes to improve the classification in view of future adoption of the ICD11, using the technical platform developed by the WHO and with the assistance of an international expert group that will be established; cross-referencing with other classification systems such as MedDRA and SNOMED-CT and posting this information on the Orphanet website, in a format adapted to the needs of the information system community to maximise its use.

General objectives The general objective of the conference is in line with the Objective of the 2nd Programme of Community action in the field of health (2008\u201313): to improve citizens\u2019 health security, by pursuing Action: Protect citizens against health threats. The conference main goal is to underpin the corresponding priority in the 2008 annual Work Plan: Enhance capacity building (point 3.2.1.3) \u2013 and could aid in identifying future action and needs in this area. Several EU Member States operate high containment laboratories (with emphasis on BSL4 or P4 laboratories) as part of their national biopreparedness strategy. These facilities provide essential diagnostic capacity in case of outbreaks (emerging infectious diseases or biological threats). Several other EU Member States are developing plans for high containment laboratories, or have them currently under construction. They are confronted with restrictive EU (not aware of any restrictions, the only legislation in place is the health at workplace directive) and national regulations, and international standards and guidelines that are not always consistent (or not coherent). In addition, there are many national and EU projects and networks funded under current and previous Programmes, which focus mainly on biopreparedness, biosafety, biosecurity, capacity building and training, or exchange of reagents, protocols and good practice. Lastly, there are several relevant priority actions in the current Health Programme, which include development of Community reference laboratories and sharing facilities and equipment. EU Member States and organisations with new high containment laboratories will need to connect with ongoing initiatives and overall they need maximize synergy and cooperation across EU Member States. Project No 20084152 160 Specific objectives of the conference: To bring together a forum of experts in all fields \u2022 pertinent to high containment facilities, and to create an opportunity for new high containment facilities to benefit from lessons-learned in the area of Biopreparedness and Research on high-risk biological agents To provide a stepping stone for bringing together \u2022 European initiatives of high-level bio- containment laboratories and for stimulating future networking and capacity building. At this level, there is clearly an overlap with the tasks given to the ENP4 and no clear demonstration of added value. 2. Expected Achievements We expect that this conference will be an excellent opportunity for EU Member States with plans or ongoing construction of high containment laboratory facilities, to benefit from lessons learned at established sites. Because of the wide range of experts (including from veterinary and military high containment labs and international experts) the participants will be given a broad perspective on all pertinent issues related the operation of high containment facilities, such as Biopreparedness and Research on high-risk biological agents (see D1 and D2). (there is added value of bringing together vet as and medics, but there is absence of an analysis on how far the current proliferation of labs will bring us , including the issue of higher risks as discussed in the US presently) We expect that this conference will promote further networking among high containment laboratories, EU projects and networks, facilitate cooperation and enhance capacity building. Further collaborative schemes limiting the current increase of P4 labs and trends towards higher specialisation should be approached; Inter governmental agreements 120522_Health Report 2008_A4_INH_gp.indd 160 22.05.2012 16:56:24 Uhr ",

At the end of the meeting we will ask the participants for feedback; whether all of their high priority issues were sufficiently addressed and to identify further action and needs in this area (see D3). As a spin-off of this meeting we will also prepare a complete overview of all high containment laboratories, relevant EU projects and networks (see deliverable D4) and explore the possibilities and the need for setting up a virtual meeting place for informal discussions and information sharing \u2013 pending input from participants during the meeting (see D5). (ENP4 tasks) 3. Target Audience The anticipated stakeholders are directors, project leaders and (senior) management of EU Member State high-containment facilities, their biosafety and biosecurity professionals and scientists involved with research on high risk pathogens (see also \u00a73.2 and \u00a74.1). The proposed meeting will have a wide EU dimension, with representatives of high containment laboratories, projects, networks and organisations, which have participants of representations from at least 10 different European countries participating in the Second Health Programme (see also \u00a73.2 and \u00a74.1). The target audience for promotional activities (see \u00a74.1) will further include the ministries of Health in the respective EU Member States, which not yet operate high containment laboratories. In addition, experts from selected veterinary and military high containment laboratories will also be asked to participate (see \u00a73.2). In that sense there is complete coverage of the EU. In addition, the results of the meeting will be widely accessible through the internet (see \u00a74.2, e.g. Health- EU Portal) and thus available for a wider audience of Health interested professionals.

The impact of the recipient\u2019s outcome on the donor and the donor\u2019s perception of the process will also be evaluated in the follow-up model. 2. Strategic relevance and contribution to the public health programme The project\u2019s achievements will contribute to the Health Programme and Work Plan in the area of improvement of citizen\u2019s health security and safety related to the evaluation of post transplant results on organ transplantation, by promoting common definitions of terms and methodology to evaluate the results of transplantation. Project No 20081104 172 3. Methods and means The project will establish a validated strategy for the living donor follow-up by designing living donor follow-up tools and methodologies, based on a survey of current practices, considering the psychosocial well- being, quality of life and perception of the process to evaluate the impact of the donation process on the donor. It will design a recipient follow-up methodology, based on a survey of current practices, using the best indicators with the purpose to link recipient\u2019s outcome to the living donor\u2019s follow-up. It will also test the methodology and tools developed in the partners\u2019 countries in a prospective study during a period of 15 months. The study will be designed to compare the psychosocial well-being and quality of life of the donors before and after donation, and in this way study the impact of the donation process. The impact of the recipient\u2019s outcome on the well-being of the donor will also be addressed. 120522_Health Report 2008_A4_INH_gp.indd 172 22.05.2012 16:56:28 Uhr ",

        "I I I . H E A L T H S E C U R I T Y Risk Assessment from Policy to Impact Dimension (RAPID) ABSTRACT 1. General objectives Policies and strategies influence the wider determinants of health. These determinants have their impact on a range of different risk factors which then directly affect human health. The main aim of the project is to develop methodologies for conduct of \u201cfull chain\u201d risk assessment and implement them on a case study application on selected EC policy and via a series of national workshops. 2. Strategic relevance and contribution to the public health programme The proposal addresses the following areas of the health programme and Annual work plan: Risk assessment thematic networks and training of \u2022 risk assessors. The thematic network will address the \u201cfull-chain\u201d approach on broad field of determinants of health including all elements of risk management cycle. Moreover as secondary area our proposal \u2022 contributes significantly to area 3.3.1 and specifically \u201cPublic health capacity building by having academic partners on board who will implement the knowledge developed to their routine public health curricula. The strategic relevance is given by full- chain approach itself and by geographical coverage of partners. Project No 20081105 174 3. Methods and means Each partner will choose a policy and conduct assessment on impact on policy on determinants of health, impact of determinants of health on prevalence of risk factors and impact of risk factors on health effect (top-down approach). Similarly, each partner will choose a health effect and conduct the assessment process up to policies (the bottom-up approach). Based upon them a merged assessment guidance document will be developed and tested on a case of a European Commission policy. National workshops will be conducted to train experts in participating countries on the developed method. Policy analysis, questionnaire survey (on risk perception), project meetings, focus group discussions, database searches, workshops will be the main methods to conduct the project. 4. Expected outcomes Pilot tested model methodologies will be produced for bottom-up and top-down risk assessment in range of the full chain between policy-health effects. Based upon them, a general assessment methodology will be presented for full-chain approach. In addition, via national workshops a set of national experts will be trained on the developed methods. 120522_Health Report 2008_A4_INH_gp.indd 174 22.05.2012 16:56:29 Uhr ",

        "I I I . H E A L T H S E C U R I T Y European Health Risk Assessment Network on Electromagnetic Fields Exposure (EFHRAN) ABSTRACT 1. General objectives To establish a network for performing health risk assessment of electromagnetic fields (EMF) exposure. This network will make use of the risk analysis of the completed project EMF-NET CA (EC FP6). 2. Strategic relevance and contribution to the public health programme EMF diffusion is such that possible health consequences of EMF exposure can generate a domino effect, involving both directly and indirectly the whole society. The establishment of the most appropriate health risk assessment process on EMF, as proposed by EFHRAN, is not only desirable but essential at the European level and should not be delayed anymore. The effort is too important to be managed well at the level of individual countries, since it cannot have the full set of highly specialised experts or infrastructure needed. Further, only supranational authorities, such as EC, can develop recommendations needed by Member States. Project No 20081106 176 3. Methods and means EFHRAN will implement the following tasks: Risk analysis and hazard identification, that will \u2022 consist in complementing the existing EMF-NET risk analysis Exposure assessment estimation, i.e. how much and \u2022 how long people in Europe are exposed to EMF Dose-response assessments, to estimate the \u2022 amount of EMF exposure that is likely to result in a particular health effect Risk characterization, to characterize the risk for the \u2022 population Give input to risk management and communication, \u2022 by identifying priority areas where intervention/ communication is needed. Specific conditions of sensitive and vulnerable groups will be considered. 4. Expected outcomes EFHRAN is expected to provide EC and the EU with a health risk assessment process on EMF exposure that will allow these bodies to react to the concerns in full understanding of the scientific issues. EFHRAN is also expected to provide input for future risk management steps. The established network is an added value for EC, being an infrastructure capable to provide the needed future updated assessments. 120522_Health Report 2008_A4_INH_gp.indd 176 22.05.2012 16:56:30 Uhr ",

        "I I I . H E A L T H S E C U R I T Y The Celebration of 10th European Donation Day (EDD) ABSTRACT 1. General objectives The main objective of the project is to develop and disseminate the guidelines for the organisation of future European Donation Day, elaborated by consultation of experts and considering the guidance of Council of Europe, the initiator of the main event. 2. Strategic relevance and contribution to the public health programme The Council of Europe is organising a European Donation Day on a yearly basis in changing countries of its member states. In 2008, the main partner organised this event on behalf of the Council of Europe in Ljubljana. The main partner develops a model based on how to organise such a European Donation Day and which components to organise based on its own experiences in organising this event in 2008. This model is proposed to be modified according to adaptability in different cultural circumstances and being formulated into general guidelines, that can help organising future European Donation Days in European Member States with less developed organ donation awareness. Furthermore, the idea shall be tested, if satellite European Donation Days in parallel to the main event are beneficial for raising awareness on organ donation in the special circumstances of small countries. Project No 20081109 178 3. Methods and means Guidelines will be drafted and tested in 5 European countries. 4. Expected outcomes The project intents to raise awareness on organ donation among different target groups, considering geographical, cultural and social diversity, and by doing so to help increasing organ availability. The project aims to achieve two major outcomes: to develop guidelines for the future organisation of \u2022 European Donation Days, specifically for the use in small European Member States with less developed rates of organ donation to increase the awareness on the need of organ \u2022 transplantation among the general public to increase the pool of available organs. 120522_Health Report 2008_A4_INH_gp.indd 178 22.05.2012 16:56:32 Uhr ",
