        "Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS TECHNICAL REPORT 5 1 Executive summary BBackground, justification and objective The global HIV/AIDS pandemic reflects the gross socio-economic and health inequalities between industrialised and non-industrialised countries. UNAIDS estimates that 33 million people were living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in 2007; more than 96% of new HIV infections took place in low- and middle-income countries. Of all PLWHA, 22.5 million live in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where adult HIV prevalence is 5%, considerably higher than the 0.8% world estimate. The Caribbean, with 1% prevalence, is the second most affected area and Eastern Europe, with 0.9% prevalence, ranks third. According to International Organization for Migration (IOM), approximately 192 million people (3% of the world\u2019s population) were international migrants in 2006, of which 95 million were women. The United Nations defines as international migrant anyone who changes their country of usual residence. The most common reason to migrate is to seek economic improvement, thus the majority of migrants travel from developing to developed countries. The countries from where the largest numbers of migrants originated in 2006 were China, India and the Philippines, whereas USA, Russia, Germany, Ukraine and France were the top five countries receiving migrants. The EU, one of the wealthiest areas of the world, has received 64 million (8.8%) migrants, with substantial heterogeneity among countries. The EU is also proud of being one the regions of the world with the longest tradition of respect for human rights. However, as in many regions of the world, migrants living in the EU face severe integration problems. Migration and social exclusion make migrants highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and their related complications. The HIV epidemic is a major public health problem in the EU; the number of HIV infections has not ceased to increase since HIV reporting mechanisms came in place around 1999. The predominant transmission route is heterosexual (53% of new HIV reports in 2006), followed by men who have sex with men (MSM) (37%) and by injecting drug users (IDU) (9%). It is worth highlighting 204 cases of HIV infection through mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) reported in 2006. Health inequalities, including those by migrant status, should be monitored to develop appropriate responses. Since 2000, former EuroHIV collects information about the geographical origin of reports. A substantial and increasing proportion of AIDS and HIV reports acquired through heterosexual intercourse are people with a different geographical origin from that of the country of report, largely from SSA. However, other groups of migrants may also be disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS though data on these groups are lacking. The absolute and relative contribution of migrants to national HIV epidemics is heterogeneous across the EU and depends on migration patterns, colonial history, state of HIV epidemics in countries of origin and destination, and on health and social responses. Since early days in the epidemic it became clear that ensuring the rights of PLWHA was one of the main issues; it was unquestionable that science, human rights and a public health approach were keys elements for that. In 2007, the Portuguese Presidency of the EU chose as its main theme the issue of migration and health. In the Council conclusions adopted in December 2007, ECDC was called upon to deliver a report on migration and infectious diseases. As a response to this call, ECDC initiated a series of reports which will form the ECDC Report on Migration and Infectious Diseases in the EU. The objectives of the current report, Epidemiology of HIV and AIDS in migrant communities and ethnic minorities, were to determine the burden of HIV infection in migrant populations and its contribution to the epidemiology of HIV in the period 1999\u20132006. Methodology Data from ECDC/former EuroHIV were used, globally and for each country, and absolute numbers and percentages of cases of AIDS and HIV were examined by geographical origin and year (1999\u20132006), stratified by sex and transmission categories. When information was not available at ECDC, key informants were contacted directly. The number of registered migrants by sex and year was obtained from public European databases, Eurostat, and National Statistics Offices in each of the participating countries, either consulting their web pages or writing to them directly. Results In 2006 6 746 AIDS cases were reported in the EU27 countries plus Norway and Iceland. The largest number of migrants was observed among heterosexually transmitted cases; of those with known geographical origin, 1 373 (50%) were from a country different to that reporting the case, 77% from SSA. Of 57 AIDS cases due to MTCT with known geographical origin, 23% were from SSA. Also, close to 20% of AIDS cases in MSM were migrants; the commonest origins were Latin America (LA) (106) and other Western European (WE) countries (52). Among 1 545 cases in IDU, 7% were migrants, largely from WE and North Africa & Middle East. The number of AIDS ",
        "Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS TECHNICAL REPORT 6 cases in the region has experienced a 42% decline from 1999\u20132006 in natives and migrants from WE. Rising numbers of AIDS cases in 1999\u20132006 are observed in migrants from Eastern Europe (EE) (by 200%), SSA (by 89%) and LA (by 50%). AIDS cases are much more common in men than in women in the EU, though the male/female ratio is decreasing. Therefore, although the absolute numbers of men and women from SSA among AIDS cases reported in 2006 were 602 and 623 respectively, their proportions within the number of AIDS cases in males and females were 12% and 33%, respectively. In 2006 26 712 HIV infections were reported in the EU27 plus Norway and Iceland, of which 29% did not record geographical origin. The largest number of migrants, both in absolute and relative terms, was observed among heterosexually transmitted cases. Of people with known geographical origin, 65% of the 8 354 HIV infections were from a country different to that reporting the case, of which the vast majority (5 046) were from SSA. Of 169 cases of HIV with known geographical origin due to MTCT, 41% were from SSA. Also, 18% of the 5 048 HIV infections with known geographical origin in MSM were migrants and the commonest regions were LA (215) and WE (247). Among 1 590 HIV infections in IDU with known geographical origin, 86% were native and 14% migrants, largely from WE (63) and EE (64). The number of HIV infections reported in Europe has experienced a marked increase in 1999\u20132006, both in natives and migrants. This increase has to be interpreted in the context of the implementation of HIV reporting in the EU, which is not yet complete. HIV infections in the EU are globally much more common in men than in women, though male/female ratio is going down. The absolute numbers of men and women from SSA among HIV infections reported in 2006 were 1 764 and 2 989, respectively. Given that the total numbers of HIV infections in native men and women were 7 891 and 2 028, respectively, the ratio between SSA and native men was 0.1 and SSA and native women was 1.5. The number of HIV reports in women from SSA exceeds by close to 1 000 infections that of native women, though 2 910 HIV infections in females have unknown geographical origin. The number of women from SSA exceeds by over 1 000 that of SSA men. After SSA, men from WE account for the largest group (539), followed by LA (456). The most common countries of origin of HIV infections in female migrants, excluding SSA, differed from that of the men\u2019s, as women from South-East Asia and Caribbean accounted for 179 and 161 infections, respectively, while women from WE and EE and LA accounted for 85 and 111 cases each. There is a huge heterogeneity between countries with regard to the proportion of migrants among the HIV infection cases. Among countries with HIV incidence below 20 cases per million, largely Central Europe, the contribution of migrants to the epidemic is low. For countries with HIV incidence between 21\u201349 cases per million, except for Lithuania, the proportion of migrants among HIV reported cases from 2006 is over 40%. Given the different populations sizes, numbers vary from 24 cases of HIV infection diagnosed in migrants in Cyprus to 258 diagnosed in Sweden. For countries with HIV incidence of 50\u201399 cases per million, except for Greece, the proportion of migrants among HIV reported cases is 40% in the Netherlands and Germany, close to 60% in Norway, around 65% in Ireland and France, and 70% in Belgium. In countries with HIV incidence of 100\u2013199 cases per million, the proportion of migrants among reported HIV infections is around 30% in Austria, 71% in the UK, and as high as 80% in Luxembourg. In Portugal, the country with the highest HIV incidence in the EU, the proportion of migrants among HIV reports is approximately 20%. In 1999\u20132006 16 222 tuberculosis (TB) cases were reported as initial AIDS-defining condition (ADC), of which 8 028 were diagnosed in migrants, 3 883 from SSA and 2 684 of unknown origin. There was a wide heterogeneity in the proportion of TB as ADC by geographical origin. The lower proportions were seen in North Americans (8%) and native people (16%), and the highest in SSA (40%), EE (40%), South-East Asia (32%), and LA (30%). Of the approximate 495 million people registered with the National Population Offices of the 27 EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, around 32.5 millions (6.5%) are registered as non-nationals. Information on the nationality of these people is available for the 30 countries of this study except for Bulgaria, Estonia, France and Luxembourg. Of these 32.5 million registered migrants, half are from Europe (6.5 million are from WE, 7.4 from Central Europe, 2.3 million from EE), followed by LA (2.31 million) and the Caribbean (261 000), South and South-East Asia (2.25 million), North-Africa and the Middle East (2.19 million), and SSA (1.32 million). DDiscussion and limitations Migrant populations, largely people from SSA, represent a considerable and growing proportion of cases of both AIDS and HIV infection reported in the EU27 countries plus Norway and Iceland during 1999\u20132006. Although the proportion of migrants from SSA among heterosexual and MTCT reported cases are very high, a significant percentage of diagnoses in MSM is also related to migrants, largely from WE and LA and the Caribbean, highlighting the need to acknowledge the sexual diversity of migrants living with HIV/AIDS. The contribution of migrant populations to the AIDS and HIV epidemic is notably higher among female reports, highlighting the feminisation of the HIV/AIDS migrant epidemic in the EU. The reasons for female vulnerability to HIV infection have both social and biological bases. These figures call for action in gender-specific HIV prevention and treatment policies on national level. Closely linked to the high burden of HIV infection in women from SSA is the very high proportion of migrants from SSA among MTCT HIV reports in EU. While the decrease in perinatal HIV infections in ",
        "TECHNICAL REPORT Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS 7 the EU represent an important achievement in public health, substantial challenges remain, particularly among migrant mothers. There is an enormous diversity in the proportion of migrants with HIV infection in the different countries. For countries in EE and for some from Central Europe, this proportion is below 10% while for most Northern countries it is over 40%. For most countries in Western Europe , the proportion of migrants among those infected by HIV is between 20% and 40%. This pattern is consistent with migratory trends as the countries where the proportion of migrants among HIV cases is higher are also the countries where the proportion of migrants in the general population is also higher, largely driven by past colonial history and recent socio-economic and demographic imbalances. There is also a substantial and worrying proportion of cases whose geographical origin is unknown, particularly in the UK, France, Belgium and Germany. The present data does not allow distinguishing between HIV infections acquired in the EU or abroad. Other reports suggest that most HIV infections in people from SSA are likely to have occurred in the countries of origin, by comparing the average duration of stay in Europe with the value of the CD4 cell count at HIV diagnosis. However, there is also evidence that people of SSA origin are becoming infected by HIV in EU countries. For other geographical origins, little data are available on where the infection took place, though for migrant injecting drug users evidence would favour their acquiring HIV in Europe. While discussing the country of probable infection is extremely controversial \u2014 as it has, unfortunately, given rise to overtly racist reactions \u2014 understanding where the HIV infection and the development of AIDS took place has important implications from a public health perspective: it may represent failure in primary HIV prevention, secondary HIV prevention, or both. Late HIV diagnosis is a big problem in the EU and USA and the data suggest that this problem is even greater for the HIV-positive migrant population of non-Western origin. The number of AIDS cases reported in most EU countries has experienced a marked decline from the mid-1990s onwards, which has been largely attributed to the population impact of including having access to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). However, for most migrants this decline is not observed, reflecting late diagnosis of HIV infection and poorer access and uptake of HAART, and may have a negative impact on the mortality of HIV positive migrant people in the EU. Furthermore, adequate treatment of HIV is also a strategy to prevent HIV transmission, given that people on HAART are less infectious. The approach treatment and prevention is also applicable to TB as prompt HIV testing would certainly decrease HIV-associated TB. As it has been well established, treatment of TB is equivalent to prevention of TB transmission and thus, of secondary cases. Interpreting the contribution of migrants to the epidemiology of HIV in the region has limitations given the heterogeneity in the implementation of the HIV reporting systems and the poor completion of the variable \u2018geographical origin\u2019 in EU Member States. In fact, the very high proportion of missing values in this category is a caveat in the interpretation of figures calling for a reinforced HIV surveillance in the EU to assure the required quality standards To conclude, the figures presented in this report are no surprise for those working in the field, especially when one examines the global HIV epidemiology and the global migration trends, both largely driven by global inequity. Controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic should break down barriers to HIV prevention and treatment for migrants in the EU. The data provided and analysed in this report does confirm that failure of both primary and secondary HIV prevention is taking place and that decisive action is needed. ",
        "Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS TECHNICAL REPORT 8 2 Background 2.1 Setting the scene 2.1.1 The global HIV/AIDS pandemic The global HIV/AIDS pandemic has an uneven distribution worldwide and its prevalence, incidence and mortality reflect the gross socio-economic and health inequalities between industrialised and non-industrialised countries. In most parts of the world the HIV epidemic is closely linked to poverty and inequality in health. Some good news have been released in the last UNAIDS report, however, as the estimated number of people becoming infected each year has started to decrease, it still outnumbers by nearly three times the number of people who can start HAART worldwide. Although the UNAIDS/WHO\u2019s \u20183 by 5\u2019 initiative (\u2018Treat 3 million by 2005\u2019) has been achieved, with two years delay, few countries are expected to meet the goal of universal access by 2010 [1 Thirty three million people were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS in the world in 2007 and the number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) has not ceased to increase; in 1997, the global estimate of PLWHA was of 24 millions. More than 96% of the new HIV infections diagnosed in 2007 took place in low and middle income countries. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the area most severely hit by the HIV/AIDS pandemic [ ]. 1]. Of the 33.2 million PLWHA in the world, 22.5 million live in SSA, where HIV prevalence rates in adult population aged 15\u201349 were estimated to be 5% in 2007, considerably higher than the 0.8% world estimate. The epidemic in SSA is largely a heterosexual epidemic, with an increasing number of women being infected as compared to men, as well as a significant number of vertically infected children. Of the 2.1 million people who died of AIDS in 2007, 1.6 million lived in SSA where universal access to HAART is still far to be achieved. The Caribbean, with an adult HIV prevalence of 1%, is the second most affected region hit by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, with 230 000 PLWHA in 2007. There is, nevertheless, substantial heterogeneity within the islands; HIV prevalence is highest in the Dominican Republic [1]. Eastern Europe and Central Asia rank third in worldwide HIV prevalence, which in 2007 was 0.9%. This region has experienced one of the most explosive epidemics, largely driven by injecting drug use (IDU). Only in Eastern Europe in 2006, 59 866 cases of HIV infection were reported, resulting in a rate of 211 new HIV diagnoses per million inhabitants, over twice the rate of Western Europe (83 per million). The number of AIDS cases in this region continues to increase. In South and East Asia there are 4 million PLWHA, giving an overall HIV prevalence of 0.3%. In Latin America, HIV prevalence is around 0.5%, with 1.6 million PLWHA. Among high-income regions, North America reported 1.3 million PLWHA in 2007, with an overall prevalence of 0.6%, and Western and Central Europe had 760 000 PLWHA and a 0.3% HIV prevalence in the adult population [1]. Just recently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have revised USA HIV/AIDS data. HIV prevalence in Afro-Americans (1.7%) and Hispanics (0.6%) are 7.6 and 2.6 times higher, respectively, than in whites (0.2%) [2]. Using BED-HIV-1 capture enzyme immunoassay, the estimated HIV incidence in 2006 was 11.5 per 100 000 whites, 29.3 in Hispanics and 83.7 per 100 000 blacks [3 2.1.2 A look into the EU HIV/AIDS epidemic ]. The HIV epidemic continues to be a major public health problem within the European Union. The epidemiology of HIV and AIDS in the EU is dominated by the Western European epidemic pattern, given that 16 of the 27 countries lie in the west, eight in the centre and only three in the east [4]. The number of reported HIV infections in many of the 27 countries has not ceased to increase since new HIV reporting mechanisms came into place around 1999. This trend is observed in all transmission categories except for IDU, in which a slight but sustained decline is seen. The predominant mode of transmission is sex between men and women, accounting for 53% of new HIV reports in 2006, followed by sex between men (37% of HIV reports) and by IDU (9% of HIV reports). It is worth highlighting the 204 cases of HIV infection reported in 2006 through mother-to-child transmission. There are, however, very distinct epidemics that merit being addressed specifically in order to be adequately understood and dealt with. Traditionally, the relative contribution of MSM to the HIV/AIDS epidemics has been larger in the north and the central parts of the EU, and that of IDU in the south and in the east. The countries with the largest HIV rates reported are Estonia (504 per million) and Portugal (205 per million). Rates in the UK (149 per million), Latvia (130 per million) and Luxembourg (119 per million) also rank among the highest in the EU [4]. Spain has incomplete HIV reporting but HIV infection rates from registries, which cover 33% of the population, show a rate of 78 cases per million and an overall descending trend secondary to major descends among IDU [5]. ",
        "TECHNICAL REPORT Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS 9 As regards to AIDS trends, a steady decline in AIDS incidence rates has been observed in most of the EU since 1997, as a result of the introduction of HAART, although AIDS incidence has increased in 11 of the 27 countries [4]. Overall, a 50% reduction in AIDS incidence has been observed from 1999 to 2006; this reduction is observed in all transmission categories, but is less marked in heterosexuals, in which the numbers of AIDS cases per year became stabilised since the late 1990s. The highest AIDS rates in 2006 were reported in Portugal (694 cases, 66 cases per million inhabitants), Spain (1 519, 35 cases per million inhabitants) and Latvia (61 cases, 27 cases per million inhabitants). Important reductions in HIV transmission rates have been also achieved in MTCT in most countries, largely due to antenatal HIV screening and treatment of both mother and child [4]. 2.1.3 International migration at global scale: a look into the EU Migration is a characteristic of mankind. People have migrated throughout history, but the migratory flows of the last 30 years are distinct to those of the past in terms of magnitude and velocity. Approximately 192 million people (3% of the world\u2019s population) were international migrants in 2006, of which 95 million were women [6]. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that the annual migratory increase is 2.9%. The United Nations (UN) defines as international migrant any person who changes his or her country of usual residence, but there is a huge heterogeneity in what EU Member States understand by the term migrant [6]. The term migrant is broad and encompasses many different situations. Although attempts to classify migration have been made, none is completely satisfactory. Migrants could be classified according to the main reason of their migration (economic migrants, students, political refugees, environmental migrants, etc), the intended duration of the migration (temporary, permanent, intermittent), the boundaries of the process (internal migration vs. international ones), and the legal and administrative processes (regularised or \u2018legal\u2019 migrants vs. undocumented or \u2018illegal\u2019 ones) [7 Although there are many reasons to migrate, the most common reason is to seek economic improvement. This may happen in contexts of war and political upheaval, where people may be granted refugee status, or in the context of natural disasters. For example, global warming is forcing thousands of people to leave their countries and the recently denominated term \u2018environmental refugee\u2019 has been proposed to identify these groups [ ]. In most occasions, many circumstances concur. In this document, the definition will be a very broad one, following UN recommendations, but will concentrate in the migration within and into the EU. The current report will use \u2018foreigner\u2019 as a synonym of \u2018migrant\u2019 and will refer to \u2018natives\u2019 to denominate people born in the countries reporting HIV/AIDS cases. 6]. Forsyth et al have documented the relationship between political conflicts in SSA and the countries of origin of HIV-infected migrants from SSA in a Central London Hospital from 1985 to 2003 [8]. In many instances, emigration-push factors are not immediately related to acute crisis and are not always consequences of chronic poverty \u2014 people who migrate are not necessarily the most economically disadvantaged of their communities. The majority (75%) of migrants originate from developing countries and move to developed countries whose economies demand labour that cannot be met by the local working force. These migrants may be joined at a later stage by their families. Worldwide population growth is also imbalanced; it lies below 0.3% in developed countries and grows up to six times faster in developing ones. This demographic imbalance, coupled with the socio- economic gradient, makes people leave populated non-industrialised countries and favours its acceptance by industrialised countries with aged populations, in what is also known as \u2018replacement migration\u2019. Finally, push and pull factors are also shaped by the historical and economic relations between countries where colonial and neo- colonial past play an important role [6]. The countries from which the largest numbers of migrants originated in 2006 were China, India and the Philippines whereas the USA, the Russian Federation, Germany, Ukraine and France were the top five countries to receive migrants. As few as twenty countries receive two-thirds of all international immigrants [6]. The feminisation of migration in industrialised countries is higher (52%) than in developing regions (46%) and this has to do with the fact that in developed countries female migrants can be admitted both as \u2018dependent\u2019 wives and as \u2018independent\u2019 women integrated into the workforce, whereas in developing countries women migrants are usually admitted only as required by the labour market [9 Apart from economic migration, political and/or social dissidence are other common reasons that lead people to leave their countries. Within this group there are people who have been persecuted because of their political beliefs [ ]. 8], their ethnicity, their gender [9] or their sexual identity [1]. None of these reasons are mutually exclusive and these people are not always considered as refugees. It has been described, for example, how Mexican gay men migrate to the USA to be able to express their sexual identity [10]. Likewise, these push factors are also operating in migrants coming to the EU. A related concept, also difficult to define, is that of ethnic minority [11,12,13]. Sometimes, there are overlaps between populations belonging to ethnic minorities and migrants. Ethnic minorities include established minorities as well as those resulting from recent migratory waves. Migrants and their descendents, sometimes designated second- or third-generation migrants, often become part of the ethnic minority community. Bhopal and others define ethnicity as a construct reflecting the community\u2019s shared ancestral and geographical origins as well as ",
        "Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS TECHNICAL REPORT 10 cultural traditions, religions and languages [14]. Although currently considered a better term than race, many authors warn that ethnic group is often used as a euphemism for race. Ethnic minority members who are born in an EU country are not, in most instances, classified as migrants but have distinct features [15]. Unfortunately, in many countries, in spite of being country nationals, they suffer discrimination in various spheres of social life such as access to education, work and legal defence [16,17 The EU is one of the wealthiest areas of the world. The EU is densely populated and the demographic pyramid shows an aged population with a low growth rate. As a result, the EU is one of the regions that have received more migrants. The IOM estimates that there are approximately 64 million migrants in Europe, which account for 8.8% of the population in Europe [ ]. 6]. The EU is also proud of being one the regions of the world with the longest tradition of respect for human rights. However, many of the migrants and ethnic minorities living in Europe still face severe integration problems and the current economic turbulence affecting the world can potentially exacerbate the structural and social determinants of migrants and ethnic minorities in the EU. 2.1.4 HIV infection in migrants and ethnic minorities in the EU Migration places people in situations of heightened vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Social exclusion, experienced by migrants, also makes these groups highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and their related complications [7,15,16]. Migrants are frequently affected by strong barriers to HIV/AIDS prevention and care, including cultural, socio- economic and language barriers. The absolute and relative contribution of migrants to national HIV epidemics is extremely heterogeneous across the EU, as it depends on migration patterns, strongly determined by economic development in the countries of origin and destination, further modified by colonial history, as well as on the state of the HIV epidemic both in the countries of origin and destination, and on the health and social responses to the epidemic. Applying the above framework to the UK, for example, a higher number of migrants from old UK colonies in SSA would be expected in the country and, given that HIV prevalence in the general adult population of the countries of Southern Africa is over 10%, a higher HIV prevalence in these groups of migrants would also be likely. In Spain, the highest numbers of migrants originate from the neighbouring country Morocco, followed by Ecuador, countries which have a lower HIV prevalence than Spain so their contribution to the epidemiology of HIV in Spain would be expected to be very small. At the time of arrival into the country of emigration, most migrants tend to have better health than host country populations. This phenomenon, known as the \u2018healthy migrant effect\u2019, is a particular form of selection bias attributed to the various processes that labour migrants undergo before coming into the country of destination. Since most people go to another country expecting to work, those who most frequently migrate are the fittest, best able to survive the journey and pass the medical examinations they may have to undergo. With notable exceptions, immigrants\u2019 and nationals\u2019 health patterns tend to converge after some years after migration and for some health conditions, immigrants fare worse [9]. The expansion of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its uneven distribution worldwide may be associated with a higher HIV prevalence in migrants originating from countries with established HIV epidemics compared to those of the countries of destination. This is yet another consequence of the overlap between health inequity and poverty that acts as one of the major push factors for emigration. This phenomenon has been reported worldwide. In the USA, blacks accounted for 49% of persons diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 2006, Hispanic/Latinos accounted for 18% and whites for 30% [2]. In the EU an increase in the absolute and relative number of migrants originating from Sub- Saharan Africa among heterosexually acquired HIV infections has been reported over the last years (Figure 1). EuroHIV surveillance data also show slower reductions in AIDS incidence in SSA migrants [7]. In Norway, Sweden, Ireland and Belgium, over 50% of the newly reported HIV cases in heterosexuals in 2006 were of migrants (Figure 2) [4]. ",

As well as people from SSA, other groups of migrants may also be disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS in Europe, but there is less available data on them. For example, in Spain, a country where an explosive HIV epidemic among Spanish IDU took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and where the contribution of migrants was until recently virtually negligible, an increase in both absolute and relative number of migrants from Latin America among HIV and AIDS reports in MSM has been reported in the last few years [19 Data on HIV/AIDS in migrants from the UK suggest that migrants from SSA are likely to be already infected by HIV when arriving to Europe [20]. This conclusion can be drawn from analyses that have measured lymphocyte CD4 counts at the time of HIV diagnosis and have related those values to the time since arrival to the country. This is, again, no surprise for those working in the field given the extent of the pandemic in SSA. There is also evidence that migrants from SSA are also becoming infected in EU countries [ ]. 21 ], or when they travel to their countries of origin. Fenton et al, in the Mayisha study, have documented the very high proportion of men and women who have engaged in unprotected sex when travelling to their home countries [22]. ",
        "Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS TECHNICAL REPORT 12 In some communities, and in generations following the migration, relationships with people originating from the country of their ancestors may also be close, either travelling to the country of origin or in the country of destination. Given that the majority of people tend to choose sexual partners within their own communities, sexual mixing may take place between migrants and members of the same ethnic minority, as described by Grass et al, among others [23 2.2 Monitoring the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in migrants and ethnic minorities ]. 2.2.1 The purpose of monitoring HIV in migrants and ethnic minorities Understanding the HIV/AIDS epidemic in male and female migrant populations in the EU requires access to data from health information systems and/or ad hoc studies. It is acknowledged that health inequalities, including those by migrant status and/or ethnicity, should be monitored in order to give visibility to these problems and develop responses. How to monitor migration/ethnic inequalities is, nevertheless difficult [11,12,13,15]. Bhopal and others recommend stating clearly what the purpose for collecting those data is. It is important to stress in this report that race/ethnicity should never be used as an intrinsic risk factor to study disease aetiology, since \u2018a racial biological determinism\u2019 to disease has been proven wrong in scientific literature and has often been associated to racist messages. Current genetic knowledge does not support the sociological construct of races. Even though the ultimate goal is that of surveillance \u2014 that is, collecting data to develop appropriate preventive and healthcare responses, monitor interventions and to inform public health policy \u2014 it is essential to acknowledge the potential misuse of data on the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in migrants and ethnic minorities in promoting xenophobia and further stigmatisation of migrants and ethnic minorities affected by HIV/AIDS [15]. The consultation with affected communities and community-based organisations will facilitate the achievement of common goals and reduce the negative impact of HIV/AIDS in affected communities. As argued by Nancy Krieger in her editorial \u2018Counting Accountably\u2019, the answer is not to stop collecting racial/ethnic data but rather to end \u2018the racialisation\u2019 of these data, improve the quality of the data collected and ensure that public health research and programmes address racial discrimination [24]. 2.2.2 Human rights in the public health approach to HIV/AIDS control Since the very early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic it became clear that ensuring the rights of the PLWHA was one of the pillars of the fight against the epidemic. It was unquestionable that science, human rights and a public health approach were the key elements to follow. Consolidated guidelines on HIV/AIDS and human rights were recently developed by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Joint United Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) [25 (cid:2) \u2018Each State has the obligation to ensure that laws, regulation and collective agreements should be enacted or reached so as to guarantee the following workplace rights: freedom from HIV screening for employment and training, confidentiality regarding all medical information including one\u2019s HIV status, and employment security for workers living with HIV until they are no longer able to work.\u2019 ]. A few highlights: (cid:2) \u2018The right to liberty of movement encompasses the rights of everyone lawfully within a territory of a State to liberty of movement within that State and the freedom to choose his/her residence, as well as the rights of nationals to enter and leave their own country. Similarly, an alien lawfully within a State can only be expelled by a legal decision with due process protection.\u2019 (cid:2) \u2018There is no public health rationale for restricting liberty of movement or choice of residence on the grounds of HIV status. According to current international health regulations, the only disease which requires a certificate for international travel is yellow fever. Therefore, any restrictions on these rights based on suspected or real HIV status alone, including HIV screening of international travellers, are discriminatory and cannot be justified by public health concerns.\u2019 These guidelines call upon governments to fulfil their obligations on non-discrimination, rights to health and employment in order to reduce the vulnerability of PLWHA. As previously mentioned, migrants are recognised as one of the most vulnerable groups to HIV infection and its consequences. Migrants from all over the world often have their right to confidential and non-discriminating HIV testing and counselling violated. Early diagnosis of HIV infection should be a right to all people, irrespective of their migrant status, but denial of entrance or work permit on the basis of their HIV result is against the above mentioned guidelines. CARAM Asia (Coordination of Action Research on AIDS and Mobility Asia) has denounced this situation in Asian countries in their report \u2018State of Health of Migrants 2007 \u2013 Mandatory testing\u2019. Mandatory testing has no legal basis in the EU where mandatory testing is forbidden in many of the contexts that migrants may undergo along their migratory trajectory, such as application ",
        "TECHNICAL REPORT Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS 13 for work permits and visas to enter countries of destination, resettlement and/or repatriation in the case of refugees and displaced people [1]. 2.2.3 Difficulties to characterise the epidemiology of HIV in migrants and ethnic minorities Most European countries have not traditionally collected information about ethnic background or migrant status of people in their health information systems. This contrasts with the USA, where variables on race and ethnicity have historically been collected, although also subject to intense debate on which the best approaches to do so are [12,13]. In this respect, HIV/AIDS are not exceptions and data broken down by ethnicity or migratory status have not traditionally been produced. In fact, if anything, tuberculosis and, since 2002, HIV/AIDS are the only diseases for which country of origin information has been collected in surveillance activities at European level [4,15]. Del Amo et al published a review paper in 2004 on the variables used to monitor HIV/AIDS in migrants and ethnic minorities in 15 EU countries. They have discussed the advantages and limitations of these variables, highlighted some of the data gathered by former EuroHIV, and drew recommendations to identify ways in which HIV/AIDS surveillance for vulnerable groups may be strengthened. The variables collected included nationality, country of birth, country of origin, country of residence, country of probable infection, race, ethnic group, date of arrival in the country, refugee status and country of origin of the partner, with most countries collecting more than one variable and some collecting none. The most commonly used variable was \u2018nationality\u2019, which was being collected by 12 of the 15 surveillance systems from the EU. \u2018Country or continent of birth\u2019 was collected in six countries and \u2018country of origin\u2019 was used in Belgium, Denmark and Spain. Ethnic group was used only in two countries. In Belgium, ethnic groups (used for AIDS but not for HIV reporting) were defined as \u2018White/Caucasian\u2019, \u2018Black/African\u2019, \u2018Hispanic/Latino\u2019, \u2018Asian\u2019, \u2018Mixed\u2019, \u2018Unknown\u2019 (EuroHIV, unpublished data). In the UK, the classification was changed in 1994 to the categories adopted by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS), which are: \u2018White, Black-African, Black-Caribbean, Black-Other, Indian/Bangladeshi/Pakistani/Asian or Oriental, Other/Mixed, Not Known\u2019. Race was used only in the Portuguese HIV/AIDS surveillance forms together with nationality. Country of probable infection was recorded in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the UK (in the UK it was only reported for cases of heterosexual transmission) [15]. Former EuroHIV collected, from the very beginning of the epidemic, information on geographical origin of the cases of HIV/AIDS infected though heterosexual sex and through mother-to-child transmission. Such decision was based on the fact that persons originating from countries with generalised epidemics accounted for the majority of HIV/AIDS cases of heterosexual transmission reported in Western Europe. Given the need to monitor the epidemic in migrant populations in all transmission categories, national representatives for HIV/AIDS surveillance in Europe agreed to collect country of origin for all cases of HIV/AIDS from 2002. This decision was adopted after the completion of a special survey on HIV/AIDS cases reported during 1997\u20131999 [26]. The former EuroHIV recommended deriving this information from nationality or from country of birth. If both nationality and country of birth are available, it is recommended to use nationality [4]. There are obvious misclassification errors as different countries use different criteria to grant nationality, which complicates comparisons at an international level and across Europe. In fact, two persons from the same country of origin living in different European countries may well be classified differently, one as being a European national and the other not. Also, nationality cannot discriminate between ethnic origins of less recent migrant populations. While efforts have been made to include country of origin in European HIV surveillance, monitoring HIV/AIDS in ethnic minorities has been less successful. This is not simply an issue that may affect second and third generation migrants as it has affected established ethnic minorities. For example, in Spain, the largest ethnic minority is the gypsy community, established in the country for more than 500 years and Spanish by nationality, but invisible in health information systems. While there is data suggesting that they have been strongly affected by the HIV epidemic, it has been impossible to quantify the magnitude of the problem. Finally, as highlighted by Del Amo et al, attempts to calculate HIV/AIDS rates at population level are likely to yield biased overestimates, since appropriate denominators for either migrant or ethnic minority populations are often lacking. Undocumented migrants \u2014 the most deprived group and among the most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS \u2014 have a higher probability of appearing in the numerator, but are often missing from the denominator as they tend not to be registered [15]. The role of systematic selective HIV testing in migrants may also lead to relative overestimates of HIV prevalence when compared to groups not exposed to the same testing practices. As for ethnic minorities, this is simply impossible in most Western European countries, as population censuses do not collect ethnic background information, the UK being the exception. In spite of the public health relevance of the question, no comprehensive analyses have so far been performed to identify the burden of infection by HIV and AIDS in migrant populations in the current EU, taking into account the heterogeneity within each of the countries. Therefore, the objectives of this report are to determine the burden of infection by HIV in migrant populations and its contribution to the epidemiology of HIV in the period 1999\u20132006. ",

HIV/AIDS surveillance data for the WHO European Region had been regularly co-ordinated by former EuroHIV since 1984 and it is now based at ECDC. The last data update available from EuroHIV goes up to 2006. Data on AIDS are adjusted for reporting delays. Therefore data from the last three years may differ from the data published in national reports. Data for HIV is not adjusted for reporting delays. Countries who had not reported full or partial HIV/AIDS data to EuroHIV were contacted directly and asked to resubmit their data. This was the case for HIV reporting in Austria, where the Austrian HIV Cohort was contacted, for example. Further details are described in Table 1. Some of the minor inconsistencies between numbers in some tables and graphs are due to missing data either on the transmission category, sex or geographical origin. Since 2000, EuroHIV collects information on the \u2018origin\u2019 of HIV/AIDS cases. \u2018Origin\u2019 refers to the geographical origin of the reported case. It is recommended to derive this information from nationality or from country of birth. If both nationality and country of birth are available, it is recommended to use nationality. The variable was classified as follows by former EuroHIV: 1 = Cases in people whose origin is the same as the reporting country 2 = West Europe 3 = Central Europe 4 = East Europe (code using EuroHIV classification) 5 = Sub-Saharan Africa 6 = East Asia & Pacific 7 = Australia & New Zealand 8 = South & South-East Asia 9 = North Africa & Middle East 10 = North America 11 = Caribbean 12 = Latin America 98 = Foreigner, subcontinent unknown 99 = Unknown For each country, and for all of them together, the absolute numbers and percentages of cases of AIDS and HIV by geographical origin and by year (1999\u20132006) stratified by sex and transmission categories were examined. Data were plotted in graphs and tables to characterise different population patterns and to assess trends. Note: For HIV reporting, five countries (France, Greece, Malta, Netherlands and Portugal) have modified substantially their HIV surveillance systems and they are usually excluded from EuroHIV trend analyses. They have all been included in this report in order to verify the absolute and relative proportion of migrants within the EU rather than to interpret trends.

There is substantial heterogeneity in the global figures and it is necessary to look at country specific data, which are presented in individual factsheets per country, together with demographic figures on migration. 5.1.1 Geographical origin of AIDS cases within transmission categories in 2006 In 2006, 6 746 AIDS cases were reported in the EU27 plus Norway and Iceland. Figure 3 describes the proportion of migrants according to their geographical origin within each of the transmission categories. The largest number of migrants, both in absolute and relative terms, is observed among heterosexually transmitted cases. Of those with known geographical origin, 1 373 (50%) of the 2 754 AIDS cases were from a country different to that reporting the case, the vast majority (1 050 cases, 77%) from Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 57 cases of AIDS due to MTCT with known geographical origin, 13 (23%) were children from Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, close to 20% (244) of the 1 404 AIDS cases diagnosed in MSM were migrants, and the most common regions of origin were Latin America (106) and other Western European countries (52). Among the 1 545 cases in IDU, 100 (7%) were migrants, largely from other Western European countries and North Africa & Middle East. The proportion of cases among these three transmission categories in which the geographical origin was not known was well below 10%. Of the 684 cases classified as other/unknown transmission categories, 99% were unknown.

A similar descending trend (by 40%) is seen in migrants from a Western European country. Rising numbers of reported AIDS cases between 1999 and 2006 are observed in people whose geographical origin is Eastern Europe (by 200%), SSA (by 89%) and Latin America (by 50%) (Table 3). In 2006, people from SSA, with 1 225 cases, represented the second largest group among the total of 6 746 AIDS reports in the EU. The third largest group, with 209 AIDS cases, are people from Latin America. As for the rest of the geographical origins within the AIDS cases, the numbers are considerably smaller than those whose origin is SSA, Latin America or another west European country and, it is worth noting the clear upward trend in AIDS cases from Asia (Table 3). Fortunately, the number of people whose country of origin is not reported has gone down by 81%.

First, AIDS cases are much more common in men than in women in the EU although the ratio male to female is decreasing: it was 3.2 in 1999 and 2.6 in 2006. Therefore, although the absolute numbers of men and women from SSA among AIDS cases reported in 2006 were 602 and 623, respectively, the proportions within the total number of AIDS cases in males and females were 12% and 33%, respectively. As for Latin Americans, there were 149 AIDS cases reported in men in 2006 and a lower number (60) of women. These differences are explained by the different HIV transmission routes operating within each geographical origin; a largely heterosexual epidemic in SSA compared to the Latin-American epidemic where both heterosexual and homosexual transmission are taking place. Differences by sex are seen in the proportional increases in AIDS cases of SSA origin; while the increase from 1999 to 2006 in men was of 64%, women experienced a 123% increase in the same period. AIDS cases in women from Asia have experienced a 90% increase from 1999 to 2006 and have a similar magnitude to AIDS cases in women from Latin America. ",

        "Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS TECHNICAL REPORT 22 (Figure 5d), a decrease is observed in native cases from 1999 (75 cases) to 2002 (40 cases) to remain stable from then on. The trends among MTCT AIDS cases of Sub-Saharan African origin (179; 26% of 678 MTCT cases) do not show a clear decreasing trend and their relative contribution to all MTCT cases has gone up from 18% in 1999 to 24% in 2006. Figure 5 Trends in AIDS cases by geographical origin within each transmission category, 1999\u20132006 5.1.4 Geographical origin of HIV infections within transmission categories in 2006 In 2006, 26 712 HIV infections were reported in the EU27 plus Norway and Iceland. Figure 6 describes the proportion of migrants within each of the transmission categories for HIV infections reported in 2006 which recorded information on transmission category and country of origin (the countries above except the Netherlands and Austria). It is worth highlighting that 7 812 (29%) HIV reports from 2006 did not record the geographical origin of the case. The largest number of migrants, both in absolute and relative terms, is observed among heterosexually transmitted cases. Out of people with known geographical origin, 5 429 (65%) of the 8 354 HIV infections were from a country different to that reporting the case, of which the vast majority (5 046) were from Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 169 cases of HIV with known geographical origin due to MTCT, 85 (50%) were natives and 69 (41%) were from Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, 896 (18%) of the 5 048 HIV infections with known geographical origin diagnosed in MSM were migrants and the most common regions of origin were Latin America (215) and other Western European countries (247), though the number of cases of unknown geographical origin was very high (1 974, 28%). Among the 1 590 HIV infections in IDU with known geographical origin, 1 366 (86%) were native and 224 (14%) foreigners, largely from Western (63), Eastern (64) and Central Europe (22), and from North Africa and the Middle East (16). This category had the smallest proportion of subjects from unknown origin 210 (12%). Practically all subjects grouped together with the other and unknown transmission categories had unknown transmission categories.

This increase, though probably reflecting an upward trend, has to be interpreted in the context of the implementation of the HIV reporting systems in the EU, which is not yet complete, as countries like Spain and Italy still do not have nationwide representative HIV surveillance systems. Changes in the HIV reporting systems may be also distorting the trends. Finally, the apparent decrease in 2006 has to be confirmed with further data from 2007 as it could be reflecting reporting delays.

The third largest group, with a considerable distance from SSA, is that of HIV cases coming from another Western European country followed by those from Latin America, South-East Asia and the Caribbean. Contrary to AIDS reporting, the number of HIV-infected people whose country of origin is not reported is alarmingly going up, after an improvement in the collection of this variable from 1999 to 2000. Overall, 4 029 HIV cases of unknown geographical origin were reported in 1999 (47% of all HIV reports) and 7 794 in 2006, representing a 32% of all reports for that year. This, together with the very high proportion of people with unknown transmission category (31% in 2006), compromises the functions of HIV surveillance in the EU. Breaking these figures by sex (Figures 7a and 7b) allows having a deeper look at the different contributions in absolute and relative terms of male and female migrants to the numbers of HIV infections reported in the EU. HIV infections are much more common in men than in women in the EU, although the male to female ratio is going down: from 2.4 in 1999 to 1.9 in 2006. The absolute numbers of men and women from SSA among HIV infections reported in 2006 were 1 764 and 2 989, respectively. Given the numbers of HIV infections in men and women whose geographical origin was that of the country of report in 2006 were 7 891 and 2 028, respectively, the ratio between SSA and native men was 0.1, and 1.5 for the women. The number of HIV reports in women from SSA exceeds by close to 1 000 infections that of women whose geographical origin is the same as the county of report, although, with the very large number of missing geographical origin (2 910 HIV infections in females), is not possible to quantify this properly. Also, the number of women from SSA exceeds by well over a thousand cases that of men from SSA in 2006. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 West Europe Centre Europe East Europe East Asia & Pacific Australia & New Zealand South & south-east Asia North Africa & Middle East North America Caribbean Latin America Others ",

The lower proportions were seen in North Americans (8%) and native EU people (16%), and the highest in Sub-Saharan Africans (40%), Eastern Europeans (40%), South-East Asians (32%) and Latin Americans (30%).

        "Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS TECHNICAL REPORT 30 Among MSM, TB represented 793 (7%) of initial ADC cumulative TB reports in natives from 1999 to 2006, with the highest proportions observed in people from SSA (50, 33%), Latin America (237, 34%) and South-East Asia (44, 29%) (Figure 9c). Figure 9c Cumulative percentage of TB as the initial AIDS-defining condition in AIDS cases reported in MSM, 1999\u20132006 5.1.8 A look into country-specific HIV & AIDS data There is a huge heterogeneity in the proportion of migrants among HIV infections reported in 2006 in EU countries plus Norway and Iceland. Figure 10 shows countries classified in five groups, according to the HIV incidence rates per million of population: below 20 cases per million, between 21 and 49 cases per million, between 50 and 99 per million, between 100 and 199 per million, and over 200 per million. Figure 10 also presents the number and proportion of migrants within the total HIV reports for 2006. Among countries with HIV incidence below 20 cases per million people, largely from Central Europe, both the absolute and the relative contribution of migrants to their epidemics are low. For countries with an HIV incidence of 21\u201349 cases per million people, except for Lithuania, the proportion of migrants among HIV reports for 2006 is over 40%. Logically, given the different population sizes of these countries, the absolute numbers of HIV cases vary from the 24 HIV infections diagnosed in migrants in Cyprus to the 258 ones diagnosed in Sweden. For countries with an HIV incidence of 50\u201399 cases per million people, except for Greece, the proportion of migrants among HIV reports from 2006 is 40% in the Netherlands and Germany, close to 60% in Norway, around 65% in Ireland and France, and 70% in Belgium. In countries with an HIV incidence of 100\u2013199 cases per million people, the proportion of migrants among reported HIV infections is around 30% in Austria, 71% in the UK and as high as 80% in Luxembourg. Finally, in the country with the highest HIV incidence in Europe \u2014 Portugal, with over 200 cases per million people \u2014 the proportion of migrants among HIV reports is 20%. For most countries, as it can be seen in the factsheets (Annex 1), the most common region of origin of AIDS and HIV reports was SSA, with some exceptions like Spain, where the absolute number of people from Latin America outnumbered that of SSA. It is also worth highlighting the very high number (n = 91) of MTCT HIV infections in the UK, of which 47% are in children from SSA. This number is considerably higher than that reported by the rest of the EU countries. 6.6% 10.0% 14.0% 14.3% 32.7% 20.0% 28.6% 11.5% 6.6% 3.6% 33.8% 20.0% 10.2% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% N a t i v e s ( 7 9 3 / 1 1 9 3 0 ) W e s t E u r o p e ( 4 6 / 4 5 9 ) C e n t r a l E u r o p e ( 2 0 / 1 4 3 ) E a s t E u r o p e ( 3 / 2 1 ) S u b - S a h a r a n A f r i c a ( 5 0 / 1 5 3 ) E a s t A s i a & P a c i f i c ( 4 / 2 0 ) S o u t h & s o u t h - e a s t A s i a ( 4 4 / 1 5 4 ) N o r t h A f r i c a & M i d d l e E a s t ( 1 5 / 1 3 1 ) N o r t h A m e r i c a ( 5 / 7 6 ) C a r i b b e a n ( 2 / 5 6 ) L a t i n A m e r i c a ( 2 3 7 / 7 0 2 ) O t h e r ( 1 0 / 5 0 ) U n k n o w n ( 1 7 8 / 1 7 4 1 ) Country of origin 6.6% 10.0% 14.0% 14.3% 32.7% 20.0% 28.6% 11.5% 6.6% 3.6% 33.8% 20.0% 10.2% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% N a t i v e s ( 7 9 3 / 1 1 9 3 0 ) W e s t E u r o p e ( 4 6 / 4 5 9 ) C e n t r a l E u r o p e ( 2 0 / 1 4 3 ) E a s t E u r o p e ( 3 / 2 1 ) S u b - S a h a r a n A f r i c a ( 5 0 / 1 5 3 ) E a s t A s i a & P a c i f i c ( 4 / 2 0 ) S o u t h & s o u t h - e a s t A s i a ( 4 4 / 1 5 4 ) N o r t h A f r i c a & M i d d l e E a s t ( 1 5 / 1 3 1 ) N o r t h A m e r i c a ( 5 / 7 6 ) C a r i b b e a n ( 2 / 5 6 ) L a t i n A m e r i c a ( 2 3 7 / 7 0 2 ) O t h e r ( 1 0 / 5 0 ) U n k n o w n ( 1 7 8 / 1 7 4 1 ) Country of origin ",

        "TECHNICAL REPORT Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS 33 6 Discussion Migrant populations, largely people from Sub-Saharan Africa, represent a considerable and growing proportion of both the AIDS cases and HIV infections reported in the 27 EU countries plus Norway and Iceland during 1999\u2013 2006. Although the proportions of migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa among heterosexual and mother-to-child HIV transmission reports are very high, a significant percentage of diagnoses in men who have sex with men is also made up of migrants, largely from Western Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. The contribution of migrant populations to the AIDS and HIV epidemics is notably higher among female reports, highlighting the feminisation of the HIV/AIDS migrant epidemic in Europe, in contrast to the largely male autochthonous HIV epidemics. These figures are no surprise when one examines the global HIV epidemiology and the global migration trends, both largely driven by global inequity. There is an enormous heterogeneity in the proportion of migrants within the AIDS and HIV infection reports among the different countries. For countries in the Eastern part of the EU and for some from Central Europe, these proportions are below 10%, while for most Northern countries these proportions are over 40%. For most of the countries in the Western part of the EU the proportion of migrants among HIV infections is between 20% and 40%. This pattern is consistent with migratory trends, as the countries where the proportion of migrants among HIV cases is higher are the countries where the proportion of migrants in the general population is also higher, largely driven by past colonial history and recent socio-economic and demographic imbalances. There is also a substantial and worrying proportion of cases whose geographical origin is unknown, which is particularly high in the UK, France, Belgium and Germany. The contribution of migrants, largely from SSA, to the number of HIV reports in the EU is higher in female reports. In fact, among HIV infections reported in women with known geographical origin, the number of HIV-positive women from SSA outnumbers that of native women and that of HIV-positive African men. The number of registered African women in population registries across the EU does not outnumber that of African men. Acknowledging the limitations resulting from a very high proportion of missing information and various possible explanations such as selective HIV testing of women from SSA during pregnancy, the data show that women from SSA, not only in their countries of origin but also when migrating to another country, suffer a greater burden of HIV disease. The reasons for female vulnerability to HIV infection have both social and biological bases. Women of black ethnicity in the USA also suffer a disproportionate burden of HIV infection compared to white women [2]. Kirsten Tillerson has published a review trying to explain the racial disparities in HIV/AIDS among women in the USA and concludes that back women do not engage in more high-risk behaviours than white women but have risky sex partners [27]. These figures call for action in gender-specific HIV prevention and treatment policies at national level. It would be a mistake to link the high number of HIV-positive women from SSA to sex work. While, over the last decades a growing proportion of migrants is seen among female, male and transgender commercial sex workers, numerous studies have reported that HIV prevalence in female sex workers (FSW) who do not inject intravenous drugs in the EU is fairly low [28]. Some studies have reported very high HIV prevalence among male and transgender sex workers but studies in female sex workers show discordant data [29 Closely linked to the high burden of HIV infection in women from SSA is the very high proportion of migrants from SSA among MTCT HIV reports in the EU. Close to 40% of the HIV reports infected through MTCT were children from SSA and this proportion has increased from 1999 to 2006. Given that geographical origin is not always equivalent to country of birth and acknowledging that some of these children may have been born to HIV infected mothers outside the EU [30], it is likely that many of these children have been infected by HIV due to failure to diagnose and treat their mothers while in an EU State. While the decreases in perinatal HIV infections in the EU represent an important achievement in public health, substantial challenges remain, particularly among migrant mothers [ ]. The data does identify a considerable proportion of migrants among HIV diagnoses in MSM, mainly from other Western EU countries, Latin America and the Caribbean. Population mobility in the EU may be one of the causes for this phenomenon while the immigration of MSM from Latin America and the Caribbean may also be driven by lack of civil sexual rights for MSM in their countries of origin, highlighting the need to acknowledge the sexual diversity of migrants living with HIV/AIDS. 31,32,33]. The missed opportunities to prevent perinatal HIV transmission relates mainly to pregnant women not having received prenatal care, to a lack of HIV testing before delivery and to not receiving appropriate interventions to prevent transmission of the virus to her infant [34]. Lack of prenatal care among migrant women is well documented and the major obstacles to access prenatal services are also well known. In France testing during pregnancy is the most common reason to diagnose HIV in women from SSA and second most common cause in French women [35]. African women present a higher proportion of delayed diagnoses at pregnancy and were more likely to have late access to prenatal care and HIV treatment. However, once they do have access, the uptake of HIV treatment and elective caesarean section was the same of French women\u2019s, and so were the ",
        "Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS TECHNICAL REPORT 34 outcomes [35]. Although one would acknowledge that the key to prevention of perinatal HIV infection is primary prevention of infection in women and men, secondary prevention strategies are also failing in the EU. Secondary prevention of MTCT involves providing prenatal care to diagnose HIV infection before delivery in order to offer the best medical intervention and prevent perinatal HIV transmission. Every perinatal HIV infection should represent a sentinel health event that should warrant an enquiry. Therefore, to strengthen and sustain measures so as to maximally reduce perinatal transmission, public health activities should give high priority to the collection of data that would allow identifying where missed opportunities occur and target prevention efforts accordingly. The current data does not allow distinguishing between HIV infections acquired in the EU or abroad, but others have reported that most HIV infections in people from SSA are likely to have occurred in the countries of origin by comparing the average duration of stay in Europe with the value of the CD4 cell counts at HIV diagnoses. However, there is also evidence that people of SSA origin are also becoming infected by HIV while in a EU country. Newly published data from the UK suggest that 25-35% of HIV-positive African residents in the UK and nearly 50% of HIV-positive African MSM may have acquired their HIV infection in the UK, which is substantially higher than previously estimated [36]. For other geographical origins, little data are available on where the infections took place, though for migrant injecting drug users the evidence would favour their acquiring HIV in Europe. While discussing about the country of probable infection is extremely controversial as it has, unfortunately, given rise to overtly racist reactions, understanding where HIV infection and the development of AIDS took place has important implications from a public health perspective as it may represent failure in primary HIV prevention, secondary HIV prevention, or both. Late HIV diagnosis is a big problem in the EU and USA, as it is associated with higher mortality [37 15 ] and the current data suggests that this problem is even bigger for the HIV-positive migrant population of non-Western origin [38, ]. The number of AIDS cases reported in most EU countries has experienced a marked decline from the mid-1990s onwards which has been largely attributed to the population impact of HAART and to decreases in HIV transmission in the late 1980s. For most migrants, with the exception of migrants from Western EU countries, this decline is not observed. These trends are likely to be reflecting late diagnosis of HIV infection and poorer access and uptake of HAART by migrants of non-Western European origin and may have a negative impact on the mortality of HIV positive migrant people in the EU. Furthermore early HIV diagnosis [39] and adequate treatment of HIV is also a strategy to prevent HIV transmission as people on HAART have lower viral load both in blood and genital fluids and are, subsequently, less infectious. However, evaluation of missed opportunities for early HIV testing is obviously different if the person has spent most of their life in another country and came to an EU country with advanced disease. Nevertheless, as described by Burns et al, HIV-positive Africans are accessing the health system in London without being offered HIV testing, highlighting missed opportunities for early prevention, treatment and care [40,41 A higher proportion of migrants develop TB as their initial ADC compared to natives. Migrants from SSA and Eastern Europe are the ones with the highest percentage of TB, around 40% each, closely followed by 32% in AIDS cases from South/East Asia. Stratifying by transmission category also shows that, though prevalence of TB is higher in IDU in the first place and heterosexuals in second place compared to MSM, the differences by geographical origin are maintained. Again, these figures are no surprise and coincide with global HIV/TB co- infection rates worldwide [42]. The data provided in this report has not dealt with TB resistance but this, together with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), may be an issue to be addressed in these populations. Prompt HIV testing would certainly decrease HIV-associated TB through both immune reconstitution through HAART and secondary TB prevention through Mantoux testing and treatment of latent TB infection. As it has been well established, treatment of TB is equivalent to prevention of TB transmission and thus, secondary cases. ]. Interpreting the contribution of migrants to the absolute and relative trends of HIV reports overtime is more difficult given the heterogeneity in the implementation of the HIV reporting systems across EU and the poor completion of the variable \u2018geographical origin\u2019. In fact, the very high proportion of missing values in this category is a caveat in the interpretation of figures. The proportion of HIV reports whose transmission category is unknown is also alarmingly rising in the EU, calling for a reinforced HIV surveillance in order to assure the required quality standards. Given that only the UK collects data on the \u2018ethnicity of cases\u2019, it is not possible to asses the contribution of ethnic minorities to the EU epidemics. It is likely that HIV is also affecting disproportionably ethnic minorities in the EU who are currently invisible to surveillance systems, as they have the same geographical origin as the country of report. As discussed previously, ethnic minorities in the USA are heavily affected by HIV and, as argued by O Aral et al, the African-American HIV epidemic has its roots in profound social disadvantage and inequity [43 As previously described, the calculation of HIV prevalence in migrants according to their geographical origin will most likely yield biased results, as for some groups of uncertain residence status the chance of appearing in the numerator is higher than that of counting in the denominator [ ]. 7,1,15]. In fact, demographic data on the number of men and women with a different nationality of that of the country of report are a very insufficient tool to health estimates. It is likely that some groups are seriously underrepresented in these population registries, thus leading ",
        "TECHNICAL REPORT Migrant health: Epidemiology of HIV infection and AIDS 35 to gross overestimates of HIV prevalence in migrants. Action at EU level to improve the quality of demographic data and to agree on a set of common definitions and timeframes is necessary. Barriers to HIV prevention and treatment for migrants in the EU have been covered in a twin ECDC report \u2014 Access to HIV prevention, treatment and care \u2014 and will not be dealt with in this specific epidemiological review. These barriers have, nevertheless, a hierarchical structure. It has to be firmly stated that in a framework of prosecution of migrants, irrespective of their administrative and legal residency status in a given country, all recommendations aimed to decrease language, cultural and gender barriers within both service providers and users are bound to fail. Fear of deportation may abort many of the public health initiatives aimed to prevent HIV and AIDS in migrants. The data does confirm that failure of both primary and secondary HIV prevention is occurring and thus action is needed. Early diagnosis of HIV infection, linked to all rights, should be the way forward for all populations. ",
