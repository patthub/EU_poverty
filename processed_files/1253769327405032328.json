        "B. whereas in some Member States, the EU funds and programmes provided for in the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework (MFF) have not yet been fully implemented; whereas financing for the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery instrument, in particular the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), will only be available after the ratification of Council Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 ( 15 ) by the Member States; C. whereas the EU institutions have on multiple occasions recognised the need for actions addressing and tackling health inequalities and protecting people\u2019s health during the current economic recession ( 16 ); D. whereas the COVID-19 outbreak has reversed the positive trend in the employment rate of the last six years in the EU-27, resulting in a reduction in the number of people in work of about 6,1 million in the second quarter of 2020 and a predicted decrease of 4,5 % over the year 2020 ( 17 ); whereas according to Eurostat, in 2019, before the pandemic, 8,5 % of the EU population aged under 60 years lived in households where the adults had worked less than 20 % of the maximum weekly working hours during the past year and were facing worrying situations of in-work poverty ( 18 ); whereas precarious employment is still a significant concern that negatively affects labour markets; whereas workers who remain employed have faced a considerable reduction in hours worked and, consequently a loss of income, and whereas this development has the biggest impact on workers that belong to vulnerable groups; whereas it is of particular concern that in a forthcoming Eurofound report, the decline in employment headcount in the EU-27 during the first wave of the pandemic is shown to have been associated with a greater outflow to inactivity than to unemployment and a resulting weakening of labour market attachment ( 19 ); E. whereas the average number of hours worked is set to increase faster than headcount employment and employment may also fall further when short-time work schemes are discontinued; whereas the reallocation of workers is usually a lengthy process and employment is therefore expected to decline slightly in 2021; whereas, despite the expected economic rebound next year, the EU unemployment rate is set to rise further from 7,7 % in 2020 to 8,6 % in 2021 and it is expected to decline in 2022 to 8,0 %, with divergences between Members States that will persist ( 20 ); F. whereas investments that can lead to enhanced total factor productivity should be welcomed in the light of the mixed results to date, including the pre-pandemic slow pace of economic recovery and the increase in precarious employment; whereas the ongoing twin transitions, green and digital, will have important, but different, impacts on employment by sector, region and type of worker; whereas that will create new opportunities, as well as significant socio-economic challenges, in many regions and industrial sectors; whereas the EU needs a common strategy to accompany workers and businesses concerned in order to ensure that no one is left behind; whereas the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated those impacts, especially in labour markets trends, and will likely also affect demand for education, training and upskilling; whereas the COVID-19 outbreak caused significant changes in the practices of the labour market, with over a third of EU workers being required to work from home ( 21 ); whereas disconnecting from work should constitute an essential principle allowing workers to refrain from carrying out work-related tasks and engaging in electronic communication outside working hours without facing any repercussions, and thus to enjoy an adequate work-life balance; C 474/102 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Thursday 11 March 2021 ( 15 ) Council Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 of 14 December 2020 on the system of own resources of the European Union and repealing Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom (OJ L 424, 15.12.2020, p. 1).

        "G. whereas before COVID-19, although there were differences between Member States, economic trends were generally described as positive in the European Semester annual reviews; whereas evidence shows that persistent and increasing inequalities remain among persons and between and within states and regions; whereas this leads to multiple divergences that need to be tackled with an intersectional approach in order to ensure equality of opportunities and a life of dignity for all groups; whereas while some regions facing more challenges in decarbonising their industries are to be targeted with financial support, like the Just Transition Fund, others that are too dependent on tourism and related services are not eligible for specific transition funds, despite some of them being the territories with the highest unemployment rates; whereas COVID-19-related support provided to workers and businesses varies greatly among the Member States; whereas global challenges such as digitalisation and the fight against climate change will persist, regardless of the COVID-19 crisis, and require a just transition so as not to leave anyone behind; H. whereas the COVID-19 crisis has led to a worsening of wage inequality around the world, only partly offset by state subsidies and minimum wage policies, leading to severe situations of precariousness and lack of protection; whereas lower paid workers, who are disproportionately women and young people, are the most affected by the socio-economic consequences of the crisis and the consequent rise in inequalities, while the stability of their work-life balance is already being challenged; I. whereas social protection systems vary between Member States and are under severe pressure to mitigate the social impact of the crisis, and ensure decent living conditions for all and access to essential services such as health, education and housing; whereas housing and childcare costs may force households into poverty and whereas it is important to take this into account when measuring in-work poverty and looking to integrate housing costs into standard indicators of social reporting; whereas in 2018, 9,6 % of the EU-27 population lived in households that spent 40 % or more of their equivalised disposable income on housing, although substantial differences between Member States were recorded; whereas in-work poverty in the EU has been increasing since the 2008 economic and financial crisis and it is estimated that 10 % of EU workers are at risk of poverty ( 22 ); J. whereas the youth unemployment rate has increased due to the COVID-19 crisis, reaching 17,1 % in September 2020, and is expected to continue rising; whereas 11,6 % of young people aged between 15 and 24 are not in education, employment or training (NEET) 15 ; whereas the COVID-19 crisis has had an impact on access to education for disadvantaged social groups such as single-parent, low-income and large families, who have struggled to access or afford digital education equipment for their children; whereas increasing inequalities between generations affect the sustainability of our welfare system as well as our democratic health; whereas the economic fallout will have long-term negative effects on youth employment, and whereas young people might find themselves with fewer and/or lower-quality opportunities and poor working conditions; K. whereas women are particularly vulnerable to labour market changes owing to social care duties and uneven distribution of unpaid household and care work, discrimination on grounds of pregnancy and motherhood, occupational segregation and their more precarious employment; whereas an intersectional evaluation shows that women in vulnerable groups, such as young women with children and particularly single mothers, Roma women, women with disabilities or women of migrant origin, are more likely to be in a worse position ( 23 ); 24.11.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 474/103 Thursday 11 March 2021 ( 22 ) Eurostat, 1 in 10 employed persons at risk of poverty in 2018 , European Commission, Luxembourg, 2020, https://ec.europa.eu/ eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20200131-2 ( 23 ) Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men, Opinion on Intersectionality in Gender Equality Laws, Policies and Practices , European Institute for Gender Equality, Vilnius, 2020. ",
        "L. whereas the gender employment gap (11,4 %), gender pay gap (14 %) and gender pension gap (30 %) remain unacceptably high; whereas closing the gender employment gap is a social and economic imperative, due to the implications for women\u2019s lives, including their financial security and quality of life, and its persisting economic costs, which amounted to around EUR 320 billion in 2018 (2,4 % of EU GDP) ( 24 ); whereas improving employment opportunities for women, ensuring equal pay, facilitating a good work-life balance, and adequately accounting for periods spent raising children in retirement pension schemes, including for men, are vital to sustainable social and economic growth and development and long-term fiscal sustainability in the EU; M. whereas people who are marginalised or suffer from social exclusion and poverty are facing particular challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and whereas the labour market changes caused by it have disproportionately affected them; whereas the EU\u2019s Roma population continues to face some of the worst socio-economic indicators, with over 80 % experiencing poverty and social exclusion, only 43 % in paid employment and disproportionately high NEET rates; whereas the Roma have been particularly badly hit by the COVID-19 crisis, not least in terms of access to education and training; N. whereas people with disabilities have faced even more limited access to services due to the pandemic; whereas the digital divide \u2014 including digital poverty, low digital literacy and difficulties with universal design \u2014 increases barriers to social rights for people with disabilities; whereas evidence gathered by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights demonstrated the significant obstacles in access to education faced by children with disabilities ( 25 ); O. whereas unemployment among temporary workers has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic; whereas one in five workers in the EU has a poor-quality job; whereas it is expected that in the next decade, job polarisation and non-standard forms of employment will increase further and there will be more jobs at the higher and lower ends of the skills spectrum ( 26 ); whereas technological change and the use of artificial intelligence might alter the labour market significantly; whereas this might lead to further disparities in earnings; whereas labour demand has consistently been weakest in the middle of the job-wage distribution, most noticeably during the period of recession and employment contraction that ran from 2008 to 2013 ( 27 ); whereas this trend is likely to be further reinforced by the pandemic; whereas low-skilled jobs will always be essential for societies and must come with decent pay and conditions; whereas the labour market faces a rapid shift towards a greener and a more digital environment, creating jobs that require updated competencies, and whereas there is a considerable major need to focus on the training, reskilling and upskilling strategy for employees of all ages; whereas this has to be simultaneously combined with improving working conditions and creating new quality jobs for all; P. whereas sustainable development is a fundamental objective of the European Union and social sustainability is a fundamental prerequisite for fair and inclusive green, digital and demographic transitions; whereas the social market economy is based on two complementary pillars, namely the enforcement of competition and robust social policy measures, which should lead to the achievement of full employment and social progress; whereas the three pillars of sustainable development are the economic, the social and the environmental; whereas sustainable development is based, among other things, on full employment and social progress; whereas this is a fundamental objective of the European Union laid down in Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU); C 474/104 EN Official Journal of the European Union 24.11.2021 Thursday 11 March 2021 ( 24 ) Eurofound, Women and labour market equality: Has COVID-19 rolled back recent gains?

Welcomes the fact that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is also being used to respond to this pandemic, by supporting the restructuring needs of EU companies; notes that the limit on worker dismissals for access to the fund has been reduced to the minimum of 200, and that this EU tool could help to fund personalised support measures, such as tailor-made training courses and re-skilling and up-skilling programmes; calls on the EU institutions involved to be flexible and quickly analyse the activation requests, ensuring that the time needed to mobilise the fund is reduced to a minimum; 47. Stresses that the brain drain phenomenon widens the economic and social development gap within the EU; calls on the Commission to assess brain drains in certain regions and sectors and propose support measures where needed, as well as to support mobile workers by ensuring freedom of movement of workers, without restrictions, and strengthening the portability of rights and entitlements; asks the Commission to put forward a proposal for a digital EU social security number; 48. Notes the need to provide specific support for the media sector, which plays a key role in our democracies, in a way that respects and promotes media freedom and pluralism at a time when the online environment is increasingly dominated by a few large players, with increasing market power and mobile tax bases, sometimes hampering the ability of many smaller EU companies to start up and scale up across the single market, as highlighted in the Commission communication on the EU Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy 2021 ( 36 ); draws the attention of the Member States to the specific measures set out in the Commission Media Action Plan unveiled on 3 December 2020 to help the broadcasting, news publishing and cinema sectors to recover from the big loss in advertising revenues experienced due to the lockdown imposed by the pandemic and to boost their production and distribution of digital content; 49. Points out that fairness conditions should be considered for companies that wish to access public funds and support in order to avoid such support going to companies based in a jurisdiction referred to in Annex I to the Council conclusions on the revised EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes ( 37 ), and points out that they should not subvert collective bargaining, workers\u2019 participation or co-determination in company decision-making processes in accordance with national law and practice, and should be conditional on maintaining the same level of working and employment conditions and rights, including protection against dismissals and reductions in wages, with no bonuses or dividends paid to managers or shareholders respectively; 50. Stresses that the assessment of the rule of law and the effectiveness of the justice system should thus continue to be included in the European Semester; o o o 51. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
