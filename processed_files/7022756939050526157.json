        "15.3.2011 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion I /9 A. INTRODUCTION AND FINANCING OF THE GENERAL BUDGET INTRODUCTION The general budget of the European Union is the instrument which sets out and authorises the total amount of revenue and expenditure deemed necessary for the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community for each year. The budget is established and implemented in compliance with the principles of unity, budgetary accuracy, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, universality, specification, sound financial management and transparency. \u2014 The principle of unity and the principle of budgetary accuracy mean that all revenue and expenditure of the Union when it is charged to the budget must be incorporated in a single document. \u2014 The principle of annuality means that the budget is adopted for one budgetary year at a time and that both commitment and payment appro\u00ad priations for the current budgetary year must, in principle, be used in the course of the year. \u2014 The principle of equilibrium means that forecasts of revenue for the budgetary year must be equal to payment appropriations for that year: borrowing to cover any budget deficit which may arise is not compatible with the own resources system and will not be authorised. \u2014 In accordance with the principle of unit of account , the budget is drawn up and implemented in euros and the accounts shall be presented in euros. \u2014 The principle of universality means that total revenue is to cover total payment appropriations with the exception of a limited number of rev\u00ad enue items which are assigned to particular items of expenditure. Revenue and expenditure are entered in full in the budget without any adjust\u00ad ment against each other. \u2014 The principle of specification means that each appropriation must have a given purpose and be assigned to a specific objective in order to pre\u00ad vent any confusion between appropriations. \u2014 The principle of sound financial management is defined by reference to the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. \u2014 The budget is established in compliance with the principle of transparency , ensuring sound information on the implementation of the budget and the accounts. The budget presents appropriations and resources by purpose (activity-based budgeting), with a view to enhancing transparency in the manage\u00ad ment of the budget with reference to the objectives of sound financial management and in particular efficiency and effectiveness. The expenditure authorised by the present budget totals EUR 141 909 398 849 in commitment appropriations and EUR 126 527 133 762 in payment appropriations, representing a growth rate of 0,25 % and of 2,90 % respectively by comparison with the 2010 budget. Budgetary revenue totals EUR 126 527 133 762. The uniform rate of call for the VAT resource is 0,30 % (except for Austria, Germany, the Neth\u00ad erlands and Sweden for which the rate of call has been fixed at 0,225 %, 0,15 %, 0,10 % and 0,10 % respectively) whilst that for the GNI resource is 0,7538 %. Traditional own resources (customs duties and sugar levies) account for 13,26 % of the financing of the budget for 2011. The VAT resource accounts for 10,90 % and the GNI resource for 74,72 %. Other revenue for this financial year is estimated at EUR 1 421 368 232. The own resources needed to finance the 2011 budget account for 1,00 % of the total GNI, thus falling below the ceiling of 1,23 % of GNI cal\u00ad culated using the method set out in Article 3(1) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Com\u00ad munities\u2019 own resources (OJ L 163, 23.6.2007, p. 17).
