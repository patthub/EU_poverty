        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 7 Preface In February 2013, the European Commission adopted a Recommendation on Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage 1 as a key element of its Social Investment Package 2 . This Recommendation, which was subsequently endorsed by the EU Council of Ministers (July 2013), sets out a common European Framework for tackling child poverty and social exclusion and promoting child well-being. It aims to help Member States \u201cstrengthen synergies across relevant policy areas\u201d as well as \u201creview their policies and learn from each other\u2019s experiences in improving policy efficiency and effectiveness through innovative approaches, whilst taking into account the different situations and needs at local, regional and national level\u201d. It also encourages the use of financial instruments, especially the Structural Funds, to promote social inclusion and combat poverty. In particular, it sets out guidelines for Member States to \u201corganise and implement policies to address child poverty and social exclusion, promoting children\u2019s well-being, through multi-dimensional strategies\u201d. In April 2017, after an extensive consultation process, the European Commission launched a European Pillar of Social Rights 3 . The Pillar is a key step forward to achieve European Commission President Juncker\u2019s objective of building a fairer Europe and strengthening its social dimension so as to create a \u201ctriple-A\u201d Social Europe. One of the 20 key principles and rights outlined in the Pillar relates to childcare and support to children. It states that \u201cChildren have the right to affordable early childhood education and care of good quality. Children have the right to protection from poverty. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds have the right to specific measures to enhance equal opportunities.\u201d One of the accompanying documents to the Pillar is a Staff Working Document (SWD) on the implementation of the Recommendation on Investing in children 4 . The SWD is a first step in a stocktaking mid-term Review of the implementation of the Recommendation since 2013. In order to deepen this stocktaking and to identify key ways forward for implementing the Recommendation the Commission asked the European Social Policy Network (ESPN) to prepare country reports and an overall Synthesis Report on the implementation of the Recommendation since its adoption in 2013. The reports are also intended to help the Commission and Member States in setting priorities for implementing the principles in relation to children in the Pillar of Social Rights and to inform the discussion on establishing a European Child Guarantee . In preparing their national reports, ESPN experts were asked to build on the findings of the 2014 reports prepared by the European Network of Independent Experts on Social Exclusion 5 . In their reports, the ESPN experts: \u2022 briefly describe the overall situation with regard to child poverty and social exclusion in their countries; \u2022 assess the policy framework in their countries for tackling child poverty and social exclusion and promoting child well-being and highlight any changes since 2013; 1 The Commission Recommendation on Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage is available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:059:0005:0016:EN:PDF. 2 For more information on the Commission\u2019s Social Investment Package , see: http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId=1044&newsId=1807&furtherNews=yes. 3 The Commission Recommendation establishing the European Pillar of Social Rights is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/commission-recommendation-establishing-european-pillar- social-rights_en. 4 European Commission (2017), Taking stock of the 2013 Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u201d , Commission Staff Working Document, SWD (2017) 258 final, Brussels: European Commission.

To assist ESPN experts in making their assessments, key data on the trends in poverty and social exclusion and child-specific material deprivation were compiled centrally by the ESPN Core Team (see Annex 1 6 ) and the European Commission provided data on the absorption and spending of EU Funds (Annex 2). This Synthesis Report brings together the findings of the national reports written by each of the 35 ESPN Country Teams of independent experts 7 and makes recommendations for the next phase of the implementation of the Recommendation in the light of the European Pillar of Social Rights \u2019 principles in relation to children. It was prepared by Hugh Frazer and Eric Marlier of the ESPN\u2019s Management Team 8 , with helpful comments and suggestions from the ESPN Country Teams and from colleagues in the ESPN Core Team 9 as well as from the European Commission 10 . In producing a Synthesis Report, it is only possible to illustrate points made with a limited number of examples. However, where we find that a similar point is made by other experts and we think this would be useful we indicate this in a bracket listing the relevant countries so that readers can examine the individual country reports for more information. In producing their reports, experts cite many different sources in support of their analysis. References to these sources are not included in this Synthesis Report. Readers wishing to follow up the original sources are again invited to consult the individual experts\u2019 reports. 6 This annex was prepared for the ESPN national experts by Anne-Catherine Guio (member of the ESPN Core Team). 7 The ESPN covers 35 countries: the 28 EU Member States as well as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland and Turkey. For a presentation of the ESPN Core Team and its 35 Country Teams, see Annex 6. 8 Hugh Frazer is from Maynooth University (Ireland) and Eric Marlier from the Luxembourg Institute of Socio- Economic Research (LISER). 9 Particular thanks are due to Sebastiano Sabato, Slavina Spasova and Bart Vanhercke of the European Social Observatory. 10 For all the comments and suggestions received, the usual disclaimer applies.

        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 9 Summary This Synthesis Report examines the extent to which 35 European countries (28 Member States and seven other countries) have strengthened or further developed their policies/ approaches and programmes for children since 2013 in ways that are consistent with the EU Recommendation on Investing in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage . The overall finding of the ESPN analysis is that the modest progress made in the direction outlined in the Recommendation is insufficient to the scale of the problem in many countries. Four countries in particular (EE, FR, IE, MT 11 ) have taken initiatives to strengthen their policies/approaches and programmes in a significant number of areas. Another eight countries (BG, IS, LT, LV, NL, PT, SI, SK) have also made improvements that are in line with the Recommendation in several areas. The countries that already had strong policies and programmes and low levels of child poverty or social exclusion have largely maintained these. However, it is clear that very limited progress has been made in most areas in too many of the countries with high or very high levels of child poverty or social exclusion (CY, EL, ES, HR, HU, IT, MK, RO, RS, TR, UK) and indeed some of these have actually weakened their approach in several areas. This is particularly concerning given the persistently high levels of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU (26.9% in 2015) and the very wide divergence between countries: 10 countries studied have low proportions (14-20%) of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE 12 ) whereas, at the other end of the scale, seven have very high proportions (36-58%). After setting the overall context on child poverty and social exclusion the report starts by looking at the approach to governance in the 35 countries analysed by ESPN experts. Encouragingly, improvements have been made to strengthen integrated multi- dimensional approaches in some ten countries. On other aspects of governance mainstreaming children\u2019s rights in policy making has been strengthened in six countries; the evidence basis for policy making in nine and the involvement of stakeholders in seven. In relation to Pillar 1 of the Recommendation (Access to Resources) there have been significant efforts to encourage parents\u2019 participation in the labour market since 2013 in nearly a third of countries in particular in relation to three areas: increased activation measures, measures to reconcile work and family life (e.g. parental leave and flexible working) and improved childcare provision. As regards child and family income support provision has been strengthened in some fourteen countries but has weakened in eight. In relation to Pillar 2 (Access to affordable quality services) the picture is uneven. Much more progress has been made in strengthening early childhood education and care (ECEC) provision than other areas, with progress in 18 of the 35 countries studied. Nine countries have improved their policies in relation to family support and alternative care, eight in the area of education, and only three in health. In housing and living environment, policies actually weakened in seven countries and were only strengthened in two. 11 Countries\u2019 official abbreviations are as follows: AT (Austria ), BE (Belgium), BG (Bulgaria), CH (Switzerland), CY (Cyprus), CZ (Czech Republic), DE (Germany), DK (Denmark), EE (Estonia), EL (Greece), ES (Spain), FI (Finland), FR (France), HR (Croatia), HU (Hungary), IE (Ireland), IS (Iceland), IT (Italy), LI (Liechtenstein), LT (Lithuania), LU (Luxembourg), LV (Latvia), MK (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), MT (Malta), NL (The Netherlands), NO (Norway), PL (Poland), PT (Portugal), RO (Romania), RS (Serbia), SE (Sweden), SI (Slovenia), SK (Slovakia), TR (Turkey), UK (United Kingdom). See also Annex 3. 12 People (whether adults or children) at risk of poverty or social exclusion are people living in households which are income poor (i.e. households \u201cat risk of poverty\u201d in EU jargon) and/or severely materially deprived (i.e. households suffering from at least four deprivations out of list of nine) and/or (quasi-)jobless (i.e. households where no one works or where the work intensity is very low). For the full definition of these indicators, see: Social Protection Committee (2015), Portfolio of EU Social Indicators for the monitoring of progress towards the EU objectives for social protection and social inclusion 2015 Update , Brussels: European Commission (document available at: http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=14239&langId=en).

        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 10 In relation to Pillar 3 (Children\u2019s right to participate) seven countries have strengthened their policies related to play, recreation, sport and cultural activities. Some nine countries have strengthened their policies and practices regarding children\u2019s participation in decision making. As regards the extent to which child poverty and social exclusion have been addressed in the European Semester the approach has been strengthened in only six Member States while it has weakened in three others. A more encouraging picture is evident in relation to the use of EU financial instruments to support the social inclusion of children with efforts being strengthened to varying degrees in 12 out of the 28 EU Member States. However, there has been little change in many countries and even where there has been some strengthening of the use of funds to benefit children it is often not to as great extent as would have been needed. One of the main concerns in the use of EU Funds to support children is that often the approach has been too piecemeal and not organised in a strategic, planned and sustainable manner linked to national policies and programmes. It is clear from the findings of the report that if the 2013 Recommendation is to have the desired impact on reducing child poverty and social exclusion and improving child well- being, that a significant intensification of effort will be required. Thus a series of overall recommendations are made for strengthening the implementation and linking it to the European Pillar on Social Rights . These cover: making the implementation of the Recommendation a high and visible political priority; developing a roadmap for implementation; ensuring rigorous monitoring and reporting; better integrating the Recommendation\u2019s implementation in the European Semester; mainstreaming and monitoring the well-being of children in all relevant EU initiatives; linking with the implementation of relevant international level processes (UN Sustainable Development Goals and UN Convention on the Rights of the Child); enhancing civil dialogue; making more effective use of EU financial instruments; intensifying exchange and learning; and raising public and political awareness. As regards the next steps that individual countries need to make to implement the Recommendation ESPN experts propose a wide range of actions. Four areas recur frequently: developing more comprehensive, strategic and coordinated approaches including mainstreaming children\u2019s rights in national policy making; better targeting of high risk groups such as Roma and immigrant children; increasing the accessibility and quality of ECEC services; and addressing inequalities and access issues in schools.

        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 11 1. Overall situation regarding child poverty and social exclusion This section sketches the context for considering the implementation of the Recommendation on Investing in children by briefly outlining the overall situation in relation to poverty and social exclusion of children (including child-specific material deprivation) across the EU and some other countries covered by the ESPN. It also highlights some key trends since the Recommendation was adopted in 2013. Detailed data per country can be found in Annex 1 (Statistical Annex). In 2015, the latest available data at present, the proportion of children \u201cat risk of poverty or social exclusion\u201d (\u201cAROPE\u201d, see definition above) varies a lot across countries \u2013 from around 15% (NO, SE, IS, FI, DK) to more than 40% (RS, BG, MK, RO, TR). The EU weighted average is 26.9% and the Euro-Area weighted average 25.4%. Table 1.1 distinguishes between four main groups of countries according to the share of their AROPE population: low, medium, high and very high AROPE countries. Grouping countries with similar characteristics is helpful as it allows comparisons of countries that are mostly in similar situations. Yet, we want to highlight that what we present in this table is only one possible grouping. We have opted for a grouping based on AROPE in view of its strategic importance in the social inclusion dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy (see below). However, even if this cannot be done in the context of this Synthesis Report, we want to stress that it is important to look at a range of different indicators to properly assess the actual living conditions of children and their families in their multi-dimensional aspects, and thus also to better understand the impact of the economic and financial crisis on their situation. It is clear from the ESPN experts\u2019 reports and other reports 13 that the crisis had a severe impact on the situation of children as their parents and other family members became worse off with regard to jobs, income etc. However, as the median income fell in many countries this was not always fully caught by the income poverty indicator included in the AROPE indicator \u2013 hence the need to complement the analysis of AROPE with other relevant EU social indicators (see Social Protection Committee (2015), op. cit. ) as well as child-specific material deprivation measures (see below) and more qualitative information to paint the full picture.

The social and economic future of countries depends to a great degree on their capacity to fight child poverty and social exclusion and improve child well-being. Yet, as can be seen from Figure 1.1, in most countries children are in fact (much) more at risk of 13 See, for instance: Save the Children (2016), Ending Educational and Child Poverty in Europe , Brussels: Save the Children.

Only in eight countries are they less at risk than the total population (HR, NO, DE, EE, FI, DK, SE, SI; differences between -2.6 and -0.9 percentage points [pp]). In four countries, the risk is similar for children and the entire population (RS, LV, NL, CY; differences between 0 and 0.5 pp). In the remaining 22 countries for which data are available, differences vary between 0.9 and 2.8 pp (in 6 countries), between 3 and 4.8 pp (9 countries) or between 5.8 and 9.4 (7 countries). At EU-28 level (weighted average), the difference is +3.2 pp, with 26.9% children at risk of poverty or social exclusion versus 23.7% for the whole population. For the Euro-Area (weighted average), it is 2.3 pp (25.4% vs 23.1%).

Source: Eurostat web-database, EU-SILC (extracted 24 March 2017). To complement the picture provided by Figure 1.1 it is useful to look at the indicator on child-specific material deprivation developed by Guio et al. 14 (see Figure 1.2). According to this indicator, a child is materially deprived if he/she lacks at least three out of 17 items (the lack is \u201cenforced\u201d, i.e. does not reflect a choice). These items include: \u2022 12 children items: Some new (not second-hand) clothes; Two pairs of properly fitting shoes; Fresh fruits and vegetables daily; Meat, chicken, fish or vegetarian 14 The original list, based on the analysis of the 2009 EU-SILC ad hoc module on material deprivation by Guio et al. (2012), consisted of 18 items. These items were collected again in after the economic and financial crisis, in the 2014 EU-SILC module. Further analysis by Guio et al. (2017/forthcoming) of the 2014 module confirmed the selection proposed by Guio et al. 2012, with the exception of one item which had some reliability problems.

When they adopted the Europe 2020 strategy, in June 2010, EU Heads of State and Government endorsed five Headline Targets for the EU as a whole. One of them consists of \u201cpromoting social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty, by aiming to lift at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and exclusion\u201d (Conclusions of 10 June 2010 European Council).

        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 15 Source: Eurostat web-database, EU-SILC (extracted 24 March 2017). The Europe 2020 strategy does not include an EU social inclusion target specifically focused on the situation of children even if some EU countries have adopted such targets at the (sub-)national level. Yet, it is worth looking at the agreed EU social inclusion target from a child perspective. This is what Figure 1.3b does by replicating Figure 1.3a and assuming that exactly the same effort would be made for children \u2013 i.e., a decrease by 17.2% of the number of AROPE children over the period 2010-2020 (2008-2018 survey years). This means going from 25.1 million down to 20.8 million. Of course, in view of the urgent need to invest more in children and also because children are largely overrepresented in the AROPE group as we saw above, this strictly proportional effort should not be considered sufficient. However, this trend already provides a useful starting basis for reflecting on the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on Investing in children . Figure 1.3b: Trends in number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE), Children, thousands, 2008-2015, European Union Note and Source: See Figure 1.3a. AROPE figures for children in 2015 (25.2 million) are almost identical to those of 2008 (25.1 million). When the Recommendation was launched in 2013 (the latest comparable data available on child poverty and social exclusion were from 2011), the figure was slightly higher (25.5 million). The peak during that period was in 2012, with 26.1 million, the height of the impact of the economic and financial crisis. Looking now at the three AROPE components, we see a slight increase in relative income poverty (2008 and 2011: 19.3 million; 2015: 19.7). (Quasi-)joblessness has increased significantly between 2008 (7.3 million) and 2015 (8.6 million, a figure identical to that observed in 2011). By contrast, the proportion of severely deprived children has slightly decreased: from 9.3 in 2008 (almost identical to the 2011 figure: 9.4) to 8.9 in 2015; in 2012 it had jumped to 11 million. It is worth emphasising that the sum of the three components of AROPE (relative income poverty, severe deprivation and (quasi-)joblessness) for a given year is higher than the AROPE number that year. This is due to the fact that a number of people at risk combine two or even all three forms of exclusion considered in this aggregate indicator. For ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 16 instance, in 2015, the 26.9% of AROPE children consist of 16.8% of children suffering from \u201conly\u201d one form of exclusion (62.5% of all AROPE children), 7.4% two (27.5%) and 2.7% all three (10%). Here again, the situation is worse among children as for the whole population the 23.7% of AROPE people consist of 16.1% of people suffering from \u201conly\u201d one form of exclusion (67.9% of all AROPE children), 5.8% two (24.5%) and 1.8% all three (7.6%). The main message from the available data (see also Annex 1) is that AROPE levels for children across the EU and beyond continue to be at unacceptably high levels and that progress towards the Europe 2020 target on reducing poverty and social exclusion, and especially the proportion that should be achieved by reducing the number of children AROPE, is quite inadequate. The more detailed analysis of the situation in the individual country reports prepared by ESPN experts reinforces this overall picture. These reports also highlight the very high levels of poverty and social exclusion among children in lone parent households and the particularly severe risk faced by some groups of children, especially Roma children, refugee and asylum-seeking children, and children with a disability. 2 Assessment of overall approach and governance This section provides an overview of the ESPN national experts\u2019 assessment of the extent to which countries have made efforts since 2013 to enhance their policy frameworks and approaches to tackling child poverty and social exclusion and promoting child well-being in ways that are in line with the Recommendation on Investing in children (see Summary Table in Annex 4 17 ). In particular, it examines progress made by countries on four issues: the development of an integrated and multi-dimensional approach to promoting the social inclusion of children; the fostering of a children\u2019s rights approach and effective mainstreaming of children\u2019s policy and rights 18 ; an evidence-based approach; and the involvement of relevant stakeholders, including children. 2.1 Integrated multi-dimensional approach Encouragingly, compared with the situation in 2013, ESPN experts identify improvements to strengthen integrated multi-dimensional approaches 19 in some ten countries. This was most evident amongst countries in the medium (BE, EE, FR, SK) and high (IE, MT, PT) \u201cAROPE groups\u201d suggested in Table 1.1. However, two low AROPE countries (CH, NL) and just one very high (RO) AROPE country also made improvements. There was, not surprisingly, little change in approach in most of the low AROPE countries which already tend to have quite comprehensive systems 20 . Also there was little change in some of the medium AROPE countries (AT, LU, PL). However, it is particularly concerning that many of the high (CY, ES, HR, IT, LT, LV) and almost all of the very high (BG, EL, HU, MK, TR) AROPE countries did not move towards a more integrated and multi-dimensional 17 Throughout this report when the approaches or policies of countries are assessed as having strengthened or having changed little or having weakened, these assessments are the ESPN experts\u2019 assessments which are summarised in Annex 4. In some categories there may be an example of a positive initiative in a country highlighted even if the expert\u2019s assessment for that category is that overall there has been little change or that the situation has weakened. 18 It is important to highlight that \u201cchildren mainstreaming involves viewing social inclusion from a child\u2019s perspective and implies integrating a concern with the well-being and social inclusion of children into all areas of policy making\u201d. (Marlier, E., Atkinson, A.B., Cantillon, B. and Nolan, B. (2007), The EU and social inclusion: Facing the challenges , Bristol: The Policy Press, p. 11). 19 The EU Recommendation on Investing in children has as its first horizontal principle \u201cTackle child poverty and social exclusion through integrated strategies that go beyond ensuring children\u2019s material security and promote equal opportunities so that all children can realise their full potential\u201d. The key elements of integrated multi- dimensional strategies are outlined in Frazer and Marlier (2014, op. cit. ), p. 29. 20 See Frazer and Marlier (2014, op. cit. ) for a comparative overview of Member States\u2019 approaches to tackling poverty and social exclusion.

        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 17 approach; one high AROPE country (UK) and one very high AROPE country (RS) actually moved backwards in this regard. Positive developments include the following: \u2022 In Belgium, a new inter-federal action plan for fighting child poverty in consultation with the federated entities is being planned. At regional level the Flemish action plan against poverty puts the emphasis on the prevention as well as the fight against child poverty. In the Brussels Capital Region, the Flemish Community Commission has adopted a plan against child poverty 2016-2020 while the French Community Commission (COCOF) approved a draft decree aiming at creating new places for childcare and at making care facilities accessible to children of vulnerable households. In the action plan against poverty of the Walloon Region, an emphasis is placed on single-parent households. \u2022 In France, efforts have been made to develop a more integrated and multi- dimensional strategy to facilitate synergies between relevant policy areas, stakeholders and actors (education, justice, family services, child protection). For instance, a new national body has been put in place to facilitate governance and provide advice in the sectors of family, childhood and ageing and a new Conseil National de la Protection de l\u2019Enfance ( National Council for Child Protection ) has been set up to officially advise the Prime minister and guarantee better coordination of actors and equal treatment of cases irrespective of the territory. \u2022 In Ireland, a National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020 ( Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures ) has been developed. It provides the roadmap for action in regard to children\u2019s well-being and includes the specification of a child poverty target of lifting over 70,000 children out of \u201cconsistent poverty\u201d 21 by 2020. The approach is broad-reaching. For example, the child poverty target is to be achieved by measures to improve parental employment and to reduce the number of jobless households while increasing investment in evidence-based ECEC services. \u2022 In the Netherlands, anti-poverty policies have increasingly focused on the position of children. In the autumn of 2016, the cabinet allocated an annual amount of \u20ac100 million for the fight against child poverty for the period to come with \u20ac85 million of this being allocated to municipalities for the provision of in-kind facilities. In delivering this increased cooperation is being encouraged between municipalities and civil society organisations and between municipal departments. Administrative agreements have been made between the government and the representative body for Dutch municipalities. \u2022 In Romania, some positive developments in setting up a coherent strategic framework can be observed since 2013. A series of national strategies with direct and indirect impact on children\u2019s welfare have been adopted, creating a broader and more coherent framework for approaching social objectives. However, only few of these strategies were supplemented by operational plans (e.g. the National Strategy for Combating Poverty and Promoting Social Inclusion and the National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children\u2019s Rights ) and even less were accompanied by the creation of institutional structures to support these plans. \u2022 In Slovakia, the National Action Plan for Children 2014-2017 has led to a more integrated multi-dimensional strategy and to synergies between various policy areas and subjects. \u2022 In Switzerland, there is a growing concern with the situation of children in many policy areas such as family law, migration policy or childcare services. However, the development of coordinated efforts and a long-term strategy is more likely at 21 Consistent poverty combines relative income poverty with relative deprivation. People living in households whose income falls below the relative income poverty line and who are also experiencing deprivation are regarded as living in consistent poverty. ",

There was generally little change in approach in the countries with low AROPE levels as they tend to be already relatively strong in this regard. However, there has been some improvement in Iceland. Since 2013 a stronger focus on children\u2019s rights is most evident amongst the medium (EE, FR, SK) and high (IE, LT, PT) AROPE countries. However, overall there was little change in approach in the majority of medium (AT, BE, LU, PL) and high (CY, ES, HR, IT, LV, MT) AROPE countries and in all but one of the countries in the very high AROPE group (sole exception RS, where there has been a weakening). One high (UK) AROPE country and one very high (RS) AROPE country actually moved backwards in this regard. Examples of positive developments: \u2022 In Estonia, a children\u2019s rights approach is increasingly adopted in updating and implementing policies. For example, such an approach is central in the new Child Protection Act adopted in 2016 and the Green Paper of Alternative Care (2014). \u2022 In Iceland, the children\u2019s rights approach has been expanded since 2013 and efforts have been made to increase participation of children, in line with the UN charter of children\u2019s rights. \u2022 In Ireland, targeted child policy has been located within a universal, rights- oriented approach. Hence the last few years have seen legislation to expressly recognise children as rights holders under the Constitution; improve child protection measures; reform family law to address the situation of children in diverse households; ensure that, from 16 years of age, the preferred gender of a person will be recognised by the state for all purposes. \u2022 In Lithuania, in 2017, during a special session devoted to protection of children\u2019s rights, the Lithuanian Parliament banned all forms of violence against children, including corporal punishment. \u2022 In Portugal, in 2015, within the scope of the strengthening of the role of the National Commission for Child Protection, it was decided that a Multiannual Plan for the Promotion and Protection of Children\u2019s Rights would be produced. The first of these plans is expected to become in place by the end of June 2017. \u2022 In Slovakia, the institutional infrastructure related to monitoring children\u2019s rights has been enriched by the Commissioner for Children and the National Coordination Centre for Action on Violence against Children. These two bodies are expected to contribute to the work of other institutions to ensure effective mainstreaming of children\u2019s policies and rights. 2.3 Evidence-based approach Some nine countries have taken steps since 2013 to strengthen the evidence-based approach to their policy making in relation to child well-being. This is most evident amongst the countries with low AROPE levels where the approach has been strengthened in four countries (DK, IS, NL, SI) and amongst the medium AROPE countries where three (EE, PL, SK) have strengthened their approach. However, worryingly only one (IE) high AROPE country and one (RO) very high AROPE country have strengthened their approach. The evidence based approach has weakened in one high (UK) and two very high (BG, HU) countries. ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 19 Examples of positive developments: \u2022 In Denmark, the trend towards more evidence-based policy-making continues. Concretely, this means that the Ministries and their National Boards finance collect and disseminate information about good practice through meta-reviews, pilot projects and evaluations. \u2022 In Estonia, the development of policies is increasingly evidence-based; analyses, researches and consultations with experts are employed in the process. Also, the impact of planned and implemented policies and measures are increasingly being analysed. \u2022 In Poland, the evidence-based approach has improved. The national statistical office added the topic \u201cChildren and family\u201d to its thematic areas. It is regularly updated and fed with various publications. \u2022 In Slovenia, the Social Protection Institute of the Republic of Slovenia is monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the strategic documents and policies related to child well-being, as well as analysing various aspects of the position of children. Its unit, the Child Observatory, monitors the situation of children in Slovenia. An on-line database focused on children has been developed to serve that purpose. 2.4 Involvement of relevant stakeholders The involvement of relevant stakeholders in policy making has seen improvements in seven countries: two low (IS, NL), two medium (EE, SK) and three high (CY, HR, LT) AROPE countries. However, the majority of countries in each of these categories have seen little change since 2013 and involvement has weakened in one country (UK). In the very high AROPE group there has been little change in all the countries except one (HU) where involvement has in fact weakened. Examples of positive developments: \u2022 In Cyprus, there have been efforts to improve the involvement of all relevant stakeholders in decision-making (e.g. the National Reform Programme is concluded after social partners and other stakeholders are consulted). There are several bodies whose competence is to represent children\u2019s views, including the Children\u2019s Parliament, the Commissioner\u2019s Youth Advisory Team and the Pancyprian Coordinating Committee for the Protection and Welfare of Children. \u2022 In Estonia, the policy improvement and implementation process has increasingly involved relevant stakeholders, who are engaged in the process through consultations and working groups. \u2022 In the Netherlands, the Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG) and five civil society organisations have been involved in the process of policy elaboration; the cooperation is laid down in Administrative Agreements (between the government and the VNG); and the five organisations have described the contours of their contributions. Children are also involved in the policy process. In ten primary schools, the State Secretary will discuss with the children (up to 12 years) how to best spend the additional budget (100 million) for child poverty reduction. Something similar is organised for older children. ",

In all other countries there has been little change. Positive developments in this area include the following: \u2022 increased expenditure on active labour market policies (CZ) and an increase in activation measures for parents, particularly women, and especially single parents (LU, MK, UK); \u2022 reforms in parental leave arrangements to support reconciliation of work and family life (ES, IE, IS, IT, LU, PL, PT, SI, UK) and encouraging more flexible working time arrangements (PT); \u2022 improved right to work part-time for family reasons (SI); \u2022 changes to parental benefit system to support better reconciliation of family and work responsibilities (CZ, EE, IE, PT); \u2022 increase in the number and affordability of childcare places (AT, EL, HU, LU, MT, UK); \u2022 breakfast clubs service in schools and provision of after school and summer school services (MT); \u2022 extended vouchers to purchase babysitting services to mothers who are self- employed or entrepreneurs (IT); \u2022 initiatives to address the gender pay gap such as compiling a regulation setting out an obligation on employers to collect gender-based data on working conditions (EE); \u2022 introduction of a scheme to help people in unemployed households with children return to work by allowing them to retain a greater proportion of their child- related benefits for two years upon taking up employment (IE); \u2022 reduction of previous salary cuts on public administration\u2019s salaries and increase in minimum wage to tackle in-work poverty (PT); \u2022 tax reductions for employers of mothers with 3 or more children (HU); \u2022 employment subsidy programmes, grants and loans for self-employment for parents (MK). 22 See Bouget, D., Frazer, H., Marlier, E., Sabato, S. and Vanhercke, B.

Overall provision has been strengthened in fourteen countries (three low [CZ, NL, SI], five medium [BE, EE, FR, LU, PL], four high [IT, LT, LV, MT] and two very high [MK, RO] AROPE countries) and it has weakened in eight countries (three low [DK, FI, IS], one medium [AT], three high [CY, ES, UK] and one very high [HU] AROPE countries). Norway has strengthened some aspects and weakened others. In the remaining countries, ESPN national experts\u2019 assessment is that there has been little change. Examples of positive developments: \u2022 improvements in child and family income support, often after a period of stagnation or decline during the economic and financial crisis (BE, EE, FR, IE, LT, LU, LV, MK, NO [just for non-employed mothers], PL, PT, RO, SI); \u2022 increased tax reliefs to households with children (CZ, LT, HU, IT); \u2022 improvements in maintenance/income support to single parents (EE, FR, LU); \u2022 provision of a children\u2019s package to low-income households consisting of the absolute essentials a child needs (e.g. vouchers for clothing) supplemented by things to help the child engage in society (NL); \u2022 social tickets for (ante)preschool attendance to low-income parents to cover food and/or clothing costs for children (RO); \u2022 introduction of a rent subsidy (LU); \u2022 tapering withdrawal of benefits for single parents entering employment (MT); \u2022 introduction of an in-work benefit scheme to care for low-earning couples and single parents (MT); \u2022 introduction/extension of free or discounted meals in cr\u00e8ches, kindergartens and in primary schools to children from low-income households or households with 3 or more children (HU), and funding for healthy meals for impoverished children (BE); \u2022 increased payments in relation to new-born children: o increase in the lump-sum payment upon birth (LT, NO); o introduction of a once-off grant in case of giving birth to a child with disabilities (PL); o bonus in favour of new born or adopted child, doubled for low-income households and a one-off bonus to low-income households with four or more children to contribute to the costs of raising children (IT).

It examines the areas of early childhood education and care, education, health, housing and living environment, and family support and alternative care. Interestingly, the analysis by ESPN national experts shows that far more progress has been made in ECEC than in any other of the policy areas with progress in over half of the countries. In relation to housing and the living environment the situation has weakened in seven countries whereas it has been strengthened in only three. 4.1 Early childhood education and care 23 The policy area in which the greatest progress has been made since 2013 seems to have been ECEC. This is evident across all four AROPE groups of countries: three of the low AROPE countries (CH, NL, NO [and to a lesser extent CZ]), six of the medium AROPE countries (AT, BE, EE, FR, LU, PL), half of the high AROPE countries (IE, LV, MT, PT, UK) and four of the very high AROPE countries (BG, HU, MK, TR) have strengthened their policies. Amongst those countries where there has been little change many of the low and medium AROPE countries already have quite well-developed policies in this area. According to the ESPN experts, there are no countries where ECEC policies have weakened since 2013. Examples of positive developments: \u2022 increases in childcare and/or kindergartens and/or preschool places (AT, BE, EE, FR, HU, IE, IT, LU, LV, NL, PL, PT, TR), improvements in quality of ECEC provision (AT, BE, HU, IE, NL, PT) and improved focus on access and support for low- income/disadvantaged households (BE, FI, IE, LU, PT, UK); \u2022 initiatives to reduce costs and/or increase provision of free places in childcare (CH, MT) and pre-school (NO, UK) or provide tax exemption for childcare costs (UK); \u2022 increased places in private child minding in enterprises, associations and private homes (FR, LV, MK); \u2022 development of bridges between childcare centres and preschools to facilitate this transition (FR). 4.2 Education In education, just eight countries have strengthened their policies and/or approaches since 2013: two low (DK, SI [and to some extent CZ]), two medium (AT, FR), three high (CY, IT, MT) and one very high (BG) AROPE countries. However, approaches have weakened in five countries (FI, PL, PT, HU and RO). In the vast majority of countries, the situation has remained broadly unchanged. Examples of positive developments: \u2022 reform of public school system to better challenge all students to reach their full potential, reduce the adverse impact of socio-economic background, and increase the well-being of pupils (DK); \u2022 adoption of a new decree on education of pupils with special educational needs which specified the implementation measures aiming to include disadvantaged pupils into mainstream education (CZ); 23 See ESPN Synthesis Report by Bouget et al.

Example of negative development: \u2022 In Poland, compulsory general education will be shorter, and tracking to general or vocational education secondary schools will take place earlier. These changes are likely to have an impact on the inequality of outcomes, on costs and on the situation of teachers. 24 4.3 Health There has been very little change in relation to access to quality health services in most countries since 2013. Only three countries have strengthened access to health services for children in this period: one low (IS), one high (PT) and one very high (BG) AROPE countries. In two countries (CY, RO) services have become weaker. Examples of positive developments: \u2022 In Bulgaria, a steady downward trend was recorded in mortality of children under 1 year of age from 2013. While child mortality continues to be two times higher than the average EU indicators, positive developments are in place. In 2015, the scope of the basic package for new-borns and pregnant women at risk has been expanded by including additional tests from the National Health Insurance Fund. \u2022 In Iceland, public subsidies of the cost of dental services for children have been significantly increased in the last few years. \u2022 In Portugal, a 2016 Order (201/2016) has relaunched the National Network of Integrated Continuous Care whose aims include the prioritisation of paediatric care and the implementation of a network of continued paediatric care. 24 See ESPN Flash Report 2017/38 on \u201cChanges in the education system in Poland\u201d which can be downloaded from the ESPN web-page: http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1135&langId=en.

        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 24 4.4 Housing and living environment It is particularly worrying that access to quality housing and living environment has weakened in seven countries since 2013: two low (DK, IS), one medium (BE), one high (UK) and three very high (BG, EL, RO) AROPE countries. Policies and provision have been strengthened in only two countries: one medium (LU) and one high (IE) AROPE countries. Examples of positive developments: \u2022 In Ireland, concerns about children inform a new action plan for housing and homelessness; this includes the intention of ending the use of unsuitable emergency accommodation for households with children by mid-2017. \u2022 In Luxembourg, the introduction of a rent subsidy in January 2016 is a long- requested step forward in housing inclusion. The rent subsidy is allocated to low- income households, renting on the private market, if their monthly rent exceeds 33% of their net disposable income. Examples of negative developments: \u2022 In Belgium, while the three regions set goals for increased investment in social housing, the level remains low compared with the needs. The share of the private rental market is shrinking. \u2022 In Bulgaria, the failure to fulfil the commitment to improve and complement the legislation in the field of housing conditions reflects the lack of an overall long- term housing policy. \u2022 In the Czech Republic, the failure to prepare the Law on Social Housing means there are more families with children living in inadequate housing. The main problems some vulnerable groups are faced with (e.g. Roma families, one-parent families) are either the insufficient quality of the housing stock or unaffordable housing costs. \u2022 In Greece, as the socio-economic crisis persists, poor children \u2013 and especially children from vulnerable groups such as Roma- are living under ever worsening housing conditions and no public policy is in force to tackle their housing problems. The only action taken in this respect has been the implementation, during the period 2014-2016, of a limited number of programmes, involving, among other things, the provision of rent subsidies to poor households with children, the impact of which has been rather insignificant. \u2022 In Iceland, from 2013 programmes for debt relief and housing mortgage interest cost subsidy, have come swiftly down again and have in the last two years been at an all-time low, while housing prices and rents have galloped ahead of everything else in the society \u2013 hence hitting young households with children particularly heavily. \u2022 In Romania, children face higher risks of overcrowding and unacceptable housing conditions compared to their European counterparts, a situation that has not improved over the last three years. \u2022 In the UK, the failure to achieve enough affordable housing means more children living in private rented housing, leading to more frequent house moves; many households with children are also forced by benefit cuts or lack of social housing to move away from their support networks and communities.

        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 25 4.5 Family support and alternative care Strengthening policies and programmes in relation to family support and alternative care has occurred in just under a quarter of countries since 2013: two low (CZ, IS), one medium (FR), four high (IT, LT, LV, MT) and two very high (BG, RO) AROPE countries. Most countries have seen little change with only one (NL) becoming weaker. Examples of positive developments: \u2022 making progress on deinstitutionalisation of children and prevention of family separation (BG, LT, LV, RO); \u2022 strengthening of services to children at risk of abandonment (RO); \u2022 developing a framework for integrated community centres/ service packages in disadvantaged communities (RO); \u2022 expanding quality social services at the place of residence as an alternative to institutional care and to ensure accessibility of services that resemble the family environment for the disabled and children (LV); \u2022 developing a children protection system that integrates welfare, education and primary health services ensuring that all children have equal access to good quality services and improving the quality of child welfare services (LT); \u2022 increasing resources for parenting support such as support for parents to follow their children\u2019s schoolwork, access family mediation in case of family breakdown, access information and advice concerning their parenting role and education (FR); \u2022 a national programme carried out on an experimental basis to support parenting and prevent institutionalisation of minors (IT); \u2022 raising the personal care allowance for funding long-term care both for children and adults (CZ). 5 Pillar 3 \u2013 Children\u2019s right to participate This section assesses the extent to which countries have enhanced children\u2019s right to participate since 2013. ESPN experts were asked to assess first the policies to support the participation of all children in play, recreation, sport and cultural activities (Section 5.1) and then, the mechanisms that promote children\u2019s participation in decision-making in areas that affect their lives (Section 5.2). Overall there has been little change in most countries. 5.1 Participation in play, recreation, sport and cultural activities Just a fifth (7) of countries studied have strengthened their policies in this area since 2013: three low (FI, IS, NL), one medium (SK) and three high (HR, LT, LV) AROPE countries. In one country (UK) provision is weaker. In the majority of countries there has been little change. Examples of positive developments: \u2022 In Estonia, the Youth Field Development Plan 2014-2020 aims to increase opportunities for the creativity development, initiative and collective actions of young people. The government has also approved recreational activity grants to increase availability, diversity and quality of recreational activities. These grants are especially targeted to increase participation among children who have not so far participated. \u2022 In Iceland, proposals for a new family policy covering the period 2017-2021 have been developed to fully realise the goals of protection, care and participation of children in society. They are currently before parliament. One of the many areas they cover is leisure activities of children (participation of children in organised ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 26 leisure outside school hours; organisation of leisure and sports activities in off- school periods; increased parental access to children\u2019s school work). \u2022 In Lithuania, since 2016, a new financing method of non-formal education through the principle of the pupil\u2019s education voucher was introduced and pupils can choose various leisure activities provided in schools or outside schools (e.g. sports, music, arts, choreography). \u2022 In the Netherlands, additional funding is being made available to municipalities who are providing a diverse range of assistance with respect to: participation for children of low-income parents in areas such as swimming lessons; contributions to sports clubs, music or dance lessons; reimbursement of parental contributions to school excursions. Municipalities are also working with civil society organisations such as the Youth Sporting Fund and Youth Culture Fund to expand provision. \u2022 In Slovakia, participation in educational activities outside regular school attendance is being supported by educational vouchers which children can use to \u201cbuy\u201d various forms of educational/leisure activities offered by schools or school facilities. Also, since 2016, a contribution to \u201cschools in nature\u201d is provided to support participation of children in outdoor educational activities organised by elementary schools. 5.2 Participation in decision making Since 2013, some nine countries have strengthened their policies and practices in relation to children\u2019s participation in decision-making in areas that affect their lives: four low (FI, IS, NL, SI), two medium (EE, FR) and three high (CY, HR, IE) AROPE countries. In one country (RO), the ESPN expert explains that these mechanisms have weakened due to both a lack of interest to enforce them and a refocussing of the administration on issues perceived as more pressing. Examples of positive developments: \u2022 In Croatia, there have been some recent improvements in the child\u2019s right to participate and there are examples of good practice at the level of individual cities where children have been included in decision-making regarding play facilities. Opatija, for example, has a children\u2019s council and a children\u2019s mayor. \u2022 In Cyprus, the law establishing the Commissioner for the Protection of Children\u2019s Rights has been modified to upgrade the role of the Commissioner\u2019s Young Advisors Team. Other participation structures are the Children\u2019s parliament and the Pancyprian Coordinating Pupils\u2019 Committee. \u2022 In Estonia, the Youth field Development Plan 2014-2020 supports participation of young people in community life and decision-making processes. There is also a renewed Child Protection Act , which aims to increase inclusion of children in decision making and stipulates the obligation to include children into planning measures targeted to children and to find out the interests of children and use them as the primary consideration when making decisions that affect them. \u2022 In Finland, a new Early Child Care Act obliges the educational staff and other authorities working with children to ensure that the child has the opportunity to participate in decisions and influence matters concerning them. Also children aged 12 years or older must be given the opportunity to express their views in any child welfare case concerning them and even younger children must be heard. The Local Government Act 2015 ensures that young people are able to participate in local decisions. \u2022 In France, since 2016 a new body, the Haut Conseil de la Famille, de l\u2019Enfance et de l\u2019Age ( High Commission for Family, Childhood and Age ), has the particular objective of promoting children\u2019s participation in decisions that concern their everyday lives. When the Committee for Childhood met in February 2017, eight ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 27 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 were present. In their capacity as established members of this body, they are contributing to the identification of the specific issues which they think should be a priority for this Committee in terms of how children spend their time when they are neither at school nor home. \u2022 In Ireland, \u201clistening to and involving children and young people\u201d is one of the five transformational goals of the overall national policy framework issued in 2014 ( Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures ). In 2015, as part of this framework, the National Strategy on Children and Young People\u2019s Participation in Decision-Making was launched. It aims to give children and young people a voice in decisions that affect them, especially in their everyday lives. It works on the basis of identifying the \u201cspaces and places\u201d where children and young people are entitled to have a voice in decisions that affect them. A Children and Young People\u2019s Participation Hub has been established at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to be a centre of excellence in regard to knowledge accrual and exchange on children\u2019s participation. \u2022 In Latvia, to improve opportunities for children\u2019s participation, as of April, 2017, started applying the children\u2019s participation assessment system developed and tested by the Council of Europe. This will allow performing regular children\u2019s participation assessment at the national, local, agency and institutional level, involving children and experts of the field. \u2022 In the Netherlands, the State Secretary of Social Affairs and Employment highlighted the importance of involving children in poverty policy and asked the Consulting Kids organisation to enter into dialogue with 10 schools in various municipalities regarding the best use of the additional resources that have been made available for combatting child poverty. In addition, a subsidy will be given to a pilot programme involving the NGOs Save the Children and Defence for Children . \u2022 In Slovenia, in 2013, the Parliament adopted a Recommendation to the government on a separate act that would institutionalise child advocacy with an autonomous and independent legal entity. The Parliament also recommended that in the meantime the \u201cAdvocate \u2013 a Child\u2019s Voice\u201d project should be extended. This pilot project has developed a programme for children\u2019s rights advocates. The Slovenian expert explains that there are currently \u201c40 advocates speaking and acting on behalf of children who thus become subjects in the exercising of their rights\u201d. 6 Addressing child poverty and social exclusion and child well- being in the European Semester The Recommendation on Investing in children was developed in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy and it was envisaged that its implementation would feature strongly during European Semester discussions (i.e. in National Reform Programmes, National Social Reports, Country Specific Recommendations and Country Reports). Thus it is disappointing that the ESPN experts\u2019 assessment is that addressing the issues of child poverty and social exclusion and child well-being in the European Semester has only been strengthened in six countries since the adoption of the Recommendation in 2013: two medium (BE, SK) and four high (IE, LT, MT, PT) AROPE countries and has weakened in two (EL, UK). Examples of positive developments: \u2022 In Belgium, the National Child Poverty Reduction Plan (2013) framed the fight against child poverty and social exclusion and the promotion of child well-being within the Europe 2020 strategy. It was shaped around three policy areas that are fundamental: (1) access to adequate resources, (2) access to quality services and (3) opportunities for and active participation of children in society. A fourth strategic objective, setting up horizontal and vertical partnerships between ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 28 different policy areas and policy levels, completed the action plan. The new inter- federal action plan (expected in 2017) seems to follow the same structure with a focus on the three pillars of the Recommendation on Investing in children . Also, in the most recent National Reform Programme, considerable attention was paid to the initiatives to combat child poverty at lower levels of government. \u2022 In Ireland, child poverty and social exclusion receive a lot of attention in the 2017 National Reform Programme. A number of the developments are in line with the Country Specific Recommendations issued to Ireland. The new Affordable Childcare Scheme as a response to the matter of affordability is notable in this context as are the developments around parental leaves and jobless households. \u2022 In Portugal, since 2014, both the National Reform Programmes and the National Social Reports have included several mentions to the subject echoing the rise in child poverty and the increased difficulties of households with children in coping with the effects of the economic and financial crisis. In one case \u2013 2014 National Reform Programme \u2013 the Recommendation on Investing in children was explicitly mentioned. The National Social Report 2016 stresses that \u201cin accordance with European guidelines, three clear guidelines have been suggested: reinforcing early childhood intervention in fields like health and education; investing on the quality and availability of child support services; ensuring adequate income to families through a well-designed combination of universal and specific benefits\u201d. The issues have also been significantly addressed in Country Reports but not in the documents accompanying Country Specific Recommendations. As for Country Specific Recommendations themselves, they have been addressing family- and child-related policy topics. For instance, the adequate coverage of social assistance, including through the minimum income scheme, was recommended in 2014 and again in 2015. \u2022 In Slovakia, the 2017 National Reform Programme sets \u201csocial inclusion of pupils from socially disadvantaged background\u201d as one of the priorities in the area of education. In relation to the labour market, low employment rate of mothers with very young children is identified as a challenge. Attention is also paid to participation of Roma children living in marginalised communities in pre-school education attendance and in successful completion of compulsory school attendance. The National Framework Strategy for Support of Social Inclusion and Fight against Poverty , which serves as one of the ex-ante conditionalities 25 for the programming period 2014-2020, focuses on child poverty and social exclusion too. 7 Mobilising relevant EU financial instruments 26 This section looks at the extent to which the 2014-2020 ESF and ERDF programming is being used to support policies and programmes for children that are in line with the approach outlined in the Recommendation on Investing in children . It is encouraging that, according to the ESPN experts\u2019 assessment, the approach to using EU financial instruments to support the social inclusion of children has been strengthened to varying degrees in 12 out of the 28 Member States: two low (CZ, SI), three medium (EE, FR, SK), six high (IE, IT, LT, LV, MT, PT) and one very high (BG) AROPE countries. However, in 14 other countries there has been little change and in two (ES, RO) the use of EU financial instruments has weakened since 2013. Even where there has been some strengthening of the use of funds to benefit children it is often not to as great an extent as might be expected. For instance, in Ireland no monies are spent on the allocative category that most closely relates to children (i.e. early childhood education and early 25 Ex ante conditionalities are one of the key elements of the cohesion policy reform for 2014-20. They were introduced for the European Structural and Investment Funds to ensure that the necessary conditions for the effective and efficient use of these Funds are in place.

        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 29 school leaving). The importance of EU financial instruments is also significantly greater in some countries (e.g. BG, CZ, EE, EL, MT, LT, LV) than others. Overall the three Thematic Objectives (TO) which are most directly (TO9. \u201cPromoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discrimination\u201d and TO10. \u201cInvesting in education, training and vocational training for skills and life-long learning\u201d) and indirectly (TO8. \u201cPromoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility\u201d) relevant to children have fairly consistent levels of mobilisation and expenditure across the three priorities (see Table 7.1). The highest percentage allocated and also already spent is in the area of employment and the lowest in social inclusion. However, it is clear from the ESPN national experts\u2019 reports that the picture on committal/absorption and also actual spending of EU Funds varies widely across Member States and sometimes between Investment Priorities. The information was not available, either at national or EU level, to ESPN experts to enable them to assess what proportion of these funds are actually assisting the social inclusion of children and, more specifically, the implementation of the Recommendation. As the Portuguese experts point out: \u201cNot every investment priority under TO8, TO9 and TO10 addresses children specifically. Additionally, it should be emphasised that the amounts regarding the Investment Priorities (IPs) targeting children cannot be earmarked to children as, in all cases, they do not target children exclusively. In some cases, they are the main target group such as in IP10i and IP10iv but in most cases they are just one of the target-groups (TO9) or they are not clearly identified as a target-group but may be covered by the actions of the IP even if they are deemed to represent only a small proportion of recipients (TO8).\u201d (See Annex 2 for IP figures for the EU as a whole within each TO. 27 ) The German experts make a similar point when they state that \u201cBecause no data on the age structure of programme participants are available, it is not possible to assess how many young people are participating in ESF projects. Nor is it possible to assess how effective the funded projects are with regard to the social inclusion of children and adolescents.\u201d Table 7.1: Distribution of the total amount in the 2014-2020 programme according to the projects selected and the amount already spent per priority Thematic objectives % of total EU money in the programme mobilised on projects (level of success in mobilising EU funds) (*) % of EU money already spent (**) 8.

SFC2014\u2019s main function is the electronic exchange of information concerning shared Fund management between Member States and the European Commission.

        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 30 7.1 Issues and problems Key issues or problems highlighted by ESPN national experts in using EU Funding instruments in the implementation of the Recommendation on Investing in children include the following: \u2022 Failure to take all or some of the Recommendation into account in making programming decisions. For instance: o In Denmark and Finland, none of the investment priority under TO8, TO9 and TO10 addresses children specifically. Children have not been the main focus of the use of structural funds. In Finland, for example, the horizontal themes chosen do not specifically and directly highlight investments in children, even though, for example, gender equality and non-discrimination programmes (accentuating Roma and immigrants) can certainly have quite direct effects on children as well. o In Croatia, projects relating to elements highlighted in the Recommendations on Investing in children are not particularly prioritised, other than indirectly, through those programmes targeting female employment and active labour market programmes for disadvantaged groups. o In Luxembourg, there is no explicit reference to the Recommendation. The fact that the ESF Operational Programme does not deal, for example, with challenges in education, ECEC and other issues linked to child poverty and social exclusion of children, is a policy choice. It is explicitly stated that these issues are dealt with via regular national funding. \u2022 Failure to use EU funds in favour of children in a strategic and planned way and link them with national or local policies and priorities. For example: o In Germany, the efficiency and effectiveness of the ESF funding are still limited because the funded projects are often not embedded in local policies. Instead of a great number of short-term projects with changing targets and target groups, it would be more effective to strengthen the regular planning and funding of service provision. o In Greece, in the absence of a specific public investment plan for children with clear-cut priorities, it is hardly possible to expect that the EU structural funds are being used appropriately to support the implementation of the Recommendation. Funding, in most cases, has been directed \u2013 and still is \u2013 towards supporting different measures and actions, which are implemented in a fragmented way, without ensuring synergy and close interaction between them. It is rare that different actions implemented complement each other or that they form part of an overall policy or strategy. o In Hungary, projects are still short-term, maximum 2-3 year-long, which is too limited a time frame to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty. After the project financing ends, they cannot be sustained, so most of their results also vanish in time. \u2022 Displacement of national resources by EU resources and thus lack of mainstreaming of programmes in national policies which raises the issue of long- term sustainability of investment in children (BG, CZ, RO). \u2022 Issues of absorption and expenditure. In several cases, there are low or uneven committal/absorption rates across measures (CY, CZ, ES, FR, HR, LU, MT, PL, PT, RO, SK). However, some experts (CY, PT) point out that on the basis of previous experience commitment and absorption rates are likely to accelerate in the second half of the 2014-2020 programming period. Some countries already have good levels of absorption in most areas (EE, SI). Also, in several countries expenditure is low or uneven across priorities (CZ, EE, ES, FR, HR, IT, LT, SE, SI, SK, UK). For instance, in France it is high on TO9 social exclusion but low on TO10 education. ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 31 \u2022 Management, procedural and monitoring weaknesses. For instance: o In Bulgaria, management bodies tend to prefer direct assignment of operations to mainly state agencies rather than competitive recruitment of the best and most innovative projects. This is not maximising the contribution of the funds to the Europe 2020 strategy, which is their main purpose, and this is contradicting the Guidance for the Structural Funds programme period 2014-2020 . o In Hungary, the project application system is very slow: the regional Children\u2019s chances programmes with invited applications had a deadline in August 2016 with no decision on the 22 applicants yet in May 2017. o In Romania, there is a lack of effective monitoring and assessment of EU funded programmes. There were weak application procedures, with delays and, due to the dysfunctionalities of the information system in use, many documents got lost and the evaluation commission did only selectively request clarifications from applicants. 7.2 Ways in which EU funds are benefiting children The ways in which EU Funds are used to support the social inclusion of children can be both direct and indirect. 7.2.1 Direct support Examples of where children benefit directly from EU funding: \u2022 Supporting education initiatives: Given the specific Thematic Objective on education it is not surprising that in most countries children are benefiting from expenditures in this area (AT, BE, BG, CY, CZ, EE, EL, FI, LV, SV). Examples of how funds are used include the following: o Austria is prioritising further improving the conditions in school, for example through increasing the availability of social workers at school; o Bulgaria is allocating funds to improve school facilities, prevent student drop- out, introduce ICT into schools, evaluate the quality of education and match it with labour market needs, improve management systems for higher education institutions, and increase the cost allocation per student in teacher training, engineering and natural sciences; o Cyprus has supported a programme ( Actions for social and school inclusion ) which targets through assertive actions pupils at risk of low educational performance, exclusion and early school leaving; o Finland is providing help to school dropouts; o Greece is facilitating access of the disabled and other vulnerable groups of children (Roma etc.) to educational services; o Latvia has funded the provision of technologies and adjustments for the inclusive development of children with functional impairment; o Sweden is addressing the special challenges for foreign-born children in both schools and school-to-work transitions. \u2022 Enhancing ECEC quality and provision: A number of countries (BE, BG, CZ, EE, EL, FI, PL, SK, UK) use funds to improve ECEC quality and provision, some primarily to increase parental involvement in employment and others more to promote the development and well-being of children. For instance: o in Belgium, support to childcare facilities is provided to parents looking for or starting a job; o in Finland, funding is used to develop the night time \u201cday-care\u201d of children of shift workers; o in Poland, there are a wide range of projects aimed at improvement of care for children less than 3 years spread all over the country (establishing ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 32 nurseries, children clubs, training for carers and others). There are also projects that involve the development of kindergartens or other forms of ECEC. Most of them are implemented by the regional operational programmes, and they always consider equality of men and women in the labour market as well as reconciliation of work and family life; o in Slovakia, there is a focus on construction of new facilities for children up to 3 years and specific support is provided in marginalised Roma settlements. \u2022 Developing child protection services and supporting initiatives for families and children at particular risk. Examples of countries making this kind of use of EU funds include the following: o Estonia is prioritising improving the quality of alternative care settings; o Finland is developing new preventive methods of child protection and supporting projects fortifying the fathers\u2019 role in family life, projects focusing on Roma and immigrant children and projects improving the situation of female prisoners and their families; o Latvia is funding work with children with communication difficulties and behavioural disorders, and with cases of domestic violence. Latvia is also investing in deinstitutionalisation and service infrastructure development for the implementation of deinstitutionalisation plans; o Slovenia targets children at risk of social exclusion under TO9 (social inclusion), with measures foreseen to promote a greater social inclusion of children belonging to minority ethnic communities and children with disabilities. Slovenia is also supporting pilot projects aimed at supporting the transition from institutional care to community care. Some experts refer to specific initiatives which use the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) to address child deprivation. For instance: \u2022 Austria has decided to develop and implement a new measure providing school- start-packages (with school supplies) for children living in households receiving minimum income; \u2022 Cyprus has announced the \u201cBaby Dowry\u201d scheme which will provide food, clothing and other essential items to households with babies who fulfil certain eligibility criteria; \u2022 Germany is using FEAD money to fund programmes for recent arrivals from EU Member States and people with housing problems; \u2022 Latvia has launched an additional distribution of food and hygiene kits for infants and children up to 2 years. 7.2.2 Indirect support Examples of where children benefit indirectly from EU funding: \u2022 Initiatives to improve the position of parents in the labour market (BE, CZ, DE, EE, EL, IE, IT, LV, MT, UK). For instance: o In Greece, the programme for the Reconciliation of family and professional life aims at filling the gaps in pre-school childcare by increasing the capacity of the childcare centres and services, though its ultimate aim is to increase the opportunities for female employment. o In Wales (UK), NEETs are targeted by projects often including young lone parents; in Scotland, a strategic European Structural and Investment Funds intervention for social inclusion and poverty reduction includes increasing income and money management skills for disadvantaged households, helping jobless, lone-parent and low-income households to increase skill levels and find work; in Northern Ireland, the ESF is used to reduce economic inactivity and enhance the skills base including three operations focused on women, several for young people and NEETs, and in particular several \u201cfamily support\u201d projects.

For instance: o in Belgium, there is a focus on improvement of the quality of life for deprived neighbourhoods and populations; o in Germany, one of the main target groups for the ESF funds is asylum seekers and refugees; the federal government is funding 128 integration projects in local cooperation networks made up of local employment services, job centres and private and public employers; o in Italy, social services are being linked to the implementation of minimum income schemes under a national plan against poverty and social exclusion; o in Romania, funds are used for the development of integrated community centres/ service packages, with an important impact on children from disadvantaged communities; o in Spain, the scheme \u201cPromote and learn by working\u201d, aimed at the Roma population has been of particular importance in improving Roma children\u2019s education. 8 Overall ESPN findings and recommendations 8.1 Overall ESPN findings Looking at developments across all 35 countries since 2013 and across all 15 governance and policy areas assessed by ESPN national experts (see Annex 4), it seems that the impact of the Recommendation on Investing in children has, overall, been \u201cmodestly positive\u201d. However, while a number of countries have strengthened or further developed some of their policies/approaches and programmes for children in ways that are consistent with the Recommendation it should be noted that it is difficult, if at all possible, to assess the extent to which individual improvements can be attributed to the Recommendation itself. There are 133 28 instances where experts have assessed that countries\u2019 policies/ approaches and programmes have been strengthened since 2013 and only 39 instances of them being weakened. However, in the vast majority of instances (340) there has been little change. Of course, little change in countries with low or medium AROPE levels and already quite well-developed policies is much less concerning than in those countries with high or very high AROPE levels and often quite weak policy infrastructure. Yet, even in low AROPE countries further improvements in line with the Recommendation are possible and should be sought. In Finland, for instance, the experts highlight that in the national debate child poverty and increasing inequalities have been vividly discussed. Given the persistent very high levels of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion across the EU it is worrying that more efforts have not been made in more countries in all categories to further strengthen their policies/approaches and programmes. There is a considerable way to go to ensure really effective and energetic implementation of the Recommendation. This is all the truer given that Principle 11 of the new European Pillar of Social Rights makes child poverty one of the key areas to be addressed to ensure a more Social Europe. Table 8.1 shows the huge variation in the extent to which countries have strengthened policies/approaches and programmes further in the direction suggested by the Recommendation. Out of the 15 areas assessed by national experts four countries have made progress in 8 or 9 areas (EE, FR, IE, MT) and eight countries in between 5 and 7 areas (BG, IS, LT, LV, NL, PT, SI, SK). Six countries (DE, EL, ES, LI, RS, SE) saw no improvements in any of the 15 areas but most also saw little change. The countries where policies have weakened in most areas are the UK (8), Romania (5) and Hungary 28 The numbers in this paragraph are derived from the number of countries listed under each of the three columns (i.e. \u201cstronger\u201d, \u201clittle change\u201d and \u201cweaker\u201d) in the Summary Table provided in Annex 4. ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 34 (4). Of the 12 countries that made progress in the greatest number of areas five are from the high AROPE group, three each from the medium and low AROPE groups and only one from the very high AROPE group. Given that there are 17 countries in the high and very high AROPE groups it is especially concerning that more progress has not been made in more of these countries.

The specific areas where countries\u2019 policies/approaches/programmes have been strengthened, have remained broadly unchanged or have weakened since 2013 are spelled out in the Summary Table in Annex 4. Looking across the 15 areas, progress on strengthening policies/approaches and programmes has been unevenly spread. The areas where the greatest number of countries have made progress are ECEC (18), income support (15, though this was balanced by a weakening of support in 9 countries), mobilising relevant EU financial instruments (12) and developing multi-dimensional strategies with synergies between policies (10). Least progress has been made by countries in the areas of access to housing and living environment (2), health (3), addressing child poverty and social exclusion in the European Semester (6) and education (8) 29 . The very limited progress in relation to the European Semester is surprising as it is here that one would have expected significant evidence of progress since 2013 if the implementation of the Recommendation had been energetically pursued 30 . In addition to income support (9 countries) the areas where the policies/approaches and programmes of the most countries have become weaker are housing and the living environment (7) and education (5). 8.2 Overall ESPN recommendations It is clear from this Synthesis Report that, while a number of countries have strengthened or further developed their policies/ approaches and programmes for children since 2013, only limited progress has been made in many countries - especially 29 The need to make progress on all elements of Pillar 2 of the Recommendation (Access to quality services) is well highlighted in the European Social Network\u2019s evaluation of the implementation of the Recommendation in 14 Member States. See: Lara Montero, A. (2016), Investing in Children\u2019s Services, Improving Outcomes, Brighton: European Social Network. Available at: http://www.esn-eu.org/publications/index.html . 30 These findings coincide with those of Eurochild which has been monitoring the extent to which child poverty has featured in the European Semester on an annual basis. Eurochild has regularly highlighted the limited attention that it is being given. See for instance: Eurochild (2016), Is Europe doing enough to invest in children? 2016 Eurochild Report on the European Semester , Brussels: Eurochild.

        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 35 in some of those with high or very high levels of child poverty or social exclusion. This means that, in the next phase of the implementation of the Recommendation on Investing in children , a much more intensive and ambitious approach will be needed if a real impact is to be made. This is even more the case in view of the new importance being given to tackling child poverty in the European Pillar of Social Rights and European Commission President Juncker\u2019s goal of achieving a \u201ctriple-A\u201d Social Europe. Section 8.3 and Annex 5 of this report include ESPN national experts\u2019 country specific priority recommendations for implementing the Recommendation. Thus, in this section the focus is on some ten key overarching recommendations aimed at bringing greater urgency and effectiveness to the implementation process. 1) Promoting and monitoring the implementation of the Recommendation and the Pillar principle on child poverty must be a high and visible political priority for the European Council, the EU Council of Ministers, the European Commission, the European Parliament and other EU institutions. To this end the following would help: o The European Council should address the issue of the fight against child poverty and social exclusion and the promotion of child well-being at least once a year in its Presidency conclusions. o To enable and support this the Social Protection Committee should consider establishing a working group to monitor and advise on the implementation of the Recommendation and to make recommendations to the EU \u201cEmployment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs\u201d Council of Ministers (EPSCO) so that it can regularly feed into the European Council on the issue of child poverty and social exclusion. o Within the European Commission, (continued) political leadership on the issue, especially from President Juncker and Commissioner Thyssen acting as champions for the social inclusion and well-being of children, is vital. A high level official should have leading responsibility for the Commission\u2019s implementation of the Recommendation and the European Pillar of Social Rights\u2019 principle on child poverty. o Implementation of the Recommendation and the European Pillar\u2019s principle on child poverty should be a key priority in the European Commission\u2019s, and especially Directorate-General (DG) Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion\u2019s, annual work programme. o Given the cross-cutting nature of the Recommendation, an inter-services group on Children\u2019s Rights consisting of senior officials should be established to coordinate implementation efforts at EU level and ensure that the issues of child poverty and social exclusion and child well-being are mainstreamed in the implementation of the European Pillar . This might involve: DG Justice given its coordination role on the rights of the child among the European Commission's services and its leading role in the implementation of the EU Agenda for the rights of the child, DG Education, Youth, Sport and Culture given its key role in ECEC and education, DG Regional and Urban Policy given its leading role in ERDF funding, DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion given its leading role on social inclusion issues and the Recommendation, DG Economic and Financial Affairs given its role on ensuring contribution of economic policies to social inclusion objectives, DG Migration and Home Affairs given its role in migration, DG Health and Food Safety in view of its role in public health and mental health and of course the Secretariat General given its key role in the European Pillar of Social Rights . o The European Parliament should maintain and enhance its close monitoring of and support for the implementation of the Recommendation. In particular, it should follow through on its 2015 Written Declaration on Investing in ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 36 Children 31 and put the implementation of the Recommendation at the heart of the work of the inter-services group on Children\u2019s Rights. o The European Economic and Social Committee and the European Committee of the Regions should give a high priority to the fight against child poverty and social exclusion and the promotion of child well-being of children in their work and monitor and advise the EU Council of Ministers and the European Commission on the implementation of the Recommendation. o In the longer term, consideration should be given to Treaty changes to raise the political status of social objectives and to allow for sanctions for countries failing to meet these objectives, including for children, as well as economic, employment and environmental objectives. 2) A key first task for the inter-services group on Children\u2019s Rights could be to develop a roadmap for the next phase of implementation of the Recommendation and the concrete implementation of the Pillar principle on child poverty: o a visible communicable plan with specific objectives and key milestones would be very helpful in mobilising support and involving all relevant stakeholders in the implementation process 32 . 3) Rigorous monitoring and reporting on the well-being of children and the implementation of the Recommendation will be vital. To this end, the following are of key importance: o Child poverty and social exclusion and child well-being should be made a key element in the Scoreboard of key employment and social indicators so that each year the performance of countries in this regard can be reported on in the Joint Employment Report and countries \u201cto watch\u201d or in a \u201ccritical situation\u201d can be highlighted - it will also be important that the Social Scoreboard is given equal weight with the EU\u2019s Macroeconomic Scoreboard. o In monitoring national budgets, the European Commission should encourage transparency and reporting by Member States on the amounts they spend on policies that fight child poverty and social exclusion and promote children\u2019s well-being. o One or more EU child-specific indicators (including a child-specific material deprivation indicator on which important progress has already been made) should be adopted so as to enhance monitoring progress towards children\u2019s rights. o The indicators used for monitoring the implementation of the Pillar of Social Rights should wherever possible and meaningful contain an age breakdown covering children. o The European Commission and Member States should be committed to carry out effective child poverty proofing of all economic, employment and environmental policies to ensure that they are, as far as is possible, 31 The Written Declaration on Investing in Children (No 0042/2015) was signed by 428 Members of the European Parliament in December 2015. More information is available at: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=PV&reference=20151214&secondRef=ANN- 01&language=EN. 32 The European Parliament\u2019s Written Declaration on Investing in Children ( op. cit. ) calls on the European Commission to draw up a roadmap. The EU Alliance for Investing in Children, in a joint statement on the 2017 European Commission\u2019s Staff Working Document which takes stock of the Recommendation on Investing in Children ( op. cit. ), stresses the need for a roadmap and argues that \u201ca visible communicable plan with specific objectives and key milestones\u201d would be an extremely helpful tool.

This could involve: o Making the issues of fighting child poverty and social exclusion and promoting the well-being of children a central element of the Annual Growth Survey, National Reform Programmes, National Social Reports, Country Specific Recommendations and European Commission Country Reports. o Establishing a child poverty or social exclusion target as part of the overall Europe 2020 target on reducing poverty and social exclusion and complementing this with national targets as appropriate. o Establishing EU and national anti-poverty strategies as part of the European Semester process with integral elements addressing child poverty and social exclusion and child well-being. o Assessing adherence to the Recommendation and the Pillar principle on child poverty in the process of accession to the EU for candidate countries, which are part of the EU acquis , and use of EU funds to promote this adherence. 5) In addition to the mainstreaming of the Recommendation and the European Pillar\u2019s principle on child poverty in the European Semester the European Commission should seek to mainstream and monitor the well-being of children in all relevant EU initiatives. To this end, the following could usefully be considered: o In the context of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies , Member States could be encouraged to develop coordinated approaches to the integration of Roma children. o The European Commission could develop and promote good standards for the integration of migrant children, including unaccompanied minors, and ensure access to education and health services for all migrant children as part of the implementation of Action Plans on the Integration of Third Country Nationals . o In the implementation of the EU Council of Ministers\u2019 Recommendation on the integration of the long-term unemployed, Member States could be encouraged to give particular attention to lone parents, Roma parents, parents in jobless households, migrant parents and parents of children with a disability. o In promoting access to adequate minimum income through an active inclusion approach, the European Commission could highlight the particular importance of adequate income support, inclusive labour markets and access to quality services for households with children 33 . o The well-being of children, especially those in vulnerable situations, should be a key element in the follow through of the European Commission\u2019s proposals on work-life balance for working parents and carers. 33 In 2008, the EU Council of Ministers adopted a Recommendation on the active inclusion of people most excluded from the labour market, promoting a comprehensive strategy based on the integration of three key and equally important social policy pillars: adequate income support, inclusive labour markets and access to quality services. ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 38 o The drafting of action plans to implement the EU Urban Agenda for cities could give a high priority to the well-being of children in cities. o The issue of children with a disability should be a key concern in implementing the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 . o The European Commission support and funding for the Joint Action for Mental Health and Well-being should emphasise the importance of a strong focus on children. o The implementation of the EU Council of Ministers\u2019 Recommendation on Upskilling Pathways should give particular attention to unemployed parents with low levels of skills. 6) Important synergies could be achieved by ensuring close links between the implementation of the Recommendation and other relevant international level processes , in particular the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 34 and 2030 Agenda and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child . 7) Effective civil dialogue involving organisations working on issues of child poverty and child well-being and on the participation of children in such a dialogue should be a key element in the implementation and monitoring of the implementation of the Recommendation 35 . 8) The growing use of EU financial instruments to support implementation of the Recommendation should be continued and intensified. To this end, the following could usefully be considered: o The European Commission should do everything it can to ensure that EU funds to support children are used by Member States as part of a strategic and comprehensive national (and regional and local) approach to the inclusion of children in line with the Recommendation and in a sustainable manner that avoids short-term projects. While there is encouraging evidence of increased use of EU Funds in relation to ECEC it is important to stress that EU Funds should be used to support increased access for children at risk and their families to all services (e.g. health, social services, education, child protection including deinstitutionalisation) and their parents into employment. o There should be more rigorous monitoring of how funds are being used to support (both directly and indirectly) the social inclusion of children and to this end data should be collected on this on a regular basis with particular attention being given to children most at risk such as Roma children, migrant children, children with a disability, children in alternative care (especially to their deinstitutionalisation) and homeless children. o Increased mapping of poverty and social exclusion, especially in relation to children, could help in effective targeting of EU Funds on some of the most disadvantaged children. 34 The 2017 UNICEF \u201cInnocenti Report Card\u201d 14 ( Building the Future: Children and the Sustainable Development Goals in Rich Countries ) provides valuable insights into what countries need to do to tackle child poverty and promote child well-being in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals. Available at: https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/890/. 35 Several EU level networks have been playing an active role in promoting and monitoring the implementation of the Recommendation. For instance: the EU Alliance for Investing in Children (http://www.alliance4investinginchildren.eu/), Eurochild (http://www.eurochild.org/), COFACE (http://www.coface-eu.org/), the European Anti-Poverty Network (http://www.eapn.eu/), the European Social Network (http://www.esn-eu.org/publications/index.html), and Save the Children (https://www.savethechildren.net/eu-office). Given their wide-ranging expertise on tackling child poverty and social exclusion and promoting the well-being of children their continued involvement in the process will be vital to the effective implementation of the Recommendation. ",
        "Progress in the implementation of the 2013 EU Recommendation on \u201cInvesting in children\u201d 39 o In the longer term, consideration should be given to the development of an EU Child Guarantee to complement the existing EU Youth Guarantee and to ensure a coordinated and strategic approach. 36 9) There should be an ongoing commitment to documenting good practice and exchange and learning : o a programme of exchange and learning (including peer reviews) on the implementation of the Recommendation should be established; and o the online European Platform for Investing in Children (EPIC) should be further developed. 10) To build support for sustained implementation of the Recommendation there should be a concerted campaign to raise public and political awareness of the nature and extent of child poverty and what needs to be done about it. It could also be helpful to hold regular national seminars involving all relevant stakeholders and the European Commission to monitor and promote the implementation of the Recommendation and the European Pillar of Social Rights\u2019 principle on child poverty. 8.3 ESPN country specific priority recommendations Clearly much more needs to be done if the Recommendation on Investing in children is to have the impact that is needed on promoting child well-being and combating child poverty and social exclusion. To assist the future implementation of the Recommendation and to take steps to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights\u2019 focus on child poverty the ESPN national experts have, based on their analysis of the implementation of the Recommendation to date, put forward their suggestions as to the key priorities in their countries for making progress. These are summarised in Annex 5. However, it is interesting to look at the areas that they most frequently highlight. The issues prioritised by experts vary widely reflecting the wide variety of national situations. However, four areas recur frequently: developing more comprehensive, strategic and coordinated approaches including mainstreaming children\u2019s rights in national policy making, better targeting of high risk groups such as Roma and immigrant children, increasing the accessibility and quality of ECEC services, and addressing inequalities and access issues in schools. The key areas covered by national recommendations can be grouped as follows: Governance \u2022 Develop a more comprehensive, multi-dimensional and coordinated approach (AT, CY, DE, EL, MK, PL, PT), put the Recommendation more at centre of policy making (EL, IT), improve coordination and integration of services for children (LT) and improve coordination between State and Regional child policies (ES). 36 The European Parliament has called for the establishment of a \u201cEuropean Child Guarantee\u201d (ECG) and has agreed with the European Commission on a preparatory pilot action (PPA) to develop the necessary analytical basis for this scheme. It goes beyond the scope of this Synthesis Report to suggest what the key elements of an ECG should be. However, on the basis of this ESPN study we would suggest that the PPA should give particular attention to four aspects: 1) ensuring that expenditure of EU funds in favour of children is increased, made more transparent and linked to the implementation of the Recommendation on Investing in Children and Principle 11 of the European Pillar of Social Rights (this principle makes child poverty a key area to be addressed to ensure a more Social Europe); 2) levering additional national funding for the inclusion and well- being of children through encouraging better child budgeting (i.e. making the overall government budget more responsive to children\u2019s rights); 3) ensuring that EU funds in favour of children are used to complement and support a strategic and coordinated approach to combating child poverty and social exclusion and improve child well-being in Member States, and not for once-off and unsustainable initiatives; and 4) ensuring that EU funds give priority support to well thought-out policies/approaches and programmes to assist those children at greatest risk (e.g. Roma children, migrant/refugee children, homeless children, children living in or leaving institutions, children with a disability, children in remote rural communities of decaying urban areas).
