The trend depicted refers to the 2009-2019 change in percentage points. A CLOSER LOOK: Those who leave education without an upper secondary qualification struggle with lower employment rates, and lower participation in adult learning. Early school leaving is higher among men; and among the foreign-born population than among native born young adults. ",

Note: the indicator covers 30 to 34 year-olds having successfully completed ISCED 5 to 8. The trend depicted refers to the 2009-2019 change in percentage points. A CLOSER LOOK: The EU has met its target of raising the rate of tertiary educational attainment to at least 40% of the 30-34 year-old population. On average in the EU, there is a large gap between the tertiary educational attainment rate of women and men, in favour of the former. The social dimension of higher education requires urgent attention, notably to support participa- tion of disadvantaged groups. ",
        "3. Early childhood education BENCHMARK 2020: At least 95% of children between the age of four and the age for starting compulsory primary education should participate in education.

See Section 2.3 of the Education and Training Monitor 2020 for more information (ec.europa.eu/education/monitor). The trend depicted refers to the 2009-2018 change in percentage points. A CLOSER LOOK: The attendance of children from the age of 4 in early childhood education is, by now, almost universal. It is also high for children aged above 3 (90%). However, it drops to 77.8% for children \u201cat risk of poverty or social exclusion\u201d. High-quality education in the early years of life correlates with better learning outcomes later in life, and particularly so for children from socio-economically disadvantaged homes. ",

Note: underachievement means failing Level 2 on the PISA scale for reading, mathematics or science. The trend depicted refers to the 2009- 2018 change in percentage points. A CLOSER LOOK: Reducing the number of pupils who cannot complete basic maths, science and reading tasks remains a challenge. Between 2012 and 2015, the EU actually moved further away from its target on basic skills. In most countries, pupils with a migrant background tend to perform worse than pupils without, signalling that investing in equal opportunities for all pupils remains a top priority in the EU. ",

Tertiary graduates had a higher employment rate (85.0%) than those holding an upper-secondary or post-second- ary vocational qualification (75.9%); The crisis of 2020 is likely to have a negative impact on these figures.
