        "EUROPEAN COMMISSION Brussels, 12.10.2011 COM(2011) 626 final 2011/0281 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ",
        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL The Commission proposal for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2014-2020 (the MFF proposal) 1 sets the budgetary framework and main orientations for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). On this basis, the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020, together with an impact assessment of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the policy. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 2 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely 1) viable food production; 2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and 3) balanced territorial development. The reform orientations in the Communication have since been broadly supported both in the inter-institutional debate 3 and in the stakeholder consultation that took place in the framework of the impact assessment. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances, while Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. 4 Through successive reforms the CAP has increased market orientation for agriculture while providing income support to producers, improved the integration of environmental requirements and reinforced support for rural development as an integrated policy for the development of rural areas across the EU. However, the same reform process has raised demands for a better distribution of support among and within Member States, as well as calls for a better targeting of measures aiming at addressing environmental challenges and better addressing increased market volatility. In the past, reforms mainly responded to endogenous challenges, from huge surpluses to food safety crises; they have served the EU well both on the domestic and the international front. However, most of today's challenges are driven by factors that are external to agriculture and would thus require a broader policy response. 1 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions A budget for Europe 2020 , COM(2011)500 final, 29.6.2011. 2 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions The CAP towards 2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future , COM(2010)672 final, 18.11.2010. 3 See in particular the European Parliament resolution of 23 June 2011, 2011/2015(INI), and the Presidency conclusions of 18.3.2011. 4 The current legislative framework comprises Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 (direct payments), Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (market instruments), Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 (rural development) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 (financing).

        "EN 3 EN The pressure on agricultural income is expected to continue as farmers are facing more risks, a slowdown in productivity and a margin squeeze due to rising input prices; there is therefore a need to maintain income support and to reinforce instruments to better manage risks and respond to crisis situations. A strong agriculture is vital for the EU food industry and global food security. At the same time, agriculture and rural areas are being called upon to step up their efforts to meet the ambitious climate and energy targets and biodiversity strategy that are part of the Europe 2020 agenda. Farmers, who are together with foresters the main land managers, will need to be supported in adopting and maintaining farming systems and practices that are particularly favourable to environmental and climate objectives because market prices do not reflect the provision of such public goods. It will also be essential to best harness the diverse potential of rural areas and thus contribute to inclusive growth and cohesion. The future CAP will not, therefore, be a policy that caters only for a small, albeit essential, part of the EU economy, but also a policy of strategic importance for food security, the environment and territorial balance. Therein lies the EU added value of a truly common policy that makes the most efficient use of limited budgetary resources in maintaining a sustainable agriculture throughout the EU, addressing important cross-border issues such as climate change and reinforcing solidarity among Member States, while also allowing flexibility in implementation to cater for local needs. The framework set out in the MFF proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two- pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30 % of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: 1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and 2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation'); \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); ",
        "EN 4 EN \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); \u2013 Proposal for a Council regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers. The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework 5 . A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. 2. RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT On the basis of the evaluation of the current policy framework and an analysis of future challenges and needs, the impact assessment assesses and compares the impact of three alternative scenarios. This is the result of a long process started in April 2010 and steered by an inter-service group that brought together extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, including setting a baseline in the form of medium-term projections for agricultural markets and income up to 2020 and modelling the impact of the different policy scenarios on the economics of the sector. The three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: 1) an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; 2) an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and 3) a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive 5 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund covered by the Common Strategic Framework and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, COM(2011)615 of 6.10.2011.

        "EN 5 EN capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. Against the background of the economic crisis and the pressure on public finances, to which the EU has responded with the Europe 2020 strategy and the MFF proposal, all three scenarios attach different weight to each of the three policy objectives of the future CAP which aims at a more competitive and sustainable agriculture in vibrant rural areas. With a view to a better alignment with the Europe 2020 strategy, notably in terms of resource efficiency, it will be increasingly essential to improve agricultural productivity through research, knowledge transfer and promoting cooperation and innovation (including through the European Innovation Partnership on agricultural productivity and sustainability). Whereas EU agricultural policy does not any more operate within a trade distorting policy environment, additional pressure on the sector is expected from further liberalization, notably in the framework of the DDA or the FTA with Mercosur. The three policy scenarios were drawn up taking into account the preferences expressed in the consultation which was conducted in the context of the impact assessment. Interested parties were invited to submit contributions between 23.11.2010 and 25.1.2011 and an advisory committee was organised on 12.1.2011.The main points are summarized below: 6 \u2013 There is broad agreement among stakeholders on the need for a strong CAP based on a two-pillar-structure in order to address the challenges of food security, sustainable management of natural resources and territorial development. \u2013 Most respondents find that the CAP should play a role in stabilizing markets and prices. \u2013 Stakeholders have diverse opinions concerning the targeting of support (especially redistribution of direct aid and capping payments). \u2013 There is agreement that both pillars can play an important role in stepping up climate action and increasing environmental performance for the benefit of EU society. Whereas many farmers believe that this already takes place today, the wider public argues that Pillar I payments can be more efficiently used. \u2013 The respondents want all parts of the EU, including less favoured areas, to be part of future growth and development. \u2013 The integration of the CAP with other policies, such as environmental, health, trade, development, was emphasised by many respondents. \u2013 Innovation, development of competitive businesses and provision of public goods to EU citizens are seen as ways to align the CAP with the Europe 2020 strategy. The impact assessment thus compared the three alternative policy scenarios: The refocus scenario would accelerate structural adjustment in the agricultural sector, shifting production to the most cost efficient areas and profitable sectors. While significantly increasing funding for the environment, it would also expose the sector to greater risks due to limited scope for market intervention. Furthermore, it would come at a significant social and 6 See Annex 9 of the impact assessment for an overview of the 517 contributions received. ",
        "EN 6 EN environmental cost as the less competitive areas would face a considerable income loss and environmental degradation, since the policy would lose the leverage of direct payments coupled with the cross compliance requirements. At the other end of the spectrum, the adjustment scenario would best allow for policy continuity with limited but tangible improvements both in agricultural competitiveness and environmental performance. There are however serious doubts as to whether this scenario could adequately address the important climate and environmental challenges of the future, which also underpin the long-term sustainability of agriculture. The integration scenario breaks new ground with enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments. The analysis shows that greening is possible at a reasonable cost to farmers although some administrative burden cannot be avoided. Similarly, a new impetus in rural development is possible provided that the new possibilities are efficiently used by Member States and regions and that the common strategic framework with the other EU funds does not remove synergies with Pillar I or weaken rural development's distinctive strengths. If the right balance is struck, this scenario would best address the long term sustainability of agriculture and rural areas. On this basis the impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives and this balance is also found in the implementation of the different elements in the legislative proposals. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. Simplification has been an important consideration throughout the process and should be enhanced in a variety of ways, for instance in the streamlining of cross compliance and market instruments, or the design of the small farmers scheme. In addition, the greening of direct payments should be designed in such a way as to minimize administrative burden including the costs of controls. 3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL It is proposed to maintain the current structure of the CAP in two pillars with annual mandatory measures of general application in Pillar I complemented by voluntary measures better tailored to national and regional specificities under a multi-annual programming approach in Pillar II. However, the new design of direct payments seeks to better exploit synergies with Pillar II, which is in turn placed under a Common Strategic Framework to better coordinate with other EU shared management funds. On this basis, the current structure of four basic legal instruments is also maintained, albeit with the scope of the financing regulation enlarged to bring together common provisions into what is now called the horizontal regulation. The proposals comply with the principle of subsidiarity. The CAP is a truly common policy: it is an area of shared competence between the EU and the Member States that is being handled at EU level with a view to maintaining a sustainable and diverse agriculture throughout the EU, addressing important cross-border issues such as climate change and reinforcing solidarity among Member States. In the light of the importance of future challenges for food security, the environment and territorial balance, the CAP remains a policy of strategic ",
        "EN 7 EN importance to ensure the most effective response to the policy challenges and the most efficient use of budgetary resources. In addition, it is proposed to maintain the current structure of instruments in two pillars where Member States have more leeway to tailor solutions to their local specificities and also co-finance Pillar II. The new European Innovation Partnership and risk management toolkit are also placed within Pillar II. At the same time the policy will be better aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy (including a common framework with other EU funds) and a number of improvements and simplification elements introduced. Finally, the analysis carried out in the framework of the impact assessment clearly shows the cost of no action in terms of negative economic, environmental and social consequences. The Single CMO regulation lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets, with the aid scheme for the most deprived to be placed under a separate instrument. The 2008-2009 dairy crisis showed the need to maintain an effective safety net mechanism as well as to streamline available tools. The discussions in the High Level Expert Group on Milk that followed also pointed to the need to improve the functioning of the food chain. The regulation thus aims to streamline, expand and simplify provisions on the basis of experience to date with public intervention, private storage, exceptional/emergency measures and aid to specific sectors as well as to facilitate cooperation through producer and interbranch organisations. Certain sectoral aids are removed (e.g. skimmed milk, hops and silkworms). The milk quota system and the wine planting ban are set to expire under existing legislation which is thus left unchanged in this respect. Sugar quotas are set to expire by 30 September 2015. A single animal disease / loss of consumer confidence provision and a general market disturbance clause are provided with the latter expanded to cover all sectors in the current Single CMO. The product coverage for recognition of producer organisations and their associations as well as interbranch organisations by Member States is expanded to all sectors in the current Single CMO. Support for the setting up of producer groups in the fruit and vegetable sector is moved to rural development. The regulation reflects the proposal already made for the milk sector that set out basic conditions if Member States make written contracts compulsory with a view to strengthening the bargaining power of milk producers in the food chain. It also reflects the proposal already made on marketing standards in the context of the quality package. From a simplification perspective, doing away with certain sectoral aids, the decoupling of the aid scheme in the silk worm sector, ending the sugar quota system and removing the requirements for registration of supply contracts and for attestation of equivalence in the hops sector will positively impact the burden on Member States and red tape for operators. It will no longer be necessary to maintain a capacity to implement the sectoral aid schemes and to allocate resources to control them. 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION The MFF proposal provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current ",
        "EN 8 EN prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, as well as of EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector and up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. As regards distribution of support among Member States, it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. The distribution of rural development support is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average. Details on the financial impact of the CAP reform proposals are set out in the financial statement accompanying the proposals. ",

(6) It should be clarified that Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] [horizontal CAP Regulation] 13 and the provisions adopted pursuant to it should apply to the measures set out in this Regulation. In particular the [horizontal CAP Regulation] lays down provisions to guarantee compliance with the obligations laid down by CAP provisions, including checks and the application of administrative measures and administrative penalties in case of non-compliance, and rules related to the lodging and releasing of securities and the recovery of undue payments.

(12) In order to stabilise the markets and to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, a differentiated system of price support for the different sectors has been developed and direct support schemes have been introduced, taking into account the different needs in each of these sectors on the one hand and the interdependence between different sectors on the other. Those measures take the form of public intervention or, as the case may be, the payment of aid for private storage. There continues to be a need to maintain price support measures whilst streamlining and simplifying them.

For that purpose it is appropriate to distinguish between reference prices and intervention prices and to define the latter, in particular, clarifying that only intervention prices for public intervention correspond to the applied administered prices referred to in the first sentence of paragraph 8 of Annex 3 to the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (i.e. price gap support). In this context it should be understood that market intervention can take the form of public intervention as well as other forms of intervention that do not use ex-ante established price indications.

(34) The production and marketing of fruit and vegetables should fully take into account environmental concerns, including cultivation practices, management of waste materials and disposal of products withdrawn from the market, in particular as regards protection of water quality, maintenance of biodiversity and the upkeep of the countryside. (35) Support for setting up producer groups should be provided for all sectors in all Member States under rural development policy so the specific support in the fruit and vegetables sector should be discontinued. (36) In order to give producer organisations in the fruit and vegetables sector greater responsibility for their financial decisions and to gear the public resources assigned to them towards future requirements, terms should be set out for the use of those resources. Joint financing of operational funds set up by producer organisations is an appropriate solution. Additional scope for financing should be permitted in particular cases. Operational funds should only be used to finance operational programmes in the fruit and vegetables sector. In order to control Union expenditure, there should be a cap on assistance granted to producer organisations that establish operational funds. (37) In regions where the organisation of production in the fruit and vegetables sector is weak, granting of additional national financial contributions should be allowed. In case of Member States which are at a particular disadvantage with regard to structures, such contributions should be reimbursed by the Union. (38) In order to ensure an efficient, targeted and sustainable support of producer organisations in the fruit and vegetables sector, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of operational funds and operational programmes, the structure and content of ",

(39) It is important to provide for support measures in the wine sector which are liable to strengthen competitive structures. While those measures should be defined and financed by the Union, it should be left to Member States to select the appropriate set of measures to meet the needs of their regional bodies, taking into account their particularities, where necessary, as well as integrating them into national support programmes. Member States should be responsible for the implementation of such programmes. (40) One key measure eligible for national support programmes should be the promotion and marketing of Union wines in third countries. Restructuring and conversion activities should continue to be covered on account of their positive structural effects on the wine sector. Support should also be available for investments in the wine sector which are geared towards improving economic performance of the enterprises as such. Support for by-product distillation should be a measure available to Member States which desire to use such an instrument to ensure the quality of wine, while preserving the environment. (41) Preventive instruments such as harvest insurance, mutual funds and green harvesting should be eligible for support under the wine support programmes so as to encourage a responsible approach to crisis situations. (42) The provisions on support to vine-growers by way of allocation of payment entitlements as decided by Member States were made definitive. Therefore the only such support which may be provided is the one decided by Member States by 1 December 2013 under Article 137 of Regulation (EU) No [COM(2011)799] and under the conditions set out in that provision. (43) In order to ensure that wine support programmes meet their objectives and that there is a targeted use of the European Funds, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of rules: on the responsibility for expenditure between the date of receipt of the support programmes, and modifications to support programmes and their date of applicability; on eligibility criteria of support measures, the type of expenditure and operations eligible for support; measures ineligible for support and the maximum level of support per measure; on changes to support programmes after they have become applicable; on requirements and thresholds for advance payments, including the requirement for a security where an advance payment is made; containing general provisions and definitions for the purposes of support programmes; to avoid misuse of the support measures and double funding of projects; under which producers shall withdraw the by-products of winemaking, exceptions from this obligation in order to avoid additional administrative burden and provisions for the voluntary certification of distillers; laying down the requirements for the Member States for the implementation of the support measures, as well as restrictions to ensure consistency with the scope of the support measures; regarding payments to beneficiaries, including payments through insurance intermediaries.

Moreover, in view of the spread of varroasis in several Member States in recent years and the problems which that disease causes to honey production, action by the Union continues to be necessary as varroasis cannot be completely eradicated and is to be treated with approved products. Given such circumstances and in order to improve the production and marketing of apiculture products in the Union, national programmes for the sector should be drawn up every three years with a view to improving the general conditions for the production and marketing of apiculture products. Those national programmes should be partly financed by the Union. (45) In order to ensure a targeted use of Union funds for apiculture, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of: the measures which may be included in apiculture programmes, rules on the obligations relating to the content of national programmes, their drawing up and the related studies; and the conditions for the allocation of the Union's financial contribution to each participating Member State. (46) Union aid for silkworm rearing should be decoupled into the direct payments system following the approach taken for aids in other sectors. (47) The aid for Union-produced skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder intended for use as a feedingstuff and for processing into casein and caseinates has not proved effective in supporting the market and should therefore be discontinued, along with the rules concerning the use of casein and caseinates in the manufacture of cheese. (48) The application of standards for the marketing of agricultural products can contribute to improving the economic conditions for the production and marketing as well as the quality of such products. The application of such standards is therefore in the interest of producers, traders and consumers. (49) Following the Communication from the Commission on agricultural product quality policy 15 and subsequent debates, it is deemed appropriate to maintain marketing standards by sectors or products, in order to take into account the expectations of consumers and to contribute to the improvement of the economic conditions for the production and marketing of agricultural products as well as to their quality. (50) In order to guarantee that all products are of sound, fair and marketable quality, and without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety 16 , a basic general marketing standard as envisaged in the aforementioned Communication of the Commission should be appropriate for products not covered by marketing standards by sectors or products. When such products conform to an applicable international standard, as appropriate, those products should be considered as conforming to the general marketing standard. (51) For some sectors and/or products, definitions, designations and/or sales descriptions are important elements for the determination of conditions of competition. Therefore, it is appropriate to lay down definitions, designations and sales descriptions for those 15 COM/2009/0234 final. 16 OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1. ",

(54) Taking into account the interest of consumers to receive adequate and transparent product information, it should be possible to determine the place of farming, on a case by case approach at the appropriate geographical level, while taking into account the specificities of some sectors, in particular concerning processed agricultural products. (55) Marketing standards should apply to all agricultural products marketed in the Union. (56) It is appropriate to provide for special rules in respect of products imported from third countries if national provisions in force in third countries justify derogations from the marketing standards if their equivalence to Union legislation is guaranteed. (57) It is appropriate to introduce the possibility for Member States to maintain or adopt certain national rules on quality levels as regards spreadable fats. (58) In order to address changes in the market situation, taking into account the specificity of each sector, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of acts to adopt, modify and derogate from requirements related to the general marketing standard, and rules concerning the conformity to it. (59) In order to take account of the expectations of consumers and to contribute to the improvement of the economic conditions for the production and marketing of agricultural products as well as to their quality and in order to adapt to the constantly changing market conditions, to the evolving consumer demands, as well as in order to take into account the developments in relevant international standards and to take technical progress into account and avoid creating obstacles to product innovation, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of acts to adopt marketing standards by sectors or products, at all stages of the marketing, as well as derogations and exemptions from the application of such standards and in respect of necessary modification, derogation or exemption from definitions and sales descriptions.

(62) The concept of quality wines in the Union is based, inter alia, on the specific characteristics attributable to the wine's geographical origin. Such wines are identified for consumers through protected designations of origin and geographical indications. In order to allow for a transparent and more elaborate framework underpinning the claim to quality by the products concerned, a regime should be established under which applications for a designation of origin or a geographical indication are examined in line with the approach followed by Union's horizontal quality policy applicable to foodstuffs other than wine and spirits in Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs 17 . (63) In order to preserve the particular quality characteristics of wines with a designation of origin or a geographical indication, Member States should be allowed to apply more stringent rules. (64) To qualify for protection in the Union, designations of origin and geographical indications for wine should be recognised and registered at the Union level in accordance with procedural rules laid down by the Commission. (65) Protection should be open to designations of origin and geographical indications of third countries where they are protected in their country of origin. (66) The registration procedure should enable any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest in a Member State or a third country to exercise his rights by notifying his objections. (67) Registered designations of origin and geographical indications should enjoy protection against uses which unduly take advantage of the reputation that complying products command. So as to promote fair competition and not to mislead consumers, that protection should also affect products and services not covered by this Regulation, including those not found in Annex I to the Treaty. (68) In order to take existing labelling practices into account, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of permitting the use of a name of a wine grape variety to be used even though it contains or consists of a protected designation of origin or a protected geographical indication. 17 OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12.

(71) Certain terms are traditionally used in the Union and convey information to consumers about particularities and quality of wines complementing the information conveyed by designations of origin and geographical indications. So as to ensure the working of the internal market and fair competition and to avoid consumers being misled, those traditional terms should be eligible for protection in the Union.

Differences between the laws of the Member States on the labelling of products of the wine sector may impede the smooth functioning of the internal market. Rules should therefore be laid down which take into account the legitimate interests of consumers and producers. For this reason, it is appropriate to provide for Union rules on labelling. (74) In order to ensure compliance with existing labelling practices, with horizontal rules related to labelling and presentation, and to consider the specificities of the wine sector; in order to ensure the efficiency of the certification, approval and verification procedures and the legitimate interests of operators and that economic operators are not prejudiced the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of exceptional circumstances justifying omitting reference to the terms \u201cprotected designation of origin\u201d or \u201cprotected geographical indication\u201d; in respect of the presentation and use of labelling particulars other than those provided for in this Regulation; certain compulsory particulars; optional particulars; and presentation; in respect of the necessary measures as regards labelling and presentation of wines bearing a designation of origin or a geographical indication, whose designation of origin or geographical indication meets the necessary requirements; in respect of wine placed on the market and labelled before 1 August 2009; and in respect of derogations on labelling and presentation.

(76) It is appropriate to lay down rules for the classification of wine grape varieties, according to which Member States producing more than 50 000 hectolitres per year continue to be responsible for classifying the wine grape varieties from which wine may be made on their territories. Certain wine grape varieties should be excluded. (77) It is appropriate to determine certain oenological practices and restrictions for the production of wine, in particular as regards coupage and the use of certain types of grape must, grape juice and fresh grapes originating in third countries. In order to meet the international standards, for further oenological practices, the Commission should as a general rule base itself on the oenological practices recommended by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV). (78) For the wine sector, Member States should be allowed to limit or to exclude the use of certain oenological practices and be allowed to keep more stringent restrictions for wines produced in their territory, as well as permit the experimental use of unauthorised oenological practices under conditions to be defined. (79) In order to provide for a satisfactory level of traceability of the products concerned, in particular in the interest of consumer protection, provision should be made for all the wine sector products covered by this Regulation to have an accompanying document when circulating within the Union.

Therefore, the standard provisions governing agreements between them should be established.

(85) Producer organisations and their associations can play useful roles in concentrating supply and promoting best practices. Interbranch organisations can play important part in allowing dialogue between actors in the supply chain, and in promoting best practices and market transparency. Existing rules on the definition and recognition of such organisations and their associations covering certain sectors should therefore be harmonised, streamlined and extended to provide for recognition on request under statutes set out in EU law in all sectors.

(89) In order to improve the operation of the market for wines, Member States should be able to implement decisions taken by interbranch organisations. The scope of such decisions should, however, exclude practices which could distort competition. (90) In the absence of Union legislation on formalised, written contracts, Member States may, within their own contract law systems, make the use of such contracts compulsory provided that in doing so the Union law is respected and in particular that the proper functioning of the internal market and the common market organisation is respected. Given the diversity of situations across the Union, in the interests of subsidiarity, such a decision should remain with Member States. However, in the milk and milk products sector, to ensure appropriate minimum standards for such contracts and good functioning of the internal market and the common market organisation, some basic conditions for the use of such contracts should be laid down at the Union level. Since some dairy co-operatives may have rules with similar effect in their statues, in the interests of simplicity they should be exempted from the requirement for a contract. In order to ensure that any such system is effective it should apply equally where intermediate parties collect milk from farmers to deliver to processors. (91) In order to ensure the rational development of production and thus a fair standard of living for dairy farmers, their bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis processors should be strengthened which should result in a fairer distribution of value-added along the supply chain. Therefore, in order to attain these CAP objectives, a provision should be adopted pursuant to Articles 42 and 43(2) of the Treaty to allow producer organisations constituted by dairy farmers or their associations to negotiate contract terms, including price, for some or all of its members' production with a dairy. In order to maintain effective competition on the dairy market, this possibility should be subject to appropriate quantitative limits. (92) The registration of all supply contracts regarding hops produced in the Union is a burdensome measure and should be discontinued.

That trading system should include import duties and export refunds and should, in principle, stabilise the Union market. The trading system should be based on the undertakings accepted under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and in bilateral agreements. (95) Monitoring trade flows is foremost a matter of management which should be addressed in a flexible way. The decision on the introduction of licence requirements should be made taking account of the need for licences for the management of the markets concerned and, in particular, for monitoring the imports or exports of the products in question. (96) In order to take account of the evolution of trade and market developments, the needs of the markets concerned and when necessary for monitoring imports or exports, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the list of the products of sectors subject to the presentation of an import or export licence; and the cases and situations where the presentation of an import or export licence is not required.

Administrative cooperation between the authorities in the importing third country and the Union is necessary to ensure the correct application of such a system. To that end, the products should be accompanied by a certificate issued in the Union. (104) In order to ensure that products that are exported may benefit from a special treatment on import into a third country if certain conditions are respected, in accordance with agreements concluded by the Union in accordance with Article 218 of the Treaty, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of requiring the competent authorities of the Member States, on request and after appropriate checks, to issue a document certifying that the conditions are met. (105) The customs duty system makes it possible to dispense with all other protective measures at the external borders of the Union. The internal market and duty mechanism could, in exceptional circumstances, prove to be inadequate. In such cases, in order not to leave the Union market without defence against disturbances that might ensue, the Union should be able to take all necessary measures without delay. Such measures should comply with the international commitments of the Union. (106) The possibility of prohibiting the use of inward and outward processing arrangements should be provided for.

Subsidised exports should be subject to limits in terms of value and quantity. (108) Compliance with the limits in terms of value should be ensured at the time when the export refunds are fixed through the monitoring of payments under the rules relating to the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. Monitoring can be facilitated by the compulsory advance fixing of export refunds, while allowing the possibility, in the case of differentiated refunds, of changing the specified destination within a geographical area to which a single export refund rate applies. In the case of a change of destination, the export refund applicable to the actual destination should be paid, with a ceiling on the amount applicable to the destination fixed in advance. (109) Compliance with the quantity limits should be ensured by a reliable and effective system of monitoring. To that end, the granting of export refunds should be made subject to an export licence. Export refunds should be granted up to the limits available, depending on the particular situation of each product concerned. Exceptions to that rule should be permitted only for processed products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty, to which volume limits do not apply. Provision should be made for a derogation from strict compliance with management rules where exports benefiting from export refunds are not likely to exceed the quantity laid down.

(117) In order to take account of the specificities of the different sectors, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of specific requirements and conditions for operators and of the products eligible for an export refund including, in particular, the definition and characteristics of the products, and the establishment of coefficients for the purposes of calculating export refunds. (118) In order to prevent illicit crops from disturbing the market for hemp for fibre, this Regulation should provide for checks on imports of hemp and hemp seed to ensure that such products offer certain guarantees with regard to the tetrahydrocannabinol content. In addition, imports of hemp seed intended for uses other than sowing should continue to be subject to a control system which provides for the authorisation of the importers concerned. (119) Minimum export prices for flowering bulbs are no longer useful and should be abolished. (120) In accordance with Article 42 of the Treaty the provisions of the Treaty concerning competition shall apply to production of and trade in agricultural products only to the extent determined by Union legislation within the framework of Article 43(2) and (3) of the Treaty and in accordance with the procedure laid down therein. ",
        "EN 27 EN (121) The rules on competition relating to the agreements, decisions and practices referred to in Article 101 of the Treaty and to the abuse of dominant positions should be applied to the production of, and trade in, agricultural products, in so far as their application does not jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of the CAP. (122) A special approach should be allowed in the case of farmers' or producer organisations or their associations the objective of which is the joint production or marketing of agricultural products or the use of joint facilities, unless such joint action excludes competition or jeopardises the attainment of the objectives of Article 39 of the Treaty. (123) A special approach should be allowed as regards certain activities of interbranch organisations on the condition that they do not lead to the partitioning of markets, affect the sound operation of the CMO, distort or eliminate competition, entail the fixing of prices, or create discrimination. (124) The proper working of the single market would be jeopardised by the granting of national aid. Therefore, the provisions of the Treaty governing State aid should, as a general rule, apply to agricultural products. In certain situations exceptions should be allowed. Where such exceptions apply, the Commission should be in a position to draw up a list of existing, new or proposed national aid, to make appropriate observations to the Member States and to propose suitable measures. (125) Due to the specific economic situation of the production and marketing of reindeer and reindeer products, Finland and Sweden should continue to grant national payments in that regard. (126) In order to address justified cases of crisis even after the end of the transitional period, the distillation support measure provided for under the support programmes in 2012, Member States should be able to make national payments for crisis distillation within an overall budgetary limit of 15 % of the respective value of the Member State's relevant yearly budget for its national support programme. Such national payments should be notified to the Commission and approved under this Regulation before being granted. (127) The provisions on the grubbing-up premium and certain measures under wine support programmes should not by themselves preclude national payments for the same purposes. (128) In Finland sugar beet growing is subject to particular geographical and climatic conditions which will adversely affect the sector beyond the general effects of the sugar reform. That Member State should therefore be authorised, on a permanent basis, to make national payments to its sugar beet growers. (129) Member States should be allowed to continue to make national payments for nuts as currently provided for under Article 120 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in order to cushion the effects of decoupling of the former Union aid scheme for nuts. For clarity, since that Regulation is to be repealed, the national payments should be provided for in this Regulation.

Experience shows that serious market disturbances such as a significant drop in consumption or in prices may be attributed to a loss in consumer confidence due to public health or animal or plant health risks. In the light of experience measures attributable to a loss in consumer confidence should be extended to plant products. (131) The exceptional market support measures for beef and veal, milk and milk products, pigmeat, sheepmeat and goatmeat, eggs and poultrymeat should be directly related to health and veterinary measures adopted in order to combat the spread of disease. They should be taken at the request of Member States in order to avoid serious disruption on the markets. (132) Special intervention measures should be provided in order to react efficiently and effectively against threats of market disturbance. The scope of those measures should be defined. (133) In order to react efficiently and effectively against threats of market disturbance caused by significant price rises or falls on internal or external markets or any other factors affecting the market, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the necessary measures for the sector concerned including, where necessary, measure to extend or modify the scope, duration or other aspects of other measures provided for under this Regulation, or suspend import duties in whole or in part including for certain quantities and/or periods. (134) The Commission should be authorised to adopt the necessary measures to solve specific problems in case of emergency. (135) Undertakings, Member States and/or third countries may be required to submit communications for the purposes of applying this Regulation, monitoring, analysing and managing the market in agricultural products, ensuring market transparency, the proper functioning of CAP measures, of checking, controlling, monitoring, evaluating and auditing CAP measures, and implementing international agreements, including notification requirements under those agreements. In order to ensure a harmonised, streamlined and simplified approach, the Commission should be empowered to adopt all the necessary measures regarding communications. In so doing it should take into account the data needs and synergies between potential data sources. (136) In order to make communications fast, efficient, accurate, and cost effective, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the nature and type of the information to be notified; the methods of notification; the rules related to the access rights to the information or information systems made available; and the conditions and means of publication of the information. (137) Union legislation concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, in particular Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals ",

(138) Funds should be transferred from the Reserve for crises in the agricultural sector under the conditions and procedure referred to in paragraph 14 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management 18 , and it should be clarified that this Regulation is the applicable basic act. (139) In order to ensure the smooth transition from the arrangements provided for in Regulation (EU) No [COM(2010)799] to those laid down in this Regulation, the power to adopt certain acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the necessary measures, in particular those necessary to protect the acquired rights and legitimate expectations of undertakings. (140) The use of urgency procedure should be reserved for exceptional cases where this proves to be necessary in order to react efficiently and effectively against threats of market disturbance or where market disturbances are occurring. The choice of an urgency procedure should be justified and the cases in which the urgency procedure should be used should be specified. (141) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers 19 . (142) The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of the acts implementing this Regulation given that those acts relate to the CAP as referred to in point (ii) of Article 2(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. However, the advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of the acts implementing this Regulation relating to competition matters given that the advisory procedure is used for the adoption of acts implementing competition law in general. (143) The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases imperative grounds of urgency so require, relating to adopting, amending or revoking Union safeguard measures, suspending the use of processing or inward or outward processing arrangements, if necessary to react immediately to the market situation, and resolving specific problems in an emergency, if such immediate action is needed to deal with the problems. (144) In respect of certain measures under this Regulation which require swift action or which consist in the mere application of general provisions to specific situations without involving discretion, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts without applying Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. 18 OJ L [\u2026], [\u2026], p.

(146) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No [COM(2010)799] several sectoral measures, including on milk quotas, sugar quotas and other sugar measures and the restrictions on the planting of vines, as well as certain state aids, will expire within a reasonable period following the entry in force of this Regulation. After the repeal of Regulation (EU) No [COM(2010)799], the relevant provisions should continue to apply until the end of the schemes concerned. (147) In order to ensure a smooth transition from the arrangements provided for in Regulation (EU) No [COM(2010)799] to the provisions of this Regulation, the Commission should be empowered to adopt transitional measures. (148) Council Regulation (EC) No 1601/96 of 30 July 1996 laying down, in respect of hops, the amount of aid to producers for the 1995 harvest 20 is a temporary measure, which by its nature, is now obsolete. Council Regulation (EC) No 1037/2001 of 22 May 2001 authorising the offer and delivery for direct human consumption of certain imported wines which may have undergone oenological processes not provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 21 has been superseded by the provisions of the Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on trade in wine adopted by Council Decision 2006/232/EC of 20 December 2005 22 and is therefore obsolete. In the interests of clarity and legal certainty Regulations (EC) No 1601/96 and (EC) No 1037/2001 should be repealed. (149) As regards contractual relations in the milk and milk products sectors, the measures set out in this Regulation, are justified in the current economic circumstances of the dairy market and the structure of the supply chain. They should therefore be applied for a sufficiently long duration (both before and after the abolition of milk quotas) to allow them to have full effect. However, given their far-reaching nature, they should nevertheless be temporary in nature, and be subject to review. The Commission should adopt reports on the development of the milk market, covering in particular potential incentives to encourage farmers to enter into joint production agreements, to be submitted by 30 June 2014 and 31 December 2018 respectively, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 20 OJ L 206, 16.8.1996, p. 46. 21 OJ L 87, 24.3.2007, p. 1. 22 OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 12.

Expected result(s) and impact It is not possible to set quantitative targets for impact indicators at this stage. Although the policy can steer in a certain direction, the broad economic, environmental and social outcomes measured by such indicators would ultimately also depend on the impact from a range of external factors, which recent experience indicates have become significant and unpredictable. Further analysis is on-going, to be ready for the period post-2013. As regards the direct payments, Member States will have the possibility to decide, to a limited degree, on the implementation of certain components of the direct payment schemes. For rural development, the expected results and impact will depend on the rural development programmes that Member States will submit to the Commission. Member States will be asked to set targets in their programmes. 1.4.4. Indicators of results and impact The proposals provide for the establishment of a common monitoring and evaluation framework with a view to measuring the performance of the Common Agricultural Policy. That framework shall include all instruments related to the monitoring and evaluation of CAP measures and in particular of the direct payments, market measures, rural development measures and of the application of cross compliance. The impact of these CAP measures shall be measured in relation to the following objectives: (a) viable food production, with a focus on agricultural income, agricultural productivity and price stability; (b) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action, with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, soil and water; (c) balanced territorial development, with a focus on rural employment, growth and poverty in rural areas. By means of implementing acts, the Commission shall define the set of indicators specific to these objectives and areas. ",
        "EN 228 EN Moreover, as regards rural development, a reinforced common monitoring and evaluation system is proposed. That system aims (a) to demonstrate the progress and achievements of rural development policy and assess the impact, effectiveness, efficiency and relevance of rural development policy interventions, (b) to contribute to better targeted support for rural development, and (c) to support a common learning process related to monitoring and evaluation. The Commission will establish, by means of implementing act, a list of common indicators linked to the policy priorities. 1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term In order to meet the multi-annual strategic objectives of the CAP which are a direct translation of the Europe 2020 strategy for European rural areas and to fulfil the relevant requirements of the Treaty, the proposals aim to lay down the legislative framework for the Common Agricultural Policy for the period after 2013. 1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement The future CAP will not only be a policy that caters for a small, albeit essential, part of the EU economy, but also a policy of strategic importance for food security, the environment and territorial balance. Thus, the CAP, as a truly common policy, makes the most efficient use of limited budgetary resources in maintaining a sustainable agriculture throughout the EU, addressing important cross-border issues such as climate change and reinforcing solidarity among Member States. As mentioned in the Commission communication \"A Budget for Europe 2020\" 54 , the CAP is a genuinely European policy. Instead of operating 27 separate agricultural policies and budgets, Member States pool resources to operate a single European policy with a single European budget. This naturally means that the CAP accounts for a significant proportion of the EU budget. However, this approach is both more efficient and economical than an uncoordinated national approach. 1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past On the basis of the evaluation of the current policy framework, an extensive consultation with stakeholders as well as an analysis of future challenges and needs, a comprehensive impact assessment has been carried out. More details can be found in the impact assessment and the explanatory memorandum that are accompanying the legal proposals. 1.5.4. Coherence and possible synergy with other relevant instruments The legislative proposals concerned by this financial statement should be seen in the broader context of the proposal for a single framework regulation with common rules for the common strategic framework funds (EAFRD, ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund and EMFF). That framework regulation will make an important contribution to reducing administrative burden, 54 COM(2011)500 final of 29 June 2011. ",

This also underpins the new concepts of the common strategic framework for all these funds and the upcoming Partnership Contracts which will also cover these funds. The common strategic framework, which will be established, will translate the objectives and priorities of the Europe 2020 Strategy into priorities for the EAFRD together with the ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund and EMFF, which will ensure an integrated use of the funds to deliver common objectives. The common strategic framework will also set out coordination mechanisms with other relevant Union policies and instruments. Moreover, as regards the CAP, significant synergies and simplification effects will be obtained by harmonising and aligning the management and control rules for the first (EAGF) and second (EAFRD) pillar of the CAP. The strong link between the EAGF and the EAFRD should be maintained and the structures already in place in the Member States be sustained. 1.6.

        "EN 231 EN 2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules In terms of monitoring and evaluation of the CAP, the Commission will present a report to the European Parliament and the Council every 4 years, with the first report to be presented not later than end 2017. This is complemented by specific provisions in all areas of the CAP, with various comprehensive reporting and notifications requirements to be specified in the implementing rules. As regards rural development, rules are also provided for monitoring at programme level, which will be aligned with the other funds, and which will be coupled with ex ante, on-going and ex post evaluations. 2.2. Management and control system 2.2.1. Risk(s) identified There are more than seven million beneficiaries of the CAP, receiving support under a large variety of different aid schemes, each of which having detailed and sometimes complex eligibility criteria. The reduction in the error rate in the domain of the common agricultural policy can already be considered as a trend. Thus, most recently an error rate close to 2% confirms the overall positive assessment of previous years. It is the intention to continue the efforts in order to achieve an error rate below 2%. 2.2.2. Control method(s) envisaged The legislative package, in particular the proposal for the regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy, envisages maintaining and reinforcing the current system established by Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. It provides for a compulsory administrative structure at Member State level, centred around accredited paying agencies, which are responsible for carrying out controls at final beneficiary level in accordance with the principles set out under point 2.3. Every year, the head of each paying agency is required to provide a statement of assurance which covers the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts, the proper functioning of the internal control systems and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. An independent audit body is required to provide an opinion on all these three elements. The Commission will continue to audit agricultural expenditure, using a risk-based approach in order to ensure that its audits are targeted to the areas of highest risk. Where these audits reveal that expenditure has been incurred in breach of Union rules, it will exclude the amounts concerned from Union financing under the conformity clearance system. ",
        "EN 232 EN As regards the cost of controls, a detailed analysis is provided in annex 8 to the impact assessment accompanying the legislative proposals. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities The legislative package, in particular the proposal for the regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy, envisages maintaining and reinforcing the current detailed systems for controls and penalties to be applied by the paying agencies, with common basis features and special rules tailored to the specificities of each aid regime. The systems generally provide for exhaustive administrative controls of 100% of the aid applications, cross-checks with other databases where this is considered appropriate as well as pre-payment on-the-spot checks of a minimum number of transactions, depending on the risk associated with the regime in question. If these on-the-spot checks reveal a high number of irregularities, additional checks must be carried out. In this context, the by far most important system is the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), which in financial year 2010 covered around 80% of total expenditure under the EAGF and the EAFRD. For Member States with properly functioning control systems and low error rates, the Commission will be empowered to allow for a reduction of the number of on-the-spot checks. The package further envisages that Member States shall prevent, detect and correct irregularities and fraud, impose effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties as laid down in Union legislation or national law, and recover any irregular payments plus interests. It includes an automatic clearance mechanism for irregularity cases, which provides that if recovery has not taken place within four years of the date of the recovery request, or within eight years in the case of legal proceedings, the amounts not recovered shall be borne by the Member State concerned. This mechanism will be a strong incentive for Member States to recover irregular payments as quickly as possible. ",
        "EN 233 EN 3. ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE The amounts indicated in this financial statement are expressed in current prices and in commitments. In addition to the changes resulting from the legislative proposals as listed in the accompanying tables below, the legislative proposals imply further changes which have no financial impact. For any of the years in the period 2014-2020, the application of financial discipline cannot be excluded at this stage. However, this will not depend on the reform proposals as such, but on other factors, such as the execution of direct aids or future developments in the agricultural markets. As concerns direct aids, the extended net ceilings for 2014 (calendar year 2013) included in the proposal regarding transition are higher than the amounts allocated to direct aids indicated in the accompanying tables. The purpose of this extension is to ensure a continuation of the existing legislation in a scenario in which all the other elements would remain unchanged, without prejudice to the possible need for applying the financial discipline mechanism. The reform proposals contain provisions giving Member States a set degree of flexibility in relation to their allocation of direct aids respectively rural development. In case Member States decide to use that flexibility, this will have financial consequences within the given financial amounts, which cannot be quantified at this stage. This financial statement does not take into account the possible use of the crises reserve. It should be underlined that the amounts taken into account for market-related expenditure are based on no public intervention buying-in and other measures related to a crisis situation in any sectors. 3.1.
