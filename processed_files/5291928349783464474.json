        "Review of the Implementation in the EU of area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change 3 Foreword Foreword Climate change is a multiplier of environmen- tal changes and has major impacts on the lives of women and men. These impacts and conse- quences are not gender-neutral. Women and men have different needs, priorities and possibilities of mitigating the effect of the impact and adapting to climate change. Therefore policies on climate change and actions taken can be more effective and enhance equality if they take into account gender aspects. The following publication summarises the main findings of EIGE\u2019s Report on implementation of one of the twelve areas of concern of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action for Equality, Development and Peace (BPfA). Like the second report, it continues the series of EIGE reports, pre- pared in support of the Presidencies of the EU Council, in the follow-up of the BPfA. The topic of the Report selected by the Danish Presidency of the Council of the European Union is gender equality and climate change and it focuses on the participation of women and men in decision mak- ing in the public sector, related to climate change and education in scientific and technical fields. Given that this area is considerably broad and un- explored, the analysis and discussions have been focused on women\u2019s involvement in decision making related to climate change and segmenta- tion of education by gender. It presents data on women\u2019s participation in decision making on cli- mate change in the public sector, demonstrating a low level of participation by women, whether it is on national, EU or international level. The report also presents the latest available sex disaggregat- ed data on women\u2019s enrolment rates in natural sci- ences and technology related tertiary education in the EU Member States. EIGE proposes to introduce new indicators in this area. The findings demonstrate that women are less likely than men to choose scientific and techno- logical subjects. The proportion of women tertiary graduates is particularly low in engineering and transport \u2013 two fields particularly related to the transport and energy sectors that are important for climate change. In 13 Member States women occupy at least one- quarter of the high level positions in the three public sectors analysed \u2013 transport, energy and environment; the environment sector being more gender balanced than the transport and energy sectors. In four Member States the representation by women is even less than 15%. As was concluded by the Ministers of the Nordic Countries in 2009, \u201cwe need the talents and re- sources of everyone. Men and women think in dif- ferent ways and contribute differently to solutions. In order to ensure this diversity, men and women must have equal opportunities to influence and benefit from the investments that are made to ad- dress climate change (adaptation/mitigation). This process will make men and women equal and full- fledged collaborative partners and citizens.\u201d 1 We are grateful to everybody who contributed to this publication and especially to the Euro- pean Commission Directorate-General for Justice and EIGE\u2019s Working Group on Beijing indicators. The publication brings additional substantiated evidence to the debates on gender equality and equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union.

        "Review of the Implementation in the EU of area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change 6 Introduction Introduction The 4 th World Conference on Women, held in Bei- jing in 1995, officially adopted the Beijing Declara- tion and Platform for Action for Equality, Develop- ment and Peace (BPfA). The BPfA outlines strategic objectives and actions to be taken by the inter- national community, national governments and civil society for the promotion and protection of human rights for women and the girl child as in- alienable, integral and indivisible elements of uni- versal human rights and fundamental freedoms of all women throughout their lives. By signing up to the document, the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU) officially ac- knowledged their responsibility for taking action to implement the BPfA and undertook to moni- tor and report on progress in each of the areas of concern. Although primary responsibility for the advancement of women lies with national govern- ments, the EU was involved in drawing up the Bei- jing Declaration and supports its Member States in taking action. Since 2010 the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has been supporting the Presiden- cies of the Council of the European Union in the follow-up to the BPfA. Denmark, which holds the Presidency of the Council of the EU during the first half of 2012, decided, in cooperation with the Commission, the High Level Group on Gender Mainstreaming and EIGE to review the area enti- tled Women and the Environment focusing on gender equality and climate change and thereby to propose indicators in this area. Two important dimensions of objective K.1 have been considered: women\u2019s participation in climate change decision- making at the national, EU and international levels, and the proportion of women tertiary graduates in scientific and technical fields related to climate change. This summary presents the main findings of the report. 2 ",
        "Review of the Implementation in the EU of area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change 7 The gender dimension of climate change The gender dimension of climate change Climate change is one of the greatest chal- lenges of the modern era. It is an important area of policy intervention in the European Union. The EU has adopted an integrated approach to climate and energy policy and plays a leading role in strengthening global efforts to protect the climate. Moreover, the EU is committed to striving for equality between women and men in all its activities. EU commitment to gender mainstreaming calls for actions and concrete measures so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in environmental policies and programmes at all levels and at all stages by the actors involved in policy-making. Climate change is a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or its vari- ability, persisting for an extended period. Accord- ing to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 3 there is no doubt that warming of the climate system is actually taking place, accord- ing with the evidence of global average air and ocean temperatures increases, melting of snow and ice in the northern hemisphere and rising sea levels, all affecting natural and human environ- ments. Anthropogenic or human-induced climate change, caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emis- sions, is widely acknowledged as one of the great- est challenges of our time. The expected impacts of climate change in the EU include more frequent extreme weather events, high temperatures and drought (in particular in Southern Europe), retreat of glaciers and reduced snow cover. Consequenc- es will include increased risk of flash floods and coastal flooding, increased erosion, more frequent wildfires, extensive species loss, reduced water availability and crop productivity. These geo-phys- ical impacts will result in socio-economic impacts such as effects on human health and pressure on economic activities such as tourism. In Europe, the energy and transport sectors are responsible for the bulk of GHG emissions; there- fore, they are key to mitigation, or the prevention of future climate change. According to data from the European Environment Agency (EEA), 4 the most important sources of GHG emissions across the EU-27 are that of fuel combustion for energy transformation, transport, and a range of indus- trial activities. Also important are agriculture and waste. It is noteworthy that the share of transport in overall GHG emissions increased from 13.8% in 1990 to 20.2% in 2009. The EU has taken the lead in developing ambi- tious climate change policies and has put in place various initiatives. 5 In addition to these initiatives within the EU, international negotiations are taking place within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These aim at an agree- ment on further commitments and mechanisms to reduce global warming, to cope with its inevi- table impacts and to provide financial support to developing countries. The gender dimension of climate change has so far been relatively absent from these debates and policy initiatives in the EU and other developed ",
        "Review of the Implementation in the EU of area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change 8 The gender dimension of climate change countries. This is an important issue to be consid- ered as socially constructed roles and identities as well as underlying power dynamics affect the way women and men contribute to, experience and respond to climate change. Women and men are, firstly, affected differently by the impacts of climate change. Gender-dif- ferentiated roles and responsibilities in families and households as well as gender segregated labour market and income gap, cause differ- entiated vulnerabilities of women and men to the effects of climate change (Figures 1, 2 and 3). They include more casualties among women during extreme weather events and stressful experiences of recovering from disasters. Eco- nomic disparities lead to differences in adaptive capacity. On average, women\u2019s salaries and as- sets are lower than men\u2019s. This may place single mothers and elderly women in a disadvantaged position when expensive adaptation measures are required. Furthermore, care work may in- crease due to health impacts of climate change, or due to natural disasters, putting additional burdens on those who are mainly responsible for caring.

        "Review of the Implementation in the EU of area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change 10 The gender dimension of climate change Secondly, there is evidence that women and men living in Europe contribute differently to GHG emissions, and thus to climate change. These dif- ferences are based on gender roles and identities that affect the behaviour and consumption pat- terns of women and men. The few quantitative data that are available indicate that women, on average, generate less gas emissions than men, in particular in the transport sector. Significant stud- ies have shown that women and men have differ- ent travel patterns, and that women tend to travel in a more sustainable way than men. Nutrition is another example, as women\u2019s daily meat con- sumption tends to be lower, and raising livestock contributes to agricultural GHG emissions. Women also tend to be more aware of environmental and health issues, and more willing to change their be- haviour in response to environmental pressures.

Research has shown that the options available to women and men to convert to a low-carbon lifestyle are shaped by education, gender roles, division of labour in the household and income. For instance, women tend to spend more time indoors as they more often have care responsibilities in their families, and thus depend to a greater extent on space heating. For mobil- ity, women depend on access to public transport to a larger degree (Figure 4), due to lower levels of car ownership and because of their preferences for the use of environmentally-friendly solutions (public transport). Owing to their lower incomes, women have a greater risk of energy poverty than men, and have fewer options for investing in low carbon options such as energy efficiency and re- newable energies. Moreover, women feel less well informed about such options and express a great- er need for adequate information. A fourth aspect is that women and men have different perceptions of and attitudes towards options for climate change mitigation (Figure 5). Women, in general, are more concerned about cli- mate change. They feel a greater need for action to tackle climate change, and are more likely to be willing to change their behaviour. Men generally have more trust in technological solutions. The preferences of women and men in terms of ener- gy supply options vary significantly. For example, women are more likely than men to reject nuclear power. Women are more in favour of policy meas- ures to reduce car use than men. ",

Women and men \u2013 largely owing to their gender roles, power relations, incomes and assets \u2013 have differing vulnerabilities to climate change and contribute in different ways to harmful global GHG emissions. They have differentiated capabilities to mitigate emissions as well as differing coping and adaptation strategies and distinct perceptions and preferences regarding policies and measures to reduce emissions. All of these gender differences need to be taken into account when developing climate change policies, measures and instru- ments. ",
        "Review of the Implementation in the EU of area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change 12 The gender dimension of climate change Cross-cutting all these dimensions is the issue of power relations and participation in climate policy, addressing the question of who is planning and deciding, and how the planning and decision- making are carried out. An equal representation of women and men in decision-making positions, in climate change research, technology develop- ment and in international negotiations is an im- portant prerequisite for gender-responsive climate change policy. The limited consideration this dimension of cli- mate change policy has received to date can be partially explained by an overall lack of awareness of the aspects mentioned above. In addition, there is a lack of research that provides stronger evi- dence to consider the gender aspects in climate change policy making in the EU. Climate change is often still considered as a \u201cgender-neutral\u201d policy. The link between gender-sensitive climate policy and gender equality in decision-making has not been sufficiently researched. Nevertheless, gen- der equality in decision-making is a question of democracy and justice, and thus is a goal in itself. The higher enrolment of women in science and technology related fields that lead to careers in the energy and transport sectors is a prerequisite to obtaining entry to the institutions and power structures which control and support climate change policy making. This report proposes indicators to measure the ex- tent of women\u2019s participation in decision-making in public sector on climate change policies at na- tional, EU and international levels in the sectors of environment, transport and energy in the Member States and at the EU level, and segmentation of ed- ucation by gender in the areas of natural sciences and technologies.

        "Review of the Implementation in the EU of area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change 13 Gender equality and climate change: new indicators Gender equality and climate change: new indicators The proposed indicators measure the involvement of women in decision-making on climate change in the public sector and segmentation of educa- tion in fields related to environment and climate change. To address these issues, the indicators cover the proportion of women in climate change decision-making bodies at national, EU and inter- national level and the proportion of women ter- tiary graduates in natural sciences and technolo- gies at the EU and Member States level. Proposed indicators address national, EU and in- ternational political decision-making levels. While climate change decision-making undoubtedly occurs at the local and regional levels as well, the data sources for this are very dispersed and diffi- cult to collect. Moreover, as there is great variety in types of local and regional authorities across the EU Member States, establishing a comparable ba- sis for data collection would be very difficult. Climate change is by its nature a multi-sectoral is- sue, and impacts the work of a wide range of sec- toral institutions. In the EU, competence for policy making that directly addresses climate change (e.g. GHG emissions targets, overall adaptation strate- gies, etc.) is typically located within environmen- tal authorities. The transport and energy sectors are together responsible for the majority of GHG emissions and have important roles in determin- ing responses to climate change. The proposed indicators therefore focus on these three sectors and, where possible, on specific departmental re- sponsibilities that are related to climate change, including sustainable transport and energy. Education is one of the factors grounding a career path for decision-making positions. In line with the decision to focus on the energy and transport sec- tors, the fourth indicator considers the proportion of women graduates in natural sciences and tech- nologies, focusing on tertiary education \u2013 the de- grees that are necessary for high-level professional qualifications. Natural sciences cover subjects like biology, chemistry and physics, which are often the educational background for professions in the environment sector \u2013 but can also relate to the energy sector, particularly with regard to renew- able energy technologies. Technologies include the study of all engineering disciplines, including electricity and different energy sources, transpor- tation services and engineering, civil engineering and building, and environmental protection. Tech- nical education in these fields prepares graduates to contribute to policy making on the regulation and use of processes and technologies to combat climate change; these include energy efficiency in buildings, renewable energy markets, automotive solutions, urban public transport, and many oth- ers. The four indicators addressing the role of women in climate change decision-making in the pub- lic sector and women graduates in scientific and technological fields are presented below, along with the key data to support them.

        "Review of the Implementation in the EU of area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change 14 Gender equality and climate change: new indicators Participation in climate change decision-making Besides the various gender dimensions of climate change and its impacts that were previously intro- duced, it is important to address the question of who determines how the planning and decision- making processes take place, and how research informs and shapes them. Indicator 1: Proportion of women in climate change deci- sion-making bodies at the national level in EU Member States This indicator provide information on the per- centage of women and men in national authori- ties with the highest level of decision-making competences (typically ministries) in environment/ climate change, transport and energy policy. Ministerial positions within three sectors across 27 Member States (81 institutions) were classified into three hierarchical levels of decision-making. Level 1 covers the highest levels/positions in the Minis- try (political level), Level 2 covers the top level of managerial or administrative decision-making in the Ministry, and usually the civil servant who is the head of the Ministry and Level 3 will cover the heads of sectoral departments or divisions. Women are slightly less likely to hold level 1 po- sitions than levels 2 or 3: only 18.2% of positions (or 29 of 159) on level 1 are held by women, while 27.0% of positions (or 41 of 152) on level 2 and 27.6% of positions (or 132 of 479) on level 3 are held by women. The indicator shows the extent to which women occupy positions relevant for climate change de- cision-making, which is an indicator of their overall role in decision-making. Data is broken down into the three sectors, and the total figure calculates the sum of all positions considered in 2011. At the national level, women in EU Member States appear to play a greater role in high-level decision- making in the environment sector, as opposed to transport and energy. In 2011, women occupied more than one-third (33.9%) of high-level positions relevant to climate change in the environmental sector; the respective figure for the transport sec- tor stands at 20.2%, and 17.3% for the energy sec- tor (Figure 6). The average figure for all sectors is just above one quarter (25.6%). The role of women in climate change-related ministries varies considerably across the Mem- ber States (Figure 7). Only Finland and Sweden have equal number of women and men (50.0%) occupying high-level positions related to climate change decision-making in the environment, transport and energy sectors. Other Member States with figures above the average are Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Spain. On average, women occupy 25.6% of high-level decision-making positions in the environment, transport and energy sectors in the Member States. Women\u2019s role in political decision-making (level 1) is lower in proportion to operational or de- partment head positions (level 2 and 3). ",

These are the institutions re- sponsible for preparing, evaluating and approving EU policies and laws. Although the Council of the European Union (or Council of Ministers) also has a role in defining and deciding on EU laws and poli- cies, the membership of the Council is comprised of national ministers (according to topic), and this data has already been tracked in Indicator 1. For the European Commission, four Directorates- General (DGs) are considered: DG Climate Action, DG Environment, DG Mobility and Transport, and DG Energy. Here, in contrast to the situation at na- tional level, women play a greater role in high-level decision-making (40% of positions in each are held by women). In DG Environment, women hold 25% of the high-level positions, and in DG Mobility and Transport, this figure is reduced to 12.5%. It should be noted that the overall data sample with- in the European Commission is relatively small, mean- ing that individual fluctuations within the positions have a great effect on the overall figures. Further data collection over time to establish a trend would pro- vide a more reliable indicator of women\u2019s role in EU- level climate change decision-making. For the European Parliament, participation in the three committees most closely related to the environment, transport and energy sectors was considered: Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; Transport and Tourism; Industry, Research and Energy.

For the Industry, Research and Energy Committee, the percentage of women is significantly lower: out of 55 members, 36.4% are women. Finally, the percentage of women re- corded for the Transport and Tourism Committee is even lower, with only 25% of women occupying high-level positions out of a total of 44 members. The average women/men ratio across these three Committees is 64 to 99. Women therefore repre- sent on average 39.3% of the members of these Committees (Figure 8). Within the European Parlia- ment as a whole, 256 out of 736 MEPs today are women, or 35%. 6 These figures are similar to those for the national ministries, with the environment sector being more gender balanced than the transport and en- ergy sectors. Indicator 3: Proportion of women in climate change deci- sion-making bodies at the international level International climate change decision-making takes place within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), includ- ing the annual meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and its supporting bodies. The COP delegations carry out the political negotiating and decision-making on international climate change policy, including agreeing targets for reduction of GHG emissions. The COP negotiations are support- ed by the work of two additional bodies, known as Subsidiary Bodies (SBs). There is one SB for Scientific and Technological Advice, which advises the COP on matters of climate, environment, technology and method. Another SB for Implementation helps review how the Convention is being applied, and deals with financial and administrative matters. Typically, the COP meets annually and the SB meets twice per year; once simultaneously with the COP and then at a second time during each year. Data on the gender of participants on the COP and SB delegations, as well as head of delegations is avail- able from the UNFCCC website once the sessions are complete. Overall, the participation of women in the UNFCCC negotiations and support work, including ministry representatives, advisors and policy consult- ants, has increased since the process began in the early 1990s. For the COP delegations, the average proportion of women on the EU Member States\u2019 delegations and the EU delegation over the past five years is 37.6%. The figures vary by Member State; the highest figures are found in Latvia (57.4%), Fin- land (56.8%), Sweden (49.5%), Bulgaria (47.4%) and Lithuania (45.6%). Of course, it is important to bear in mind that the size of these delegations varies significantly between the Member States; in 2010, the total size of delegations ranged from 4 or 7 for six Member States (BG, CY, LV, LT, MT, SK) to del- egations 10 times larger for France and Germany and 104 delegates for Belgium which sends del- egations both for the federal government and by region. Overall, between 1996 and 2010, women\u2019s partici- pation in national delegations to the UNFCCC has been increasing (Figure 9). For example in COP 2 in 1996, the average women\u2019s participation across all EU Member States and the EU delegation was 24.3%. This average increased to 32.4% in COP 6 (2000), and continued to increase steadily to 40.5% in COP 16 (2010). ",

Like the COP delegations, the SB delegations have also shown an upward trend over the same period (Figure 9). In 1996, the average women\u2019s participa- tion in EU SB delegations was 24.6%. This average showed a steady increase until SB28 in 2008, where women\u2019s participation reached 46.2%. Since SB28, the average decreased slightly to 42.7% for SB30 in 2009, and was recorded at 44% for SB34 in 2011. Heads of SB Delegations (SB HoDs) were also con- sidered, as these positions represent high-level decision-making power in a position not reserved for a head of state or minister, but rather a distin- guished technical expert. Figure 10 shows a gen- eral upward trend in the proportion of women SB HoDs for each SB meeting that did not coincide with a COP since 1996. Results of analysing the women participators in decision-making positions in the international cli- mate change negotiations show that during the last five years proportion of women in COP del- egations has increased and in 2010 was 40.5%. The proportion of women in the SB delegations is only slightly higher than for the COP delegations (44% accordingly in 2011). Segmentation of education Education is an important intervention area for achieving the Beijing objectives. BPfA declares that one of the key actions to be taken by governments, at all levels, including municipal authorities to achieve objective K.1 is to \u201cfacilitate and increase women\u2019s access to information and education, including the areas of science, technology and economics, thus enhancing their knowledge, skills and opportunities for participation in environmental decisions\u201d. 7 Indicator 4: Proportion of women tertiary graduates of total graduates (ISCED levels 5 and 6) in natu- ral sciences and technologies at the EU and Member States level This indicator reflects the proportion of women awarded degrees in the scientific and technological fields relevant to climate change. Analysis of women tertiary graduates in natural sciences and technolo- gies in the EU Member States shows that women are less likely than men to choose scientific and techno- logical fields. The proportion of women tertiary grad- uates is particularly low in engineering and transport services \u2013 two fields particularly related to the trans- port and energy sectors. Data on EU graduates, disaggregated by sex, are available at the Member State level by field of education from Eurostat for reference years 2000- 2009. 8 These data are available for ISCED levels 3 to 6, which cover upper secondary through sec- ond stage tertiary academic programmes. 9 The analysis shows significant differences in the proportion of women graduates in the select- ed fields over the past decade (Figure 11). From among these fields, life sciences and environ- mental protection are the most popular choices for women (respectively 61.8% and 51.1% in 2009) where they account for more than half of the ter- tiary graduates for the majority of reference years.

        "Review of the Implementation in the EU of area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change 22 Conclusions Conclusions EIGE\u2019s report analyses the gender dimension of climate change in the EU with regard to the dif- ferent impact of changing climate on women and men and their different efforts to mitigate climate change. As this is a relatively new field of research, the report marks the first effort to propose indica- tors that measure progress in the EU in the area of women and the environment. For this reason, it was important to investigate data sources and determine which data were most readily available to support future monitoring of progress. The re- sults of the collection and analysis of data not only shaped the proposed indicators, but also high- lighted a number of conclusions and recommen- dations for further research in this area. The report reveals important links between gen- der and climate change and the necessity to take gender into account in policy making so as to improve the overall responsiveness of climate change policies to the real needs of women and men, and society, in general. Women and men are affected differently by the impacts of climate change; they contribute differently to GHG emis- sions; they have different capabilities to mitigate and adapt to climate change at the individual lev- el; they have different perceptions of and attitudes towards options for climate change mitigation; and, finally, they are affected differently by the so- cio-economic impacts of the climate policy. Such factors should become an integral part of climate change policy debates and decisions. Women\u2019s participation in climate change decision- making is an important factor for more gender responsive and efficient climate change policies. The research shows that women\u2019s involvement in climate change decision-making at local, national and international level is still low. Higher numbers of women were found among the heads of secto- ral departments of Member States\u2019 ministries than at higher political and administrative levels. The reasons are rooted in organisational structures and cultures, traditional gender division of care work, tensions related to reconciliation of work and private life as well as gender-based educational choices. In international climate change decision-making, the number of women in UNFCCC delegations from the EU Member States has been growing since the early 1990s. This has been encouraged by the international non-governmental networks on gender and climate change. At the national level women tend to participate in environmental policy making to a higher degree when the issues are less technological in nature. In general, wom- en\u2019s participation in decision-making in the energy and transport sectors, both public and private, is relatively low compared with their overall partici ation in the workforce. Women\u2019s higher enrolment in science and technol- ogy-related educational fields leading to careers in the energy and transport sectors is one of the prerequisites for obtaining access to institutions and power structures that support and control cli- mate change policy making. Climate change is a relatively new policy area, therefore many people in senior decision-making positions, such as envi- ronmental authorities, were educated in a variety of fields, including social sciences, economics or law (where there are much higher rates of women graduates). Scientific and technological degrees in fields like engineering, physical and life sciences or transport services might be important for gain- ing high-level positions in decision-making in the energy and transport sectors. However, further re- search is needed to substantiate the link between education and decision-making positions. The literature review carried out for EIGE\u2019s report revealed the shortage of studies and research on gender and climate change. To address this, the ",
        "Review of the Implementation in the EU of area K of the Beijing Platform for Action: Women and the Environment Gender Equality and Climate Change 23 Conclusions gaps within the existing body of research must be identified and strategies for inte- grating gender research into policy-making processes developed . For example, in order to maximise the value of the collected data, specific goals and quantitative targets for women\u2019s partici- pation in decision-making could be introduced in gender equality and climate change-related poli- cies. Awareness about the relevance of gender issues for climate change must be raised to overcome the low priority given to justice and equality issues in the context of the urgent drive to mitigate climate change, which often continues to be considered a \u201cgender neutral\u201d policy field. In order to address the impacts of climate change and the need for fundamental changes to way of life, immense efforts and leadership from govern- ments, the private sector and civil society will be required. Gender sensitivity and gender respon- siveness are prerequisites for such efforts. Genuine progress towards more effective and gender-just climate policies will require more than just the integration of gender wording into policy documents. In fact a more profound and systemic change involving not only gender- mainstreaming but also a transformation of gender relations and societal structures will be necessary to underpin climate change poli- cies. Reluctance to face up to far-reaching implica- tions may be the reason for the lack of recognition of gender issues in the climate change field. Area K of the BPfA contains three objectives for women and the environment; EIGE\u2019s report cov- ers only one of them. The second objective aims at increasing the integration of gender concerns and perspectives in sustainable development policies, and the third objective seeks to establish mechanisms to assess the impacts of environmen- tal policies on women. The work in this area could benefit from further research on the links between women\u2019s participation in decision-making and the actual policy outcomes. The research of quali- tative aspects of policies from a gender per- spective could certainly bring an additional value to the area. Climate change is a broad field and cuts across many sectors as well as institutions, some of which were not considered in the report for reasons of time, scope and data availability. These include national legislative bodies, local and region- al governments, the private commercial sec- tor, civil society organisations or research and academic institutions, which all are very important contributors to climate change policies and implementation of those policies. Further re- search would be needed to better understand the roles of these institutions in climate policies, the prevalence of women in decision-making and the extent to which it shapes policy outcomes. Moreo- ver, future research should also investigate other climate change-related sectors, which contribute significantly to GHG emissions and play a relevant role in climate change policy making, such as agri- culture, industrial processes and waste.
