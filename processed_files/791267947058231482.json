II. the objective of the court\u2019s audit was to assess whether EDf support for regional economic integration in East africa and West africa had been effective. the audit examined the commission\u2019s approach to regional economic integration, its man- agement of the support provided and the results of a sample of individual projects. III. the regional economic integration pro- cess is making progress in both regions in terms of agreements being reached on regional objectives and policies relating to trade and transport issues. However, the implementation of such agreements by the national authorities is lagging be- hind and the free movement of goods, services, capital and people is not yet a reality in either of the two regions.

V. the commission\u2019s approach to supporting regional economic integration in East africa and West africa is relevant to the regions\u2019 and the countries\u2019 needs to achieve higher economic growth as a means to fight poverty. However, the strategies and interventions at the regional and national levels have largely been designed and implemented independently of each other, with insufficient attention paid to the possibility of creating complementarity between them except, to some extent, in the transport sector. VI. the commission\u2019s Delegations have nei- ther adequate guidelines nor sufficient capacity to deal with the preparation, im- plementation, reporting and coordination of regional activities. at the level of the regional organisations, coordination is also inadequate and there is no monitor- ing system to track the overall progress of the regional economic integration process in the individual countries. E X Ec u t i vE s u m ma rY VII. i t was difficult to assess the results achieved or likely to be achieved by in- dividual projects, due to poorly defined objectives, the lack of adequate report- ing and monitoring and the fact that sev- eral major projects are ongoing and their final results are not yet known. overall, these projects are likely to have, at best, only partially satisfactory results. VIII. the court\u2019s main recommendations are that the c ommission should: \u2014 make the continuation of its support for regional integration conditional on an early agreement on how to achieve the necessary convergence between the various regional organisations in a region within a predefined time- frame and on the national authorities taking greater ownership of the re - gional integration process; \u2014 from the 2010 mid-term review of the 10th EDf strategies onwards, improve coherence between its regional and national strategies; \u2014 examine whether the financial alloca- tion in the 10th EDf to regional pro - grammes is too high; \u2014 in relation to the Delegations\u2019 man- agement of regional programmes, de- fine their responsibilities, set up an appropriate coordination mechanism between them and review their staff capacity.

Even prior to the cotonou agreement, in a communication of 1995 3 , the commission had defined its support for regional inte- gration among developing countries by outlining a conceptual framework and by formulating three main areas for develop- ment cooperation support: capacity building and institutional strengthening at regional and national levels, direct support for the private sector to help exploit the opportunities resulting from regional integration and budget support to help meet the transi- tional costs of economic liberalisation and reform. 3. the Ec Development policy of 2000 4 selected a limited number of priority fields for community development cooperation activ- ities, including trade and development, and regional integration and cooperation. the updated Ec development policy of 2005, \u2019the European consensus on Development\u2019 5 , again emphasised the importance of trade and regional integration by linking them and selecting them as one of the priority areas for community action. 1 acp-Ec partnership agreement, signed on 23 June 2000 and revised on 25 June 2005 (hereinafter called the cotonou agreement), part 3, title i: Development strategies, article 19. 2 communication from the commission to the council, the European parliament, the European Economic and social committee and the committee of the regions: regional integration for development in acp countries. com(2008) 604 final/2 of 6.10.2008. also see the commission staff working document accompanying the communication on regional integration for development in acp countries, sEc(2008) 2539 of 1.10.2008. 3 communication from the commission: Ec support for regional economic integration efforts among developing countries. com(95) 219 of 16.6.1995. 4 communication from the commission to the council and the European parliament: the European community\u2019s Development policy, com(2000) 212 final of 26.4.2000. 5 Joint statement by the council and the representatives of the governments of the member states meeting within the council, the European parliament and the commission: \u2019the European consensus on Development\u2019, 22 november 2005.

Before the ninth EDf, the regional programmes were agreed be- tween the commission and the individual countries belonging to the region concerned, with regional projects often providing add- itional funding for national activities (e.g. road building) rather than supporting clearly designed regional policies. 7. the cotonou agreement, however, placed a new emphasis on the regional programmes as the main instrument to support regional economic integration and stipulated that multi-annual regional support strategies and indicative programmes be prepared and agreed for each region jointly by the commission and the duly mandated regional organisation(s), under the following condi- tions 7 : \u2014 the acp states concerned decide on the definition of the geo- graphical regions; \u2014 to the maximum extent possible, regional programmes should correspond to programmes of existing regional organisations with a mandate for economic integration; \u2014 in the case of overlapping membership of several regional organisations, the regional programme should \u2018correspond to the combined membership of these organisations\u2019. 8. as a result of the aforementioned provisions, regional program- ming under the ninth and 10th EDfs has resulted in strategies and indicative programmes for six different regions covering the totality of the acp countries, i.e. four in africa, one in the pacific and one in the caribbean. in several of the african regions more than one regional organisation exists with a mandate for eco - nomic integration, covering different, and sometimes overlap- ping, areas. this has led to the situation that in the two largest regions, East africa and West africa, for example, the commission has to work with four (East africa) and two (West africa) regional organisations respectively as the duly mandated organisations to draw up, sign and implement the regional strategy and indicative programme for their region. the regional indicative programme provides a first allocation of the resources available for the region and the period concerned to the focal areas of support. for each individual intervention the most appropriate regional organisa- tion is allocated the role of regional authorising officer, respon- sible for preparation and implementation of the interventions in close cooperation with the c ommission. 7 cotonou agreement, annex iv \u2018implementation and management procedures\u2019, chapter 2 \u2018programming and preparation (regional)\u2019.

However, it is not a member of comEsa, but it is a member of saDc. EAST AFRICA REGION 9. the East africa region in its current composition was created with the signing of the ninth EDf regional strategy paper and regional indicative programme 8 . it is a heterogeneous and diverse region in many respects, with countries varying in size, population, geo- graphical situation, level of development and political stability. under the ninth EDf, the regional programme covered 21 coun- tries, but under the 10th EDf this number has been reduced to 17, following the withdrawal of four countries from the regional organisations involved. 10. the region is characterised by the presence of four regional or - ganisations, covering different sub-regions, with a mandate for re- gional integration. these are known respectively by the acronyms comEsa, Eac, igaD and ioc 9 . these organisations show significant overlaps in geographical coverage and membership and in man- dates and policy objectives (see Annexes I and II ). comEsa and Eac are primarily aiming for regional economic integration, with Eac already having established a customs union, while comEsa is still in the process of transforming its free trade area into a customs union. igaD also includes regional economic integration in its mandate but focuses more on conflict resolution and food security issues. the ioc has a mandate for economic and trade cooperation rather than for regional economic integration, and it focuses mainly on regional cooperation in natural resources management (fisheries). nevertheless, ioc participates in the pro - gramming and implementation of the 9th and 10th EDf regional indicative p rogrammes for the East a frica region. 11. the overlapping membership poses considerable problems, as some member countries belong to two different trade areas (comEsa and Eac ). in addition, there are overlaps and incom- patibilities in membership with the southern africa Develop- ment community (saDc), the regional organisation for southern africa 10 , which also aims to establish a customs union between its member countries. membership in more than one customs union, however, is technically not possible. these overlaps in member- ship and mandates result in a complex institutional framework. these factors, and the current weak state of coordination be- tween these organisations (see paragraphs 39 to 43), pose serious problems for the commission, in particular for the design and implementation of interventions in the area of regional economic integration.

(b) Has the commission managed its support for regional integra- tion well? (c) Have the commission\u2019s individual projects in support of re- gional integration met their objectives? 16. regarding the geographical scope, the court\u2019s audit has focused on the two largest of the six existing regional programmes, i.e. those for East africa and West africa (see Table 1 ), which together account for well over 50 % of the total amount allocated to re - gional programmes. auDit scopE anD approacH ",

THE COMMISSION\u2019S REGIONAL COOPERATION STRATEGY IS RELEVANT BUT COMPLEMENTARITY VIS-\u00c0-VIS ITS NATIONAL COOPERATION STRATEGIES IS WEAK AND THE LEVEL OF FUNDING DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF ABSORPTION CAPACITIES 19. in its regional strategy documents for both the ninth and the tenth EDfs the commission provides an accurate analysis of the progress made in regional integration and the challenges it faces. this analysis justified the decision to focus the EDf financial al- locations for both regions on economic integration and trade, with transport either being included or treated as a second focal sector. the justification provided, in the 10th EDf regional strat - egy papers and in the commission\u2019s 2008 communication (see footnote 2), for the doubling of the financial allocation to regional programmes under the tenth EDf to 1 783 million euro is that it reflects \u2018Eu- acp consensus on the importance of regional integra- tion for development\u2019. this large allocation will be difficult to use in an efficient and effective way by the regional organisations, given their limited absorption capacity demonstrated so far (see paragraphs 44 to 49). 20. the commission\u2019s regional strategies are aligned with the strat- egies and objectives of the main regional organisations to increase economic growth and reduce poverty through higher levels of regional economic integration, by supporting the implementa- tion and consolidation of existing free trade areas and customs unions, and by addressing supply side constraints in the area of infrastructure. oBsEr vations ",

However, the regional strategy documents do not identify the priority needs to strengthen the institutional capacity of individual countries to participate actively in the formulation and implementation of regional integration policies. 22. the focus on transport in the regional strategy is in line with the Joint africa\u2013Eu strategy 17 which stated that africa and the Eu would aim at increasing interconnectivity by investing in and improving infrastructure along the trans-african road transport corridors in order to support development through growth and trade. the objective is to support the definition and implementa- tion of regional transport policies, with priority being given to the harmonisation of national transport policies (e.g. standardisation of maximum axle load for heavy goods vehicles) and transport fa- cilitation along regional corridors (e.g. jointly built and managed border posts, elimination of illicit controls). 23. the commission\u2019s cooperation strategies with individual countries under the ninth and 10th EDfs are aligned with national develop - ment strategies, as formulated in the countries\u2019 poverty reduc- tion strategy papers. the aim of all these national strategies is to achieve higher economic growth, which is seen as a necessary condition to be able to reduce poverty. However, in many cases the national strategies do not consider how they should interact with or complement regional integration programmes. 17 \u2018the africa\u2013Eu strategic partnership: a Joint africa\u2013Eu strategy\u2019, adopted at the Eu\u2013africa summit, lisbon, December 2007.

Whilst, for most of the countries examined by the court, the 10th EDf country strategies include provisions for non-focal support in areas such as trade, regional integration or implementation of Economic partnership agreements (Epa ), they do not specify the priority needs to be addressed. 27. the court\u2019s findings corroborate the evaluations commissioned by the commission for the two regions. these evaluations, which covered the eighth and ninth EDfs, concluded that there was in- sufficient complementarity, because of inadequate coordination, both at the level of the policy dialogue between the commission, the regional organisations and individual countries, and at pro - gramme level between regional and national programmes.

However, the com- mission, regional organisations and individual countries have respectively given insufficient attention to and support for the necessary follow-up actions at national level, in particular in re- lation to the transposition and application of legislation and the implementation of regional policies (see Box 1 ). INSUFFICIENT LINK BETWEEN REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ACTIVITIES in East africa, the regional integration support programme (risp), launched in July 2005, aims to develop the capacity of the regional organisations and their member states in policy formulation, implementa- tion and monitoring of regional integration, multilateral and regional trade and in trade-related areas. under its \u2018result area 5 \u2014 improve harmonisation of regional policies at national level\u2019, the project is meant to support member states\u2019 \u2018national development and trade policy forum\u2019 (or similar national working group) in the task of guiding, co-ordinating and monitoring a country\u2019s regional integration efforts as well as its integration in the world economy. in 2008, however, there were only four countries (Burundi, Ethiopia, malawi and seychelles) where the trade policy forum was sufficiently active and had enough capacity to present a work plan in this area. among them, only Ethiopia has actually been assisted by the project. in West africa, EcoWas focal points exist within the administrations of all the member states. they are responsible for assisting the EcoWas countries in the transposition of regional decisions, but their inputs are not sufficiently considered in the management of the main regional integration project, as they are not represented on the project\u2019s steering committee. their capacity is very limited and so far they have mostly functioned as information and contact points of EcoWas in the member countries. the project has acknowledged the need to reinforce the capacity of the EcoWas focal points, but it has allocated insufficient funds for this task. the project work plan for 2008 provided 45 000 euro (3 000 euro per focal point) for the development of a capacity building plan, which was still under preparation at the time of the audit. the 2009 work plan only provides for 98 000 euro (6 500 euro per focal point) for the implementation of the capacity building plan.

DELEGATIONS LACK GUIDELINES AND CAPACITY TO MANAGE REGIONAL PROGRAMMES 33. Whereas country strategy papers are prepared on the basis of discussions between the commission and an individual coun- try, regional strategy papers concern no less than four regional organisations ( comEsa, Eac, igaD, ioc) in the case of the East african region, representing 17 national governments, and two regional organisations in the case of the West african region (EcoW as, uEmoa ), representing 16 national governments. on the commission\u2019s side there is in each region almost the same number of Delegations involved. activities under the regional projects are mainly carried out at the regional level, i.e. by one or more of the regional organisations, but some activities also take place at the level of the individual countries belonging to the region. Estab- lishing a customs union, for instance, requires first an agreement to be reached at regional level on one common External tariff, but its application requires the involvement and training of all the customs services in the participating countries. With so many different parties involved, the preparation and implementation of a regional strategy requires a high degree of coordination. ",

Whereas a Delegation\u2019s workload is deter- mined by various factors 20 , the size of the financial allocation to be managed by a Delegation is relevant for its staffing position, in particular for operational, financial and contractual matters. However, the court found that the larger responsibility of those Delegations managing regional as well as national activities is not reflected in their staffing capacity and that the potential impact of the doubling of the 10th EDf regional allocations has not yet been addressed. 20 for example, budget support may carry a different workload for a Delegation than project support, while the percentage of budget support may vary from one country to another; or, in addition to the normal EDf allocations, Delegations in the regions concerned may also have responsibility for a number of projects funded from horizontal budget lines in the general Budget. INADEQUATE REPORTING AND MONITORING BY THE COMMISSION the fragmentation of responsibilities can be observed in the way Delegations report on regional activ- ities in their six-monthly External assistance management reports to commission Headquarters. in West africa, neither the Delegation in abuja, which deals with EcoWas, nor the Delegation in ouagadougou, dealing with uEmoa, has a full overview of the progress of two major regional projects, \u2018support for regional integration and trade\u2019 and the \u2018transport facility\u2019, which involve activities taking place in all or many of the countries in the region. in practice, each of these two Delegations reports to commission Headquarters on those activities for which \u2018their\u2019 regional organisation is responsible. furthermore, since Delegations in any of the other countries do not have any formal responsibility for regional projects, they do not report on any activities that may have taken place under these projects in their country 21 . a similar situation has arisen in East africa, where the regional organisation comEsa, based in Zambia, has formal responsibility for the main regional integration projects (risp/rism), but part of the project activities relate to the Eac\u2019s integration agenda, and are implemented by the Eac, based in tanzania, while certain activities concern, in principle, all countries belonging to the East africa region. neither the Delegation in Zambia as the main contact point for comEsa, nor any of the other Delegations has a complete overview of the progress of these projects and only the four Delegations in the countries where the four regional organisations are based report to commission Headquarters on those activities for which \u2018their\u2019 regional organisation is responsible. 21 an exception is the regional project \u2018appui au programme de formation de l\u2019asEcna\u2019 (support for asEcna\u2019s training programme) for which the responsibility is shared by the Delegations in senegal and niger.

During the audit, the court did not find evidence that ap- propriate action had been taken by the commission in response to the evaluation findings. OVERALL COORDINATION, REPORTING AND MONITORING BY REGIONAL ORGANISATIONS IS INADEQUATE 39. in both regions, the regional organisations have set up mech- anisms to support coordination between themselves and to monitor implementation of programmes. in 2003, the four regional organ- isations in East africa established the inter regional coordinating committee (ircc ), the secretariat of which is currently supported through an EDf project (\u2018support to secretariat of ircc\u2019). in West africa EcoW as and uEmoa established a Joint technical secretariat in 2004. this body is also supported through an EDf-funded project (\u2018rip m onitoring m echanism\u2019).

However, the ircc has so far not en- sured that an overall monitoring and evaluation system covering the whole regional indicative programme has been established. in practice, the ircc monitors the financial implementation of the regional projects, but not the progress made by these programmes against predefined targets and their contribution towards the re- gional integration process as such. a mid-term review of the ircc project, carried out in 2005, recommended, among other things, the setting up of a common monitoring and evaluation system and a quality-review system of financing proposals, to increase coordination between the national and regional indicative pro- grammes. the regional organisations and the commission have, however, been slow to adjust the project accordingly, as these recommendations will only be taken up in new terms of reference for the project\u2019s extension phase under the 10th EDf, which will become operational during the course of 2009. 41. in West africa, the Joint technical secretariat has the potential to be an important instrument for coordinating between the regional organisations and ensuring the coherence between the different individual projects and the approved regional strategy. so far, it has not been able to undertake these roles effectively, due to lim- ited human resources capacity and limited authority. the activity reports produced by the rip monitoring mechanism project have mentioned problems such as lack of staff and the unavailability of monitoring data in the absence of timely progress reports by projects. these problems, which were also reported to the steer- ing committee for the regional indicative programme, on which the commission is represented, illustrate the failure of the two regional organisations (EcoW as and uEmoa ) and the commission to overcome basic constraints, which were already known and re- ported in 2007 and which prevent an effective monitoring and co- ordination of the r egional i ndicative p rogramme in West a frica.

REGIONAL PROJECT COMPLEX AND SLOW the main ninth EDf support for regional integration in West africa is channelled through one large project with a financial allocation of 105 million euro. this complex project started in 2007 and is im- plemented under the responsibility of the two regional organisations, EcoWas and uEmoa, through the following instruments: \u2022 a contribution agreement with each of the regional organisations for 44,8 and 31,6 million euro respectively with a focus on the common market, macroeconomic stability and capacity building for the regional organisations and member states; \u2022 a financing agreement of 28,6 million euro, with a focus on improving the competitiveness of the private sector and capacity building for non-state actors, signed with uEmoa acting on behalf of the two organisations; \u2022 the \u2018private sector\u2019 component of this financing agreement consists of three sub-components: 1) a \u2018Quality\u2019 programme implemented through a contribution agreement with uniDo (15 million euro); 2) \u2018Harmonisation of business law\u2019 (4 million euro) and 3) \u2018Harmonisation of fisheries legislation\u2019 (5 million euro), to be implemented by uEmoa through programme estimates and direct labour operations, but delegated to the national a uthorising officers in member states; \u2022 the \u2018capacity building for non-state actors\u2019 component (2,6 million euro) is implemented by EcoWas through grant contracts following a call for proposals. implementation under the fifteen different components has been very slow, mainly due to the weak insti- tutional capacity of the two regional organisations. in early 2009, after almost 2 years of implementation, the implementation rate of the contribution agreements was 4 % 22 . payments by the commission under the financing agreement, signed in 2006, amounted to some 20 % of the budget, while in January 2009, the deadline by which all contracts had to be signed, more than 5 million euro (or 17 % of the financing agreement\u2019s budget) were not yet committed and are in principle lost for the project. 22 Excluding payments under the financial compensation mechanism for loss of government revenues due to customs tariff reductions.

Joint management is the main method of implementation foreseen in the financial regulation 23 for cooperation with international organisations. its main char- acteristic is that the organisation in question is allowed to use its own accounting, internal control, audit and procurement pro- cedures, provided a four-pillar ex-ante assessment confirms that these procedures comply with international standards. following a positive assessment, the commission can provide its financial support for the organisation in question through a contribution agreement. 48. the commission signed contribution agreements with uEmoa and EcoW as for the implementation of a significant part of the ninth EDf regional programme in spite of the fact that the four- pillar assessment conclusion was negative. as a result, the com- mission had to add special conditions concerning the financial, procurement and external audit procedures to compensate for weaknesses found in the organisations\u2019 systems and procedures. instead of strengthening the ownership, this interim solution re- sulted in considerable discontent on the part of uEmoa, as in its view these conditions defeated the purpose of using a con- tribution agreement. the envisaged increased efficiency has not yet materialised either, as the Delegations concerned are still obliged to monitor financial implementation closely, given the weak financial management capacities of the organisations. in practice, implementation of the current ninth EDf programmes in West africa has been very slow (see Box 3 ), and the absorption capacity for increased aid flows remains limited for the foresee- able future. in this context, the doubling of funds allocated to regional cooperation under the 10th EDf is likely to aggravate the implementation problems experienced in this region. 23 financial regulation of 27 march 2003 applicable to the 9th EDf, article 16 (oJ l 83, 1.4.2003, p. 1); council regulation (Ec) no 215/2008 of 18 february 2008 on the financial regulation applicable to the 10th fED, article 29 (oJ l 78, 19.3.2008, p. 1).

However, some of the activities under these projects are to be carried out by the other regional organisation, Eac, whereas the institutional capacity of its secretariat is still weak and the four-pillar assessment was negative. again, an in- terim solution was agreed which required the Eac to manage risp funds on the basis of comEsa procedures. However, according to internal audit reports by comEsa, in practice Eac is actually ap - plying its own procedures, which have not yet been validated by the c ommission.

UNABLE TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS in East africa the regional integration programme (phase ii) aimed to strengthen regional integration policy-making by increasing the analytical and information capacity of the comEsa secretariat. the court found that the project had not reported, as required, on the progress made every six months, but had instead only reported in the annual work plans on the activities carried out during the preced- ing year. the project did not have a steering committee to assess periodically the progress achieved. apart from a mid-term review, no other external monitoring missions had taken place, nor had an in- dependent evaluation mission at the end of the project been carried out, although this was foreseen in the financing agreement. the indicators provided in the project\u2019s logical framework were found to be too vague to permit a reliable and detailed assessment of the project\u2019s effectiveness for each of the expected results.

PROJECT RESULTS UNSATISFACTORY the court found that the regional integration support project in East africa, which is scheduled to be completed by mid 2010, had by the end of 2008 accomplished only three out of the seven intermediate targets proposed in the contribution agreement. in particular the lack of relevant results regarding the adoption of regional policies by the national authorities is putting at risk the project\u2019s overall ef- fectiveness. in West africa, the transport facility project (64 million euro) aims to improve regional transport services, in particular by establishing joint border posts along the main regional transport corridors. the project has experienced significant delays during its start-up phase and after three years of implementation the main achievement has been the completion of a detailed study concerning the intended functioning of these border posts. in order to be able to continue with the design and eventually the construction of the border posts, the commission had to provide a \u2018waiver\u2019 for what is known as the D+3 rule, which requires contracts within a project to be signed not later than three years after the project\u2019s financial commitment has been approved. Even with the two years\u2019 extension obtained, the two regional or- ganisations EcoWas and uEmoa are still facing a difficult task to complete the construction works and to establish detailed and harmonised arrangements between the countries concerned to operate the border posts efficiently. BOX 5 24 in East africa this concerns: \u2014 regional integration support programme (risp); \u2014 regional integration support mechanism (rism). in West africa this concerns: \u2014 Economic integration and trade; \u2014 support for regional integration in West africa.

PROJECT RESULTS PARTIALLY SATISFACTORY in West africa the pari project (\u2018programme d\u2019appui \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gration r\u00e9gionale de la zone uEmoa\u2019/sup- port programme for regional integration in the WaEmu zone) aimed to support uEmoa and its member states in improving the legal and administrative framework, in establishing a regional market and in consolidating the macro-economic framework. although these project objectives and related indicators were formulated in very general terms, the final evaluation of the project found improvements in the regional integration process. specifically, the legislation regarding the customs union and the liberalisa- tion of intra-community trade, produced by uEmoa, was of good quality and was introduced into the legal systems of the various member states. However, the free circulation of goods, persons, services and capital as well as the right of establishment were still far from being achieved. similarly, the functioning of the multilateral macro-economic surveillance mechanism of uEmoa had improved, but this had not yet resulted in a better convergence of the uEmoa-zone economies, which was the main objective. the same areas are again being addressed under the ongoing Economic integration and trade project.

However, the implementation of such agreements by the national authorities is lagging behind and the free movement of goods, services, capital and people is not yet a reality in either of the two regions. 57. EDf support for regional economic integration has so far been only partially effective, due to a number of factors. some of these factors are outside the direct control of the commission, even though it can influence them through its support and policy dialogue. in both regions there are multiple regional organisations with overlapping membership and mandates. moreover, despite the commission\u2019s capacity building support, all the regional organisations still lack institutional capacity, albeit in varying degrees, in all aspects of the project cycle, from programming and project preparation to implementation, reporting and financial management. furthermore, member countries do not always give a high priority to regional integration as a policy objective in view of the many other pressing needs identified at national level. other factors related to the commission\u2019s approach and management also undermine the effectiveness of EDf support (see paragraphs 58 to 60). the commission should make the continuation of its support for regional integration conditional on an early agreement on how to achieve the necessary convergence between the vari- ous regional organisations in each region within a pre-defined timeframe and on the national authorities taking greater own- ership of the regional integration process.

However, coher- ence is inadequately addressed in that the strategies and inter- ventions at the two levels have largely been designed and imple- mented independently of each other, with insufficient attention paid to the possibility of creating complementarity between them, except to some extent in the transport sector. furthermore, the doubling of the financial allocation to regional programmes under the 10th EDf does not take into account the limited absorption capacity of the r egional organisations (paragraphs 19 to 31). the commission should, from the 2010 mid-term review of the 10th EDf strategies onwards, improve the coherence between its regional strategy and national strategies, by \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 regional integration in all its support activities at national level and by seeking more systematic complementarity between its support activities at the two different levels.

Where the insti- tutional capacity of the implementing organisation is weak, the use of contribution agreements has not improved the speed of project implementation (paragraphs 33 to 49). in relation to its management of regional programmes the commission should: \u2014 clearly define the responsibilities of the different Delega- tions in the regions concerned; \u2014 establish an appropriate coordination mechanism between Delegations in a region; \u2014 review the resources allocated to Delegations for the programming and implementation of its regional pro- grammes; \u2014 use contribution agreements with regional organisations only where the financial management is found to comply with international standards.

II. the commission wishes to draw the attention to the fact that beyond economic integration, its suppor t for regional integration includes strong political components such as governance, peace building and conflict prevention, as well as support to gradually building regional policies, strategies and institutions in areas of sustainable development. these components make an important, albeit indirect contribution to regional economic integration. III. the commission agrees that moving from agreed political objectives to a practical reality for regional economic actors is the key challenge of the next years. IV. r e g i o n a l e c o n o m i c i n t e g r a t i o n h a s achieved significant progress over the last years. this could not have been achieved without Ec support, of a financial, political or technical nature.

While difficulties and some setbacks have been experienced, they have to be put in the perspective of the particularly c o m p l e x i n s t i t u t i o n a l s e t t i n g a n d low administrative capacities rightly emphasised by the c ourt\u2019s report. V. the commission acknowledges that com- plementarity between regional and na- tional strategies is a key issue. the work done by the commission and its Delega- tions in the 10th EDf was already a sig- nificant improvement over the 9th EDf programming. However, the commission agrees that further improvements are still possible. complementarity will be a key element in the mid-term reviews of the 10th EDf national strategies that will take place in 2010, in which special attention will be given to ensuring that the regional integration objectives supported by the regional indicative programmes (rip) will be integrated in the analysis of the national i ndicative p rogrammes (nip). VI. the commission is aware of the need to provide up-to-date and more articulate guidance to the staff in Delegations. initiatives have already been taken in order to produce guidelines on trade and private sector development, which include a section on regional integration, as well as tailored regional training workshops which are delivered in three to five regions per year. coordination has also clearly improved at the level of regional organisations, with a much better coordination through the ircc in East africa, and in the common strategy for the papED (p rogramme apE pour le D\u00e9veloppement) in West africa. these have to be seen as first steps towards the goal of a much better regional integration. the commission acknowledges the need for adequate monitoring systems in the regional organisations and is taking the necessary steps to address this issue. VIII. First indent the commission recognises the challenges of the institutional complexity for effective regional integration. this complexity is the result of history and political compromises between african nations. this issue is directly addressed in the context of the Joint Eu\u2013 africa s trategy. rather than imposing conditions for the Eu support, the commission believes that the convergence of regional organisations is best supported through political and policy dialogue and assistance for the convergence of regionally-led policies. rEp l Y o f tH E co m m i s s i o n ",

Second indent specific efforts are being undertaken, in particular through regional seminars, to improve coherence between nips and rips, such as the recent lusaka meeting and the West africa regional seminar in abuja (15\u201316/10/2009). the mid-term reviews of the country strat- egy papers (csps) and regional strategy papers (rsps) will indeed aim to further reinforce the interaction between both levels. the national mid-term review (mtr) guidelines already foresee this aspect. VIII. Third indent the increased funding is closely related to the recognised need of significant financial resources for the development dimension of the Economic partnership agreements (Epa s). progress made in implementing the regional programmes and the regional allocation is routinely examined under the mid-term review in the light of current needs and per formance. considering the short period of time during which the 10th EDf regional programmes have been implemented, it is too early to draw conclusions on the resources. there is a need to concentrate on strength- ening the absorption capacity of the re- gional organisations, rather than to already envisaging the revision of the volume of re- sources of the regional programmes. VIII. Fourth indent the commission agrees that the Delega- tions\u2019 capacities to manage regional pro- grammes should be improved and their responsibilities better defined. in add- ition to regular regional seminars, a more formal co-operation mechanism between the regional Delegations has already been introduced since January 2009. improved coordination modalities have been agreed which will include two meetings per year at Heads of Delegations level. INTRODUCTION 2. regional integration is a major priority of the Development cooperation policy, as reflected in the European consensus on Development. the need to deepen and accelerate regional integration processes in the acp is detailed in the various commission communications including com(2008) 604 on regional integration for development in acp countries but also in communications dating back to 1995, 2000, 2007. Development assistance is underpinning the trade and development s trate g y, including the considerable c h a l l e n g e o f t h e n e g o t i a t i o n s a n d i m p l e m e n t a t i o n o f t h e E c o n o m i c partnership a greements. the regional programmes are the main vehicle to deliver on the commitments to provide specific trade-related assistance, support to trade-related infrastructures, building-up of productive capacities and trade-related adjustment measures. rEp l Y o f tH E co m m i s s i o n ",

Yet the commission 2008 communication also identified a fifth, non- economic, policy area: \u2018developing regional policies for sustainable development\u2019. 5. the financial envelope for the 10th EDf reflects the importance of regional inte- gration and trade in the political agendas of both the European union and the afri- can s tates. 8. the rsp/rip for the West africa region takes into account the institutional struc- ture of the region (uEmoa and EcoW as) and the specific mandate of each organi- sation. the rsp/rip for the Esa \u2013io region also takes into account the different mandates and geographical scope of the four regional organisations, with comEsa and Eac focused more on economic and political integration in their respective geographical areas, and igaD and ioc on functional cooperation. 10. the overlapping memberships in East africa has been addressed by the tripartite summit in Kampala in october 2008, where the direction was set towards a merger of the three regional organisations comEsa , Eac and saDc, thus paving the way for a free trade area and a subsequent customs union. With this new regional structure the issue of overlapping membership should disappear in the medium term. the com- mission will closely monitor and support where possible this ambitious but complex and lengthy process. the regional meeting (s eptember 2009 \u2014 lusaka) has focused on showcasing and supporting the tri- partite efforts. the commission has made demarches to igaD to encourage them to streamline their minimum integration plan into the regional fta and cu plans of the tripartite (points raised especially during the igaD\u2013Ec troika m inisterial meeting). 11. th e i r cc m e c h a n i s m i s i nte n d e d to address some of the problems posed by the issue of overlapping membership, w h i c h w a s f u r t h e r h i g h l i g h t e d a n d discussed at the lusaka meeting where a series of steps to deal effectively with the issues of alignment, convergence and coordination were agreed. ultimately, the completion of the tri-partite process should effectively deal with the issue of overlapping memberships. rEp l Y o f tH E co m m i s s i o n ",

OBSERVATIONS 19. the share of the regional envelope within the overall 10th EDf envelope is solidly grounded. the regional envelope has been increased to reflect its prominent role in Eu Development policy, as stated in the European consensus on Development. Development assistance is underpinning Eu t ra d e a n d d e ve l o p m e nt s t rate g y, including the considerable challenge of the negotiations and implementation of the Economic partnership agreements. in addition, the regional organisations' agenda has been extended to conflict prevention, good governance, migrations, promotion of human rights and sustainable development. the amount for the 10th EDf is for six years instead of five years under the 9th EDf. However, the commission is aware that the absorptive capacity of the regional organisations needs to be increased. one of the aims of the programmes is to increase absorption capacity. see also reply to paragraph 2. rEp l Y o f tH E co m m i s s i o n ",

However, the commission agrees that further improvements are still possible. these must result from discussions with all concerned partners. notably in the context of the mid-term review special attention will be given to ensure that the regional integration objectives supported by the rip will be integrated in the analysis and, where appropriate, in the review of the nips, to assess the impact of the regional programmes at national level and to ensure overall complementarity between the nips and the rips (and other Ec and other donor instruments). 25. the commission confirms the increased emphasis on regional interconnectivity in the 10th EDf national programmes. 26. the commission wishes to stress that nips are programming documents that leave room for further needs assessment in the subsequent phases of the project cycle (identification and formulation). rEp l Y o f tH E co m m i s s i o n ",

Box 1 \u2014 Insufficient link between regional and national activities Both the commission and the regional organisations are aware of the need to ensure a better articulation between the regional and the national components of inter ventions. this issue will lie at the heart of a detailed roadmap for the implementation of the 10th EDf and will be systematically addressed during project identification and formulation process. the need to reinforce support to national EcoW a s fo c a l p o i n t h a s b e e n d u l y acknowledged and could be addressed in a new project to be approved early 2010: \u2018support to monitoring of the regional integration process\u2019 (20 million euro). 34. (a) the regional Delegations are directly in- volved in the rsp preparations and all the other Delegations have been consulted throughout the programming process of the 10th EDf rsp . the need for guidelines on how to co- ordinate and share responsibility for pro- gramming is a concern that the regional Delegations have raised. it is acknowl- edged that the division of responsibili- ties and information between the dif- ferent Delegations involved needs to be strengthened. the commission is in the process of preparing these guidelines. 34. (b) the Delegations established in the head- quarters of the different regional organi- sations have, by their physical proximity, the mandate and the coordinating respon- sibility for the regional programmes. 34. (c) coordination structures between the region- alised Delegations and the Delegations in the regions can and must still be improved: staff increases and mission budgets are in- dispensible to improve the situation. the in- ternal audit report has led to intensive con- sultations among Delegations and related services in headquarters. a seminar on the management of the re- gional programmes took place in february 2009, with active participation of Delega- tions with regional responsibilities. this has led to conclusions for improvements in the flow of information. rEp l Y o f tH E co m m i s s i o n ",

Preparation of draft Country Strat- egy Paper/Regional Strategy Paper\u2019 which defines the responsibilities between the regional authorising officers, Heads of Delegations and commission headquar- ters. strategies and interventions at national and regional level have been designed, to the extent possible to ensure close interaction and subsidiarity between the two levels. Both the establishment of the regional integration roadmaps and the ongoing mid-term review of the 10th EDf national programmes will be used to improve the complementarity between the national and regional programmes. in addition specific efforts are ongoing to improve coherence between nips and rips. regional seminars were held in 2009 for nao and rao to improve coherence between national and regional strategies, such as the East africa (lusaka, september 2009) and the West africa regional (abuja, october 2009) seminars. 36. the commission agrees that reporting should be improved with more coordinated reviews by the Delegations concerned of projects in implementation. a more formal cooperation mechanism between t h e r e g i o n a l D e l e g a t i o n s h a s b e e n introduced since January 2009. improved coordination modalities have been agreed which will include two meetings per year at Heads of Delegation level. Box 2 \u2014 Inadequate reporting and monitoring by the Commission up until the Eamr of January 2009, report - ing on regional activities figured within the respective national reports. as of July 2009 a consolidated report for the regional programmes is established by the regional Delegations. in the same way, headquar- ters now produce a consolidated reply en- compassing all regional activities, which is sent to all Delegations in the region. this will contribute to an enhanced awareness of the regional activities by the Ec Delega- tions in the region. 37. Besides the total amount of the new programming, other elements play also an important role in the Delegations' workload, such as the share among the different means of aid implementation, the size and number of actions and financial operations (commitments, payments), number of focal sectors, etc. the rElEX commissioners decided in 2008 to serve better the political/policy dialogue and the regional integration and trade. this was achieved through r e d e p l o y m e n t a n d r e i n f o r c e m e n t measures, which are currently being implemented. the situation of scarcity is due to evolve as new resources will be made available. close attention will be given to improving the capacity of Delegations to handle regional integration and trade issues. the Delegation in nigeria will be reinforced by a deputy head of Delegation with specific responsibility for regional issues. in addition the office in Djibouti has been upgraded to a full Delegation to reinforce the political and development cooperation ties with the regional organisation (igaD). rEp l Y o f tH E co m m i s s i o n ",

While ircc may have shortcomings, its very existence embodies the coordination that takes place within the region during the programming and implementation of the rsp/rip. it has proved an effective tool for programming by encouraging the regional organisations to plan together. 41. the commission has duly acknowledged constraints resulting from limited human resources capacity, limited authority and lack of staff. they illustrate the difficulty of the institutional context of regional cooperation in West a frica. a new programme under the 10th EDf is currently in formulation that will incorporate lessons learned, e.g. extension of the project to all EcoWas/uEmoa monitoring capacities, rather than EDf projects and to provide for a more rigorous logical framework aiming to further develop and enhance the coordination between the roas. 42. s e v e r a l m a j o r p r o g r a m m e s s t a r t e d towards the end of the 9th EDf cycle. this relatively late start is mainly due to the late signature of the 9th EDf r i p, t h e c o m p l e x i t y o f t h e s u b j e c t (economic integration) and the number of stakeholders and countries involved. also, creating ownership among the regional organisations for the proposed i m p l e m e n t a t i o n m e c h a n i s m s a n d procedures takes time. as for the mid-term review of the 9th EDf projects in West africa, their late start is due to the late signature of the 9th EDf rip, the complexity of the subject ( e co n o m i c i n te gra t i o n ) a n d g e n e r a l delays in implementation have led to postponement of the mid-term review. the commission will pay specific attention to ensure that these evaluations are timely and to ensure compliance with reporting requirements. 43. the commission has recognised report- ing weaknesses and has raised it with the ircc. as a result the ircc and the regional organisations are in the process of develop- ing comprehensive m+E systems. for West africa the commission is addressing the is- sue with the formulation of a new project to be approved early 2010. 45. the formulation of objectives is often the expression of the political ambition rather than reflecting implementation capacity of the ros. therefore Delegations have reviewed projects often downwards to produce a better match bet ween objectives and ro capacities. the varied absorption capacities of the ros are indeed an impor tant reason for the extension of the implementation period of programmes. therefore the commission puts a high emphasis to ro's capacity building in most of its 10th EDf projects. rEp l Y o f tH E co m m i s s i o n ",

Delays in the implementation of the transport facility project are mainly due to insufficient project formulation that was too general and did not pay enough attention to cross-border cooperation and policy harmonisation as well as the functional design requirements of the border posts. a great deal of time was thus needed after project approval to address these issues before physical implementation could begin. the preliminary design of joint border posts shows a financing gap and has led to the decrease in the number of joint border posts (7 to 5) to be built. this selection is based on technical criteria to avoid political bargaining. tender procedures for works supervision have been launched. preparation of works tenders is under way. the calendar established to meet the D+5 deadline is being respected and continuous attention is being paid to this project. Box 6 \u2014 Project results partially satisfactory regional integration is a process and, in the West african context and given the region's own limited resources, it represents a new and quite dramatic change in policies and approaches that cannot be achieved in only 5 years time. this process will go on for years and commission funded projects will facilitate this integration, that in the end, rests on the region and countries' own willingness and priorities. rEp l Y o f tH E co m m i s s i o n ",

EDf support has been instrumental to some of the most visible achievements of regional integration in West africa (such as the uEmoa customs union) or East africa (such as the Eac customs union). 57. the commission has been a staunch and reliable supporter of the regional integration process in africa for more than 20 years. significant progress has been made in liberalising and harmonising the trade regime, trade facilitation, standards and quality systems, facilitating transport, harmonising monetary policy and other areas of the regional economic integration agenda. Both in East and West africa, agreements on harmonising structures for the regional organisations (such as the ircc) and im- provements on their performance have been achieved. commitments for their fu- ture unification have also been obtained. regarding policy, the issue of the ration- alisation of regional organisations has be- come part of the Joint africa\u2013Eu strategy, thereby enhancing political and policy dialogue on the issue between the african union, regional organisations and the Eu . rEp l Y o f tH E co m m i s s i o n ",
