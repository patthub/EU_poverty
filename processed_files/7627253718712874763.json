        "I N T R O D U C T I ON - T HE P U R P O SE OF T HE G R E EN P A P ER P\u00e1draig Flynn, Member of the Commission, responsible for Social Affairs and Employment -L/uropean social policy 1 is entering into a critical phase. This is due to three main fac tors: (i) the present Social action programme is reaching its natural end. The Commis sion has presented all of the 47 proposals involved and, while some of the most important proposals are still pending before the Council, the majority have been adopted; (ii) the entry into force of the Treaty on European Union has opened up new possi bilities for Community action in the social field, particularly by giving a stronger role to the social partners; and (iii) the changing socio economic situation, reflec ted notably in the serious 1 The term \"social policy' has many diffe rent meanings which also vary from Mem ber State to Member State. For the purposes of this document it is taken to mean the full range of policies in the social sphere inclu ding labour market policies. Photo:^ CEC levels of unemployment, is requiring a new look at the link between economic and social policies, both at national and Community level. The Commission considers that this situation requires the launching of a wide-ranging debate about the future direc tion of social policy, before it proceeds to put forward speci fic proposals in the form of a White Paper. To prepare this Green Paper, the Commission issued a public appeal for contributions and comments; 150 contributions have been received, including official responses from Mem ber States and from a wide range of bodies and individu als. These are listed in Annex I. The contributions have demonstrated a firm interest in clarifying various aspects of EC social policy in the next stage of development of the Europe an Community. The intention is to stimulate a wide-ranging debate within all Member States about the futu re lines of social policy in the European Union. It is being issued to coincide with the rati fication of the Maastricht Trea ty, an opportune time to take stock and consider the different options for the future. The Green Paper is, therefore, designed to form the basis of such a debate, which, it is hoped, will take place not only at national level within each Member State but also between all interested parties, including, of course, the social partners, as well as specific interest groups. The Commission will follow these discussions care fully and seek to draw from them the major themes of the future White Paper. This Green Paper does not deal with the procedural implications of the new Maastricht provisions as these will be the subject of a separate Communication. Of course, this process will be taking place at a moment when the attention of the Community is focused on the whole issue of how to reconcile economic and social objectives in the face of rising unemployment and growing concern about Eu rope's ability to remain com petitive into the 21 st century. There is much debate in all Member States about how to address the problem of unem ployment, much of which is now recognized as being struc tural in character. The issues under discussion include the need for greater labour market adaptability, the suggestion that wage differentials should be widened and that wages should vary more in function of eco nomic conditions, and ques tions about whether social benefits should be reduced or targeted so as to provide greater incentives to seek work. This is linked to the problems which all Member States are having in funding the growing demand on social protection systems and the search for greater effi ciency in the operation of these systems as one means of making savings. At the same time, there exists a growing degree of public con cern that, contrary to the objec tive of ensuring that economic and social progress should go hand in hand as clearly stated in both the Treaties of Rome and Maastricht, the net impact of the integration process could be a levelling down of social standards. This is reflected in the fear that the creation of a single market could open the way to a form of social dum ping, that is the gaining of unfair competitive advantage within the Community through unacceptably low social stan dards. But there is also a con cern that, somehow, the impe rative of action at European level can become a pretext for changes in social standards at national level. In this context, this Green Paper, and the process of de bate which it is designed to trigger, will be interactive with the discussions around the forthcoming White Paper on growth, competitiveness and ",
        "INTRODUCTION employment, due to be presen ted to the European Council on 10 December. Since the Green Paper is designed ultimately to channel ideas into the develop ment of the next phase of social policy at European level, it is clear that analysis and pro posals for action contained in the White Paper on growth will help also to shape the climate and the substance of the coming debate on how best to combine the objectives of economic suc cess and social progress. The premise at the heart of this Green Paper is that the next phase in the development of European social policy cannot be based on the idea that social progress must go into retreat in order for economic competi tiveness to recover. On the con trary, as has been stated on many occasions by the Euro pean Council, the Community is fully committed to ensuring that economic and social pro gress go hand in hand. Indeed, much of Europe's influence and power has come precisely from its capacity to combine wealth creation with enhanced bene fits and freedoms for its people. In current conditions this will not be easy. But Europe's con tinuing contribution to the search for a model of sustain able development which com bines economic dynamism with social progress can only be made if the issues are openly debated and a consensus ar rived at. The rich diversity of the cultures and social systems within the European Union is a competitive advantage in a fast- changing world. All societies are in the same process of lear ning. But diversity may deteri orate into disorder if the com mon goals, which embody the distinctive values of European society and are set out in the Treaty on European Union, are not defended by the efforts of Member States and by people themselves. Part I sets out what the Com munity has already achieved in the social sphere. Part II looks at the social challenges now facing us all. It examines the risks of declining social cohe sion in Europe and the threats to important common goals such as social protection, soli darity and high levels of employment. A new medium- term strategy is needed which will draw together economic and social policies in partner ship rather than in conflict with each other. Only in this way will sustainable growth, social solidarity and public confi dence be restored. It is acknow ledged that European produc tion systems need to be based on the new technologies. There can be no social progress with out wealth creation. But it should also be recognised that the consequent structural chan ges will have considerable impact on other important areas, such as employment intensity, working and living conditions, the quality of life and the development of indu strial relations. Part III discus ses the possible responses of the Union to these challenges, both in terms of what Member States want and of what the Community is trying to achie ve. Part IV provides a brief con clusion. Part V brings together the questions raised in different parts of the Green Paper. These will be the focus of the debate to follow. Graphs in the Green Paper are drawn from the Employment in Europe report 1993, except Figure 19 which comes from the Report on social protection 1993. Europe is at a turning point. Decisions taken in the coming period will set the direction of social policy for many years to come. Now is the time for all sections of opinion to make their views known. The Community is fully committed to ensuring that economic and social progress go together Photo: \u00a9CEC ",

        "I - A C H I E V E M E N TS OF T HE C O M M U N I TY SOCIAL D I M E N S I ON Cc community social policy has covered a wide range of areas. These include equality of opportunity, health and safety matters, employment and labour law matters, issues of social protection and social security, as well as action focu sed on specific points such as poverty and the role of the dis abled. It has been developed both through the evolution of the Treaties and by social and economic change, and has drawn on a variety of instru ments, depending on the objec tive concerned. It has, in this respect, fulfilled three major functions: (i) to provide a legal frame work in specific given areas of the Treaty design ed to connect the dialogue between the social part ners, thereby contributing to the definition at various levels of fundamental soci al rights for workers; (ii) to give substantial financi al support in particular for training and employment measures, thereby contri buting to the redistribution of financial resources; (iii) to stimulate and encoura ge cooperation between various actors of social policy, the setting-up of networks and partnerships, the exchange of informati on and experience and the promotion of innovation, good practice and policies. Legislation has, therefore, been only one of a number of tools at the disposal of Community social policy and is too often considered in isolation. Often it has complemented other instruments. Legislation itself can be used in various ways; only rarely has it been used to prescribe certain specific actions in the social policy sphere. Fundamental social rights for workers have been further consolidated in the case-law of the European Court of Justice A. LEGAL ATTAINMENTS OR 'ACQUIS' Legal provisions have been put in place over a long period. They have furnished a sound basis for the guarantee of fun damental social rights for wor kers, rights which have been further consolidated in the case- law of the European Court of Justice. The amount of legisla tion is relatively small in rela tion to other instruments. The first regulations adopted in the social field relate to free movement of workers, one of the four freedoms of the Treaty, and specifically concern coor dination of social security systems for migrant workers. These regulations provide basic rights for the free movement of workers, which have been widely used by European citi zens including through recour se to the European Court. Another area of Community legislation is equal treatment between men and women. It is worth noting how a Treaty pro vision (Article 119) based ori ginally on a competition argu ment has been able to serve in practice as a basis for a com prehensive policy combining rights and the promotion of equal opportunities for women. It is an example of how on the basis of legal rights comple mented by positive actions, the Community has been able to make an active contribution and to stimulate a response to a major issue of a progressive society. A third area of more recent legal development concerns the protection of workers as regards health and safety at work. On the basis of a framework direc tive minimum requirements to encourage improvements in the health and safety of workers at work have been adopted at Community level and constitu te a major set of rights cover ing all sectors of activity. Other legislation concerning the protection of workers and labour law has been significant in particular for preventing risks of social dumping, even if a number of major pieces of pro posed legislation have yet to be finalized. They should, howe ver, be seen as priority items for adoption by the Council. Details of the scope and con tent of Community legislation are to be found in Annex II. ",
        "ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY SOCIAL DIMENSION B. THE COMMUNITY CHARTER OF THE FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL RIGHTS OF WOR KERS A ND THE ACTION PROGRAMME The instruments used by the Community either singly or in combination culminated in the Community Charter of the Fun damental Social Rights of Workers adopted in 1989 and in the Commission's action programme. The Charter repre sents a framework of principles, covering many aspects of wor king and living conditions. The 1990/91 action programme is aimed at giving a tangible expression to these principles. The Charter as such was a new point of departure for the Com munity - not only in operatio nal terms but also as a political signal. It expressed the politi cal will that the completion of the internal market should not be achieved without taking the 'social dimension' into account. All of the 47 initiatives an nounced in the action pro gramme have been presented by the Commission. Many of these measures did not require legislative action; 29 of the measures required Council approval and of these, 16 have been adopted. The action programme was based on four fundamental pre mises: (i) subsidiarity, i.e. taking account of the specific nature of social policy and its objectives and ensuring that the type of action (har monization, coordination, convergence, cooperation, etc.) is matched to the sub ject matter; also that due consideration is given to known needs and to the potential added value of Community action; (ii) the diversity of national systems, cultures and prac tices, where this is a posi tive element in terms of the completion of the internal market; (iii) the preservation of the competitiveness of firms, taking into consideration economic and social issu es: (iv) reducing disparities bet ween Member States with out interfering in the com parative advantage of the less-developed regions. Details of the progress of indi vidual initiatives are set out in Annex III. In each initiative a balance was sought and achieved. This is the essential background to the Commission's action program me, which seeks to establish a sound base of minimum provi sions, with regard given to the need to avoid any distortion of competition, to support moves to strengthen economic and social cohesion and to contri bute to the creation of jobs, which is the prime aim of com petition in the internal market. The dynamic thus created has had the beneficial effect of ena bling many Member States to bring their national legisla tion up to date as part of the process of transferring Com munity law. The wide variety of tools used by the Commission in its action programme has led to the mobi lization of many actors: natio nal authorities, employers, uni ons, regional and local autho rities, non-governmental orga nizations, social workers, prac titioners, experts involved in observatories and specialist groups. Although proposals for binding legislation have played a part, notably on free movement of workers, working conditions and health and safety issues, specific programmes (for example, Poverty III. Helios II, older people and solidarity bet ween generations), convergen ce strategies for social protec tion and cooperation activities have enjoyed a somewhat high er profile in social policy deve- C. FINANCIAL S U P P O RT lopment. In the case of certain areas, such as equal opportuni ties for women, the balance bet ween legislative and program me-based activity has been much more even. The massive financial support of the European Social Fund (ESF) for training and employ ment measures has contributed greatly to the development of national measures, especially as far as young people and the long-term unemployed are con cerned. The role of the ESF has been especially significant in developing training in the least -favoured regions of the Com munity. During the period 1989-93 the ESF devoted more than ECU 21 billion to these activities, benefiting around 17 million people in the Community. The scope of the European Social Fund (ESF) has been widened as a result of the recent revision of the ESF regulation. Its tasks now include broad human resources development and the improvement of the workings of the labour market. There is an explicit commit ment that the principle of equal opportunities for women and men should be respected in the implementation of actions financed by the ESF. The revision of the ESF regu lation has also equipped it with new tools to provide a more effective and flexible response to the changing labour market requirements and specific chal lenges facing Member States. A new Objective 4 has been created which aims to facilita te the adaptation of workers to industrial change and changes in production systems. This not only adds a preventive dimen sion to the fight against unem ployment but contributes to competitiveness and growth. Moreover, in addition to conti- 10 ",
        "ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY SOCIAL DIMENSION During the period 1989-93 the ESF devoted more than ECU 21 billion to training and employment measures Photo.\u00ae CEC nuing its focus on young peo ple and the long-term unem ployed, ESF support under Objective 3 has been extended to cover those exposed to long- term unemployment and exclu sion from the labour market. Particular emphasis is also pla ced on strengthening employ ment services, broadening the scope of direct aids to employ ment, extending the range and quality of initial training and, in the least favoured regions, reinforcing education, training and research, science and tech nology systems. D. COOPERATION, MOBILIZATION, EXCHANGES In response to social and eco nomic change and to common challenges facing Member Sta tes, a number of programmes and exchanges have been deve loped. These have led to the creation of large and successful networks. In some cases, this has involved promotion of exchanges of information on national situations and/or poli cies (e.g. observatories/net works on employment, equal opportunities, family policies, ageing, exclusion). In addition, exchange programmes have tried to identify and evaluate innovative actions and to orga nize exchanges of experience for long-term unemployment, local development, integration of disabled persons, etc. Other programmes have concentrated on research and awareness campaigns (in particular in the health area, e.g. the cancer pro gramme). On certain issues, more com prehensive programmes com bine financial support and exchanges (PETRA, IRIS, LEI, poverty, older people and soli darity between generations) and/or support concrete actions and legislation. These are good examples of the combining of instruments in social policy. Whether the programmes con cern categories of people (older people, disabled people) or issues (employment, health, equal opportunities for women and men, local development, training, poverty/exclusion), they are based on the same approach, one in which the Community added value is clearly identifiable. They encourage innovation, good practice and policies, the exchange of ideas and experi ence, the transfer of know-how and the development of exchan ge of practitioners. In this way, participants have been mobilized; partnerships at various levels have been esta blished and developed; and the search for more coherent and comprehensive approaches on social issues has been stimula ted. The setting-up of durable and effective networks and the achieving of Community added value are significant benefits. 11 ",

SOCIAL DIALOGUE: A CONSENSUS A P P R O A CH TO SOCIAL POLICY F. CONCLUSION This brief and necessarily suc cinct overview of the achieve ments of the Community's social policy to date shows clearly its breadth and vitality. The search for agreement has not always been easy and has even, on occasions, been con troversial. But the overall thrust remains clear: the social dimen sion has been an integral and significant element of the pro cess of integration since the inception of the Community. This is the foundation upon which the next phase of action must be built. The nature and scale of the challenges which Europe must face in the coming years, as set out in Part II, show clearly that many changes will be necessary both at national and at Community level. But the fundamental objectives will remain constant; the advance ment of economic and social progress as two sides of the same coin and the search to ensure that the process of inte gration is clearly identified in the minds of all the population as bringing in its wake an incre mental improvement in social and living standards rather than the reverse. A key feature of the Commis sion's method of work in brin ging forward proposals in the social field has been the prac tice of extensive consultation of the social partners at various stages in both the conception of initiatives and the detailed writ ing of texts. This has taken place principally via the net work of tripartite consultative committees which exist in all the main areas of policy, such as health and safety and equa lity of opportunities. But it has also involved a more ad hoc process of seeking the views of a wide range of representative bodies, including those three organizations, UNICE, ETUC and CEEP, which make up the present social dialogue at Euro pean level. In parallel with legal provi sions and complementary to them, the development of soci al dialogue between employ ers and unions is a major fea ture of the evolution of Euro pean social policy. This has already provided a number of joint opinions (see Annex IV) on important issues concer ning training and labour mar ket policies, together with a framework agreement bet ween three organizations: ETUC, CEEP and UNICE. Moreover, this consensus approach has been promoted through regular and separate consultation of the social part ners for each relevant propo sal. This clearly illustrates the method chosen: dialogue and a search for consensus. The Single European Act reinfor ced structures for social dia logue, which are now a com ponent of the Social Agree ment of the Treaty on Europe an Union. The emphasis pla ced on this in the Agreement, following from a consensus between employers and uni ons, is an illustration of the ways and means by which the Community intends to pro mote the development of soci al policy: concertation, nego tiation, consensus. 12 ",
        "Il \u00ad T HE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE W h hat follows is an attempt to identify, in a synthetic and concise way, the major trends and challenges for Europe. It is not intended to be exhaustive. Many of the issues, however, have been the subject of reports and other papers which offer more detailed analysis. Exam\u00ad ples are the social protection report and this year's report on employment in Europe. Pres\u00ad sure is being felt in many areas: demography, family structure, new technology, relations in the workplace, tax and the distri\u00ad bution of income, etc. This pressure raises issues regarding the future direction of the wel\u00ad fare State, social justice, equa\u00ad lity of opportunity and other matters. Pressure is experien\u00ad ced by all Member States, albeit in different ways. Considerati\u00ad on of these challenges forms the essential background to any discussion of the future deve\u00ad lopment of social policy. The possible response to those chal\u00ad lenges is examined in Part III. It is important to realize that the real debate is less about high or low standards but rath\u00ad er about issues of trade\u00adoff bet\u00ad ween measures universally recognized as desirable, such as high levels of social protec\u00ad tion or adequate social securi\u00ad ty, and the impact of these mea\u00ad sures on government budgets and the competitiveness of companies. Economic and social considerations are inex\u00ad tricably linked in this analysis. Social progress is possible only through economic success but equally high social standards are a vital part of building a competitive economy. Many, but by no means all, of the issu\u00ad es require public intervention but social policy depends in the last resort on the active com\u00ad mitment and participation of everyone concerned: public authorities, social partners, spe\u00ad cial interest groups and volun\u00ad tary bodies and, of course, indi\u00ad viduals. A. EUROPE IN THE WORLD As the European Community moves towards the European Union set out in the Maastricht Treaty, with a Treaty on a Euro\u00ad pean Economic Area with the EFTA countries and enlarge\u00ad ment to include the Nordic Countries and Austria and, perhaps, the countries of Cen\u00ad tral and Eastern Europe around the turn of the century, it is important to take stock of the global forces behind these developments. The Western socioeconomic model was built on twin foun\u00ad dations in the post\u00adWorld War II period: full employment and the welfare State. Coupled with political democracy and human rights these constituted the pul\u00ad ling power. With the disappea\u00ad rance of a two\u00adblock world stra\u00ad tegic system, in which defence and the nuclear balance domi\u00ad nated, world strategic compe\u00ad tition and cooperation will be increasingly based on success in socioeconomic development, involving different and, to some extent, competing forms of capitalism. On this chessboard of socioe\u00ad conomic competition and coo\u00ad peration, European socioeco\u00ad nomic models have high pre\u00ad stige because of post\u00adwar suc\u00ad cesses. The Community is one of the most prosperous areas of the world. While it contains only 7% of the world's working age population, it produces some 30% of world GDP and 45% of world trade in manu\u00ad factured goods. At the moment, however, despite the job\u00adcrea\u00ad ting recovery of the 1980s, which was linked to the mobi\u00ad lizing goal of the single market, Europe begins to falter and there is a resurgence of Euro\u00ad pessimism. But even if the public debate on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty un\u00ad leashed unforeseen difficulties, it should not be forgotten that the vigour of the debate testi\u00ad fies to the continuing power of the European idea. And even if the Social Chapter has proved to be a particular source of dif\u00ad ficulty, there appears to be a popular wish for a Europe less dominated by economic and technocratic considerations, one \u25a0\u039b\u00ad..; ; The main social objectives of the Union cover issues close to the daily lives of the citizens and workers Photo:\u00ae CEC \\f MAASTRICHT 7-2-92 P v 6> 'V ' \u2022 \u00ad > ^> ^r^ d^fz^ 13 ",
        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE closer to the living and working needs of the population. In this context social policy is bound to be of growing importance in its own right, as well as provi ding accompanying policy for other strategic objectives such as the single market and eco nomic and monetary union. Indeed, the Treaty on European Union (Article 2) clearly esta blishes that the tasks of the Union will include: \u2022 a high level of employment and social protection, \u2022 the raising of the standard of living and the quality of life; \u2022 economic and social cohesi on and solidarity between all its Member States. The Articles of the EEC Treaty specifically related to social policy spell out the objectives to include the working and living conditions of workers (117), health and safety at work (118a), equal treatment bet ween women and men at work (119) and the development of the social dialogue between the social partners (employers and trade unions) at European level ( 118b) and the European Soci al Fund (Article 123).The Trea ty on European Union, in its Agreement on Social Policy, recalls and strengthens these objectives with a sharper accent on the dialogue between the social partners and its potential results. At the same time it broadens the scope of the objectives of social policy (human resources, employm ent, social protection and soci al exclusion), and defines the areas for decision by qualified- majority. Thus, the main social objectives of the Union cover issues close to the daily lives of the citizens and workers. These objectives provide the thread running throughout this Green Paper. But since we are now in the phase of constructing a more democratic Europe, let us begin by asking, as a basis for dis cussion and debate, a funda mental question. B. WHAT SORT OF A SOCIETY DO EUROPEANS WANT? Europe's strength lies in its eth nic, linguistic and cultural diversity, not only because of the rich quality of life that this brings, but also because the complex social challenges ahead call for a variety of solu tions through which all Mem ber States can learn from one another. But for this strength to be preserved there needs to be a common sense of purpose, coo peration to seek out solutions, and common policies and Com munity instruments when these prove to be necessary, in accor dance with the principle of sub sidiarity. Indeed, throughout the history of the Community there have been European values which, though a source of con troversy on occasion, never theless provide common ground in the long run. Democracy, individual rights and freedoms, equality of opportunities, diver sity of culture, respect for human dignity, social security and the rule of law are not as such a matter of controversy. These are shared values which need to be translated into poli tical action by the Member Sta tes and the Union together, and to involve the civic society. What is not at issue is that they are fundamental to the future development of European society. There is no doubt that, in one form or another, all Europeans want a world in which econo mic and social progress go together - a society in which women and men can participa te on an equal footing. But it has to be admitted that the recessions that were ushered in by the oil-price shocks of the 1970s have revealed the new challenges facing employment, the welfare State and equality of opportunity. Although there was a substantial European recovery in the 1980s, with over 9 million new jobs crea ted, unemployment has conti nued to rise and the welfare State is confronted by new pressures. Poverty and social exclusion are to be seen on the streets. It is important to underline that high standards of social pro tection have been a major con tributory factor in Europe's economic success in the past. Many would argue that high social standards should not be seen as an optional extra, or a luxury which can be done with out once times get hard, but rather as an integral part of a competitive economic model. The debate between this view and those who argue that Euro pe's present level of social stan dards have become unafforda- ble goes to the heart of issue. So what is going wrong? With the great depression of the 1930s behind them, the foun ders of the modern European socioeconomic system saw the world in terms of boom and depression. The 'full employ ment' of economic resources could be maintained through government action on the level of economic demand; the wel fare State would transfer inco me to those at risk of poverty through unemployment, ill- health or old age. The active population would thereby finance a guaranteed and/or minimum income for the non- active population. In this sense, social policy was largely based 14 ",

Patncola on the transfer of income to the needy through the tax system, and the development of social security systems based in cer\u00ad tain countries on contributions by employers and workers so as to maintain incomes in times of need. There are a number of major reasons for looking afresh at this approach: First, the citizens of advanced, industrialized democracies such as those in the European Com\u00ad munity have difficulty in for\u00ad ging a personal and social iden\u00ad tity when they are part of the 'non-active' population. As new jobs are created in Euro\u00ad pe, new groups enter the labour market because there is a latent 'social' demand for work, as well as the economic demand arising from the wish to main\u00ad tain or expand family income. Many women, for example, seek work for reasons of eman\u00ad cipation, dignity, social identi\u00ad ty and the ordering of their lives, as well as for income. Beyond paid work there is a demand for voluntary activity, as witnessed by the rapid and healthy growth of community organizations and associations, and by the active involvement of older people in them. People want to participate and need to have that activity recognized, whatever it is and whether it is carried out inside or outside the home. Second, we are in a world of continuing structural change rather than one dominated by boom, depression and world wars. It will soon be 50 years after the end of World War II and the record shows that somehow or other the econo\u00ad mic policy-makers have suc\u00ad ceeded in evening out some of the worst parts at the top and the bottom (the boom and the recession periods) of the eco\u00ad nomic cycle. Despite the local and regional conflicts that have followed the collapse of com\u00ad munism, it is probable that we are emerging into a world dominated by peaceful socio\u00ad economic competition based on self-generated change, rather than economic and social restructuring forced by boom, depression and war. But eco\u00ad nomic policy is still dominated by short-term cyclical policies and has not yet succeeded in wedding cyclical and structu\u00ad ral policies. An additional fac\u00ad tor is the effect of the 'globa\u00ad lization' process which implies ever greater ability on the part of economic actors to cope with permanent change and a need to adjust more rapidly. Third, demographic trends include several components which have a significant bea\u00ad ring on the future of social and economic policies: \u2022 the ageing of the population and its effects on social pro\u00ad tection, future employment trends, the shifting balance between active and non- active population, the inte\u00ad gration and participation of older people in social and economic life; 15 ",

Fourth, the development of new technology has deeply altered the organization and even the concept of work. It has brought new forms of work, the adap\u00ad tation of skills and new ap\u00ad proaches to work. This has also affected relationships in the workplace; it has led to new forms of working time, pay and job specification and to new challenges for methods of negotiation and collective bar\u00ad gaining between firms and their partners. A further complicati\u00ad on is the growing number of people excluded from the labour market and the increa\u00ad sing concern among the social partners regarding the external conditions affecting the deve\u00ad lopment of firms. Fifth, we have to take into account the growth of the black economy in certain traditional sectors but also in new areas, together with its relationship with traditional and new forms of work (home working, local employment initiatives, etc.). Sixth, the combination of these factors leads to a search for: \u2022 new approaches to respon\u00ad sibility, both at individual level (such as in the active search for employment) as well as at collective level, public and private; \u2022 new roles for various bodies (social partners, voluntary organizations, local authori\u00ad ties); \u2022 new forms of solidarity lea\u00ad ding to new partnerships bet\u00ad ween all the relevant actors in the field of social policy. One obvious outcome of these various pressures to which our societies are being subjected is the escalating costs of social security budgets particularly in the health field, leading to doubts about Europe's ability to continue to fund these systems into the future. There is a high risk that the con\u00ad tinued pursuit of present poli\u00ad cies will lead ultimately to a 'dual' society in which wealth creation is primarily in the hands of a highly qualified labour force, while income is transferred to a growing num\u00ad ber of non-active people as a basis for a reasonable level of social justice. Such a society would not only become increa\u00ad singly less cohesive, it would also run counter to the need for the maximum mobilization of Europe's human resource wealth in order to remain com\u00ad petitive. The alternative would be to seek to create an 'active' society where there is a wider distribution of income, achie\u00ad ved by means other than sim\u00ad ple social security transfers, and in which each individual feels able to contribution not only to production (as part of the search for full employment) but also via a more active partici\u00ad pation in the development of society as a whole. An 'active' society is also one which has the ability to provide an ade\u00ad quate supply of the 'collective goods' - such as education, health and social protection systems - which are required to ensure its innovative capaci\u00ad ties and its ability to adjust quickly. Which way Europe goes will not depend on a single choice, but on the answers given to three inter-related questions linked to the fundamental objectives of the Treaty on European Union and to the social foundations of the future Europe: \u2022 Is there a route back to full employment? \u03a6 Should the welfare State be given a new role? \u03a6 What is the next stage in equality of opportunity, without which European democracy will falter? 16 ",
        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE C. IS THERE A ROUTE BACK TO FULL EMPLOYMENT? Despite Europe's efforts over the last decade, full employ ment can no longer be taken for granted as the automatic out come of growth-creating eco nomic policies. All the eviden ce points to deep underlying structural problems in Europe which make a return to full employment unlikely in the foreseeable future unless signi ficant changes of policy are introduced. Therefore, it is clear that there is no single road back to a high level of employment. Whilst higher levels of econo mic growth are indispensable if more jobs are to be created, the foreseeable rates of growth will not solve the problems. The harsh reality is that Euro pe has been creating fewer jobs than Japan and the United Sta tes: only 60% of the working- age population is in work in the Community compared to over 70% or even 75% in compara ble economies. This means it has a bigger latent demand for work which eats up the new jobs without bringing down unemployment, and probably more 'mismatch' unemploy ment, that is to say people with out the skills and qualifications to fill the available jobs. The reasons which lie behind this discrepancy in Europe's performance in job creation have already been the subject of previous Commission texts (see notably the Employment in Europe report 1993) and will not be entered into detail here. The key point to note is that this relatively low employment rate means that it is necessary to create a large number of new jobs in order to have any real impact on unemployment levels. For example, during the period 1985-91, Europe crea ted over 9 million jobs but unemployment only dropped by 3 million. (See Figure 1.) 1. The challenge of technological and structural change The essential point that has to be grasped is that Europe, like all the major economic areas on the world stage such as North America, Asia, Russia and China is entering a new era of radical technological and struc tural change. Global interna tional competition is pushing Europe to the frontier of new technologies, to a new balance between manufacturing, servi ces and agriculture, to different combinations of physical and human capital, and to a society in which individuals have to change their skills and qualifi cations over the course of their lives. There is no going back on this radical process of change towards the post-industrial society.

This means that it is neces sary to create a large number of new jobs in order to have any real impact on unem ployment levels. 17 ",
        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE Photo: CEC Global international competition is pushing Europe to the frontier of new technologies strialized societies the job destruction/job creation process is very turbulent; around 10% of jobs are destroyed each year. The outcome in terms of unem ployment will depend on how successfully the adaptation of the labour force is managed and the scale on which new jobs are created. That is why we need a dynamic approach by employ ers, trade unions and govern ments to new sources of job creation, new forms of employ ment, work organization and qualifications. Only in this way can we spread jobs and work income across the population. That a mix of macroeconomic and structural policies is now needed is widely accepted. But the exploration of new structu ral policies has been largely limited to improving the func tioning of markets, including labour markets, whereas a rather more radical approach aimed at moving towards active labour market and social policy is what is required. Such a fresh search would include the whole range of rele vant policies. This would cover industrial, regional, technolo gical, welfare, education and training policies. It would also include and go beyond macro- economic and active labour market policies, acting respec tively on the demand and sup ply sides of labour, which have been the traditional basis for employment policy. 2. The employment policy tripod Three policy approaches are necessary to attack the problem: (i) a dynamic and stable macroeconomic environ ment. (ii) fundamental structural changes, (iii) a dynamic but equitable process of social adjust ment. The first, the creation of a sta ble, non inflationary macro- economic environment. For a long time, employment has not been an economic policy aim as such. This partly changed after the oil-price shock reces sions, when a stable, non infla tionary macroeconomic policy did become the framework for achieving growth, efficient allo cation of resources and full employment. But employment has not always been seen as an objective per se of such poli cies, largely because the 'full employment' of all factors of production, including labour, has been seen as a derivative of perfectly functioning markets, which supposes that prices adjust. This is the key issue: labour markets cannot operate with major upward and down ward wage fluctuations, be cause of the human, political and social issues involved. The conflict between economic and social policies hinges around this issue. It is only recently that employment is becoming an explicit aim of economic policy, leading to a whole range of new medium-term structural policies, and to intense consi deration of how short-term eco nomic recovery programmes can lead to the fastest possible increase of employment. The fact is that until now, this approach has not resulted in the improvement aimed at. The second, structural policies related to employment, needs to be focused on the following central questions, namely (1) the new sources of job creati on, (2) the relationship between the investment process and job creation, (3) the impact of taxa tion and social security funding on the functioning of the labour markets, and (4) the balance between physical and human capital which is necessary to exploit new technological opportunities. The third, dynamic and equi table social adjustment, is dominated by the issue of whether labour markets should be left to function only through price adjustments, or whether and in what new forms adjust ments can be foreseen and pre pared. This will require in the first instance active labour mar ket policies designed to increa se employment. It will also require, however, active social protection policies targeted less at income maintenance than at helping to integrate vulnerable individuals into the economy and society. The answers will require new links between macroeconomic, structural and social policies of a kind that have emerged from the debate on the environment. It is strange that whereas the depletion of natural resources has led to the widely accepted goal of sustainable growth, the depletion of human resources through unemployment and social exclusion is only now raising the political temperature to that point. Perhaps the con cept of employment-intensive growth will serve that purpo se? But it should be borne in mind that it is not only government policies that will change the situation.

        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE consuming, saving and in vesting will determine the society of the future, and the role of work in it. 3. The role of work in society To grapple with this contem porary issue, we need to under stand the origins of the present role of paid work in society. The industrial revolution split the production and welfare functions in society, functions which in the agricultural com munity were combined in fami lies, villages and small towns. Migration into growing cities and work in factories broke the rural networks and gradually led to welfare functions being focused first on charities, trusts, religious orders and trade unions, and then increasingly on the State. The industrial revolution and the technology of the production line not only separated the work and welfare functions but also rigidified the separation of work from other activities. Yet work has other functions in addition to provi ding income: purposeful activi ty and personal fulfilment, dig nity, social contacts, recogniti on and a basis for organizing daily or weekly time. The mas sive entry of women into the labour market is partly a reflec tion of this reality. Their role in the economy and in society will have a decisive influence in the future. Demographic trends, notably the ageing of the popu lation, will soon reinforce the need to keep as many people as possible in an active role, and the new technologies may faci litate more dispersed economic activities and more flexible labour markets and working time. These changes could mean that the division between 'working time' and 'other time' will again fade, so that work is reintegrated into a wider pat tern of activities. They present the challenge of realigning work and welfare in ways that help as many as possible to par ticipate actively in their socie ties, while taking advantage of the greater flexibility that new modes of production allow. Photo: \u00a9 CEC The division between 'working time ' and 'other time ' will fade, so that work is reintegrated into a wider pattern of activities D. A NEW ROLE FOR THE WELFARE STATE? The analysis so far suggests that we are in the middle of a reali gnment of the functions of the State, the enterprise and the family, such as took place in the course of the industrial revolu tion. If so, this may imply that the role of the welfare State may have to be reassessed, not only because of the funding pressures but, more fundamen tally, because of the need to move towards more active poli cies aimed at ensuring people's integration into work and society. Social welfare is a major achievement of modern socie ties. In this they are usually strongly supported by public opinion, as is shown recently in a Eurobarometer survey that highlighted the almost unani mous support for a high level of social protection. Social wel fare is also a major component of social cohesion and solida rity. However, social welfare and social protection systems are faced with growing pressures owing to five main factors: (i) the evolution of the labour market and in particular rising unemployment (see Figure 2); (ii) demographic trends and in particular the ageing of the population; (iii) changes in family struc ture; (iv) the growing incidence of poverty and social exclu sion resulting from these trends; (v) a massive increase in demand for a whole range of social services inclu ding, in particular, health care. 19 ",

Once policy-makers realized that welfare spending could not go on indefinitely increasing its share of the cake, the emergen\u00ad ce of a widespread political debate on the future of the wel\u00ad fare State became inevitable. Up to now the debate has focused on various issues: \u2022 the importance of control\u00ad ling the explosive growth in government social spending, in particular on health care; \u2022 the establishing of incenti\u00ad ves for people to work; \u2022 a possible new mix of public and private schemes, with some attempts to focus public expenditure on those most in need (sometimes called 'targeting'), giving the occupational and/or private sector an increased role in particular in pension and in health care; \u2022 a more decentralized approach through, in some cases, the development of the role of local authorities and/or welfare organiz\u00ad ations. It is important to recognize in this respect that in modern societies, where labour markets will be required to be more flexible, individuals need soci\u00ad al protection. The debate has also revealed the public's wish to maintain high standards both in terms of the availability and the quality of social services. The so-called crises of social protection, health and educati\u00ad on all have something in com\u00ad mon: an explosive demand from individuals and families. At the same time, from the point of view of society, they are perceived as being linked to the public good, to national welfare, and to equality. In democracies, no-one can pre\u00ad vent individuals from spending on health, future pensions and the education of children. And yet a society in which the suc\u00ad cessful can 'consume' these services in the market to the possible detriment of a public system available to all, does raise difficult questions regar\u00ad ding social equity. 1. Social exclusion Poverty and marginalization are nothing new and have for some time given rise not only to anal\u00ad ysis of a scientific and political nature but also to numerous public and private initiatives. But public debate on these mat\u00ad ters has greatly changed over the past 15 years. The empha\u00ad sis is now on the structural nature of a process which excludes part of the population from economic and social opportunities. The problem is not only one of disparities be\u00ad tween the top and bottom of the social scale, but also between those who have a place in society and those who are excluded. Social exclusion does not only mean insufficient income. It 20 ",
        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE even goes beyond participation in working life; it is manifest in fields such as housing, educa\u00ad tion, health and access to ser\u00ad vices. It affects not only indi\u00ad viduals who have suffered serious set-backs but social groups, particularly in urban and rural areas, who are subject to discrimination, segregation or the weakening of the tradi\u00ad tional forms of social relations. More generally, by highlighting the flaws in the social fabric, it suggests something more than social inequality and, conco\u00ad mitantly, carries with it the risk of a dual or fragmented society. Lone parenthood responsibili\u00ad ties and low income levels leave women in particular in situations of poverty with poor prospects of improving their position. The causes of exclusion are multiple: persistent unemploy\u00ad ment and especially long-term unemployment; the impact of industrial change on poorly skilled workers; the evolution of family structures and the decline of traditional forms of solidarity; the growth of indi\u00ad vidualism and the decline of traditional representative insti\u00ad tutions; and finally new forms of migration, particularly ille\u00ad gal immigration and move\u00ad ments of population. All these phenomena are sometimes coupled with traditional forms of poverty concentrated in dec\u00ad lining urban areas or in rural areas lagging behind the gene\u00ad ral progress in society. Growing resentment at being excluded from sharing in wealth and opportunities heigh\u00ad tens the risk of people being driven to desperation and dis\u00ad ruptive behaviour such as vio\u00ad lence or drugs. Insecurity gene\u00ad rates fear of the future, often leading in turn to introversion or susceptibility to racist ideo\u00ad logies, xenophobic behaviour and political and social extre\u00ad mism. It is to be feared that the effects of all these factors will worsen in the next few years. The employment situation is unfa\u00ad vourable, public funds are severely limited, the geogra\u00ad phical distribution of social exclusion is fragmented, and family structures provide less of a safety net than in the past. The consequence is clear: if the aim of social policy is to assist individuals to take care of themselves and, as far as pos\u00ad sible, to perform a useful role in society, only new and inno\u00ad vative combinations of work and welfare are likely to achieve that goal for vulnera\u00ad ble people at risk. 2. Social policies to integrate people into society The central implication of both the rising demand for social services in the market and of the need to combat the exclusi\u00ad on of weak groups is that inco\u00ad me maintenance can no longer be the only objective of social policy. There is a consensus in Europe that all citizens should have a guarantee of resources but social policies now have to take on the more ambitious objective of helping people to find a place in society. The main route, but not the only one, is paid work - and that is why employment policies and social policies should be more closely linked. There are already many prac\u00ad tical experiments in that direc\u00ad tion but consideration could be given to more generalized mainstream policies aimed at integration and to their being spread throughout the Com\u00ad munity by cooperation and mutual learning. Examples are: \u2022 the linking of minimum income schemes with servi\u00ad ces to promote economic and social reinsertion; \u2022 better adaptation of social programmes to avoid pover\u00ad ty and unemployment traps; \u2022 preventive labour market policies on the part of the employment services; \u2022 unemployment compensa\u00ad tion linked to training, job creation and incentives to work; \u03a6 equal opportunities' measu\u00ad res to take account of women's skills and needs in the labour market and in society; \u2022 more flexible pension ar\u00ad rangements to enable varia\u00ad ble retirement age and the combination of retirement and working income; \u2022 preventive health program\u00ad mes to encourage healthy lifestyles; \u2022 measures to integrate dis\u00ad abled people into the main\u00ad stream of society; \u2022 measures to integrate immi\u00ad grants in social and econo\u00ad mic life; \u2022 more generally, combined strategies at various levels including education, trai\u00ad ning, employment, equal opportunities for women and men, social protection, social services, housing, health, etc. Measures to integrate disabled people into the mainstream of society 21 ",
        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE 3. A demographic transformation The greatest challenge to the welfare State in the short run seems to be the serious finan cial difficulties it has to face as a result of the recession which is currently hitting most Euro pean economies. It can safely be assumed that under normal economic circumstances the financing of the European wel fare States would not pose, at present, any major problems. However, it is well-known that over the coming decades there will be a considerable shift in the demographic structure of our populations and an increa sing number of older people will have to rely on the support of a shrinking number of people in working age. By the year 2020, the ratio of people of age 65 or older to those in working age, i.e. be tween 15 and 64, may have increased by about 50%. This raises the issue of whether we can afford to redirect an addi tional 5% of GDP towards the financing of old-age pensions and possibly another few per centage points towards higher health care costs. There will be no easy options in the face of this fundamental change: available resources will have to be shared between the active and the inactive, between the old and the young. Govern ments may be tempted to avoid being caught in this distribu tional conflict between the generations and may therefore wish to promote private social security provision. However, private provision will only develop to the extent that public provision is reduced, which will, of course, be hugely unpo pular. It would, furthermore, be necessary to create tax in centives for private provision at high costs to the exchequer in a situation where budgetary discipline is imperative. The most appropriate answer to this fundamental demogra phic change would be to extend the length of people's working lives. Over the last decades this has shortened because of lon ger education and early depar ture from the labour market. However, raising the retirement age will not be sufficient to increase the rate of employment of older workers. Unless more employment opportunities can be created for them, they will either remain unemployed for longer periods or have to accept reduced pensions. The success of our employment policies will therefore also be the key for the long-term future of the welfare State.

ISSUES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY The view that everybody should have a minimum level of resources is an agreed objec tive but European democracies should also have the ambition to make further progress in equality of opportunity, to some extent enshrined in rights, for all their citizens. Progress in that direction has faltered for profound economic and social reasons which need to be understood if equality of oppor tunity is to continue to advance as one of the central aims of European social policy. The need for considerations of social justice and equality of opportunity to be taken into account at all levels of social policy decision-making is, if anything, even greater during the present period of major social change. In particular, these elements should play a larger role in discussions bet ween the social partners. 22 ",
        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE 1. Education cannot do it alone Education has long been per\u00ad ceived as an essential vehicle of equality of opportunity, and the advent of secondary school for all children, with more democratic access to university, has changed the lives of many individuals as well as leading to a more open society in Europe. Certainly the struggle to make schools and universi\u00ad ties the flagships of equality of opportunity should go on but we must recognize that they also serve a process of social selection by integrating people into the economy and society according to their level of edu\u00ad cational achievement, the lat\u00ad ter depending significantly on family and social class. 'Second chance' opportunities have therefore appeared in con\u00ad cepts such as 'permanent' or 'continuing' education, and these are reinforced by the need of modern production systems for changing skills and qualifi\u00ad cations. Increasingly modern business needs an education system which provides, in addi\u00ad tion to specific vocational skills, basic knowledge, the capacity to change and inno\u00ad vate, and in consequence the basis for continuing learning. The young person leaving school is not a 'product' to be inserted into a fixed occupatio\u00ad nal hierarchy, but rather a potential to be developed. Here in lies the possibility of a new partnership between industry and education going far beyond traditional concepts of educa\u00ad tion and training. As socioeconomic hierarchies change, equality of opportuni\u00ad ty can only be achieved if the social mobility of individuals, young and adult, is viewed as part of a continuous process of personal development starting with school and continuing into work and further training, ra\u00ad ther than being subject to a system which segregates oppor\u00ad tunities between generations. That is why the broad frame\u00ad work of 'life long learning' is so important. 2. The workplace as the new frontier For all these reasons the work\u00ad place, as well as the school, should contribute to equality of opportunity. Instead of initial qualifications being the only basis for careers, more flexible qualifications and structures are being developed. Enterprises are being compelled to make the best use of their staff through training and human resource development. This is a trend, which even if slowed down by the current recession, should have a positive effect on equality of opportunity in the long run. The changing nature of pro\u00ad duction and the impact of tech\u00ad nology on employment rela\u00ad tionships, notably through increased emphasis on team work, will also mean that the workplace could have an important role in altering stereotypes and in encouraging the integration of disadvantaged groups. 3. Intergenerational inequalities These developments will, to some extent, redress the bal\u00ad ance of opportunities between generations by giving a second, Photo: \u00a9 CEC The young person leaving school is not a 'product ', but rather a potential to be developed and even a third, chance to those who do not fully develop their talents in the basic educa\u00ad tion system. To some extent it will enable a catching-up pro\u00ad cess by adults who did not pro\u00ad fit from the expansion of edu\u00ad cational opportunities after World War II. It should also benefit women, who should have more equality in terms of opportunities, careers and deci\u00ad sion-making in society com\u00ad mensurate with their achieve\u00ad ments in the educational system. But there is a profound addi\u00ad tional question of social justice towards the new cohorts of young people who did not benefit from the higher earnings and higher employment of post\u00ad war decades and who now have to cope with an insecure labour market and a social security system that demographic trends are turning to their disadvan\u00ad tage. Access of young people to the labour market, and youth opportunities more generally, are a major social policy issue.

Quite apart from developments in legal provision, there are practical ways in which indivi\u00ad duals will be helped to exploit these opportunities by Europe\u00ad an cooperation: # better information about education, working oppor\u00ad tunities and social security arrangements; # qualification systems which make it possible for educa\u00ad F.

Over a quarter of all women in the Community are heads of households \u00ad they live alone, or as single parents \u00ad and over half are in paid work, at least part\u00adtime. Women are having fewer children than even a decade ago ( 1.59 on average) and they are having them later (average age 26).

The question of their rights and opportunities is thus vital for the future of the economy (see Figure 3). Broadly speaking, women are now on an equal footing in schools and universities. There are, however, numerous bar riers to women's participation on equal terms with men in both employment and society. Women continue to hold the largest proportion of low-qua lified, low-paid and insecure jobs. Women's unemployment is higher than men's. They con stitute the majority of the long- term unemployed as well as of those living in poverty. In these circumstances, women today feel increasingly threatened. In addition to job insecurity resul ting from structural changes in the labour market, society has failed to acknowledge, in prac tical terms, that it is primarily women who are faced with conflicting employment and family responsibilities. This can result in women failing to rea lize their full potential. Social and labour market struc tures continue to operate on the assumption that women are pri marily responsible for home and child care while men are responsible for the family's economic and financial well- being. This conflicts with the new reality. Dual income and lone parent families are increa singly common, while the num ber of sole breadwinner two- adult families has declined dra matically. The gender-based division of family and employment res ponsibilities not only constrains women's lives but also deprives men of the emotional rewards resulting from the care and development of children. There needs to be a combined labour market and social policy to develop the rights and oppor tunities of women, one which reflects their role in society and their needs throughout their lives. The strategic objective should be to go from equal rights to equal treatment in the labour market through equali ty of opportunity in society, thereby making better use of women's experience and skills for the benefit of society as a whole, including increased par ticipation in the decision making process. This broad objective is neces sary because women represent a reserve of energy and talent which has not so far fully expressed itself because of past discrimination. New technolo gies and the accompanying changes in work and society are altering traditional roles and releasing new energies. It is not without significance, for exam ple, that the majority of new small enterprises set up in the 1980s were initiated by women. The very nature of the structu ral changes now under way, implying a shift to 'qualitative' growth reconciling economic performance and human needs, must ensure that full account is taken of women's concerns, requirements and skills. In view of their first-hand expe- rience of the extent to which labour market structures have failed to keep pace with chang ing technological, economic, social and political realities, women have a vital interest in participating directly in the pro cess of change. The importance of promoting such participation Photo: \u00a9 CEC Equal treatment in the labour market through equality of opportunity in society in all sectors of society, inclu ding key decision-making pro cesses, cannot be underesti mated. 25 ",
        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE G. THE OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF INTERNATIONALIZATION AND GLOBALISM The new strategic balance, progressive disarmament, economic interdependence, improved world-wide com munications and the decline of exclusive ideologies are all part of the slow emergence of pea ceful socioeconomic competi tion. Equally, the technological 'frontier' and the outward (space) and inward (oceanic and inner-earth) expansion of world resources provide an opportunity to break out of a finite, zero-sum world game. The Club of Rome was right to point out in the 1970s that finite resources of energy, the environment and raw materials place a limit on growth at any given point. But the last 20 years of world history support the view that science and tech nology and economic creativi ty can push the frontier of resources back to a point where it now appears that the limit is human capability and political organization rather than a fi nite planet. It is a fair challenge to any social system to seek its success within that framework. But under what conditions, and with what ground rules, can peaceful socioeconomic com petition and cooperation be tween nations and regions gather strength? And where does the future of Europe lie in that respect? Europe's weakness in the early 1980s was perceived to be its inability to adopt certain inhe rently cultural features of the North American model, such as flexibility and mobility. A decade later, however, the American model is being dif ferently interpreted, with the accent being put on the need for major institutional changes in fields such as education and training, research and develop ment, industrial policy and the improvement of infrastruc tures. The European recovery of the late 1980s exemplified the power of different national and regional cultures to pro mote economic dynamism. Japan, too, has based its eco nomic success on a culture fun damentally different from Western Europe and North America. Market principles prevail in all these economies and are gain ing ground throughout the world. But that does not mean that Russia, China, Latin Ame rica and Asia - not to mention African and Arab countries - will develop according to a Western cultural model any more than Japan has done. How then can the ground rules in a one-world economic system cope with this diversity? 1. The need for social ground rules The greatest threat to peaceful competition is likely to be wide discrepancies in the economic fortunes of the different re gions. It is in the enlightened (and even narrow) self-interest of the advanced, industrialized countries to encourage the gro wth of new markets in other regions. Thus, if a new balan ce of power has provided the opportunity for peaceful socioe conomic competition, then a new balance of development is probably the condition of its survival. This notion of balan ce is, for example, central to the discussion about the role of Japan vis-\u00e0-vis Europe and the United States.

        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE Quite clearly, an open world economic system is the only framework within which peaceful competition can gain strength, but that does not mean that existing ground rules favour such a development. Probably the main weakness of the underlying concept of world economic cooperation is the static nature of comparative advantage. 'Human capital', like the land, is seen as part of a fixed endowment of nations. In reality the real capital (human, financial, know-how) tends to seek economic opportunity wherever it arises. Is it not necessary to recognize that human and social structures can neither adjust nor flow across boundaries at the same rate as money, products and know-how? If regions with dif ferent labour costs are to com pete, is not some convergence of economic and social stan dards both inevitable and desir able, otherwise migration or derealization of production is the only answer? 2. The implications for Europe Trade has been the centre of Europe's economic success in the past and the maintenance of an open, multilateral trading system will be vital to her fu ture prosperity. Trade is not a zero-sum game in which one country's gains necessarily imply the losses of another. The objective is to create a positive- sum game in which all benefit through ever-expanding world markets. However, it is also clear that the rapid changes in international comparative advantage which are happening daily require a major and continuous process of adjustment within Europe so as to create new jobs to replace those destroyed or transferred elsewhere and to ensure that the competitive edge is constantly renewed. Popular concern about whether this process of adjustment is keeping pace with the shift in comparative advantage away from the industrialized world towards the low-cost producers of the Pacific rim and Eastern Europe is reflected in fears about the large-scale relocati on of manufacturing industry from within the Community to other parts of the world and in allegations of unfair competi tion based on unacceptably low social standards, such as the use of child or forced labour. Europe's main response must be to restore its competitive edge but it will also be neces sary to promote more balanced economic development within the Union itself. There may be a tendency for the new techno logies to exacerbate regional disparities because skills, or ganizational capability and social attitudes conducive to radical change accumulate in existing dynamic regions. As against this, new information technologies favour the decen tralization of production be cause of lower information and communication costs, and because lower establishment costs and higher quality of life attract small, technologically- based companies outside the metropolitan areas. Since gro wing regional disparities will tend to reinforce pressure for protection, policies are needed to foster indigenous skills, ent repreneurship and development in the less-developed regions of the Union. H. THE CHANGING NATURE OF PRODUCTION The extent to which Europe succeeds in making progress towards the common social goals of the Union will depend substantially on its capacity to generate the necessary wealth. Europe is 'therefore' compel led to be at the forefront of eco nomic and technological pro gress. That the industrial revolution is now being overtaken by changes in the nature of pro duction is widely accepted. Theories of the 'post-industrial society', the 'information' or 'knowledge' society, are all attempts to identify this new revolution based on the new information and communica tion technologies, and their impact on production and society. It seems clear that any new model of sustainable development has three main components: (i) first, a new potential for growth and job creation which results from the new wave of generic tech nologies (like steam and electricity in the industri al revolution); (ii) second, the changes in the production process and in skill needs, work organi zation, working conditions and industrial relations which are needed to ex plore this new potential; (iii) third, the results in terms of society and the quality of life.

        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE 1. Where Europe stands Economic success since World War II has been based not only on macroeconomic manage ment but also on the success of companies in bringing new pro ducts and services into the mar ket, based on new technologies and their diffusion. Essential to this bringing of new products was the commercial liberaliza tion permitted through the GATT. From this more structural point of view, the immediate post war European development can be seen as a process of catching up, to some extent through the Marshall Plan, on the US mass- production model. Europe caught up in many advanced industrial sectors such as com puters, electronics and com munications, and Japan came from behind with a competing model of capitalist production, of which the main parameters are now widely debated in Europe: 'just in time' produc tion, flexible robots, life-long employment and enterprise cul ture. European industry, less committed to the mass-produc tion model than the Americans, appears to have responded more quickly to the Japanese challenge. Could Europe be poised to leap-frog the Japan ese model because its greater diversity of culture potentially means a more creative working population and more wide spread capacity for entrepre neurship? Realizing this poten tial is a complex matter beyond the scope of this Green Paper but the context needs to be stated so that the social dimension can be understood. 2. The new balance between macroeconomic and structural policies The economy is not only a con tinuing process of adjustment between demand and supply within the framework of the economic cycle but also one of deep movements (or waves) in the potential for growth resul ting from technological chan ge. At the moment, we appear to be in the middle of such a wave based on the all-pervasive information technologies, accompanied by more sector specific technologies such as new materials and bio-techno logy. The opportunities they present can only be realized by raising the level of investment, not only in machines and equip ment, but also in people, orga nization, research and deve lopment, and the infrastructures needed to modernize the eco nomy. 3. The interdepen dence between physical and 'intangible' capital It has to be recognized that the expected productivity gains resulting from the investment in new technologies have been slow in materializing. This is the so-called 'productivity para dox' . The reason appears to be that reaping the rewards of technological progress depends not only on technological crea tivity based on research and development, but also on a widespread process of innova tion and diffusion. The new technologies will not bring their benefits without the skills, orga nization, infrastructures and social negotiations which eith er block or facilitate their diffusion. In that sense, tech nology is a social process. 4. The obsolescence of human capital This social process is deeply affected by the historically new phenomenon of the so-called Obsolescence' of human capi tal. It is unacceptable, even abhorrent, to use for workers the same concepts of 'invest ment' and 'depreciation of capi tal' that we use for machines. There is, however, a radical counter-argument: that human capabilities are creative and adaptable, and therefore con stitute an invaluable resource which does not need to be 'scrapped' like the outdated machine. In economic terms human capital is infinitely 'mal leable' and a bold attitude to investing in human resources is therefore justified. However, the harsh reality is that fierce competition, with rapidly chan ging technologies and produc tion systems, does lead to situa tions in which to all appearan ces, at least for the individuals concerned, human capital is 'scrapped'. It cannot be doub ted that it is this perception which is undermining the public image of the enterprise in the current round of lay-offs and social plans.

        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE 5. Creativity within enterprises A more highly educated, more adaptable and more creative workforce is needed to sustain changes in production orga\u00ad nization. The shift to quality production means forms of organization and management which will enhance the skills and autonomy of working peo\u00ad ple. The necessary adaptabili\u00ad ty of the production system to be more responsive to product changes, and to use fully expen\u00ad sive capital equipment, leads to new patterns of working time, pay and job specification. No doubt there will be new pro\u00ad blems of job stress and safety, but on the whole the move away from the mass\u00adproduction assembly line offers benefits to be obtained through negotiation and collective bargaining. 6. Job creation and entrepreneurship Whereas the cyclical analysis of the labour market concen\u00ad trates on employment, unem\u00ad ployment and labour force par\u00ad ticipation, the most important parameter in the structural approach is the outcome of the job destruction/job creation process. Whether or not this outcome is positive largely depends on the creation of new small firms and therefore on entrepreneurship. Post\u00adindu\u00ad strial societies have a funda\u00ad mental need to widen the con\u00ad cept of the enterprise, covering self\u00ademployment, cooperatives, non\u00adprofit institutions, etc.; foster the culture of entrepre\u00ad neurship in wider segments of the population; and develop support structures which recog\u00ad nize that the traditional capita\u00ad list is not the typical founder of a modern small enterprise in today's world. (See Figure 4.) The return to a new form of full employment is likely to be con\u00ad ditioned by such a cultural change towards more wide\u00ad spread capacities for economic initiative in the population. The 'employee' culture which dominates education and trai\u00ad ning, for example, needs to undergo a transformation, as does the rigid sequence of edu\u00ad cation, work, leisure and reti\u00ad rement typical of the mass\u00adpro\u00ad duction, manufacturing, male\u00ad dominated model of society. 7. The role of services The trend towards decreasing employment in traditional manufacturing raises the ques\u00ad tion of whether the real scope for employment creation might not lie more in the area of ser\u00ad vices. This is so partly because the service sector is relatively less exposed to the full rigour of international competition, partly because jobs in the ser\u00ad vice sector often do not require such specialized skill levels (and, therefore, could offer new job possibilities to the many long\u00adterm unemployed who lack formal qualifications of any kind) and partly because this is an area where social and demographic trends combine to create new opportunities such as domestic work or the caring industry.

        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE 8. Quality off output, quality of work and quality of life Another key question is whether these modern trends offer a new route to the quali\u00ad ty of life. The market for high- quality products and services is linked to more open forms of management and organization, better working conditions and more democratic forms of par\u00ad ticipation, both in work and in capital. The technological wheel which led to mass pro\u00ad duction and the military-deri\u00ad ved modes of management is turning. The quality of working life is improving and constitutes a key component in the quali\u00ad ty of life as a whole. Its evolu\u00ad tion is linked to the importance of time-use and skills in modern production systems, since efficient production is largely dependent on the crea\u00ad tive use of both. Also, modern production systems permit more flexible work/family/lei\u00ad sure/education patterns. On the other hand, the greater flexibi\u00ad lity required by enterprises is leading to more insecurity for those who, rather than being in the 'core' workforce, are in the 'contingent' labour force which is needed to adjust output when demand falls. Thus, both sides of the equation have to be looked at if we are to answer the question whether these more varied and flexible forms of working time and participa\u00ad tion in work represent an opportunity to reconcile effi\u00ad ciency with both a higher qua\u00ad lity of life and more widely spread working opportunities. 9. The urban/rural balance Progress since the industrial revolution has been perceived as an urban phenomenon. The rationale of much of the above discussion is related to the evo\u00ad lution of urban populations in large concentrations, for whom the problems of the quality of life are posed by the urban envi\u00ad ronment, and for whom the rural environment is a leisure hinterland. All this is a conse\u00ad quence of the economies of scale resulting from manufac\u00ad turing economies requiring local concentrations of produc\u00ad tion facilities, working popula\u00ad tions and supporting services. If the right infrastructures are created, the new information technologies could change this spatial pattern of economic development, which has been responsible for some of the major environmental problems, notably urban overcrowding, inner-city problems of social exclusion and rural decline. This situation is further com\u00ad plicated by the crisis in agri\u00ad culture, the risk of accelerating rural desertification and the weakening of the social struc\u00ad ture of the rural communities. Certain development issues are emerging: \u03a6 the new scope for city deve\u00ad lopment will depend on the solution to a wide range of problems, including inner- city transport, access to the rural hinterland, integrated socioeconomic city policies, The future of the rural economy will depend on diversification of both production and sen'ice activity and articulated prevention and integration policies; \u2022 the future of the rural eco\u00ad nomy will depend on diver\u00ad sification of both production and service activity, this twin development being essential to the retention of rural populations; \u2022 a new spatial distribution of the population towards smal\u00ad ler urban centres may pro\u00ad vide the base structure of a revived rural quality of life. Do all the developments descri\u00ad bed in this context constitute a possible contribution, if cor\u00ad rectly understood, promoted and controlled through policy and negotiations between all partners concerned, including employers and trade unions, to a new European model of deve\u00ad lopment? 31 ",
        "THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES FOR EUROPE I. WHERE THE CHALLENGES LIE - A SUMMARY The object of Part II has been to identify, in non-exhaustive fashion, what challenges we face. A great deal of ground has been covered. More detailed analysis of the issues raised can be found in reports and other papers but there has been an attempt to identify the major trends. Part II began with a short description of the background to the emergence of the Euro pean socioeconomic model and of the pressures - demographic, technological, industrial, fiscal, human - faced by Member States. Europe is now entering upon a period of development in which its capacity to build an active and open society and to combine economic dyna mism and social progress will be more important than ever. This was followed by an examination of the sort of society wanted and needed by Europeans. Part II then discussed the criti cal areas of social policy where changes are most evident. The first was employment, where pressure from technological and structural change is changing patterns of employment and the role of work in society. There are pressures, too, on the wel fare State, notably because of the growing numbers of people affected by social exclusion, the widening need for integration measures and the significant demographic changes taking place in Europe. These were looked at briefly. In a section on social justice and equality of opportunity, developments in the part play ed by education, changes in workplace relationships, inter- generational inequalities and workers' rights were highligh ted. There was then a discus sion of women's rights and opportunities, examining the labour market and social impli cations of the changes taking place as they affect women. The perspective widened to examine issues of socioecono mic cooperation and competi tion on an international scale and what impact these might have for Europe. This was fol lowed by consideration of how Europe is adapting to the chan ging nature of the production process, seen throughout the world. This included issues of where Europe stands in relation to the Japanese response to eco nomic changes since World War II; the new balance be tween macroeconomic and structural policies; the interde pendence of physical and 'intangible' capital; the appa rent obsolescence of human capital; the role of job creation and entrepreneurship; changes in the role of the services; aspects of the quality of output, work and life; and the urban/rural balance. Success will go to economies that are competitive and inte grated, where full advantage is taken of new technologies and modern methods of production and work organization. There need to be high levels of invest ment in infrastructures, research and development and, above all, people. People themselves need to feel involved in the pro cess of continuing change which must be sustained over the medium term; there needs to be a balance between physi cal and human capital. There are important issues in the challenges facing Europe. They include issues of equali ty of opportunity, rights and responsibilities at work and in society, employment itself, the need for education and training throughout life, social and eco nomic integration. A robust debate around these issues will enable the Commission to make proposals to provide a framework for the Union's social policy to the end of the century. At the same time this debate contributes to continuing discussions on the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment requested by the Copenhagen Council. In Part III the possible respon ses to those challenges are dis cussed, both in terms of coope ration between Member States and at the level of the Union. 32 ",
        "I ll - E U R O P E AN U N I ON - P O S S I B LE R E S P O N S ES TO T HE CHALLENGES A. DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL POLICY: A MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY Jean Monnet saw the construc tion of Europe as a process of economic integration leading to political union. In that phase, the move towards a single European market was necessar ily accompanied by the concept of a European social 'dimensi on' dealing with fundamental problems such as employment, free movement, social solidar ity, working conditions, social security and training. These areas of action by the Commu nity were all propelled by the reality that an economic com munity cannot survive without some social ground rules. Euro pean social policy, based on both legislative and operation al provisions or acquis, is now evolving within precise politi cal constraints. These reflect the fact that the social forces operating at the time, and expressed in the notion of a 'European model of society', were governments, organized employers and trade unions act ing in concert. The social dia logue, now reinforced by the Social Protocol of the Maas tricht Treaty, has been the prod uct of a slow process of cooper ation and mutual adaptation between the Member States, the European legislator and the social partners. This is an achievement of great impor tance for the future because the turbulent, fast-changing world we are moving into is one in which governments cannot take all the decisions. The political construction of Europe will have to be unique because it must build on the diversity of European cultures, the decen tralization of power and the deeper involvement of civil society. Social policy will have to address the problems facing the general population, citizens and workers, in the countryside as well as in the towns, women and men, young and old. It will also need to reflect the reality that there have been profound changes in the structure of the working population, both in terms of occupation and sex; in demography and migration; in the balance between urban and rural population, in family structure, and in working/edu cation/leisure patterns. The challenges set out in Part II are unlikely to be met by any single European State acting alone. There needs to be progress towards solving the problems of employment, liv ing and working standards and quality of life. These are declared as common tasks in the Treaty. Without such progress, European economic integration, and now political cooperation, will be hindered. It should not be forgotten that European social standards have improved remarkably in the period since the adoption of the Treaty of Rome. However, Europe is now faced with unac ceptable levels of unemploy ment, inequality between women and men, poverty and social exclusion. There is grow ing insecurity in the workplace. The scale of these problems calls for mobilization and coop eration based on a medium- term strategy which brings in both structural and cyclical pol icies. The role of social policy will be particularly vital because, of all policies, it is concerned with the daily lives of people. It affects their jobs and their social protection. It is to social policy that they turn when pov erty strikes. It affects their working conditions, their stan dard of living and their quality of life. Most fundamentally of all, it affects their dignity as workers and as citizens. Whilst defending this human side of things, social policy has also to play its role in achiev ing the wider objectives of the Union which affect the welfare of all citizens. These include its competitive strength, its dem ocratic functioning and its role as a partner in the world system. The balance between these two notions, social poli cy as the human face of the Union and social policy as a means to other strategic objec tives of the Union, is not easy to achieve. Indeed it is some times a matter of fierce dispute, as in the current view in some circles that high social stan dards are undermining the Community's competitiveness in world markets. But the chal lenges set out in this Green Paper make it clear that social policy is always on the knife edge between the aspirations of individuals and what society can offer. It has to come to grips with both sides of that equation. This is true for Mem ber States and for the Union.

        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES The Commission believes that certain major objectives could be the subject of consensus and could serve as guidelines for policies at various levels: 1. Properly directed social instruments contribute to the stable growth of output and jobs and to social and polit\u00ad ical stability. This is so because unrestrained com\u00ad petition in the market can\u00ad not cover certain risks to individuals. Nor can it redis\u00ad tribute resources to deal with poverty or achieve the nec\u00ad essary investments in human resources. 2. Social expenditure has to be pursued within the limits of public budgets and insurance funds but economy meas\u00ad ures should respect pro\u00ad gramme effectiveness and social goals, including equi\u00ad ty and solidarity. 3. The welfare State now has to evolve towards an opti\u00ad mal balance between public, private-collective and indi\u00ad vidual provision, involving new partnerships in both the financing and delivery of services and recognizing the need for the State to regulate the overall system. 4. Social protection and labour market policies should where possible be directed towards the positive goals of human resource develop\u00ad ment, individual self-suffi\u00ad ciency and the integration of individuals into society whilst recognizing the over\u00ad riding need to provide a min\u00ad imum, decent level of income to those in distress. These objectives and issues will have to be addressed in differ\u00ad ent ways. There are a number of common challenges faced by Member States where they and/or their regional or local authorities will remain primar\u00ad ily responsible for policies and measures. But these areas may call for (and often are already the subject of) cooperation and exchanges and possible conver\u00ad gence of policy objectives. In these cases, the Community added value consists mainly of the stimulation of innovation, good practice and policies through the promotion of exchanges, networks and the development of relevant part\u00ad nerships. This is mostly true of the issues dealt with under Sec\u00ad tion \u0392 below. Other issues, clearly indicated in the Treaty, call for action by the Union as such, being legal, financial or for the promotion of exchanges, these issues are dealt with in Section C. The demarcation between these two sets of issues (action by Member States or by the Union) is not always total\u00ad ly clear. Certain areas will require consideration under both headings and the instru\u00ad ments which may be used may also be mixed. It is worth recalling the types of action available to the Union. These are: \u2022 agreement to a convergence of policy in areas which remain a matter of exclusive Member State competence; \u2022 programmatic cooperation through networking and exchanges of experience and good practice; \u2022 financial support; \u2022 use of social partners' agree\u00ad ment at European level; \u03a6 legislation. B. PRIORITY ISSUES COMMON TO THE MEMBER STATES: PROMOTING THE CONVERGENCE OF SOCIAL POLICIES The challenges set out in Part II are clearly interdependent and call for more synergy in government policies than in the past. This is not easy because different areas of government policy have their own rationale and logic, and only a clear and accepted definition of objec\u00ad tives will force the necessary medium-term developments. This is a matter for the Mem\u00ad ber States, but cooperation within the Union will certainly help. The overall objective of an active, open and just European society as the essential aim of employment, social protection and equal opportunity policies is no doubt widely acceptable, but it is too loose to influence policy action. If the role of the Union in relation to these com\u00ad mon policy goals is to mobilize the efforts of the Member States and civil society, then more pre\u00ad cise objectives and quantified targets would provide a focal point for the necessary action. On a number of issues the dis\u00ad cussion at Union level of com\u00ad mon objectives and targets aims at promoting convergence of social policies and at serving as guidelines for the definition of policies at national level, Mem\u00ad ber States remaining respon\u00ad sible for fixing organization, arrangements and priorities for the reaching of these objectives. An example of this approach is to be found in the area of social protection in the 1992 Recom\u00ad mendation on the convergence of social protection policies and objectives. 34 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES 1. Improving the employment situation There can be no doubt that the causes and consequences of high and rising unemployment in Europe represent the single most serious challenge facing Member States today. The growing perception that coun\u00ad tries, both individually and in terms of their cooperation with\u00ad in the Union, are unable to make real progress in solving these problems has major implications for the future of the process of integration. Increased unemployment to a forecast Community average of around 12% in 1994, following on already high structural unemployment, has reached the point where it is socially dan\u00ad gerous as well as politically and economically unacceptable. The 'ratcheting up' of unem\u00ad ployment with each recession has to be reversed because it now means that more than half the unemployed have been out of work for 12 months or more. Such a process partly explains escalating poverty and social exclusion (see Figure 7). These high levels of unemploy\u00ad ment are both the result and the cause of the Community's declining international competi\u00ad tiveness. They are the result, because Europe's inability to create enough jobs stems - in part but by no means exclusive\u00ad ly - from a lack of growth and inadequate wealth creation. They are the cause, because unemployment means wasting one of Europe's greatest assets - the skills and creativity of its people - and because the cost of unemployment to the public exchequer is putting an unprec\u00ad edented strain on government spending. What sort of objectives and targets would be acceptable to the Member States and the partners concerned? In the field of the labour market: the provision of a job, activity, useful training for all those see\u00ad king work or work-sharing? a new balance between expenditure on active measures and income maintenance? In the field of social protection and exclusion: minimum income provision? an integration plan for all the excluded? In the field of equal opportunity: targets for specific groups (work-sharing, income-sharing, decision-making) such as women? measures which reconcile family responsibilities with employ\u00ad ment? for the young, a 'guarantee' of a job, activity or useful trai\u00ad ning? measures to encourage the horizontal and vertical desegre\u00ad gation of the labour market? In the field of training: targets for the output of qualifications at different levels, so as to mobilize the different actors? 7 Long-term unemployment (> 1 year) in the Member States, 1985 and 1991' 70 % total unemployed 70 \u0393 60 50 40 30 20 10 31985 H1991 60 50 40 30 20 10 Long-term unemployment remains very high in the Community - about 45% of the total unemployed. 35 ",

It is equally clear that Member States acting in isolation will have great difficulty in finding effective solutions. This is, therefore, an area where there is much to be gained from close cooperation, increased coordi nation and, where possible, common - as distinct from joint - action. The more Member States' policies are tending to go in the same direction the greater the chance of success, both individually and collec tively. It was in this spirit that the Commission put forward in May of this year the Commu nity-wide framework for employment, which was wel comed by the Social Affairs Council of 1 June. \u2022 improved adaptability at the workplace and the develop ment of new types of employment based on inno vative forms of work organ ization; \u2022 modifying the incidence of taxation, for example by reducing employers' social security contributions; \u2022 encouraging new working time structures to share jobs; \u2022 improving training systems to bring more people into work and better to anticipate structural change in indus try; There is general agreement that the main solution to the prob lem will come from increased growth. In this regard, a num ber of measures are already in hand, including in particular, the 'growth initiative' agreed at the Edinburgh European Council and reinforced at the Copenhagen Council. The thrust of the employment framework is that the Commu nity institutions and the Mem ber States should commit them selves to a rolling process of common analysis and coordi nated policy action. Suggested areas for analysis and action in the framework include: However, there is also a grow ing recognition that growth alone will not be enough. There appear to be structural barriers to job creation in Europe which, unless addressed in a radical and new way, will continue to impede the translation of growth into jobs. Thus, there will be a need for action on two levels: a series of measures to restore growth and a parallel action to address the structural barriers to job creation. It is clear that many of the pol icy levers which will have to be pulled are, and will continue to Improving training systems to bring more people into work 36 ",

The simple truth is that there will be no single solution. An improvement in the situation will come from the cumulative impact of a series of policy measures and the mix of measures needed will vary greatly from Member State to Member State, given the diver sity of their situations. A shift towards quality production processes, flexible and even reduced working time can be an integral part of the process of change To take just one example, the issue of work sharing. Some people object to work sharing based on the idea of restricting labour supply or shar ing a fixed volume of work. However, the concept can make considerable sense when linked to new patterns of working time, more flexible working hours, more alternation between work and training and more flexible retirement. Moreover, there is a well-established secular trend towards reduced working hours as a natural outcome of produc tivity gains. Thus, particularly in the context of a shift towards quality production processes, more flexible and even reduced working time can be an integral part of the process of change. On the other hand, present pol icies tend to squeeze some groups out of the labour mar ket altogether, leaving them totally dependent on income transfers from the social pro tection systems. This is only one example but it illustrates the kind of issues which will have to be addressed and the value of discussion of these issues at European level even if the precise policy meas ures adopted will remain a mat ter for the individual Member States. The need is for a common medium-term strategy around which the individual Member States can construct their spe cific national measures, in a way which means that the whole of the impact is greater than the simple addition of the national parts. The other element of the equa tion is the manner in which action at the level of the Com munity itself could help to underpin this process. This could take different forms. For example, it has been suggested that the adoption of a Commu nity directive to facilitate the greater spread of part-time work could be a positive con tribution to the discussions on this issue at national level, by providing a framework and certain guarantees (see Fig ure 8). 37 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION \u00ad POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES Another example concerns the use of the Structural Funds and, in particular, the European Social Fund. The newly adopt\u00ad ed regulations make this a more flexible instrument which could be used to encourage policy innovation and the translation of successful pilot projects into mainstream policies. It is evident that in all of this the proposals which the Com\u00ad mission will bring forward in the Growth, competitiveness and employment White Paper will be central to the develop\u00ad ment of such a medium\u00adterm strategy, bringing together the macroeconomic framework and the structural changes needed. The debate on this aspect of this Green Paper will, therefore be heavily influenced by the con\u00ad tent of the Commission's pro\u00ad posals and the Council's reac\u00ad tion to them. 8 Changes in full-time and part-time employment in the Member States, 1983-91 Average annual change (%) Full\u00adtime \u25a1 Part\u00adtime L 1 1983\u00ad1985 1985\u00ad1990 1990\u00ad1991 \u0392 DK D GR \u0395 \u03a1 IRL I L NL \u03a1 UK \u03b8 DK D GR \u0395 \u0393 IRL I L NL \u03a1 UK \u0392 OK D GR E F IRL I L NL \u03a1 UK The Member States where the numbers employed have risen most, relative to the volume of work, tend to be those In which part\u00adtime working has increased the most. 2. Accelerating progress towards a quality\u00adbased production system The analysis of the challenges in Part II has pointed to the importance of the new produc\u00ad tion process not only as a means of creating the wealth through which the social objec\u00ad tives of the Union can be achieved. However, its signif\u00ad icance goes further: (i) because the productivity dividend from new technologies depends on social negotiations, and (ii) because the impact of the changes on living and working conditions and on the quality of life could be considerable. This is not only an issue for large companies and central governments but of small firms and local and regional commu\u00ad nities. Many small European firms, deeply embedded in their local communities and cultures, are now active in the world market; many regions and localities in Europe are formu\u00ad lating the objectives for their future with a keen eye on Europe and the world beyond. Their opportunities depend on local energies, resources and capacity for partnership. In par\u00ad ticular, this will require new approaches to worker partici\u00ad pation and involvement, encouraging managers, work\u00ad ers and their representatives at enterprise level to confer in the early stages of introducing new technology. Social adaptation to the chang\u00ad ing economic structures will be vital for competitive success, but, just as importantly, neces\u00ad sary in order to ensure that basic social values are pre\u00ad served and protected in a peri\u00ad od of transition. In what ways could the Community\u00adwide framework for employment be further developed as part of a medium\u00adterm strategy to combat unemployment and promote a more employment\u00adintensive pattern of growth? What role could the social partners organized at European level play in such a process? What could be the role of Community action as such as in helping to underpin the process, either in the form of legis\u00ad lation or financial support? 38 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION \u00ad POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES (a) Human resource development It would be wrong to reduce investment in people to a sim\u00ad ple economic calculation. There are fundamental political and social values at issue here. However, the importance of the need for investment in human resources development as a key means of ensuring competitive success in the global market has still not been fully understood. Big shifts in occupations and skills, and in systems of qual\u00ad ifications, will require funda\u00ad mental changes in education and training systems and in the relationship between training in enterprises and the formal education and training system. In general terms, more demo\u00ad cratic and flexible forms of work organization call for vig\u00ad orous enterprise training poli\u00ad cies interacting with flexible, effective and broadly based education systems. Both have to be related to life\u00adlong learn\u00ad ing in an overall system based on partnership between govern\u00ad ments, the social partners and educational institutions, and geared towards clearly identi\u00ad fied targets for the output of qualifications. Attention also needs to be paid to getting training schemes, par\u00ad ticularly re\u00adtraining pro\u00ad grammes for the unemployed, into better line with the real needs of the market place. These schemes often offer lit\u00ad tle real chance for the unem\u00ad ployed to find new jobs and have become palliative rather than real instruments of labour market re\u00adentry. Such develop\u00ad ments in education and train\u00ad ing would not succeed unless there was a parallel develop\u00ad ment of qualifications systems, involving the cumulation of modular courses, recognition of work experience and nego\u00ad tiation between the partners on the definition of qualifications' and their relationship to pay. The development of European training and qualifications mar\u00ad kets, assisted by the Union, would help to accelerate devel\u00ad opments in the Member States. These issues are also addressed in Section C.l. (See Figures 9 and 10.) The Community is already playing a major role in these developments with its action programmes in the field of edu\u00ad cation and training (such as Comett, FORCE and PETRA), through the Social Fund under Euroform and NOW, as well as in its mainstream programmes and through the social dialogue. Furthermore, the recent revi\u00ad sion of the ESF provides even more scope for this kind of action. The social dialogue, per\u00ad haps through collective agree\u00ad ment in the area of education and training where there is a wide degree of common ground between trade unions and employers, will also play a key role in the future. 9 I ( D DK NL \u0392 EUR 11 IRL GR UK I E L \u03a1 ( educational attainment of the labour force (> 25) in the Member States, 1991 ) 20 40 60 80 100 \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 University education ) 20 40 60 80 100 % labour force The average level of edu\u00ad cational attainment is in general much higher in the northern part of the Com\u00ad munity than in the less\u00ad developed and less pros\u00ad perous, southern Member States.

(b) Labour standards and working conditions These need to evolve to keep pace with rapid changes in technology and production organization, so as to facilitate the new forms of flexibility that enterprises need, whilst at the same time giving necessary protection to workers. In this respect, the Commission emphasizes the need for an early adoption of existing pro\u00ad posed directives, because they will help rather than hinder the support of the work\u00adforce for a fundamental process of change. The principal effects of the new production process, whilst var\u00ad ying according to industrial sec\u00ad tor, constitute a general basis around which discussions and perhaps negotiations might take place: (i) the shift towards more decentralized management structures and shorter and faster production cycles, involving more responsible roles for workers; (iv) a changing pattern of trade union and business organ\u00ad ization. Whilst transnational enterpri\u00ad ses could adopt a 'cost\u00adcutting' strategy and negotiate for lower social standards, they are more likely to opt for a 'quality' strat\u00ad egy of high levels of pay, par\u00ad ticipation and security because Critical questions that need to be addressed are: How can retraining schemes be better linked to real labour market needs? How can we best work towards establishing the right of each individual to training throughout life, particularly when skills and qualifications need constantly to be enhanced because of industrial change? How can we overcome the handicap whereby, in some Mem\u00ad ber States and in the Union itself, education and vocational training policies tend to be separately conceived and imple\u00ad mented? (ii) big changes in occupations and skills, and therefore on\u00adthe\u00adjob training, up\u00ad grading of qualifications and broader job classifica\u00ad tions; (iii) new patterns of working time, involving new work schedules corresponding to the aspirations of the work\u00ad force and intensive use of capital equipment; 40 ",

Nevertheless, whilst such conditions would apply to their 'core' labour force, their flexibility also depends on a 'contingent' labour force which can take many forms, includ\u00ad ing seasonal part-time hiring, permanent part-time hiring, and use of contracted labour both at low and high levels of qualifi\u00ad cation and skill. But it is also vital for Europe that the SMEs, which are the main contributors to output and employment, should prosper in the new eco\u00ad nomic environment. There are a number of reasons for thinking that their position in the Euro\u00ad pean economy will be enhanced because of their adaptability, the growing 'decentralization' of production units and the growing space for small production units special\u00ad izing in products of high qual\u00ad ity and operating in internation\u00ad al networks. The key point here is how to adapt labour law and practices in such a way as to constitute a positive incentive towards the adoption of new techniques and processes while seeking to preserve equally the fundamental objectives of pro\u00ad tecting workers' rights and social progress. Consideration must also be given to the cost impact of any new measures. (See Figure 11.) (c) Redefining labour market adaptability Mastering this process of con\u00ad tinuing technological and struc\u00ad tural change requires a new and socially acceptable concept of flexibility. It is doubtful that the limitation to wages and mobil\u00ad ity would be acceptable to the social partners under the present circumstances.

Actions are designed to complement, and not substitute for, the efforts that firms must themselves undertake. The following questions cover issues raised in points (b), (c) and (d). 3.

It should be noted that this partnership between economic, employment and social policy, at the service of an active and fair society of autonomous but protected indi viduals, was already present in the founding texts of European social security - social 'insu rance' being the expression of the principle of self-provision within the framework of a State guarantee. The neglect of the social integration objective was not apparent when high employment and the growth of national and personal incomes could mask the incipient dan gers, but moderate growth com bined with rapid structural changes in society have unhinged the original concep tion and demonstrated the inad equacy of the income-mainte nance objective without an accompanying objective of social integration.

This means a gener al evolution of social policies, health policies, labour market policies and education and training policies towards the goal of the economic and social integration of all citizens.

The specific options and prior ities for discussion are: (i) the improvement of the quality of working life (working conditions and health and safety) which would improve labour pro ductivity by reducing absenteeism, sickness absence, and occupational disability; (ii) the evolution of unemploy ment compensation systems so that they sup port re-entry into the labour market, job creation and self-employment, and thereby play a role in industrial adaptation; (iii) more flexible pension systems so as to allow more freedom of choice between early retirement for those who seek it, and part-time work or volun tary activity by those who wish to continue to be active, and more general ly policies to support the social integration of the aged; (iv) 'life-long learning' educa tion and training policies so as to support the renew al of skills and combat the obsolescence of human capital; (v) minimum income provi sion so as to support social and economic integration; (vi) technical provision at the workplace to ensure oppor tunities for the social and economic integration of disabled persons; (vii)integrated provision for young people so as to enhance the prospects of a Should future action be developed in specific action program mes and/or more precise setting of selected objectives and targets at Union level? successful transition to the labour market and adult life, thereby avoiding the unemployment/exclusion trap. In addition to the above, the delivery and simplification of services for recipients need to be improved, the various lev els involved need to be coordi nated; and information for the public should be easy to under stand. (c) Youth opportunities and risks The Community has done much to involve young people in European affairs, stimulate youth policies ('Youth for Europe'), tackle the problem of youth unemployment (the Social Fund), and promote vocational training opportu nities for young people so as to strengthen the transition to work (PETRA).

(See Figure 12.) In a real sense, the problem of youth is becoming a problem (d) The economic and social role of the elderly Many older people are better off than in the past, both in terms of income, social services and health. But there are also significant numbers who, because of their careers and social security coverage, are not adequately protected in old age. Solidarity between the genera tions is still vital but the prin cipal problem remains the social integration of the aged. This has been the focal point of the Community's work in this area and a key element of the 1993 European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations. It is clear, however, that the demographic changes foreseen imply a shift in the age struc ture of society and a different relationship between the gen erations.

Can youth employment be given a stimulus by lower 'entry wages' without distorting recruitment patterns or discrimina ting against older workers? Photo: t Entr'Ages/l. Lebert Solidarity between tlie generations is still vital but the principal problem remains the social integration of the aged ahead of them, is fraught with human, social and economic difficulties. An important objective of a European active society should be to reorientate economic and social policy towards the reality that the older population will be big consumers, command major investments, exercise political influence and could play a major role in dealing with the problems of youth segregation and women's opportunities referred to earlier. (See Figure 13.) These are questions of social innovation as well as social pol icy, where changes have to be promoted in civil society, through cooperation between trade unions, local authorities, enterprises and voluntary organizations. The partnership and networking approach which the Community has developed is well suited to tack ling such problems. Article 7 of the Social Agreement of the Treaty on European Union pro vides for a regular report on demography. This could help to monitor trends and policies linked to demographic trends.

This was especially true for the southern countries of the Community, where in each case the proportion increased by around 30 % or more. The success of migration poli cy for Member State nationals - despite certain shortcomings - is due mostly to the fact that the political will to enable people to migrate was enshrined in the Treaty of Rome. Thus, there was a solid base on which to develop the legal and practical arrangements to facilitate the movement of people. If the Community wishes to adopt a migration policy for third-coun try nationals it must, for the pol icy to succeed, base itself on clear objectives related to the organization of migration flows and their accompanying social measures, and provide itself with the necessary instruments to do so. An integration policy must include security of stay for those whose residence is stable and permanent, equal opportu nities in employment, educa tion, training and housing, sim plified access to naturalization and the fostering of tolerance between the different commu nities living side by side. Consideration could be given to allowing access to employ ment in another Member State States (family reunion and ref ugees); others may arise from potential imbalances in the sup ply and demand of labour. Title VI of the Treaty on European Union now allows for common action on immigration policy and policy regarding nationals of third countries. The deepen ing of the European integration process has recently served to focus attention both within the Community and outside on how it receives and integrates non-Community citizens. But as early as 1976, the Council declared its intention to further equal treatment of third-coun try nationals and the members of their families with nationals of the Member States, as regards living and working con ditions, wages and economic rights. The Commission, in its 1991 communication to the Council and Parliament on immigration, highlighted the need to strengthen measures designed to promote the inte gration of third-country nation als in the context of a compre hensive policy which would also address the need to take action on migration pressure and to control migration flows. It is proposed to update that communication, and the asso ciated communication on asy lum, to take account of devel opments since 1991 and the new possibilities offered by the Treaty on European Union by way of a new communication to be addressed to the Council and Parliament. How can the present progress of the European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations be built on? How could the report referred to in Article 7 be used as a basis for a strong debate on demographic trends and their consequences for social security, employment, etc. and per haps the development of a regular monitoring process? 47 ",

That also raises the ques tion of whether other rights which are a corollary to free movement in Community terms should be extended to such third-country nationals. In par ticular, the question should be examined whether it is still jus tified to exclude third-country nationals moving within the Community from the protection offered by the coordination of social security schemes, sim ply because of their national ity. Immigration calls for realistic, coherent and complex ap proaches based on fundamen tal principles: respect for laws, the rights of individuals and for external as well as internal action as far as integration is concerned. Surely the equality of rights and obligations is an essential con dition for achieving solidarity between the various elements of a society. The main objec tive of the Community in this respect is to enhance the social integration of legally resident migrants through equal oppor tunities in employment, educa tion, housing, social security and health care. (f) The integration of disabled people The ultimate test of policies for disadvantaged groups will be how the effort socially to inte grate people in difficulty applies to people suffering from a physical or mental disability. Social segregation, even with adequate income maintenance and special provision, is con trary to human dignity and cor rosive of social solidarity and community morale. Special facilities, institutions and legal rights are obviously necessary, but they should not be an obsta cle or an alternative to the prin ciple of 'mainstreaming' - that is to say acceptance of people as full members of society, with opportunities for integrated education, training and employ ment, and to lead their lives How can we best stimulate policies and practices which pro mote a concerted integration policy which aims at the harmo nious coexistence of peoples in the Union?

Should the Community develop specific legislative action in this area? What role would the social partners play in this respect? How can partnerships be strengthened between the various actors, NGOs, social partners, local authorities, etc.? (g) The fight against racism and xenophobia Racial discrimination and xen ophobia are not only directed at immigrants. They also affect citizens of the Member States. However, in a time of reces sion, where there is competi tion for jobs and housing, eth nic minorities can be a scape goat for the fear and anger in society. Xenophobia and racist attitudes are fed by ignorance of other people and a lack of under standing of different cultures. Measures in the areas of infor mation and education are there fore of prime importance. The fight against racism and xenophobia is echoed in the protection of fundamental rights, confirmed in the Single European Act. All the legal systems of the Member States include measures to sanction violations. However, sanctions alone cannot overcome all forms of racism and xenopho bia. Comprehensive anti-dis crimination legislation offers an integrated and coherent approach to combating racism, discrimination and xenophobia, whether founded on colour, race, ethnicity or national ori gin, religion, beliefs or culture. (h) Social policies and rural development The birth of modem social pol icy has its origin in the plight of the urban poor as a conse quence of the industrial revo lution. The social networks and family links of the countryside were broken by migration to urban manufacturing centres, social potential in rural areas under the Structural Funds (Objectives 1 and 5b), involv ing especially job creation, alternative employment and local employment initiatives; and measures designed to make surplus agricultural produce available to certain categories of consumer at low prices and accessible conditions. leading to a redistribution of welfare functions between the family, the State and the enter prise. Now that the wheel is turning again with welfare functions being spread through out society and less concentrat ed in the hands of the State, it is important that social policies should assist rural populations and underpin rural develop ment. Steps should be taken so as to ensure that the treatment of the problems of rural popula tions is on a par with that in the cities. In this context, new approaches to solidarity in the rural world as well as the more recent development of new partnerships provide a number of useful examples. The Community is already con tributing to the social policy effort against depopulation and marginalization in the weakest rural areas, as well as to that against the social decline of the population concerned. This contribution has consisted mainly in compensatory pay ment to farmers in mountain ous and less-favoured areas; the development of agricultural resources and economic and C. M A IN POLICY OBJECTIVES AT EUROPEAN LEVEL As risks of exclusion and marginalization in rural areas are increasing, what further actions other than what is undertak en at present would prevent rural social decline? How can we improve and broaden the promotion of measures in the field of education, information and legislation as tools in counteracting racist attitudes, acts and discrimination? In Section III.B, we have looked at those challenges which, although not strictly a matter of competence for the Union as such, are common to Member States and could be better met by increased coop eration and, where appropriate and possible, by some conver gence of policy. In this section, we will explore the options for action by the Union itself. The entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty has created a new situation in relation to social policy at European level. In the first instance, there is the existence of the Agreement on Social Policy, adopted by 11 of the Member States and en shrined in the Protocol on Social Policy which is annexed to the Treaty. This Agreement seeks to clar ify the kind of areas which the 49 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES Union's social policy would cover and also establishes new procedures for decision-mak ing. In terms of the substance, the Agreement sets out the follow ing objectives: 'the promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions, proper social pro tection, dialogue between man agement and labour, the devel opment of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combat ing of exclusion ...'. It identifies two groups of areas of activity: one, to be decided on the basis of qualified majority voting, which covers: The entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty has created a new situation in relation to social policy at European level Photo: \u00a9CEC (i) improvement in particular of the working environ ment to protect workers' health and safety, (ii) working conditions, (iii) the information and con sultation of workers, (iv) equality between men and women with regard to labour market opportu nities and treatment at work, (v) the integration of persons excluded from the labour market, without prejudice to Article 127 of the Trea ty establishing the Europe an Community; another, to be decided by una nimity, which covers: (i) social security and social protection of workers; (ii) protection of workers where their employment is terminated; (iii) representation and collec tive defence of the inter ests of workers and employers, including co- determination; (iv) conditions of employment for third-country nationals legally residing in Com munity territory; (v) financial contributions for promotion of employment and job creation, without prejudice to the provisions relating to the Social Fund. Finally, it is worth noting that the following areas are expli citly excluded from action: pay, the right of association, the right to strike and the right to impose lock-outs. In terms of procedures, the major innovation of the Agree ment is to formalize a process Which areas of social policy are most likely to be amenable to being addressed by collective agreements? Which areas are most likely to need a legislative approach? Can framework laws provide the kind of results required such as, for example, in the areas of minimum standards or equal ity of opportunity? of two-stage consultation with the social partners, which can lead to the negotiation of col lective agreements at Europe an level, possibly as a substi tute for legislation. Of course, it needs to be recalled that the original idea was that this Agreement would replace the existing provisions of the Treaty of Rome. As this is not the case, social policy is now potentially governed by two separate legal frameworks: that of the Treaty of Rome which continues to apply and that of the Agreement on Social Policy which 11 Member States have agreed to operate between them. The procedural implications of all this are treated in a separate Commission communication. What is particularly important to recall for the purposes of this Green Paper is that any discus sion on social policy at Euro pean level has to take into con sideration that, henceforth, the range of instruments available is multiple: on the one hand, there are the traditional categories of action which may be summarized as follows: mobilisation of the actors in the Member States; cooperation between actors in the Member States, particular ly through networking; legislation; financial support; on the other hand, there will be decisions to be made about the legal basis for the action and, in particular, about the possibil ity of collective agreements as an alternative to legislation. In the event that legislation is agreed to be the best option for addressing a given problem, the question of the nature of the legislation then arises. Past experience has shown a tenden cy towards much detail in Community social law. Often, as was classically the case with the directive on working time, this results not so much from the Commission's first draft text as from the process of negotiation in the Council and Parliament. Consideration needs to be given to whether lighter and more flexible laws might not be better adapted to the diversity of different Mem ber States, provided that this can be reconciled with the sub stantive results sought. 50 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES 1. The single market and the free move ment of people Free movement of people is one of the four 'freedoms' enshrined in the Treaty of Rome (Article 3(c)). Given that its origin lies in the establish ment of the European Econom ic Community, it is economic activity which constitutes the key element of the provisions relating to free movement: activities as an employed per son (Articles 48 to 51), estab lishment as a self-employed person (Articles 52 to 58) and the provision of services (Arti cles 59 to 66). Article 8a of the Treaty on European Union grants the right to move and reside freely within the Mem ber States to every citizen of the Union. It is only in the context of the single market programme that the Council extended the right of stay to all nationals of the Member States, even if they do not pursue any economic activ ities but provided that they have health insurance and sufficient means by which to live. The Court of Justice has made a decisive contribution to ensur ing that intra-Community movements take place under conditions of freedom and dig nity. The nationals of the Mem ber States have the right to pur sue an economic activity in the territory of a Member State of which they are not a national without any discrimination, whether as an employed or self- employed person. The Member States may only reserve for their own nationals employ ment in the public service (Arti cle 48(4) of the EEC Treaty), but the Court of Justice has reduced the scope of this excep tion to employment which involves participation in the exercise of public power and responsibility for safeguarding the general interests of the State. This right to exercise an eco nomic activity without being discriminated against on grounds of nationality has become more palpable - par ticularly for self-employed peo ple - with the adoption of Com munity legislation on the mutu al recognition of diplomas and qualifications. After a period in which mutu al recognition was pursued on the basis of individual direc tives for specific professions, the Community has now adopt ed two horizontal directives which extend recognition to all regulated professions. A much more complex but important issue for the future is how to ensure the equivalence of qual ifications for non-regulated pro fessions and skills. Equally, active consideration needs to be given as to how the Europe- wide recognition factor can be built in from the start to the very large number of new qual ifications which are going to be needed in the future. The establishment of real and effective mutual recognition and equivalence of qualifica tions at all levels throughout the territory of the Union has to be an urgent political priority. This is for reasons related not only to the economic benefits which this would bring but also because of the contribution it would make to the notion of European citizenship. The concept of 'worker' cov ers not only workers settling definitively in another Member State but also frontier workers, temporary workers and season al workers. Temporary activity by self-employed people is cov ered by the provisions on the free movement of services. (See Figures 14 and 15.) The right of residence is regard ed by Community law as first of all a corollary of the right to pursue an occupation. The right of residence has thus been rec ognized for employed and self- employed people and it has been extended to members of their families (spouses, depen dent relatives in the descend ing line or those under the age of 21, and dependent relatives in the ascending line). More over, Community law has granted the right to remain in the host country to employed and self-employed people after their activities end due to retire ment or incapacity to work. These rights apply also to their families even after the employed person's death. All those enjoying the right of residence naturally also have a right of entry to the territory of another Member State. The Single European Act further adds 'the removal of physical controls at the internal frontiers'. This objective has yet to be fully realized but work continues on the basic meas ures considered necessary to achieve the removal of controls on all persons when crossing the internal frontiers. It should be noted in this connection that the Court of Justice has ruled that tourists may be regarded as 'persons receiving services' and that they are covered by the provisions relating to the free movement of services, specif ically with regard to entry and residence. The Court has also specified that the freedom of movement for workers also covers the right of a person seeking employment to reside in the ter ritory of another Member State as long as he or she continues to look for work and has a gen uine possibility of being employed. 51 ",

        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES The basic principle is clear: within the scope of applica tion of the Treaty (Article 6 EC), any discrimination on grounds of nationality is pro hibited. This total equality with nation als in virtually all fields, how ever, is guaranteed solely for persons who have the status of migrant worker and for mem bers of their families. In other words, people seeking employ ment and students (other than migrant workers' children) enjoy the protection of Com munity law as regards the ele ments peculiar to the situation in which they find themselves, but they cannot claim total equality of treatment, for instance, in the domain of social assistance. Particular emphasis should be given to the importance of Community coordination of national social security schemes, which is indispens able for ensuring effective free dom of movement in Europe. The question is: how can this fundamental freedom be fully exercised if there is a risk of being penalized in terms of social security? The Treaty of Rome, in particular Article 51, has from the outset facilitated the establishment of Commu nity regulations to remove this risk for employed and self- employed people and their fam ilies moving within the Com munity. These regulations are regular ly brought up to date to take account of changes made to national law and of the Court's case-law. The objective of the regulations is not to harmonize national systems but simply to protect the people concerned against the effects of national measures which do not take account of the particular situa tion of people moving from one Member State to another. Most categories of workers are covered by the Community reg ulations. However, the special schemes for civil servants and persons treated as such still remain to be included in the scope of coordination. The exclusion of these schemes is no longer justified since the Court of Justice, in its rulings concerning Article 48(4) of the Treaty, has largely granted access to employment in the public service to nationals of the Member States. In this new context the Commission has transmitted a proposal for a reg ulation which is currently under discussion in the Council. In light of the social dimension of the internal market, coordi nation of social security schemes should encompass all people insured in the Commu nity. To this end the Commis sion has also proposed that the scope of the regulations be extended to categories still excluded today, namely stu dents and non-active people. Furthermore, there is still the difficult matter of supplemen tary social security provision, particular occupation pensions and supplementary health insu rance. Such provision is often made under the terms of collec tive agreements or at the initia tive of the employer or individ ual concerned. As a result and in contrast to statutory social security provision, supplemen tary provision is excluded from the scope of Community coor dination. The very complexity and diversity of this type of social security provision has so far ruled out coordination at Community level. However, the need for such coordination is likely to increase with the shift in the demographic bal ance, as workers may have to rely increasingly on supple mentary social security. In addi tion, a greater cross-border mobility of highly qualified workers is expected. It would not be acceptable that workers who depend heavily on supple mentary social security provi sion are prevented from exer cising their right to free move ment for fear of losing an ade quate level of social security cover. Another important element of moving towards a genuine peo ple's Europe is currently under consideration. The Commission is examining how the existing rules on access to the health ser vices of another Member State can be made more flexible in the interests of patients. Consideration could also be given to the possibility of ex tending the benefits of coordi nation of social security sche mes to nationals of non-mem ber States in particular cases. Community coordination could be further improved and strengthened in the following key areas: Unemployment benefits: Exist ing Community legislation offers only a very limited pro tection for unemployed persons looking for work in another Member State. Under strict conditions, for a maximum period of three months and only once between two periods of employment, the right to unem ployment benefit can be re tained. These provisions, adopt ed when the employment rate within the Community was high, are less encouraging to people who otherwise would be ready to take advantage of employment opportunities on a European scale. In times of high unemployment, the exist ing Community legislation in this field therefore needs to be modernized and adapted to the new situation. Mobility would be increased by extending the right to retain unemployment benefit when searching for work in another Member State, but without creating new finan cial burdens or unbalanced sit uations between the Member States and whilst avoiding any incentive for abuse of the system. Early retirement pensions: A number of gaps remain to be filled. These schemes are still excluded from the scope of existing regulations which also do not take into account the specific situation of people taking early retirement. This is especially true with regard to family benefits and health care. Sickness benefits: The existing rules need to be made more flexible. For example, people who work in border regions may, under insurance rules, claim benefits-in-kind in either their country of residence or their country of employment. However, this possibility is not open to members of their fam ilies. Consideration should also be given to establishing the right of residence of far less well-off people (at present excluded from free movement). More generally, it is necessary to improve the service which Community coordination ren ders to the Community's citi zens. Such improvement could in particular consist of the fol lowing: 53 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES Simplification of the rules of coordination: This would enable a more homogeneous implementation of coordination and make the rules more trans parent and therefore easier to understand for European citi zens. This task, while particu larly difficult to achieve because of the technical nature of the rules in force, is never theless extremely important. Modernization of the exchange of data between social security institutions: Better exploitation of modern technology could greatly improve the exchange of data, for example the estab lishment of a telematic network or the possibility of developing a card for those with social security cover which can be used in all the Member States. The widest possible dissemina tion of information to the pub lic: Coordination is likely to have a direct impact on citizens, for example in every-day situa tions such as the provision of health services to persons mov ing within the Community. without being able to reach an acceptable agreement. People who exercise the right to free movement are often con fronted with cumbersome administrative procedures. Local administrations are not always aware of the rights enjoyed by Community-citi zens; and, particularly in the case of less qualified workers, mobility is far from easy. The EURES network, formed by the national employment services and the Commission, is responsible for exchanging information on job offers and applications throughout the Community, with a view to developing freedom of move ment for migrant workers with in the single market. Further more, the network also aims to provide - through its Euro- advisors - exchange of infor mation on working and living conditions between the Mem ber States, to enable workers and their families to make deci sions in the full knowledge of what to expect. Photo CEC The EURES network is responsible for exchanging information on job offers and applications throughout the Community In its White Paper on achiev ing the internal market the Commission indicated that before 1992 the remaining bar riers to free movement of self- employed persons and workers needed to be lifted. The Com mission also remarked that Community citizens should be able to exercise their profes sional activity throughout the Community, if they so wish, without any administrative pro cedures which in the end might discourage them from moving to another Member State. These considerations remain valid. Over the last three years the Council has discussed the Com mission proposals to improve free movement of workers, Community citizens will increasingly move within the Community as they have tradi tionally moved within their own country, with these move ments being quite distinct from traditional migration patterns. 54 ",

Promoting equal opportunities for women and men in a changing European society The European Community has a longstanding track record in promoting equal opportunities for women in the labour mar\u00ad ket. In particular, the Commu\u00ad nity has developed a wide\u00adrang\u00ad ing legal framework to help promote the full participation of women in the labour market. In time of recession, action in this regard needs to be defend\u00ad ed and strengthened because the key labour market indica\u00ad tors show that unemployment hits women harder than men in almost all Member States. (See Figure 16.) It is clear that the Community's legal framework alone is insuf\u00ad ficient to eliminate the persis\u00ad tent inequality of opportunities for women. There remain numerous barriers to women's participation on equal terms with men in both employment and society. Women today feel increasingly vulnerabfe.

        "EUROPEAN UNION \u00ad POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES areas because it constrains women from making a full con\u00ad tribution to economic growth and social improvement. (See Figures 17 and 18.) The problems which women encounter in the labour market cannot be tackled in isolation. Society should be encouraged to benefit more from the input of women's abilities and spe\u00ad cial skills while at the same time addressing the particular interests and needs of women. Demographic trends threaten to bring in their wake further ten\u00ad sions in the labour market and in society as a whole. An effec\u00ad tive approach to the social transformation needed to achieve economic growth and social cohesion depends upon empowering women to play a greater role in shaping future developments. One issue which merits partic\u00ad ular attention is the participa\u00ad tion of women in the process of collective bargaining. Bargain\u00ad ing power is currently very unequally shared between women and men in social partners' organizations at national as well as European level. Recent research has shown that in the 12 Member States, the existing systems and processes of collective bargain\u00ad ing have contributed to increas\u00ad ing the pay gap between women and men. The fundamental objective therefore should be to advance from equal rights to equal treat\u00ad ment in the labour market through equality of opportunity in society. This implies that the highest priority should be given to measures which will enable individuals, men and women, to achieve a better balance in their private and their working lives, through a change of atti\u00ad tudes and values. In order to obtain a more bal\u00ad anced type of society, three main issues must be addressed: (i) the reconciliation of employment and family responsibilities; (ii) the desegregation of the labour market \u00ad vertical and horizontal; (iii) an increase in women's participation in decision\u00ad making. The possibilities for action are numerous: (i) encouraging more flex\u00ad ibility in careers and working hours; (ii) promoting innovative ways to combine house\u00ad hold and working respon\u00ad sibilities; (iii) promoting the provision of child\u00adcare facilities; (iv) setting clear targets for women in vocational training opportunities (particularly with regard to ESF assistance) and employment within male\u00ad dominated occupations, combined with the need to develop adequate mon\u00ad itoring systems; (v) creating more diversified training, job and career opportunities, both to widen scope for and improve prospects of women; (vi) eliminating direct and indirect discrimination in the labour market, includ\u00ad ing that concerning lay\u00ad offs and part\u00adtime work; (vii) reviewing the structure of decision\u00admaking proce\u00ad dures in economic, social and political areas; (viii)improving women's access to information about their rights general\u00ad ly and at European level; (ix) giving increased attention to women's labour mar\u00ad ket difficulties in the con\u00ad text of the social dialogue. One of the keys to achieving overall equality of opportunity is the practical acknowledge\u00ad ment of equality of work by means of equal pay. The prin\u00ad ciple of equal pay for men and women has been enshrined in Community law from its ori\u00ad gins. Article 119 of the EEC Treaty requires Member States to 'ensure and subsequently maintain the application of the principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work'. This was ampli\u00ad fied by Directive 75/117/EEC which introduced the concept of equal pay for work of equal value into the statute books of the Member States. However, despite the existence of these political and legal commit\u00ad ments, official statistics disclose that the pay gap between men and women remains wide. It is imperative that the funda\u00ad mental right to equal pay is fully implemented at Commu\u00ad nity level. Towards this end, the Commission has recently pub\u00ad lished a communication for the information of and considera\u00ad tion by all parties concerned with the equal pay issue.

It also suggests that in addition to the use of legal instruments and processes, any strategy for the promotion of equal pay for work of equal value must include improve ment of baseline data on women and pay, improved dis semination of information and improved legal and practical training for people working in the field. Among the options which warrant attention is the possibility of adopting certain basic principles to serve as guidelines for joint negotiations on job classification and eval uation. These would be applied at various levels without preju dice to the autonomy and indi vidual responsibilities of the social partners. These guide lines could be used as a basis for a code of practice on the implementation of equal pay for work of equal value. The new provisions in the Social Agreement annexed to the Treaty on European Union relating to the potential role of the social partners in develop ing social policy at Community level offer new possibilities in the equal pay field. 3. The social transition to economic and monetary union Having eliminated the internal frontiers in order to guarantee the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, the next logical step in the pro cess of economic integration will be the transition to a sin gle currency. The goal of eco nomic and monetary union (EMU), the most ambitious project in the process of Euro pean integration, is provided for in the Treaty on European Union. Some consideration needs to be given to the impli cations for social policy of this transition. For example, to what extent will EMU also require a more active social policy? Photo CIC The next logical step in the pro cess of economic integration will be the transition to a single cur rency What more should be done at Community level to promote equality of opportunity between women and men in fields such as education and training, research and development and employment and labour market policies? Should specific goals and timetables - including quotas, tar gets and positive measures - be used to ensure a fuller par ticipation of women In areas In which they are under-repre sented? What steps should be taken to reconcile family and work responsibilities? Should monitoring mechanisms be developed (and at what level) to assess the position of women in relation to the above as well as pay, benefits and family-friendly policies, notably the organization of working time? Which specific obligations should be put on employers and unions to ensure a proper recognition of women's interests within the social dialogue and more balanced participation of women and men at decision-making level within the repre sentative organizations? What more needs to be done at Community level to ensure the practical implementation and monitoring of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value? What form should a code of practice to guide and ensure implementation of this principle take? EMU is not an end in itself but has to serve the Community's overall objective of promoting economic and social progress, and in particular a high level of employment and social protec tion, as Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union makes clear. The EMU process is a major building block for achieving such progress, since respecting the established con vergence criteria will enhance the efficiency of the European economy and strengthen its position in the world economy. In fact, social progress will be best served by further econom ic integration, not less. While EMU underpinned by the necessary level of econom ic convergence will promote the goal of economic and social progress, it is equally clear that it sets a new and different framework for social policy. In particular, by preventing mon etary, fiscal and debt slippage, which generally results in sig nificant social costs, it will eliminate the scope for some policy illusions. For instance, inflation and budget deficits often mask unresolved social conflicts. EMU therefore im plies that all social groups and in particular the social partners are aware of what is feasible in terms of wage rises and other social improvements and act accordingly. More generally, one can say that EMU requires a better functioning of labour markets because the Member States will irrevocably lose their exchange rates and their mone tary policies as instruments for macroeconomic adjustment. However, the transition to EMU will guarantee that no Member State will lose control of these policy instruments before it is clearly established that it can cope without them. 58 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES The fact that transition to EMU will involve structural reforms and difficult but socially bal anced consolidation of budgets for several Member States has to be seen in the context of the negative social consequences of further delaying inescapable adjustments. Budgetary consol idation is essential in any event to ensure that interest payments on the public debt do not con tinue to increase their share of overall government expendi ture, thereby leading both to sustainability worries and to reduced scope for social spend ing. From this perspective the binding character of the con vergence process is not neces sarily a burden but, on the con trary, through the credibility given to the convergence com mitment, a way to reduce the inevitable adjustment costs. Furthermore, the medium-term character of the convergence process and the provisions of the Treaty provide sufficient flexibility to modulate adjust ments during recession and to exploit recovery to increase the pace of progress in reaching the declared targets. It might be of interest to identi fy the social challenges each Member State has to face in this transition and, to the extent pos sible, to quantify important aspects, especially as far as social security spending com mitments are concerned. Knowing the need for social policy adjustments, it should become easier to work out realistic and socially acceptable programmes of economic and social convergence. Such programmes might be dis cussed with governments (mainly the Ministries of Finan ce and Social Affairs/Employ ment) and with the social part ners. After all, the latter have an important role both in achieving the convergence cri teria and in financing, or bear ing the cost of, social policy. Could the Union issue recommendations in this process of economic and social convergence, after due consultation with all the national authorities concerned and the social partners, with a view to making sure that the process of economic Inte gration does indeed contribute to Its most basic objectives as defined in Article 2 of the Maastricht Treaty? Should the Union promote convergence of social policies alongside convergence of economic policies through: (i) the definition of common objectives and monitoring (e.g. on the same basis as convergence of social protection policies and objectives); (ii) possible recommendations on important economic issues, e.g. in preventing social dumping; (\u00a1ii) monitoring procedures for social policy in the transition towards EMU; (iv) strong involvement of social partners in these proce dures; (v) joint discussions of national authorities responsible for economic affairs and for social policy? 4. Issues of social standards Europe's social policy is influ enced by the operation of free markets, especially free labour markets, and by the develop ment of social ground rules. There are two important ele ments in this concept: on the one hand a defensive mecha nism to ensure that there is a minimum floor below which social standards should not fall in certain key areas, and on the other hand a more pro-active concept aimed at ensuring con vergence through social pro gress. These ideas are enshrined notably in Article 118a of the Treaty and are found in the Social Charter and the Agree ment on Social Policy. Public debate on the Maastricht Treaty has demonstrated that significant parts of the public fear a Europe in which social rules and legislation, until now the subject of consensus, are put into question. (a) Common minimum standards relating to working conditions and labour law The achievement of the single market and of economic and monetary union will be at risk if the general population, and not ably the working population, does not take part in the ven ture. The issue of social dump ing is often invoked in this con text. Although it is a fact that in times of fierce competition enterprises need flexibility and that high unemployment re duces the bargaining power of workers, competition within the Community on the basis of 59 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES unacceptably low social stan dards, rather than the produc tivity of enterprises, will under mine the economic objectives of the Union. The common standards enshrined in existing Community legislation and those on the table in the action programme to implement the Social Charter constitute a min imum floor and will do so even more when the applicant EFTA States join the Union. But they are also a demonstration of the common political will, both on the part of governments and the social partners, to grant workers fundamental social rights as an integral part of the unpreceden ted economic and social progress since World War II. Legislation at Union level is not the only way of establishing social rules. More weight should be given to agreements between the social partners. Not only standards and norms, not only collective agreements, not only defined rights and respon sibilities, but also tacit and implicit behavioural rules are needed to reduce conflict and sustain a rapid pace of social change. Only well-functioning cooperation between the Mem ber States, the Parliament, the social partners and other civil partners in the European endea vour can contribute to this. Nevertheless, legislation con tinues to have its proper place in achieving the objective shared by all Member States, i.e. that European workers should have minimum guaran tees on health, safety and employment conditions. That objective should be pursued by completing the social action programme, and by exploiting to the full the possibilities offered by the Social Agree ment of the Maastricht Treaty. (b) Social standards within Europe High social standards, which are a complex mix of working and living conditions, are a clear objective of the Europe an Community. European expe rience has shown that they are an integral part of a competi tive model of economic devel opment. They are determined by a variety of government pol icies and by collective bargain ing for a given level of econom ic development, this comple mentary approach being con sidered as essential to a demo cratic community. It is there fore a matter of concern that global economic competition, and the resulting international trade in goods and services, should improve and not reduce social and working standards. In particular, it would be a dan gerous trend if unfair competi tion through unacceptably low standards should become wide spread. However, the welfare of the European Community is depen dent on playing a full role in an open, world competitive system, based on free trade, even if this implies painful adjustments in certain sectors and regions of the Community. The fundamental principle of social and economic cohesion in the Community is an expres sion of the will to share the bur den of such adjustment and to reduce existing disparities between groups and regions. The Structural Funds (includ ing the Social Fund) have pre cisely that purpose. Taken together their provisions reflect the will towards an economi cally dynamic, balanced and socially just Community. A key objective of European integration is that working and living standards in the Commu nity should converge. Despite all the difficulties, the evidence is that standards are levelling up rather than down, as wit nessed by the rising working and living standards in the less- developed parts of the Commu nity. The question is not one of limiting the competition from countries and regions with The welfare of the European Community is dependent on playing a full role in an open, world competitive system, based on free trade, even if this implies painful adjustments in certain sectors and regions of the Community Photo: \u00a9CEC 60 ",

This is the long-term trend, but it has to be recog nized that, under the present conditions of high unemploy ment, the social ground rules may need to be strengthened (for example, with regard to the problem of the derealization of production units within the Union). The existing OECD guidelines for transnational companies only register these questions, but vigilance on the part of Member States and of the Union is needed to ensure effective compliance. A most important contribution is likely to come from the deep involvement of the social part ners in the process of Europe an construction. For example, agreements between them at European level could facilitate the setting of social standards within the framework of the Social Charter. Together, backed up by the convergence of public social policy objec tives, they will assist the slow convergence of standards. (c) Adjustment assistance Since the place of the European Community in the world divi sion of labour is bound to be towards high-quality produc tion with high social standards, resistance to industrial restruc turing will be counterproduc tive in the long term. Howev er, trade-induced changes in employment patterns may be more rapid than those resulting What are the social ground rules needed by a Union of Mem ber States, whose future lies at the leading edge of the mar ket and whose history and success have been built on certain values which cement them together, in all their diversity, as a fraternity of nations? It is recognized that the Union needs to be a reliable partner in world trade. But to ensure progress in labour standards and fair competition, should the Union put a strong emphasis on the prevention of the risk of social dumping through: (i) adequate minimum provisions at Community level; (ii) possible agreements between employers and unions if they so desire; (\u00a1ii) anticipation and monitoring processes through, for example, observatories or special bodies; (iv) adjustment assistance measures supported by the ESF? from technological change and productivity gains per se, and they are in any case less access ible to negotiation between the social partners. There is there fore a strong case for govern ment action to provide assis tance to those workers who are worst affected. The European Union, especially through the new provisions for Objective 4 of the Social Fund, can assist this process by stimulating action to anticipate major struc tural changes and by providing training and other measures to absorb the shocks. 5. Reinforcing the social dialogue The unique political construc tion that is taking place in Europe is fundamentally linked to the diversity of its members, and the difficulty of forging its union is certainly affected by the phenomenon of growing decentralization present in all States - national, federal and confederal. All political and economic systems seem to be under pressure (the Soviet demise is a case in point) to devolve power and decentral ize structures, leading to a dif fusion of decision-making in a variety of institutions other than the State, including the market and civil society. This is why the role of the social partners in the process of European construction is vital, even if the process of social dia logue has been slow to mature. In so far as the representative organizations of employers and trade unions speak for member ships spread throughout the Union, it is an important ele ment of democratization, along side the growing role of the European Parliament and the regions. A major step forward - perhaps a breakthrough - in the development of the European 'social dimension' is now pos sible since the partners may proceed, if they so wish, from dialogue to collective agree ment. Collective agreements are already foreseen in Article 118b of the Treaty, and the agreement of the Eleven on social policy provides new means to implement an even tual agreement between the social partners (Article 4). This will require, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, clear determination of the rel ative roles of national legisla- 61 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES The role of the social partners in the process of European con struction is vital Photo: CEC tion, Community norms and collective agreements at the various levels, as well as of pro cedures to ensure their mutual synergy. Negotiations may be engaged, respecting fully the autonomy of the social partners, either on a proposal of the Commission or spontaneously. In the latter case, negotiations may be between branches of industry, across sectors Europe-wide, between regions or through transnational groups. The key issue in this respect is whether collective agreements could help to overcome some of the weaknesses in the legis lative process, notably the dif ficulty of reaching a consensus by consulting the social part ners before submitting legisla tion. It may be more realistic and more acceptable for the social partners to proceed to agreement in some cases. In Member States, regulations on social policy are in any case the result of a division of labour between the legislator and the social partners, so the existence of an autonomous collective bargaining space at European level could have considerable potential for the future. Progress will depend on the political will of the social part ners, on the capacity and func tioning of the machinery of the social dialogue and on the real prospects for pan-European collective bargaining. (a) Strengthening the architecture and functioning of the social dialogue The Commission is undertak ing a study, in cooperation with the national administrations concerned, of the arrangements for recognizing social partners in the Member States. It is hoped that this study will pro vide useful information for strengthening the three func tions of the social dialogue at European level: consultation, dialogue and negotiation. In particular, the Commission will put forward a review of the coherence and effectiveness of the existing consultation struc tures and procedures; at both interprofessional and sectoral levels, so as to define a more comprehensive and coherent consultation system. The Commission will continue to facilitate and give technical assistance to the social partners so that they may proceed as quickly as possible, if they so wish, to negotiation and agree ment. Furthermore, the Commission will cooperate with the social partners in examining the prob lems of implementing agree ments reached between them, both in the case where imple mentation will be through their own procedures and practices or those of Member States, or 62 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES in the case where the partners to the agreement would wish the Commission to propose a decision by the Council. The effectiveness of the Commission's efforts will of course depend on the success of the European representative bodies in involving their own structures at national level in the process of the social dia logue. (b) The issue of pan- European collective bargaining The different legal frameworks in Member States, the varied structures and traditions of col lective bargaining, and limita tions to real negotiating power at the European level mean that the road to collective agree ments will be a difficult one. Patience and the slow accumu lation of experience are the order of the day. However, the existing capital of the European social dialogue, accumulated over many years of persistent effort, should not be underesti mated. The Agreement was a major step forward and reflects the will of the social partners to keep the social dialogue up and running. For progress to be made, a discussion and clarifi cation of the several options under the Social Protocol for negotiation at the European level is necessary: \u2022 the social partners could agree to make a joint recom mendation to the Commis sion, thereby influencing the legislative process; \u2022 they could reach agreement and proceed through national channels, thereby developing a sort of coordinated Euro pean national bargaining; \u2022 they could convert the joint opinions into 'framework' agreements, to be imple mented by employers and trade unions at national level, thereby spreading the European social dialogue within the national systems; \u2022 they could send their agree ment to the Commission with the request that the Council convert it into a legal instrument; \u2022 they could open up negotia tion, at the appropriate level, in the domains where they are competent; \u2022 where there is no agreement between the social partners, the Commission will have to decide how best to proceed in order to achieve the objec tives it has set. Thus, it is clear in the Commission's view that much progress can be made without waiting for a full-blown Euro pean collective bargaining system. The European Union Treaty institutionalizes a space for collective agreement between the social partners. It is up to them to use it, with the Commission's help. (c) The changing indus trial relations agenda Against a common background of structural change and cycli cal crisis, employers and trade unions have been propelled towards new issues where the balance between cooperation and conflict has been changed. The drive of the employers towards flexibility and the dec entralization of industrial rela tions, combined with the weak ening of statutory labour mar ket regulation by some govern ments, has also had an impact on the industrial relations agen- New trade union functions are growing alongside those of the past Photo CEC 63 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES da. Continuing structural change cannot be accomplished without the cooperation of the organized work-force, so that new trade union functions are growing alongside those of the past. The persistent joint inter est by both trade unions and employers in the question of education and training, for example, seems to result from the shift towards quality pro duction and a high quality work-force, leading to a new bargaining agenda, and new forms of industrial democracy. Yet at the same time, the quest for flexibility is leading to inse curity and poor conditions for some groups of workers. Over all this hangs the shadow of unemployment. This is lead ing both trade unions and employers, to some extent with common interests, to plead for bolder economic policies which will raise the level of produc tive investment and lead to a higher path of growth. Thus, the 'economic' and the 'social' agenda of industrial relations are intimately linked. Beyond this, there is a whole range of issues resulting from the internationalization of econ omies, the introduction of new technologies and the intensifi cation of international competi tion. Taken together, these changes require national bar gaining strategies to give more weight to international reper cussions than in the past. In each of their joint opinions, the social partners have arrived at a consensus based on a for ward-looking, negotiated pro cess of adaptation to structural change. This approach, support ed by the resources of the Com munity, including the Social Fund, could be the basis for common responses to the major challenges outlined above and others. How could the social dialogue be strengthened and broad ened (assuming of course the willingness of the partners)? A number of issues might be considered: (i) new possibilities for European-wide collective bargaining; (il) broadening of the agenda on issues which will influence the future of industry: health and safety at the workplace, demographic trends including the role of older workers, social protection, equal opportunities, integration of migrant workers, preventing and combating exclusion, measures to facilitate free movement of workers (mutual recognition of qualifications, transnational training, port ability of occupational pensions, etc.); (\u00a1ii) possible partnership with other bodies on some issues (e.g. with NGOs on equal opportunities and integration of disabled persons in the labour market and with NGOs and local authorities on exclusion). The social dialogue at Community level has already reflected these trends in Industrial relations and has demonstrated its value as a platform for the next steps. Where will the priorities lie? This is a matter for the social partners themselves, but the Commission would like to advance some points for dis cussion, bearing in mind the different levels (Inter-branch, sectoral, transnational enterprises) of the dialogue. Should higher priority be given to employment, education and training, In which the social partners have already had discus sions and the Commission is taking new initiatives? The two issues are linked, because the use of training to cope with problems of Industrial adaptation will reduce the strains on the external labour market and prevent further unemploy ment. What will the social partners' involvement be in the wide range of issues related to the completion of the single market and to free movement within it: mutual recognition of qualifi cations, portability of pensions, social security, transnational training? Should the social partners strengthen their involvement In the following issues: exclusion, equal opportunities, reconciliation between work and family, problems of older workers, integra tion of immigrant workers from third countries? 64 ",

Health matters Separate Commission Commu nications on both health and safety at work and public health have been prepared and there fore these are not dealt with in detail in the Green Paper. (a) Health and safety at work Statistics available from Mem ber States show that 8 000 peo ple die each year in the Euro pean Community from the con sequences of an accident at their place of work. Of the approximately 120 million workers in the Community, 10 million suffer an industrial acci dent or occupational disease every year. Quite apart from the human aspects, the economic conse quences are considerable: ben efits paid as a consequence of industrial accidents and occu pational diseases throughout the EC are estimated at ECU 26 000 million, and this sum does not take into account the indirect costs arising from time lost, increased administrative costs, damage to equipment, etc., which probably amount to far more. There is a preconceived notion that the improvement of health and safety in the workplace automatically imposes added costs. This is not the case, espe cially as improved health and safety leads to a reduction in costs through less accidents and ill health. In addition increased well-being at work encourages efficiency, strengthens the per sonal commitment of the work er, and contributes to increased industrial harmony. While it is true that Community directives adopted before and after the entry into force of the Single European Act form a Improved health and safety leads to a reduction in costs through fewer accidents and ill health Photo- CEC Photo: < Co\u00ecolh\u00e9que/AGE In the future, emphasis has to be placed on the promotion and mainte nance of a high level of human health in the European population valuable basis for promoting equitable working conditions and attaining an even higher level of protection for workers, it is also true that their actual effectiveness depends and will continue to depend on their being rigorously applied in the Member States. Moreover, information, education and training in these fields also need to be improved. (b) Public health A striking example of coopera tion between the Member States to achieve prevention rather than suffer the high human and financial costs of care is provided by the action programmes and activity of the Community over the last decade to mobilize efforts and promote cooperation to combat problems like cancer, AIDS, drugs and alcohol use, and to promote healthy life styles through health education. The competence of the Union in this field has now been for malized in the Treaty on Euro pean Union (Article 129), which sets out a framework for action and defines the respec tive roles of the Member States and the Community. Thus an important human dimension will be added to the Com munity's work. This will enable a more strate gic and coherent approach to be adopted in the future, recogniz ing that the health status of the population is more affected by lifestyle and environmental conditions than by curative action through the health-care system. In the future, emphasis has to be placed on the promo tion and maintenance of a high level of human health in the European population, as well as on the prevention of disease. (See Figure 19.)

Economic and social cohesion: The role of the European Social Fund No democratic State or union of States can function without efforts towards economic cohe\u00ad sion between poor and rich regions and solidarity between fortunate and disadvantaged social groups. The ESF (the European Social Fund), as a component of the Community's social policy (Article 3(i) of the Treaty of Union) and as one of the four Structural Funds of the Community, contributes to both: it is a tangible demonstra\u00ad tion of the Community's con\u00ad cern for the development of human resources and the improvement in the function\u00ad ing of the labour market, both from a regional perspective and in relation to vulnerable groups. Bearing in mind not only sub\u00ad sidiarity but also added value, the ESF has to be seen as a complement to the efforts of the Member States in the same direction. As we have seen in the 'Chal\u00ad lenges' (Part III), Europe can\u00ad not solve its economic and social problems unless it suc\u00ad ceeds in modernizing its pro\u00ad duction system. Action is also called for to increase the employment intensity of growth, to sustain existing jobs, create new ones and to promote equal opportunities for men and women in the labour market. The recent revision of the ESF regulation has equipped it with the means to provide a more effective and flexible response to the changing labour market requirements and specific chal\u00ad lenges facing Member States. This revision reflects one of the main thrusts of this paper: the need to move partly from cure to prevention in the labour mar\u00ad ket field and the need to move from income maintenance to integration into the labour mar\u00ad ket in the social protection field. Of course, ESF intervention though frequently substantial, is only an additional contribu\u00ad tion to Member States' own efforts to address the full range of human resources' and labour market problems. 66 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES (a) Tackling the diverse needs of the unemployed and those excluded from the labour market In addition to its continuing focus on young people and the long-term unemployed, ESF activity under Objective 3 has been extended to provide sup port to those exposed to long- term unemployment and exclu sion from the labour market. A comprehensive and coordi nated package of measures. A more effective, pro-active approach to the reinsertion of the unemployed and those excluded from the labour mar ket depends on the provision of a comprehensive and coordi nated package of measures tail ored to local needs. As well as providing accompanying meas ures such as care for children, elderly or sick dependants, to ensure maximum access to training/education/employment services, a much wider range of actions is needed to supple ment traditional vocational training and employment aids. For example, pre-training, counselling, upgrading of basic skills, community employment or work experience, job search assistance, in-job support and aids to promote geographical and occupational mobility. Ensuring effective delivery of a broad range of actions will often require the strengthening of employment services and other relevant institutions and systems, for example through training of trainers and other staff, support for planning/pro gramming and the transfer of know-how. To succeed, support must not only address the requirements of a large number of target groups but also be responsive to local needs and situations and be provided in as coordi nated a way as possible to enable progression from one measure to another. Flexibility in delivery, harnessing poten tial at local level and the active involvement of all relevant actors, including the unem ployed/excluded themselves, will be vital in this respect. In addition, the ESF, through appropriate employment aids, will also support efforts to introduce flexible and innova tive methods of work organiza tion and distribution with a view to promoting employment intensive growth. (b) Adapting the work force to the new challenges A new Objective 4 has been specifically created so that the ESF, throughout the Commu nity, can facilitate the adapta tion of workers to industrial change and to changes in pro duction systems. Experience to date has shown that, especially in Objective 1 regions, there is a lack of organ ized structures for in-company training, little training takes place and the training that is undertaken tends to be haphaz ard and lacking in focus. Such a fragmented approach to contin uing training for employees acts as a block to development. A systematic approach to con tinuing training. To maximize the potential of human capital, in the first place, ways must be found to assist the establish ment of effective training systems within firms. These include the development of appropriate in-company train ing structures, the drawing up of training plans, management development and mechanisms to anticipate labour market trends. The particular difficul ties faced by SMEs in address ing their training needs in- house must also be taken into account. Distance training tech niques and technologies in par ticular, open up cost-efficient and flexible training possibil ities for employees of SMEs. Secondly, ways to improve the quality and relevance of train ing supply must be developed. Consideration needs to be given to the setting up of decentral ized networks of accredited training centres to provide con tinuing training for employees. In this regard, attention could be given to the development of centres of 'self-learning' which would provide access to elec tronic information and telemat- ic learning opportunities. Mechanisms to monitor and supervise actions and to certi fy the qualifications of both trainers and trainees would be especially important as would the full involvement of all the social and economic partners, the public and private sector and any relevant educa tion/training institutes/guilds. (c) Strengthening initial training/ education and research,science and technology (RST) systems Emphasis on initial training and education is essential because of the significant preventive function they can provide and their medium- to long-term importance in determining a meaningful continuing educa tion and training system. Ways need to be found to widen access to initial training and education, to minimize the numbers of unqualified school leaders, school failure and school drop-outs, to improve the quality of initial training and education, including higher education and to promote great er mobility in the European context. Access to quality. Considera tion will be given to the need for ESF support for strengthen ing planning/programming systems (for example, through improving the quality and con tent of curricula, training of teachers and other staff) and for bringing schools/training cen tres and higher education estab lishments closer to economic activity (for example, through the development of networks, the introduction of more lan guage and technological mod ules into secondary education, the promotion of new technol ogy, greater emphasis on multi- dimensionality, promoting cer tification and recognition of qualifications at European level and efforts to raise the status of technical and vocational edu cation/training). Boosting human potential in research, science and technol- 67 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES ogy has a key role to play. The ESF will contribute in terms of support for post-graduate train ing, training of managers, tech nicians and other staff of public and private research establish ments, and, where necessary, appropriate employment aids. Whereas ESF support for initial training is envisaged through out the Community, financing for research, science and tech nology and education will be concentrated on the least favoured regions. In these regions strengthening educa- tion/training/RST systems will require adequate infrastructure and equipment including li braries, databases and docu mentation centres for which Structural Fund support can be provided. (d) A partnership approach To gain maximum benefit from the increased scope and flex ibility of the revised Social Fund in responding to the chal lenges faced by Member States requires not only strong part nership between the Commis sion and the Member States and regions, but wider partnership within Member States. This is especially true of the new themes of the Social Fund: exclusion from the labour mar ket and adapting to industrial change, where much expertise and experience lies outside the public domain and where a bot tom-up approach is particular ly appropriate. The full partic ipation of NGOs, Community bodies, local authorities, the social and economic partners and the private as well as the public sector will be a key determining factor in the suc cess of action in these new ESF aspects. (e) Concentrating on the areas of greatest need Both the Commission and the Member States are required to ensure, within the partnership at the planning and program ming stage that Community assistance, whether through mainstream funding or through Community initiatives, is con centrated on the most important needs and the most effective operations. The bulk of financ ing will inevitably go towards the least favoured regions of the Community where it can address a wide range of prior ities. Outside of Objective 1 regions, where Community financing is more limited in comparison with national financing, relatively greater emphasis needs to be given to the development of appropriate training and employment struc tures and services, to measures designed to bridge existing gaps in training/employment servic es provision, to the exchange of know-how and best practice, to innovative approaches and to ensuring synergy between the various Community pro grammes and actions undertak en at national level. The ESF administers between 80% to 90% of the social bud get of the Union and could therefore play a significant role in helping the Union to respond The bulk of financing will inevitably go towards the least favoured regions of the Community Photo: \u00a9CEC 68 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES to the difficult challenges set out in this paper. However, achieving a real impact will require: \u2022 the strengthening of partner ship between the Fund and national and regional admin istrations, the economic and social partners and other competent bodies; \u2022 more flexibility in scope, eli gibility conditions and administration; \u2022 more concentration of effort on priority objectives and on the most innovative and effective structures. For its part, the Commission introduced such improvements to the revised Structural Fund regulations approved by the Council in July, enabling the ESF to widen its tasks to include broad human resourc es development and the improvement of the function ing of the labour market. The idea of a Community initiative on employment and the devel opment of human resources has Specific questions for consideration include: What mechanisms, at national and Community level, are required to ensure that the outcomes of Community support for innovative programmes get translated into the main stream of Member State human resource policies? How can the ESF contribute to the removal of institutional and systemic disincentives to the take-up of training and employment possibilities, including those which affect equal opportunities for men and women and the awareness of problems faced by those excluded from the labour market? What mechanisms are most appropriate to ensure that, at ground level, action to develop human resources is properly taken into account when investment decisions on infrastruc ture and productive environment are made? What kind of measures must be implemented in order to improve the anticipation of industrial changes and related skill needs? What mechanisms are required to ensure that, in addition to the national authorities and the Commission, all the neces sary partners (including local and regional administrative bodies, the economic and social partners, NGOs and educa tional institutes, etc.) play a full part in programming and tak ing operational decisions to achieve successful implementa tion of action? Should more ESF support go towards funding a system of trainee choice, thus encouraging competitiveness between training providers and putting a premium on quality? also been put forward, in the recent Green Paper on the future of the Community initia tives under the Structural Funds, to address the Commu nity dimension of adaptation to industrial change, employment- intensive growth, exclusion from the labour market and equal opportunities. For the new approach to work it is imperative that the policy choices made by the Member States take full advantage of the broader scope and new flexibil ity of the ESF whilst taking account of the need for concen tration. 8. International aspects The emergence of a period of peaceful socioeconomic coop eration and competition (see 'Challenges'), in which the European social model will on the one hand be a major asset in terms of the Union's diplo macy but on the other will be under threat, will compel clos er consideration of the external relations aspects of social poli cy. (a) Minimum interna tional labour standards The issue of minimum interna tional labour standards is com plex and difficult. On the one hand, competition on the basis of natural compar ative advantage, which can often legitimately be based on lower labour costs and, indeed, on a willingness to work long er, harder or under more diffi cult conditions, is the best way for developing countries to improve their position. On the other, it is not in the interests of international economic coop eration that the exploitation of workers should become an instrument of competition. As the controversial and diffi cult debate on the issue of social clauses in trade agree ments shows, the distinction between the two situations is not always easy to draw. Whereas there is widespread agreement that the exploitation of children or the use of forced labour are practices which the international community must condemn, situations involving relative views about health and safety or working hours give rise to a different debate. Con cern about the plight of work ers in less-developed countries, while often genuinely motivat ed, can disguise a self-interest ed tendency towards protection ism. The promotion of basic workers' rights through agreed international labour standards is actively pursued through existing international institu tions such as the International Labour Organization and the Community will continue to play a constructive role in this process. As the globalization of eco nomic production gains momentum, these difficult issues will continue to be debat ed in the search for a fair and equitable balance between safe guards against unfair competi tion based on exploitative labour conditions and legiti mate comparative advantage. 69 ",
        "EUROPEAN UNION - POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGES (b) The EFTA candidates The possible accession of some EFTA countries will, because of their relatively high social and labour standards as well as their important achievements in the field of equal opportu nities for women and men, put pressure on the development of a strong social policy by the Union. If these countries become members of the Union, they are likely to lend their sup port both to the construction of a forward-looking social poli cy and to the democratic pro cess of establishing it. (c) Central and East European Countries (CEEC) Communism in these countries generated a passive culture which collapsed from within, even if the appeal of the politi cal democracy and the market economy of the West played a significant role. The broad con sequence has been that the tran sition to a Western type of soci ety and economy has been slower than expected, as the institutional framework and the ground rules have to be recon structed more or less from scratch and are a condition of a return to a competitive econo my. The concept of the 'rush to the market' certainly under estimated these realities, and the rapid emergence of high unemployment, poverty and social exclusion place political limits on the speed with which that process can go forward. (See Figure 20.) Photo: \u00a9 CEC In these circumstances, it is vital that the CEEC countries be helped to establish effective social policies in an open way which recognizes that the Euro pean social model is changing. There is much to be learned on both sides. CEEC countries cannot overnight set up social policies which took decades to develop in the West, even with the high economic growth of the post-war period. It is likely that, in that process, both the Union and the CEEC countries will move to a next generation of social policies, which may be different from those prevail ing in the socioeconomic mod els in other parts of the world and even in Europe. Such an approach will be the best way of relieving inevita ble problems. The main com petitive advantage of the CEEC countries lies in low labour costs combined with the rela tively high level of education which prevailed under the com munist system. However, it should also be remembered that, under communism, the enteiprise was the main instru ment of social protection, whereas in the West many of the costs of social policy have been borne by the State. Cooperation between the Union and the CEEC countries on the social dimension of transition is essential to reduce the risk of the population rejecting democ racy and the market economy because the social and human costs are too high. More generally, for the reasons mentioned in Part III on the challenges, the Union should cooperate in the social policy work of other international institutions. Cooperation and exchange of information with North America and Japan is necessary, but the rich experi ence of the Member States on the social dimension of eco nomic development will also be a positive element in the Union's relations with the developing world. What should be the principal social policy priorities for the external relations of the Union? How best can the Union pursue the agreement of internation al labour standards (e.g. via the ILO or social clauses in trade agreements)? 70 ",

Unem\u00ad ployment continues to rise steeply throughout the region. 9. Democratizing the process of social change and constructing a people's Europe The remarks on challenges (Part ILI) emphasized that the move towards globalism is par\u00ad allelled by a movement in the Member States towards region\u00ad alism and localism. This devel\u00ad opment is partly due to the fact that in fast-changing societies, in which social innovation becomes a key requirement, decision-making becomes more decentralized because of the need for flexibility and respon\u00ad siveness. In the next stage of European construction it will therefore be necessary to involve the 'grass roots' more, both for reasons of democratic functioning and for effective\u00ad ness. Within the Member States, there has been over the past decade a strong movement towards local and regional initiatives, in which diverse social groups have taken part and where enterprises and trade unions have exercised their social responsibility. The rela\u00ad tionship between this micro- level action and government policy has not yet been clearly worked out but it is certain that in many fields (economic development, social protection, urban and rural development, youth integration and involve\u00ad ment of older people) there are lessons to be learned. In this regard, cooperative societies, insurance companies and other associations which make up the fabric of the social economy, will have an important role to play. As far as the Community is concerned, these same realities have compelled networking and partnership between different groups, as opposed to the leg\u00ad islative route. Legislation at Community level can be the correct approach but mobiliza\u00ad tion of the diverse actors into a concerted effort is often the only way of moving forward. This is true, for example, in the case of poverty and exclusion, education and training and many of the social problems facing the Union, such as drugs, delinquency and even crime. But it is also true of job crea\u00ad tion and economic develop\u00ad ment. The Community's frame\u00ad work programmes for research and development have analysed these developments as an 'Archipelago of Europe', i.e. the fabric of local, diversified capacities for action that are now a key instrument for build\u00ad ing Europe. The transition to the European Union, involving for the first time the concept of European citizenship, is a vital stage in the construction of a democrat\u00ad ic Europe. The social objectives 71 ",

Community legislation, as interpreted by the European Court of Justice, has built up a body of rights which need fully to be understood by citizens. This is far from the case at present. Thus, notwithstanding further legislation, the existing rights in all the relevant fields of social policy should be clar ified and made known to the citizen. Since many Member States are reinforcing citizens' rights, either through legislation or through administrative action and public awareness (such as Citizens' charters), the exchange of information on such matters could be facilitat ed by the Union. How could the many networks cooperating with the Member States and the Commission contribute to identifying and solv ing the problems of society now facing the Union? Would there be an advantage In envisaging an appropriate forum for discussion in which the strategic problems of Euro pean society could be debated in an open and democratic way? How can we stimulate a kind of consolidated statement of citizens' rights within the Union, which would make explicit existing rights and seek to shift the existing 'labour market orientation' to a more general people-oriented approach on the basis of values common to Member States?

Success is impossible without a competitive and integrated European economy, taking full advantage of new technologies and modem methods of produc\u00ad tion and organization.

        "ANNEX I A Green Paper In general, contributors welcomed the idea of a Green Paper and were grateful for having been given the opportunity to make their views known. The ETUC, however, is concerned that the Green Paper is a way of delaying action and would like to see a Green/White Paper which presents concrete policy proposals. for closer coordination between economic and social policies is now recognized (NMS, GML). Both contribute to economic growth. Social policy is not just a way of providing compensatory payments, but has a positive role in promoting economic deve lopment and competitiveness (PM). In particular, an active labour market policy facilitates structural change by improving inter- firm and occupational mobility (SM) and consequently makes an important contribution to economic growth. Unemployment and employment Not surprisingly, there is widespread recognition that low rates of employment and high rates of unemployment are the major pro blems facing our societies with costs for individuals, society and the economy. Many felt that policies for tackling unemployment and stimula ting economic recovery should constitute the core of the Green Paper (GLM, DML, IML, NMS, SM). How can we combine a higher rate of growth with a high rate of labour force participation, low unemployment and low inflation in a society in which econo mic and social welfare are mutually reinforcing (SM, NMS, SM)? The contribution from the Swedish Government sums up the need for coordination of several different sorts of policies: 'In Swe den a strong policy tradition exists of combining economic and labour market policies in order to make them mutually reinfor cing. However, the complexities of our societies necessitate the coordination of several policy areas. Economic policy has to set the general framework for job and enterprise creation and expan sion; regional policy and policy for equal treatment for a fair dis tribution of employment between regions and between women and men; and labour market policy for a flexible labour market. Social security has to provide the necessary and at the same time efficient safety nets and educational policy the long-term com petence basis (sic) for the economy.' There is felt to be a role for the Community in improving the way in which labour markets work and in reducing the imbalances on the labour market which often cannot be done at national level (NMS). Ways must be found of improving access to the labour market, especially for young people, the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups (SM). One suggestion was that the Commission should set up a task force to examine the Commu nity's role in helping to improve the way its labour market works (CBI). Some stressed the possible negative consequences of economic and monetary union (EMU). The ETUC states that we should be aware that economic and monetary union could aggravate the employment situation, especially rigid adherence to the conver gence criteria. The Austrian Government suggests that we should control and monitor the negative effects of the implementation of the convergence criteria. The CPAG suggested that the goal of reducing unemployment should be integrated into the con vergence criteria. Nevertheless, others, such as the Dutch Mini ster for Social Affairs, stress the importance of meeting the con vergence criteria. There is awareness that, in the past, there has been a certain degree of separation between economic and social policies. The need Social exclusion In addition to tackling the unemployment problem, we need to look at the wider problem of poverty and social exclusion (IML, GMW, ICM). Now, more than ever, the Community needs to deve lop a social policy to maintain and reinforce social cohesion (FS A). We need to improve awareness of the problems (DMS) and produce strong action at Community level to combat social exclusion (FSA, ETUC, NGO, CPAG). Measures should include a guaranteed mini mum income, rights to health care and education, Community competence in the area of homelessness and housing (FE), more actions to improve reinsertion onto the labour market, and exchange of experiences, especially on training and education (ETUC, CO, ICM, RC). IMI suggests that there should be a Com munity action programme in favour of disadvantaged people. The EAPN suggested that there should be a recognition of pover ty and social exclusion in all Community policies through a set of internal Commission rules (see the rules to take account of the environmental dimension in Community policies). We also need a fundamental re-examination of the way in which Europe deve lops so that nobody is left by the wayside. In particular, the Com munity should develop common goals for the full integration of disabled people and their families into European society (DMS, 81 ",
        "ANNEX I DPI, AG,CO). In general, we should encourage the re-creation of social solidarity with all actors in the social field working together for a better society. The involvement of non-governmental volun tary organizations, in particular, should be developed and vol unteers in local communities trained (RC). The NMW, however, thinks that the fight against social exclu sion is a national responsibility and that the Community's role should be limited to one of exchange of information. instead, on the quality of goods and services. The need to develop social policy hand in hand with economic policy was reiterated in this context. Many contributors believe that the Community needs to avoid erosion of social standards (DMS, FME) and should agree mini mum standards to prevent social dumping (NMS). Some wish to see a positive programme for raising social standards (ETUC. AG). In regional terms, there is still a wide divergence in standards of living across the Community and a way must be found at Com munity level to ensure convergence as laid down in the Treaty on European Union (PM, AG). The EAPN suggested that the Commission should make recom mendations in this area to prevent Member States from reducing social protection as a result of restrictive budgetary policies and CO recommended introducing a clause of 'non-regression' into Community instruments, aimed at Member States with higher- than-average norms of social protection. European Social Fund The activities of the European Social Fund (ESF) are broadly welcomed but there is some feeling that, although it has had an impact at national level, it has had limited impact in promulgating a European-wide policy (ETUC). At the other end of the spectrum, the CCRE says local and regional administrations should be more involved in ESF programmes and the Community should take more account of local strategies. The ETUC and EAPN would like a constitutional document or a reform of the Treaties which says that European union will guarantee the fundamental rights of European citizens and European residents from the point of view of income, work, housing, etc. Progress on the implementation of the Social Charter has been too slow. Nevertheless, in developing European social policy, we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. The Social Charter should be fully implemented and form the basis for further policy. Agreement should be reached on outstanding proposals on, for example, atypical workers, worker participati on, young workers, and dismissals (AG, ETUC). Competition, social protection and social dumping There is a growing realization that the European Community has been becoming less and less competitive with a consequent loss of jobs. There are new sources of competition linked to the growing importance of high technology and globilization of markets. There is concern on the part of some that this will lead to grow ing pressure for the erosion of acquired social rights and com petition on the basis of reduced social costs and deregulation. There are strong feelings (ETUC, NMS) that social policy should not be used as an element of competition which should be based, Several contributors (e.g. ETUC, NGO, EAPN) would like a social clause inserted in international trade agreements and the ETUC believes that all 12 Member States should ratify ILO conventions on freedom of association, the prevention of forced labour and the fight against child labour. Others ask whether Europe can maintain traditions of social pro tection in the face of increasing competition. European models of social policy can only survive if they make European compa nies more competitive rather than reducing competitiveness. This is one of the major challenges. We should avoid subsidizing non- profitable industries (NMS) and must remember that the streng thening of the competitiveness of Community industry is essen tial to the long-term success of European social policy (UNICE). We need to look carefully at those costs which threaten jobs. According to the UKG, this does not mean that Community action 82 ",
        "ANNEX I should focus on a reduction of existing standards but that furt her obligations or restrictions need to be carefully considered for their effects on competitiveness and existing measures reviewed to see whether their objectives are appropriate and, if so, whether the same result could not be achieved in a less onerous way. Others were more forthright in their assertion that high labour costs, due to such things as expensive amounts of statutory and personal holidays and sick leave, are barriers to a company's competitiveness and to investment and reinvestment, and should be reviewed (USB). the world. In addition to considering our competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis Japan, the United States of America and other emerging competitors, we should consider the effects of enlargement and the changes which are occurring in Eastern Europe (PM). Western Europe needs strong economies in order to help the countries of Eastern Europe (UNICE). There is fear of competition from the Eastern bloc countries but it should be remembered that, at the moment, imports from Eastern Europe account for only 3% of Community imports, whereas 50% of these countries' imports come from the Community. Barriers to trade are coming down, but the countries of the East need help to develop their economies in order to pay off their debt and develop their export capacity. There was widespread agreement that in the face of increased competition, we need to emphasize research and development and high value-added industries and allocate more resources to education and training (PM) and 'workforce development' (USB). We should also try and ensure that training is correctly focused for the needs of the future (CBI). A comprehensive approach to human resource development with improved and expanded edu cation and training opportunities, including training in enterpri ses is needed (SM). Europe has a role to play here in looking at the wide range of experiences across Member States and drawing out useful lessons for future policy. The Commission's PHARE programme is helping to modern ize or restructure employment and social policies in these coun tries and cooperation with Eastern Europe must be intensified (NMS). Since the aim is to forge ever-closer ties with eventual EC membership of these countries, we should ensure that social policy develops in line with EC practices. It is also vital that the social dimension is given due consideration so that reform is not rejected by the people on the grounds that the social costs are too high. In addition to the costs of social protection which have to be borne by companies and their effects on competitiveness, there are con cerns about the cost of social security regimes to governments. Systems are under strain because of demographic pressures and need restructuring (UNICE, CO) so that they are financially sound, cost-effective and flexible (USB). Revised social securi ty systems could encourage movement from unemployment com pensation to employment by incorporating training and 'work- fare' elements (USB). There is little enthusiasm from governments for full harmoniza tion of social security schemes across the Community, the sub sidiarity principle being deemed to apply. Nevertheless, the Euro pean Community has a role to play in developing the coordination of social security schemes so as to achieve the highest possible level of cross-frontier protection (GML, NMS) and convergence of their objectives. The LSS thinks the Green Paper should con sider whether there should be coordination in other areas and whether a commitment to an effective social security system should be incorporated in the Social Charter. Europe in a world context Many contributions stressed that future social policy must be developed bearing in mind Europe's relationship with the rest of Subsidiarity and diversity There is a widespread feeling that the Community should re spect the principle of subsidiarity. EC action should be taken only where there is a clear Community dimension to a problem (NMS). European social policy should be geared to providing solutions to concrete social/political problems but must refrain from trying to codify a coherent system (GML). It should also limit itself to defining the results to be achieved rather than the precise methods for implementation (UNICE). The Community has a role to play in promoting the free movement of workers and in preventing unacceptable forms of competi tion in the internal market. It should act to define minimum requirements, for example in health and safety, promotion of equal opportunities for men and women, treatment of minors, protection of pregnancy and maternity rights benefits, non-discri mination on the grounds of sex, race, age, religion or nationality and employment of disabled people (UNICE). However, the Community should not act on collective labour laws, industrial relations systems and procedures, worker con- 83 ",
        "ANNEX I sulfation and participation, job content, employment contracts, pay, and working time (UNICE). The UKG is concerned that the Community has sometimes over stepped the mark. It accepts that the Community has a role to play in the areas of free movement of workers, minimum stan dards of health and safety at work and the attainment of a high level of health protection. However, it believes there are many other areas where the Treaty on European Union does not pro vide a basis for Community measures and the responsibility for action lies with the Member States. The UKG argues that there is a need to evaluate legislation adop ted in the past, especially with a view to its effects on competiti veness, and use such evaluations to form new policy decisions. Where legislation is appropriate, it should be flexible and not too detailed (GLM) and should set out a framework of aims to be achieved rather than detailed means or standards to be observed. Others, however, stress that Community-wide legislation is impor tant and that we should take advantage of the new legislative framework to create a 'Social Europe' where rights are pro tected by law and social dumping avoided (FME, ETUC, ICM, DPI, women's organizations). A social policy at the level of the Community should take into account the economic, social, cultural and geographical diversi ty which exists across the Community (GML), and should reco gnize that Member States look in different ways to central legis lation, to collective bargaining or to voluntary mechanisms as the main engine of social policy (UKG). The NMS and GLM suggest that legislative proposals should take account of the different economic strengths of Member States by, for example, basing the legislation on minimum standards. Where large differences exist, recommendations are preferable to binding regulations. The CCRE feels that local and regional communities and admi nistrations have a vital role to play in the development and imple mentation of Community social policy. They should be invol ved in the social dialogue at Community level in the same way as other social partners. The Commission does have a role as a catalyst for new ideas (NMS) and it is important to analyse and share experiences over the coming years (UKG, DML). The statistical bases for action need to be improved. In particular, we need accurate statistics and information on the family dimen sion in different areas of social protection (GMFE, CO) and also improved statistics on the elderly (GMFE) and on public social expenditure (EAPN). There is concern among employers' organizations about the multiplicity of pending Commission initiatives concerning em ployee participation, information and consultation. These pro posals include, inter alia, the European Works Council Direc tive, the fifth company law Directive and the European Company Statute. The USB states that the added requirements, coupled with other EC directives and/or national laws and practices, would create an 'overlapping, conflicting, costly, time-consuming maze of organizations and systems within which companies would ope rate.' The CBI even goes so far as to propose a moratorium on almost all new regulatory instruments. The NMS also stresses that attention must be paid to the internal consistency of EC legislation to avoid double regulation, with particular attention being paid to legislation passed on the basis of Articles 118a and 100a. Legislation There is a feeling that legislation is not always the most appro priate way of dealing with social policy at European level (DML, UKG, IML, PM). The GLM believes that the aim should not be harmonization of labour law, but general convergence. Minimum standards should be set for workers' rights, but these should not be too detailed. They should include equality of treatment for part-time and tem porary workers, equality between men and women, protection in the event of dismissal, the right of complaint, etc. 84 ",
        "ANNEX I The Maastricht Treaty Very few of the contributions referred directly to the Treaty on European Union, but the two main representatives of the social partners, UNICE and ETUC, were concerned about the relationship between the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Maastricht. The ETUC feels that the social dialogue to date has been a sort of apprenticeship and now needs to be developed and strengthened in the light of the Maastricht Treaty. Governments, too, recognize the importance of using the pos sibility, given in the Social Protocol, of involving the social part ners. At a national level, the social partners should have more influence on the implementation of Community instruments (DML, AG, SM, GLM, FME). Free movement of workers There is general agreement that the Community has a vital role to play in encouraging the free movement of workers. It should make greater efforts to promote mobility (DMS, IML, NGO) and integration (AG) and should consider equal social security pro vision and access to health care for immigrants from third coun tries (ETUC, LSS). Older people Several organizations representing older people made contribu tions. In a society which is ageing, we should ensure that the talents of older people are used to the full and that we prepare people better for later life, for example by introducing more flexible retirement schemes. We should also ensure that older people have adequate social protection and are fully integrated into European society (BMP, AG, EPSO, GMW). An ageing population has implications not only for the cost of pensions but for providing care. With increased mobility and increased labour market participation of both men and women, there is a potential increased burden on the State. If the State tries to avoid this responsibility, studies have shown that this consti tutes a threat to equality, since it is usually women who are for ced to care for elderly relatives. It will be very difficult to for mulate binding legislation in this field. Nevertheless, the Com munity has a role to play in inspiring Member States to develop their policies and encourage convergence (SM). Women A tenth of the contributions came from groups representing women. There have been significant changes in the role of women over the last 20 years, with more women working, many having fewer children, a growing number of single parents and single person households. However, many women are still concentrated in low-wage jobs with poor working conditions. Equal opportunities are not just an issue for women but also for men and the wider social organization. There is a need to look at the organization of work and education and training. The Com munity should increase public awareness of the issues, improve access to work and possibilities for re-entry on to the labour mar ket, improve research and statistics, and improve child-care faci lities (EWL, CREW, IML). There is a need for better represen tation of women at decision-making level. At the moment, it is lar gely men who make the decisions regarding women 'who, after all, represent half of humanity, half of our human resources' (PW). We need policies for both men and women which facilitate the combination of gainful employment and parenthood. We should aim for a common standard for policies on child care and paren tal leave to avoid this being an impediment to the free movement of workers (SM). Social partners and social dialogue UNICE and ETUC obviously welcomed the new role of the social partners in the formulation of European social policy. The NMS proposes that equal treatment aspects should be inte grated into all Community proposals for legislation. 85 ",
        "ANNEX I Family policy The competence of Member States in the field of family policy should be recognized and the role of the Commission in the exchange of information and the promotion of cooperation high lighted (GMFE, GMW). Family policy concerns all families and not just those in difficulties. A balance must be found between families with specific needs and all families. Family policy is currently not mentioned in the Treaties and should be included in the 1996 reform of the Treaties. Representatives of family orga nizations should be consulted in the same way that the social partners are consulted (CO). ing time arrangements. The individualization of lifestyles and behaviour means changes in the organization of work (UNICE). We need to create more flexible working time arrangements not just to help employers and, perhaps, help create jobs, but to achieve a balance between family life and professional life (SM, AG, DMS, CO). Health The NMW, however, does not believe that there should be a fami ly policy either at national or European level, preferring to focus on the individual. This is felt to be largely a matter for Member States (GHM, CO) but the Community has an important role to play in providing information and creating networks, especially in the area of pre vention (CO). Working time and organization of work Many contributors feel that the Commission needs to look careful ly at trends in working time and develop new ideas about work- The Swedish Government feels that the Commission, in colla boration with Member States, should develop its work on health and safety. The traditional view of health and safety should be broadened to look at the impact of the working environment as a whole on both people and productivity. 86 ",

Phase II (1993-96) has an annual bud get of ECU 1 million. \u2022 SPEC Support programme for employment creation SPEC aims to provide technical and financial support for inno vative regional or local employment creation projects, with a view to accommodating structural changes on the labour market, particularly in connection with the completion of the internal market. Priority is also given to regions facing employ ment problems which are given priority under Objectives 1, 2 and 5b of the Structural Funds and frontier regions where projects involve transfrontier cooperation. Funding is given in three-year periods. The programme's budget for 1993 is ECU 1.2 million. \u2022 EURES European employment services The legal basis for the EURES project is provided by Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, underpinned by Articles 48 and 49 of the Treaty of Rome. This is amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2434/921 of July 1992. The EURES project (European employment services) is a close partnership between the Commission of the European Commu nities (Directorate-General V - Employment) and the public employment services of the Member States. The project seeks to provide detailed information concerning job vacancies, job appli cations, and general information on living and working conditi ons and the labour market - to assist individuals looking for work in another Member State and employers seeking to recruit at Euro pean level. To facilitate access to such information, there is already a net work of 100 'Euroadvisers' across the Community, with a further 120 to be trained in 1993. By September 1993, Euroadvisers will be linked together by an electronic mail system, as well as having access to information databases. Computerized exchange job vacancies will become a reality in April 1994. \u2022 LEDA Local employment development action Now in its third phase (1993-96), this action-research program me was launched in 1986 to identify successful strategies in com bating unemployment through exploiting local development potential, to disseminate this information throughout the Com munity, and to offer support in the form of advice and technical assistance. Both Commission experts and locally-active partici pants contribute to the development of the programme. LEDA's annual budget is ECU 2 million. \u2022 Integration or reintegration of offenders In 1993 ECU 1.5 million has been allocated for support of deve lopment work on integrating or reintegrating offenders into the labour market.

        "ANNEX V EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY READAPTATION AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF IRON AND STEEL POLICIES Article 56 of the ECSC Treaty provides the legal basis for the granting of ECSC readaptation aid and establishes the interven tion provisions, namely allowances for tideover payments and resettlement grants and the financing of vocational training. Aid is financed by a contribution from the two industries by means of an annual levy on production and is conditional upon the paym ent of a special contribution by the Member State. ECSC read aptation aid is provided under three forms: traditional aid, the social 'volet' and the Rechar programme. \u2022 Traditional aid This is granted to workers in both the coal and steel sectors and is calculated solely on the basis of the bilateral convention. The five standard social accompanying measures financed by ECSC readaptation aid are early retirement, unemployment, internal transfer, external redeployment and vocational training. The bud get for traditional aid for 1992 was ECU 170 million. \u2022 The social 'volet' This provides supplementary provisions of aid for workers spe cifically engaged in the steel industry. The 1992 budget was ECU 53 million. From the period 1993-95 onwards, social 'volet' aid will provide financial assistance for unemployment as well as the early retirement and redeployment measures of the last pro gramme. It is proposed to set average ceilings for assistance at ECU 5 000 for early retirement, ECU 4 000 for redeployment and ECU 2 000 for unemployment. EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES \u2022 Third programme on equal opportunities The third medium-term Community action programme on equal opportunities for women and men (1991-95) has as its goal the creation of circumstances in which women can participate fully in the labour market and maximize their contribution to economic and social life. It has three basic aims: to improve the imple mentation of existing legal provisions; to promote the integrati on of women in the labour market; and to improve the status of women in society. The Member States are asked to achieve the fol lowing objectives: raise the level of awareness about legal rights and obligations; develop specific measures for equal opportuni ties for women and men, and promote women's entrepreneurs- hip and LEIs; improve the quality of women's employment by maximizing their potential; reduce barriers to women's access to, and participation in, employment by reconciling the family and occupational responsibilities of women and men; develop innovatory programmes presenting a complete, realistic picture of women in society; encourage measures designed to promote the participation of women in the decision-making process in public, economic and social life. \u2022 LEI Local employment initiatives for women Originating in 1984, LEI provides financial aid for the creation by women of initiatives such as cooperatives and SMEs which crea te at least two full-time jobs for women. As well as such grants, information and advice is also provided in cooperation with local and national institutions, women's groups, chambers of com merce and local and regional development agencies. A European network has been set up to provide help to initiatives for women in the employment field. \u2022 Rechar This brings together finance from the Structural Funds and other financial instruments (ERDF, ESF, EIB, ECSC) to help the eco nomic conversion of those coal-mining areas worst affected by industrial decline. Under Rechar (presently 1990-93) the ECSC provides readaptation aid towards four measures: early retire ment, 'traditional' vocational training, pre-training and rede ployment. Rechar's 1992 budget was ECU 50 million. \u2022 IRIS European network of vocational training projects for women With a coordination office in Brussels and a network of over 450 projects throughout the Community, IRIS provides a network of innovative experiences in the field of vocational training for women in order to facilitate their access to jobs of the future or where women are under-represented. Six other networks are made up of representatives and/or experts from Member States: 104 ",
        "ANNEX V \u2022 Network on the application of the equality directives This identifies specific problems such as burden of proof, indirect discrimination, the notion of equal value, etc. Is also preparing a legal encyclopaedia which brings together national and Com munity jurisprudence and law concerning equal opportunities for men and women. SOCIAL SECURITY, SOCIAL PROTEC TION AND LIVING CONDITIONS SOCIAL SECURITY AND SOCIAL ACTION PROGRAMMES \u2022 Network on the position of women in the labour market This aims to analyse the obstacles, problems and challenges con fronting women in the area of employment. The third action pro gramme on equal opportunities has identified three main areas of research: the participation of women in the labour market; the value of women's work and, in general, the quality of their employment; the identification of obstacles to the integration of women in the labour market and, in particular, the division of work and family life. \u2022 Missoc Mutual information system on social protection in the Member States of the Community The Missoc network relating to social protection in the Commu nity was launched in 1990 to promote exchanges of information on social protection systems and policies in Member States. It is composed of government experts who produce regular tables of statistics accompanied by an annual analysis of trends and deve lopments in the field of social security. \u2022 Network on women in decision-making This aims to encourage women's participation in decision-making at all levels, one of the two action 'volets' to improve the status of women in society. \u2022 Steering Committee for Equal Opportunities in Broadcasting Since 1986 the Committee has worked to promote women's employment in television and radio throughout the Community because of the influence of the media industry on public opinion. \u2022 Network on child care and other measures to reconcile work and family responsibilities Responsible for bringing together and evaluating information on child-care services, and for making people aware of the importance of child care and other measures to reconcile work and family responsibilities. \u2022 Working group for equal opportunities at school Has several goals, including the diversification of choice of pro fession amongst boys and girls at school and the removal of ste reotypes present in teaching material. \u2022 Poverty III A medium-term Community action programme concerning the social and economic integration of the socially and economical ly less-privileged groups in society Poverty III (1989-94) aims to produce pilot projects involving preventive and corrective measures to combat social exclusion in Europe. Funding is given to such projects, to innovatory mea sures designed to develop original ways of providing assistance, and to studies of and research into marginalization processes. Information is disseminated through monthly information let ters, the Magazine, and an annual report and a directory of projects. The programme is run by DG V with the assistance of a central management and organization unit, a network of nine research and development units covering all Member States, and an Advi sory committee composed of national government representati ves. \u2022 The European Observatory of National Family Policies Set up in 1989, the Observatory is composed of 12 independent experts, each specializing in a particular field (e.g. sociologists, lawyers) who, on the basis ofinformation collected, submit natio nal reports on family policy developments. From these reports an annual report is compiled providing an analysis of trends and developments. Comparative tables on specific themes are also drawn up. 105 ",
        "ANNEX V \u2022 Observatory on National Policies to Combat Social Exclusion Created in 1990, the Observatory is charged with studying the efforts of the public authorities within each Member State to com bat exclusion: the efforts which they make themselves and those which they delegate to non-governmental institutions. It produces an annual report, prepared by the members of the Observatory (an independent expert from each Member State), which collects, analyses and presents quantitative and qualitative information on social exclusion. The 1991 report examined sectoral policies (health, living conditions, training, education, employment, etc.) and general policies conducted in the field of social exclusion. FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND MIGRATION POLICY The unit runs a budget of ECU 7 million to promote the integra tion of migrants, under which some 400 projects submitted by NGOs (e.g. building reception centres and housing for migrants, providing specialist social services, financing anti-racism activi ties, etc.) are funded. \u2022 RIMET - Information network on immigration from third countries \u2022 Observatory on Ageing and Older People The Observatory was established in 1991 to analyse the impact of social and economic policies on older people throughout the Euro pean Community, concentrating on four principal areas: living standards and way of life, employment and the labour market, health and social care, and the social integration of older people in both formal and informal settings. The Observatory compri ses a network of 12 scientific experts, one from each Member State, who collect and analyse extant national data, including official statistics, policy documents, legislation and parliamen tary reports, following guidelines established by the coordinati on team. This team is then responsible for synthesizing the infor mation provided in the national reports and preparing an over view. The first report of June 1991 has been followed by two during 1992. \u2022 Community actions for the elderly This three-year action programme (1991-93) proposes measures to be taken at European level to increase awareness of and sup plement efforts at national level to help older people. No legis lation is proposed, but exchanges of information and experience and the transfer of know-how and initiatives are encouraged. The Programme has a budget of ECU 13 million spread over the three years and culminates in 1993 with the European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations. Studies and analy ses have been carried out on the question of ageing and its soci al and economic repercussions, and awareness-raising campaig ns have been mounted. In implementing this programme, the Commission is assisted by three specialized bodies: the Member States are represented within the Advisory Committee; the Obser vatory on Ageing and Older People; and the Liaison Group which comprises the European non-governmental organizations EURAG, Eurolink Age, FERPA and FIAPA. (R\u00e9seau d'information sur les migrations des \u00c9tats tiers) Basic information necessary for doser cooperation as regards national immigration policies is collected through independent experts who report twice a year on new policy undertakings and trends in the Member States as regards immigration and integra tion of third country nationals. \u2022 Network on free movement Reports on the EC free movement of Community workers; mem bers of this network (one national expert for each Member State) produce a report and meet yearly. The purpose of these reports is to assist the Commission in its task of monitoring the transpo sition and implementation of Community legislation, both by national courts and, especially, by local, regional or national auth orities. The experts may be requested to provide information on specific points whenever the Commission needs it urgently (par liamentary petition or question). \u2022 Elaine European local authorities information network on ethnic mino rities The first contact migrants usually have with a host country is not with the central governmental but with city authorities. Therefo re, this network sets up cooperation and information exchange between local authorities dealing with migrants at practical levels. The Commission provides core funding of ECU 250 000, which is complemented by member city contributions. 106 ",
        "ANNEX V SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS \u2022 Compendium of Community Provisions on Social Security This is updated and published by the unit every two or three years. The Compendium is sent to specific representatives on certain committees and is also on sale to the general public. It provides details of regulations, information on court cases, etc. MEASURES FOR THE DISABLED \u2022 Helios II Handicapped people in the European Community living inde pendently in an open society The second Helios programme (1992-96) concerning people with disabilities aims to continue, extend and expand the activities of the first programme: exchange of information and experience; conferences, seminars, working groups, study visits and training courses; provision of practical information on technical aids for disabled people using the Handynet computerized database; sup port for participation of disabled people in Community pro grammes and inititatives relating to training, new technologies, youth mobility and exchanges.

With respect to cancer prevention, in addition to continuing legislative action, the strategy is designed to support and implement measures to enhance public awareness at European and national level. The programme is implemented by the Commission, in close coordination with the competent authorities in the Member Sta tes and with the assistance of an advisory committee. The Com munity contribution amounts to ECU 50 million. most urgent measures and specifying the most appropriate infor mation to be provided by the Member States. Five priority areas and accompanying actions were chosen for 1992-93: primary and secondary prevention and rehabilitation (support for pilot projects under a local initiative framework; studies and promotion of types of treatment and of rehabilitati on); information (analysis of campaigns, exchange of informa tion and experience concerning information of the general public; promotion of different methods of informing drug addicts; eva luation of the awareness and knowledge of the general public and the target audience); education (exchanges of information and experience and pilot projects to promote youth health edu cation at school, in the community and within the family); voca tional training and best practices; research and coordination (gat hering of statistics; identification of problems of analysis; coor dination with other actions and policies concerning drug-rela ted issues). SAFETY AT WORK Europe against AIDS Following a Council Decision adopted in 1991, the action pro gramme Europe against AIDS was launched to run from 1991 to 1993 with the assistance of an advisory committee com posed of representatives of Member States and chaired by the representative of the Commission. The Committee's duties inclu de the examination of projects and measures involving cofinan- cing from public funds and the coordination, at national level, of projects partly financed by NGOs. The programme concentrates on four main areas in the field of AIDS prevention: the promoti on of information, health education, research and international cooperation.
