        "Norway The challenge of structural change for a more knowledge-intensive and sustainable economy Summary: P erformance in research, innovation and competitiveness The indicators in the table below present a synthesis of research, innovation and competitiveness in Norway. They relate knowledge investment and input to performance or economic output throughout the innovation cycle. They show thematic strengths in key technologies and also the high-tech and medium-tech contribution to the trade balance. The table includes a new index on excellence in science and technology which takes into consideration the quality of scientific production as well as technological development. The indicator on knowledge-intensity of the economy is an index on structural change that focuses on the sectoral composition and specialisation of the economy and shows the evolution of the weight of knowledge-intensive sectors and products and services. Investment and Input Performance/economic output Research R&D intensity 2011: 1.70% (EU: 2.03%; US: 2.75%) 2000-2011 * : +0.66% (EU: +0.8%; US: +0.2%) Excellence in S&T 2010: 51.77 (EU:47.86; US: 56.68) 2005-2010: +11.61% (EU: +3.09%;US: +0.53) Innovation and Structural change Index of economic impact of innovation 2010-2011: 0.433 (EU: 0.612) Knowledge-intensity of the economy 2010: 39.99 (EU:48.75; US: 56.25) 2000-2010: +2.22% (EU: +0.93%; US: +0.5%) Competitiveness Hot-spots in key technologies Energy, Environment, Food, agriculture and fisheries, Other transport technology HT + MT contribution to the trade balance 2011: -17.38% (EU ** : 4.2%; US: 1.93%) 2000-2011 *** : n.a. (EU ** : +4.99%; US:-10.75%) * The growth rate for Norway refers to the period 2001-2011. ** The EU value is the weighted average of the trade balance of the Member States. *** For the period 2000-2011 there are no data available to provide the annual growth rate. The negative values for this period indicates a structural deficit for the industry for the country. Norway has the second highest GDP per inhabitant in Europe, with the high GDP partly explaining the low R&D intensity level. The Norwegian economy is mainly based on traditional industrial activities related to the extraction of raw materials and natural resources (petroleum and natural gas, fish) and to their industrial processing into bulk products and semi-finished goods. These industries are less R&D intensive than industries such as pharmaceuticals and ICT, which partly explains why Norway's R&D intensity level was only 1.70% (in 2011), a lower value than the EU average of 2.03% and also lower than the R&D intensity of the United States (2.75% in 2011). Norway's R&D intensity has fluctuated over the period 2001-2011 reaching a high of 1.78% in 2009 and a low of 1.48% in 2006 and with an average annual growth rate of 0.7% (a little lower then EU growth rate). Norway has a higher level of S&T excellence and a higher growth rate for S&T excellence than the EU average. Norway is below the EU average in terms of the knowledge-intensity of its economy. Norway performs moderately on all indicators related to structural change (not visible in the table above). As part of the structural change, internationalization has become an overall priority of the government's R&I policy in the last years and the new internationalization strategy states that all activities of the RCN 1 must include clearly defined objectives and plans for international co-operation. Moreover, in terms of funding, there is a shift from instruments dedicated to internationalization towards including the internationalization dimension in all activities. The low-tech nature of the Norway's economy is reflected also in the negative contribution to the trade balance of high-tech (HT) and medium-tech (MT) products, with imports much higher than exports for the last 11 years. There are no signs that this characteristic of the Norwegian economy will change in the coming years. 1 Research Council of Norway ",
        "2 Investing in knowledge Source: DG Research and Innovation - Economic Analysis Unit Data: DG Research and Innovation, Eurostat Notes: (1) The R&D intensity projections based on trends are derived from the average annual growth in R&D intensity for 2000-2011.in the the case of the EU and for 2001-2011 in the case of Norway. (2) EU: This projection is based on the R&D intensity target of 3.0% for 2020. (3) NO: An R&D intensity target for 2020 is not available.

This is due to the particular nature of Norway's economy which is characterised by traditional industrial activities related to the extraction and processing of natural resources. In recent years, Norwegian policy makers have increasingly recognized that the low level of industrial R&D should be seen against the backdrop of the country's industrial structure. Although Norway's R&D intensity has fluctuated over the last decade, the average annual growth rate of its R&D intensity is close to that of the EU as a whole. If Norway's R&D intensity continues to grow at the same average annual growth rate, the R&D intensity value attained by Norway in 2020 will still be below the EU value and, in fact will be lower than 2%. Over the last decade, total expenditure on R&D (GERD) in Norway has increased in real terms at an average annual growth rate of 2.1% while the corresponding growth rate for business expenditure on R&D (BERD) was 0.4%. The business enterprise sector accounts for 51% of Norwegian R&D and a large share of it is performed by SMEs. Norway's business R&D intensity of 0.86% in 2011 is much lower than the EU value of 1.26% and is far below the level of the other Nordic countries all of which have values higher than 2%. It is important to mention that the value excludes indirect support for R&D such as R&D tax credits which is the largest R&D support scheme for business in Norway. The country is therefore an outlier with regard to innovation, with a low-tech but very knowledge-intensive industry sector based on raw materials. This is reflected in the increasing share of SMEs introducing product or process innovations (1.1% growth over the period 2004-2010). On the other hand, the share of knowledge-intensive services exports in total service exports has grown at an average annual rate of 1.6% over the period 2004-2009. The EU Framework Programmes are the most important international research programmes in which Norway participates. Norwegian researchers have participated in EU FPs since 1987. In FP7, Norway's participant success rate was 24.64%. The successful participants received a total EC financial contribution of \u20ac 563 million. ",
        "3 An effective research and innovation system building on the European Research Area The graph below illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of the Norwegian innovation system. Reading clockwise, it provides information on human resources, scientific production, technology valorisation and innovation. Average annual growth rates from 2000 to the latest available year are given in brackets.

Overall, the Norwegian R&I system's relative strengths are in human resources, public-private cooperation, an attractive research system, financing and entrepreneurship (the latter two dimensions are not shown on the above graph). In the last decade, venture capital, an important financial tool for the business sector, has increased to 0.21% of GDP in 2011, with an average annual growth rate of 2.4%. In particular, the business sector is supported through a number of specific programs for seed venture capital whereby state venture capital is provided as a loan with a risk relief element. Areas of relative weakness are private sector investment, patenting levels and business innovations. The main structural challenges faced by the Norwegian innovation system are a relatively low level of science and engineering graduates, the need to increase industrial R&D and the need to increase innovation in firms. The main program for R&D grants to business is an open research arena for quality projects without thematic restrictions. There has been a shift from indirect to direct support for business R&D and innovation. The Norwegian innovation system is adapted to knowledge-intensive industry supplemented by a strong service sector. Norway's innovation system is dominated by knowledge-intensive enterprises that rely on collaborative learning. Two other types of enterprise complete the system: enterprises operating with little knowledge accumulation, and small R&D-intensive enterprises that rely on collaborative learning and operate within global innovative networks. Norway's share of employment in knowledge-intensive activities is higher than the EU average but lower than its reference group of countries as shown on the above graph. ",
        "4 Norway's scientific strengths The maps below illustrate four key science areas where Norway has real strengths in a European context. The maps are based on the number of scientific publications produced by authors and inventors based in the regions. Energy (Scientific production) Environment (Scientific production) Food, Agriculture and Fisheries (Scientific production) Other Transport Technologies (Scientific production) Norway's scientific production shows good results in the fields of energy, environment, food, agriculture and fisheries, and other transport technology 2 . Scientific activity is closely related to Norway\u2019s R&D strategies and takes into account the need to meet global challenges. It focuses particularly on environment, climate change, oceans, food safety and energy research. 2 Railway vehicles (including hover trains) and associated equipment; aircraft and associated equipment; spacecraft (including satellites) and spacecraft launch vehicles; parts thereof; ships, boats (including hovercraft) and floating structures (SITC Rev.4).

        "5 Economic impact of innovation The index below is a summary index of the economic impact of innovation composed of five of the Innovation Union Scoreboard's indicators 3 . Source: DG Research and Innovation - Economic Analysis Unit (2013) Data: Innovation Union Scoreboard 2013, Eurostat Note: (1) Based on underlying data for 2009, 2010 and 2011. 0.433 0.612 0.552 0.000 0.100 0.200 0.300 0.400 0.500 0.600 0.700 Norway EU Reference Group (IE+LU+NL+IS+NO) Norway - Index of economic impact of innovation (1) The situation of Norway's on this index as well as its score on each of its components reflects the specificities of its economic and trade structure. Despites scores higher than EU average on the employment in knowledge-intensive sectors and in the share of knowledge-intensive services export in total services export, the overall result is strongly influenced by the negative contribution of high-tech and medium-tech exports to the trade balance. Although innovation performance refers to more than technology-driven innovation, it is to be noted that Norway has a number of policy measures the objective of which is to support R&D in companies. Overall public support for industrial R&D is relatively high in Norway, and the mix of instruments has remained largely stable for at least a decade. The most significant innovation policy developments in Norway since mid- 2009 concern the follow up and implementation of the priorities outlined in the innovation White Paper. The objectives of innovation policy were to foster sustainable value creation, secure future job opportunities and protect welfare in order to respond to increasingly globalised challenges. The competitiveness of trade and industry is dependent on increased research activity in selected service, technology and industrial areas - industrial sectors that could replace the loss in value-creation that will occur when oil and gas production declines. Human resources are an important asset for innovation, value creation and growth and are essential for future growth in new knowledge-intensive sectors. In order to further improve the quality and capacity of Norway's R&I system, research activity must promote the development of a more knowledge-intensive trade and industrial sector that invests in its own research and development, boosts expertise within the companies and enhances the ability of companies to make use of research conducted by others. Environmental technologies or eco-innovations are an emerging and important field in Norwegian innovation policy. In June 2011, the government published a strategy for environmental technologies that describes the measures that the government intends to implement in order to create favourable conditions for the development of internationally competitive industries and markets for environmental technologies. 3 See Methodological note for the composition of this index.

        "6 Upgrading the manufacturing sector through research and technologies The graph below illustrates the upgrading of knowledge in different manufacturing industries. The position on the horizontal axis illustrates the changing weight of each industry sector in value added over the period. The general trend to the left-hand side reflects the decrease of manufacturing in the overall economy. The sectors above the x-axis are sectors whose research intensity has increased over time. The size of the bubble represents the share of the sector (in value added) in manufacturing (for all sectors presented on the graph). The red-coloured sectors are high-tech or medium-high-tech sectors. Source: DG Research and Innovation - Economic Analysis unit Data: OECD Notes: (1) High-Tech and Medium-High-Tech sectors are shown in red. 'Chemicals, chemical products, rubber, plastics, fuel products' and 'Other transport equipment' include High-Tech, Medium-High-Tech and Medium-Low-Tech, (2) 'Electrical equipment', 'Motor vehicles'', 'Other manufacturing', 'Other transport equipment': 1995-2007; 'Recycling': 1996-2007.

Very few sectors have increased their R&D intensities and manufacturing in general has less weight in the overall economy. Most of the sectors are grouped near the axes intersection point, meaning that small variations in levels of R&D intensity are usually accompanied by small or no variations in shares of value added. There are some exceptions. In sectors such as basic metals, motor vehicles and pulp, paper and paper products, business R&D intensity has increased significantly although the share of value added is decreasing. Recycling is the only sector where a small increase in R&D intensity has been accompanied a significant increase in its share of value added, however, this sector is one of the smallest in the economy. Over recent years, R&D policies and innovation strategies have been developed to focus on specific and representative areas of Norway's economy. These include the strategies for oil and gas, energy, climate, green growth, biotechnologies, nano-technologies and the maritime sector. At national level, there has been a broad political consensus on the need to foster more R&D intensive, knowledge- intensive manufacturing industries and services, exploiting both renewable and non-renewable energy technologies 4 . Therefore, green growth and environmental issues continue to develop as key areas for Science, Technology and Industry (STI), alongside prioritised technology fields such as bio- and nano- technology and ICT. 4 Report on Science & Technology Indicators for Norway by the Research Council of Norway 2011 ",
        "7 Competitiveness in global demand and markets Investment in knowledge, technology-intensive clusters, innovation and the upgrading of the manufacturing sector are determinants of a country's competitiveness in global export markets. A positive contribution of high-tech and medium-tech products to the trade balance is an indication of specialisation and competitiveness in these products.

For each year over the same period imports of high-tech (HT) and medium- tech (MT) products exceeded exports. The share of HT and MT imports in total HT and MT trade was lower in 2011 (70%) than in 2000 (72%). Over the period 2000-2011 some HT and MT products have increased their contributions to the trade balance (left side of the graph). The most significant increases were in other transport equipment 5 and office machines. The product with the biggest decrease in its contribution to the trade balance over 2000-2011 is road vehicles. Norway's total factor productivity grew between 2000 and 2005 but then declined to reach a level in 2012 that is lower than the level in 2000. This type of evolution is not unusual due to the fact that the petroleum sector, a large part of Norway's economy, depends on physical oil production which is directly related to the characteristics of the actual reservoirs. As a result, production at a new well will rise for several years and then fall for even longer periods affecting the total factor productivity of the country. Norway's employment rate decreased slightly from 80.3% in 2000 to 79.6% in 2011 but remains much higher than the EU average of 68.6%. The share of population at risk of poverty or social exclusion has decreased by 1.1 percentage points between 2004 and 2011 to reach 14.6%. Norway is the European country with the highest share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption. Its share of 61.1% in 2010 is five times higher than the EU average. Greenhouse gas emissions in Norway have decreased over the last decade but are still significantly higher than the EU average. It is also noteworthy that in 2008 patents in environment-related technologies were at a considerably lower level than the EU average with only a slight increase since 2000. The level of patent applications in health-related technologies has decreased significantly between 2000 and 2008. 5 idem 3 ",
