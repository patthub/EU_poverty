        "N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 3 T he newsreader on the main evening news on Belgium\u2019s leading French-speaking tel- evision station warned viewers, on 2 August, of the upsetting nature of the images to follow. They were of children torn from the arms of their mothers who were trampled underfoot, of a pregnant woman being dragged down the street. Most shocking of all, a woman with a child tied to her back being pulled along by her feet with the full weight of her body resting on the baby. These were homeless Africans, mostly women and children, being evicted by police from a squat in a Paris suburb. It was amateur footage shot on 21 July that had caused a buzz on the Internet before being broadcast by TV stations worldwide, including CNN and the BBC. An African immigrant must respect the law and the police must enforce it. But in reply to a journalist\u2019s question concerning a touching case in which a young female teacher committed suicide after being relentlessly pursued by the courts for misconduct with no victim, one French President, George Pompidou at the time (1969) distanced himself from the force of the law and replied by reciting lines by the poet Paul Eluard: \u201cUnderstand it if you will. Me, my remorse was the reasonable victim, with the gaze of a lost child, she who resembled the dead, who died so as to be loved\u201d. A comment that is valid in other circumstances too. A few days before this brutal eviction it was images of the starving children of Niger, wracked by hunger, which moved the world. In the past two years the inter- national press has also sounded the alarm about the worsening food situation in Ethiopia and the spectre of a famine as dreadful as it was in 1984. Yet we have also seen the publication of Mathias L\u00e9ridon\u2019s \u201cAfrica you are doing well\u201d * just as The Courier was preparing this issue\u2019s dossier on Africa\u2019s place in the world economy. This work calls to mind the audacity of the publication, in 1973, of \u201cWhen China wakes\u2026 it will shake the world\u201d by the French essayist, diplomat and politician Alain Peyrefitte at a time when this country seemed to be plunged into depression. A perspicacity which can only fully be appreciated today. The Courier knows of many international organisations and experts that agree with L\u00e9ridon. Whether it is the International Monetary Fund applauding Africa\u2019s per- formance in resisting the financial crisis thanks to its healthy and solid financial bases or the European Investment Bank playing the card of the continent\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises and, above all, stressing to European entrepreneurs that it is the place to invest. Or the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and UN Millennium Campaign that place 11 African nations among the 20 leading developing countries for their success in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the subject of a special supplement enclosed with this issue of the magazine. The image conveyed by South Africa\u2019s faultless organisation of the World Cup, refuting the doomsayers, couldn\u2019t be more positive for Africa. The image is completely changing and becoming an image that perhaps, in 20 or 30 years\u2019 time, will replace those which today have upset television viewers. It is no more than a bet. But one on which a growing number of experts are putting their money. * Matthias Leridon \"L'Afrique va bien\", Ed.

        "EU still committed to the target of 0.7 of GNI to development aid by 2015 Interview with Fokion Fotiadis, Director General, DG Development and Relations with ACP States Hegel Goutier Y ou have significant experience deal- ing with external relations. In your previous job you also had to deal with the ACP countries. How will this experience benefit you in the new post and what are the immediate tasks that you have marked in your \u2018To Do List\u2019? I have spent the longest part of my career at the European Commission working in the External Relations DG. I have worked with countries ranging from our close neighbours in Eastern Europe to Central Asia and the Middle East. Even the EU maritime and fisher- ies policy has a significant international dimension. Let me give you just one example \u2013 Mauritania, the EU financial support pack- age for the fisheries sector is even larger than the develop- ment aid from the European Commission to that country. There is a new Commissioner responsi- ble for development policy since the beginning of the year. I am taking up the new post just a couple of months ahead of the creation of the European External Action Service. Institutional change is all around us, but people should not expect a slow start from me. Several important events are planned for this autumn \u2013 the UN High Level Meeting on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the EU \u2013 Africa Summit, as well as a number of policy documents which are already being prepared. Let's not forget that there are only five years left to achieve the MDGs. It is time to prepare already now for the period after 2015 \u2013 what will be our new strategic goals for the rest of the decade? We will have a challenging Autumn and interesting years ahead of us in development policy. We will have a challenging Autumn and interesting years ahead of us in development policy One of the EU\u2019s priori- ties is achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Many European countries are lagging behind on their commit- ment to attain spending of 0.7 per cent of GNI (Gross National Income) by 2015, citing economic and financial difficulties. Do you think they will be able to make up the lost ground and are further EU commitments required? The European Union is fully committed to helping developing countries achieve the MDGs. I am confident that the target of 0.7 per cent of GNI can be reached by 2015. EU leaders have confirmed this target at the European Council on 17 June. Of course, it will be a real challenge, especially in the current atmosphere of budget austerity measures imposed by many Member States. Increasing Official Development Assistance (ODA) is an issue of politi- cal choice, and we have seen that a number of Member States have been able to increase their aid in 2009 and 2010 despite the eco- nomic downturn in Europe. To monitor the progress of reaching the ODA targets, the Council has agreed to report on this question annually. We see that there are several EU countries that have made their ODA targets binding and they are actu- ally succeeding in reaching them. There is no binding EU legislation on how each Member State has to arrive at their ODA target, but I can promise that we will continue working closely with them to make the 0.7 per cent figure a reality by 2015. What outcome are you hoping for from the UN\u2019s High Level Meeting on MDGs in September? The European Commission presented its so called \u201812- 4 Profile \u00a9 EC On 1 July 2010 Fokion Fotiadis took up his new job as Director General of DG DEV, the DG responsible for development policy and relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific States. After leading the Commission's Maritime Affairs and Fisheries DG for three years, he now heads a service that is facing a very challenging political agenda. The Courier magazine talked with Mr Fotiadis a few weeks after taking up his new post. ",
        "point Action Plan\u2019 in support of MDGs on 21 April 2010, which paved the way for the EU to come to New York with a strong and substantial political message agreed in the Foreign Affairs Council in June. Later the European Council reaffirmed the EU's determination to support the achievement of the MDGs. We are determined to make the MDG Summit in September a success. More precisely, the EU wants to make a real step forward in terms of aid effectiveness, notably by better coordinat- ing our spending, focusing on high impact aid and improving the coherence of other EU policies with devel- opment objectives. We must ensure that the High Level Meeting is a stepping stone in this direction with strong political engagement from all stakeholders. Many analysts say devel- oping countries have managed to keep their heads above water during the recent financial crisis, notably Africa. Do you feel that the continent is poised to become the new emerging bloc? African economies have been hit hard by the crisis. However, it is true that Africa proved to be more resilient to the crisis than other parts of the world and several African countries increased prosperity (GDP per capita) in 2009. The recently released African Economic Outlook 2010 predicts real GDP growth averaged across the conti- nent in the range of 4-5 per cent in 2010 and 2011. The European Commission is proud to have contributed to this over the last two years using the Vulnerability FLEX mechanism to assist the countries worst affected by the crises. Increasing ODA is an issue of political choice Therefore, I see some posi- tive signs for Africa\u2019s future and Africa\u2019s potential to become the new emerging continent. However, there are still some significant challenges ahead for the continent. The constraints to Africa's growth include poor infrastructure and low levels of human capi- tal. The drivers of growth are still trade-related and African trade suffers from weak diversification both in terms of sectors, still rely- ing mainly on commodities and raw materials, and in terms of markets of destina- tion. Attracting investment into diversified and higher value-added sectors remains a challenge for the continent. From the perspective of the EU, it is therefore of utmost importance that we design our development policy as a catalyst to boost growth and to accompany Africa in its development effort. In the past, you have also worked on EU relations with China and other Asian countries. Do you feel that the time is ripe for Africa-EU-China trian- gular relations or should bi-lateral policies prevail; Africa-EU and Africa- China? It is important that donor countries cooperate, under the coordination of the recipient country authorities. This is a large part of what we mean by 'aid effective- ness'. But it is not enough to do this among traditional donors. Emerging donors become more and more important and we need to engage in a constructive cooperation with them. China is a significant devel- opment partner of Africa. There is no doubt that a triangular cooperation will be helpful at a certain point. But your question is about timing, whether the time is ripe. This requires the will of all three parties. The Commission made this clear in 2008 when adopting its Communication entitled \u2018The EU, Africa and China: towards trilateral dialogue and cooperation\u2019. The Chinese authorities have expressed their openness to the approach, provided of course that African partners also want it. At global level, the G20 offers a unique platform to foster interna- tional cooperation. As the need becomes greater, we are already seeing African interest in concrete cases. In my view, this interest is set to grow. N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 5 Road in Uganda. \u00a9 Reporters ",
        "6 C urier The More attention to humanitarian needs and constraints of resources To the point Kristalina Georgieva, a Bulgarian citizen, was recently appointed EU Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response. The rapidity with which her initial emergency package was delivered in the wake of the earth- quake in Haiti did not go unnoticed. She has already developed a reputation for communicating in a direct and heartfelt manner. Interview by Hegel Goutier HG - You are the first Commissioner to hold the humanitarian aid and crisis response portfolio and at the same time have responsibility for international cooperation. Is there a correlation? KG - The Commission decided to set up this new portfolio because of the unfor- tunate increase in the frequency, intensity and impact of disasters. People are suf- fering either from natural or man-made actions; from wars and conflicts. This new portfolio combines two main objectives: one is to bring attention to humanitarian needs and suffering people and to ensure that the EU deploys resources in the most effective ways possible where they are more needed; the second is to bring a more coordinated and more efficient, coherent Kristalina Georgieva, speaking with a logistics manager in Haiti, after the violent earthquake struck the island. \u00a9 EC ",
        "7 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 and visible EU response to disasters. This is because when needs are growing and EU member countries are burdened by the impact of the economic and financial crisis, their budgets are constrained. I also have in my title the words \u2018interna- tional cooperation\u2019 because humanitarian assistance and crisis responses are the best way to deploy the EU\u2019s most pre- cious value of solidar- ity. Solidarity means reaching other coun- tries and more proac- tively engaging them to cope with natural disasters. Every year we disburse around \u20ac1bn of humanitarian aid. Although this is a lot of money it is not that much, given the needs around the world that are crying out. For example, we know that there is once more a danger of famine in the Sahel. We have committed \u20ac30M for the Sahel and are working on almost doubling this money very quickly. In the case of Haiti, when the earthquake struck the country, working with local partners we disbursed an immediate \u20ac8M in humanitarian assistance followed by another \u20ac30M. Less than two months later, I went to Haiti and we increased this by \u20ac120M in humanitarian assistance. Does the frontier between development assistance and humanitarian aid not appear to be unclear sometimes? In the vast majority of cases we build continuity between relief, rehabilitation and development. If we have a situation where there is debate on policies between an individual country that we are assisting and the European Commission, we will provide humanitarian aid if needed, but in such a case there may be less scope for other forms of engagement. In these cases, the distinction between humanitar- ian aid and devel- opment aid may be more profound, but these cases are more the exception than the rule. For instance, in Haiti, of course, we are striving to make sure that humanitarian aid helps development and development meets humanitarian needs. With our partners, the World Food Programme, we are trying to get as much food as possible procured locally, either in Haiti or in the Dominican Republic or other countries in the region. Why? Because by doing that we provide an incentive, we help the agricultural sector in Haiti, and then we try to make sure that this help follows the people and is not artificially concen- trated in one place, say Port-au-Prince. We have used humanitarian assistance cash for work programmes because we want to encourage young people to work and mobilise them to clean and build houses or set up tents. Support for job cre- ation is a long-term sustainable objective. But the cultivation of rice in Haiti has historically perished because of over- seas imports. Not with my money. For this reason, on 31 March, the very day of the New York conference for Haiti, we asked all our part- ners first to seek local purchases and only if local products were exhausted could they import food from elsewhere. You spoke about work for food; did you ask European NGOs to employ competent local experts in Haiti or elsewhere instead of engaging only foreign staff? What we do not want to see is a paral- lel economy of development assistance partners in Haiti with two worlds; one of expatriates and another of Haitians. What we do want to see is the building of as much capacity as possible as quickly as possible and topping up capacity that already exists. What impressed me more than anything else when I travelled to Haiti was the dignity of the Haitian people and the fact that they came out of this tremendous shock without experiencing any riots on the streets and in a way more willing to work together than they were prior to the earthquake. In the humanitarian field, we have around 200 partner organisations around the world and we always strive to ensure that these organisations are deeply grounded in the countries. Is EU humanitarian aid suffering from a lack of visibility compared to the US? Yes, there are two explanations. The first is that European peoples are modest. When the US says \u201cGreat, fantastic, fabu- lous\u201d, we in the EU we would say, \u201cNot too bad\u201d. This is a cultural difference. The second reason is the United States is a federal country. The EU is a union, not yet a federation. There are 27 independ- ent States, with 27 flags; they do not yet have the instinct to promote the European flag. During the conference on Haiti, for the first time, the European Union came with one very big number, almost \u20ac1.3bn. Afterwards, individual member states stood up and pointed out the amount they contributed to this number. I think we will see this happening more and more. We owe our citizens information about what we do, giving them pride in knowing that the EU is number one in the world for generosity. To the point Kristalina Georgieva \u00a9 Hegel Goutier What we do not want to see is a parallel economy of development assistance partners in Haiti with two worlds; one of expatriates and another of Haitians.

        "8 C urier The Election build-up Nigeria Round up Okeoma Ibe N igeria has had its fair share of misfortunes \u2013 colonial rule, military dictatorship and a dif- ficult transition to democracy. The 2011 general elections are cur- rently dominating the country\u2019s politi- cal discussions. Recent events suggest that the incumbent, President,Goodluck Jonathan, might be interested in contest- ing for the office he currently holds. In the build-up, Nigeria\u2019s legislative assemblies (federal and states) have voted to remove a provision of the 1999 Constitution which bars candidates indicted by administrative panels from contesting political offices. Indictment by an administrative panel of enquiry was one of the methods previ- ously employed to exclude politicians from participation in elections. Nomination is a party affair. Traditionally the ruling People\u2019s Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) alter- nates its presidential candidates between the north and south meaning that it would be the north\u2019s turn in 2011. This sched- ule now appears to have changed but President Jonathan, who originates in the south, has yet to spell out whether he will contest the election. Recent proposed changes to the constitution could mean that the elections could take place as early as January 2011. Civil society groups have already begun mobilising Nigerians to protect their mandates and ensure rigging does not rob them of their votes. Economic front On the economic front, Nigeria\u2019s growth has been impeded by inconsistency in economic and development planning. Unfortunately, Nigeria has not been lucky in getting successive governments to com- mit to the same eco- nomic priorities. The banking crisis of 2008/9 is a classic case. While the Chukwuma Soludo-led Central Bank supported a $US167M minimum share capital for banks, the current leader- ship thinks that banks must be categorised into small, medium and large. Similarly, the previous administration did not find any corporate governance issues with bank management while the current one sacked the management of five banks. In the aftermath of the crash in stock prices, the National Assembly recently passed a bill which established the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (Amcon) to \u2018soak up\u2019 toxic loans provided by banks to persons and institutions with the intention of bringing some stability into the stock market and by extension, the economy. \u201cThe establishment of Amcon is a reflec- tion of the government's commitment to safeguard the interests of depositors, creditors and other stakeholders in the Nigerian financial system, and in doing so rejuvenate the domestic economy\u201d, says President Jonathan. Falling crude prices owing in part to oil pipeline vandals and kidnapping in the Niger Delta have had a negative impact on oil revenue forecasts. Neglect of the area poses a graver danger as militants there are threatening to destabilise oil pro- duction until the government invests in making the region liveable for inhabitants. Neglect of the Niger Delta poses a danger Uneasy polity, unstable economy: Nigerian columnist, Okeoma Ibe, says these four words summarise the current political and economic situation in Nigeria ahead of the 2011 general elections.

        "9 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 The \u2018socially responsible\u2019 flower trade In South Africa, some flower growers have managed to gain a foothold in the much coveted African flower market, one still dominated by Kenya. But unlike most of its continental rivals, the Timbali company is investing in its workers, all of whom originate from poor rural com- munities. Marie-Martine Buckens \u201cT he initial idea was to offer people from underprivi- leged backgrounds the chance to participate in the economic mainstream\u201d, explains Mauritz Lombaard, one of the nine direc- tors of the Timbali technology incubator that lies just a few hundred metres from the administrative buildings of Nelspruit, the capital of Mpumalanga Province. The company is built on the \u2018cluster\u2019 model and is a grouping of several micro-companies. \u201cThe aim\u201d, continues Mr. Lombaard, \u201cis to share a common infrastructure, such as the water purification system, transport costs, supply and marketing. That way we achieve economies of scale that facilitate our access to the market\u201d. Timbali owns the infrastructures and the farmers who work there rent the services. \u201cIt is an incubation process\u201d, explains Lombaard. \u201cIn the first six months we look at whether the candidates are really ready to make the commitment. We then train them for two or three years before offering them places on manage- ment courses. After that, they are free to return to their land and produce under franchise. In that case they have access to production grants.\u201d The company is supported in its activities by the SEDA (Small Enterprise Development Agency) government agency, which helps small businesses, as well as by other institutions, including the European Union. In this way the Nelspruit incubator gives black people from poor communi- ties \u2013 \u201cmost of them can hardly read or write\u201d \u2013 the chance to acquire the skills to enter a South African agriculture sector in which farmers must face heavily subsi- dised competition, often poor soils and severely limited water resources. Wisdom At present Timbali markets mainly Gerbera. \u201cWith an annual production of 2 million flowers, we are without doubt Africa\u2019s biggest producer of this flower\u201d, adds Lombaard. The flowers are sold throughout the province and as far away as the rich province of Gauteng , while awaiting an opening on the much coveted export market. Unless the bosses are wise enough to look first to the conti- nental market, having witnessed just how hard the major Kenyan flower growers were hit when the volcanic eruption on Iceland grounded all air transport. But the company is thinking big. Around the greenhouses, thousands of lemon and other fruit trees have been planted and alongside these intensive plantations, two hectares are given over to biological market gardening, with pesticide-free production. Another potential market perhaps? The Gerbera in the Timbali greenhouses. \u00a9 Xavier.Rouchaud Round up The farmers must face heavily subsidised competitors, often poor soils and severely limited water resources South Africa ",
        "10 C urier The Round up Victoria Burbidge T he rise of this well-known leader of Tivoli Gardens \u2013 an inner- city community located in the West Kingston constituency, was in train since childhood when his father, Lester Lloyd Coke (Jim Brown) ruled the area. According to Claude Robinson, a Jamaican political analyst, Coke\u2019s widespread support stems from \u2018garrison politics\u2019, which was started in the late 1960s and 1970s by the two dominant political parties, the now ruling Jamaica Labour Party and the Opposition \u2013 the People\u2019s National Party. \u201cYou have to go back to the basic structures of garri- An analysis of the prominence of Christopher \u2018Dudus\u2019 Coke, now facing drugs and gun trafficking charges in the United States Christopher \u2018Dudus\u2019 Coke: Victimiser or benefactor? son communities and Tivoli Gardens has been described as the \u2018mother of all garrisons\u2019\u201d, he says. Robinson explains that these garrison communities operate as a law unto themselves, with their own \u201cjungle justice system\u201d. \u201cSince the breakup of the apparatus in Tivoli Gardens, we have seen reports in the press of torture chambers and other indications of a jungle justice system\u201d, he says of the community, which is repre- sented by the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Bruce Golding. \u201cThe dons and leadership operating in garrison communities have a capacity to inflict and use force and coercion to get their way among citizens and the evidence suggests that there is some form of jungle justice, there is a power of control and people are a victim of this authority\u201d, he adds. Coke, the benefactor But some residents of Tivoli Gardens have openly embraced the system, saying that Coke\u2019s presence in the community made them feel safe. Many residents demons- trated and barricaded the community after Prime Minister Golding gave the go ahead for Coke\u2019s extradition request by the United States to begin albeit months of delaying tactics.

S tefano Manservisi, former Director-General for Development at the European Commission and Co-chair of The Courier\u2019s Editorial Board, has been appointed Director General of the Commission's new Home Affairs Department where he took up his duties on 1 July. Before his appointment as Director- General of DG DEV in 2004, Stefano Manservisi had already spent 15 years working at the European Commission, including stints in the Development directorate-general and as Head of Cabinet to Romano Prodi, President of the European Commission from 1999 to 2004. With his long experience in dealing with development affairs and cooperation, Stefano Manservisi had become a familiar face to the ACP Group, almost a member of the family, who could be at ease and frank with his partners from the different ACP regions. His hard work lay behind the success of various papers, initiatives and events over the past five years. While implementing the policy established by the Member States and Development Commissioners, from the time he took up office as Director-General he launched major changes and modifications to make European development policy more effi- cient. Examples include strategy papers of the ACP countries and regions which placed greater emphasis on the decisions of beneficiary countries in aid programming. The European consensus on development in order to improve the coordination and harmonisation of the development policies of the European Union and its Member States is another example of an initiative to which Manservisi made a major con- tribution. Stefano Manservisi also attached great importance to the profile of the European Union\u2019s development policy and to public awareness in general. The energy he devoted to supporting events such as European Development Days, launched by Commissioner Louis Michel in 2006, contributed significantly to the success of this event. Goodbye to Stefano Manservisi, Co-chair of The Courier\u2019s Editorial Board Colombia\u2019s unemployment rate in 2002 was 18 per cent of the 49 million popula- tion, with approximately 60 per cent living in poverty. There was corruption among state officials, limited social services, poor representation, and drug lords filled the void created by these absences. \u201cBoth Colombia and Jamaica are sta- tes that are battling narco-trafficking and these drug lords. In recent times, Colombia has had some success in dealing with this\u201d, says Robinson pointing to the fall of Pablo Escobar. He adds: \u201cI don\u2019t know which road we are heading, I don\u2019t want to make any comparison with other countries\u2026 but certainly I will say that both countries are fighting these drug lords\u201d. He, however, argues that the dismantling of the criminal network in Jamaica will not happen overnight but will have to entail a concerted effort by the state. \u201cDo not offer them contracts, do not offer them support and perhaps I think that there is a possibility, a chance of the dismantling of the criminal networks in Tivoli Gardens\u201d, he says. \u201cIt is (also) possible that you can begin to dismantle other networks elsewhere.\u201d Robinson is, however, quick to point out that this will not happen with just one operation in one community but that it has to be a sustained effort by the states, the communities, private sector and everyone in Jamaica.

        "12 C urier The Solid economic foundations in the face of the crisis Dossier Sub-Saharan Africa is the region which has been least affected by the global financial crisis, owing to its relatively low degree of integration in the world economy, but fundamentally because of the favourable macroeconomic condition of the continent. The region was also quick to adapt its economic policies at the very start of the crisis, with a view to limiting shocks from the wider world, and this is without mentioning its social achievements and sectors of economic growth. Such is the broad conclusion of a recent report by the International Monetary Fund*. Hegel Goutier I n spite of the question mark in the title of the IMF report published in April 2010 (and revised in July 2010*), \u2018Sub-Saharan Africa: Back to High Growth?\u2019, it is relatively optimis- tic about the economic situation in the region and its trump cards for increased integration into the world economy. Like everywhere else in the world, growth fell in 2009, with an increase in production of only two per cent, a marked decline which is none the less considered to be limited in nature. There are also large dispari- ties, with a very heavy fall in countries of an intermediate income level, such as a 6.5 per cent drop in growth in South Africa, for example, in comparison to the period between 2003 and 2007, and on the other hand a positive balance in most of the so-called fragile economies, like Congo (DRC), with growth figures of over 10 per cent.

        "13 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 (revised in July 2010) for the region as a whole for 2010 estimate growth of five per cent, with an even more promising figure of six per cent for 2011. Moreover, this growth should be maintained as long as the worldwide recovery continues, and assuming that there are no major political destabilising factors. Bold policies: an increase in public spending instead of catch- ing a cold Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s resistance to the crisis is considered in the IMF study as one of the most notable phenomena in the current world recession. The continent\u2019s low level of integration in the global eco- nomy has certainly played a part in this, but this reason alone is not sufficient to explain it, given that previous crises caused a great deal more suffering. The determining factors in its performance are to be found in the strong macroeconomic foundations built up since the middle of the past decade, and in the intelligent reactions of African governments, which, at the very first signs of economic slow- down, took steps to reduce the importance of external factors by increasing public spending, in spite of stagnation or reduc- tions in revenue. This has permitted the economy to wait for the current recovery in global demand and its corollaries, an increase in the prices of staples and there- fore a growth in export revenue for many sub-Saharan countries. During the crisis, this increase in public spending has been particularly signifi- cant in certain fragile economies like Togo. A few countries, however, have not been able to increase flexibility in terms of budgetary policy, such as another fra- gile state, the Comoros, which is still far from leaving the ranks of the most indebted poor nations. Another example is the Seychelles, which, despite being an intermediate-level country, has had to face macro-economic imbalances owing to the colossal property inves- tments made. In monetary terms, many of the continent\u2019s nations had lowered base rates to a reasona- ble level, which has favoured internal inves- tment. Governments have kept their own public investment at the same level as before, with half of them even registering an increase. This has proved possible because budgetary balan- ces had improved in the years before the crisis. Given the lack of new resources, many countries undertook transfers of sound resources which might be conside- red as a kind of \u2018social protection in the form of development\u2019, as it is described in the IMF report. This consists in investing in food security through the subsidising of agricultural input, in addition to public works. Social policy: in defence of the economy While in the past, the IMF report notes, sub-Saharan African countries had the bad habit of cutting social expenditure in order to resolve budgetary problems, their reaction this time, from the start of the financial crisis, has been completely different. In 2009, the last year for which figures are available, they managed to maintain spending on the most under- privileged classes. In terms of education and health, the sums allotted have even been increased in 20 of the 29 countries with low revenues. Nonetheless, the fact remains that the near total absence of social security has led to great suffering for the most underprivileged sectors, par- ticularly for those who have lost their jobs, 700,000 in South Africa alone. According to the World Bank, the crisis has prevented at least seven million people from lifting themselves above the poverty threshold ($1.25 per day). In comparison with other regions of the world, sub-Saharan Africa has been rela- tively successful in maintaining the con- fidence of foreign investors. The most recent recorded trends show that inves- tments have bounced back to the degree where there are already signs in the most developed countries of fears of an over- heating economy. It is also the case that remittances from African expatriates have only undergone a small decline, a similar pattern to that seen in development aid. The picture is not, however, entirely rosy. A third of the region\u2019s nations are highly unintegrated in the movements of international capital. The IMF study closes with some recommendations which appear to be beneficial. Following the protective measures needed in the short term, governments were advised to give priority once more to traditio- nal objectives such as infrastructure, and to resolve budgetary deficits that have been beneficial during the crisis, even if it sometimes proves necessary to employ prudence and continue to call upon the budget to stimulate demand. * World Economic and Financial Surveys \u2013 Regional Economic Outlook \u2013 IMF, April 2010. **World Economic Outlook update: http:// www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/ update/02/index.htm The European Commission will publish a new Eurobarometer survey on Europeans and Africa in November before the AU-EU summit.

        "14 C urier The Dossier Africa in the world economy The European Investment Bank plays the Africa card Since the beginning of the year, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has commit- ted itself, alongside other financial institutions, to a number of initiatives in Africa aimed at stimulating economic recovery and job creation by strengthening capital markets and the private sector and attracting investors. This is boosting Africa\u2019s new image as a growth continent. H.G. I n May 2010, the EIB joined forces with the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) to support the new Capitalisation Fund for Africa initiated by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group. The fund will have $US200M with which to consolidate the lending capacity of Africa\u2019s pri- vate commercial banks with the aim of speeding up the economic recovery and job creation. It plans to coordinate its actions with those of other financial institutions to alleviate the effects of the global financial crisis in Africa. Above all, it hopes to attract sovereign capital and thereby demonstrate the commer- cial viability of private investments that contribute to Africa\u2019s development. \u201cThe partnership put into place\u2026 sends a clear signal of confidence regarding the possibilities for commit- ment on African financial markets\u201d, believes EIB Vice President Plutarchos Sakellaris. From large companies to micro- businesses Also in May 2010, the EIB and seven other African institutions or institutions well established on the continent, such as the Development Bank for Southern Africa and the Netherlands Financing Company for Developing Countries (FMO) offi- cially launched the \u2018African Financing Partnership\u2019, designed principally for large scale projects in the infrastructure and industry sectors. These eight estab- lishments invested a total of $US8.8bn in Africa in 2009. The initiative aims to attract private investment with a high growth potential. In 2009, three-quarters of the EIB\u2019s investments in Africa were in partnership with other institutions. Within the \u2018African Financing Partnership\u2019, any one of the associated institutions can operate on behalf of the others, with the aim of reducing the waste of time and resources incurred by, among other things, repeated audits and numer- ous case studies. Another pledge for Africa. The EIB has become the leading investor in the sole microfinance fund for Sub-Saharan Africa, the REGMIFA* launched in May 2010 following a G8 decision and allocated $US150M, the EIB contribut- ing $US15M. This fund will invest in 50 microfinance enterprises that will grant loans in local currency to small busi- nesses, an initiative from which 300,000 are expected to benefit over the next five years. *Regional Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Fund for Sub-Saharan Africa.

        "15 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 Africa in the world economy Dossier Interview by H.G. T he agreement between DRC\u2019s government and a group of state-owned Chinese compa- nies concerns a loan for the construction of infrastructure valued at $US6.5bn and a further $US2bn loan for the modernisation of the existing mining infrastructure, both provided in their entirety by China\u2019s EXIM Bank. At the time, this was China\u2019s largest single deal in Africa. As a guarantee of repayment, a Sino-Congolese joint venture has been set up to exploit the copper, cobalt and gold of the Congo. SM \u2013 This venture marks a transitional period in Chinese relations with Africa. It shows that the post-colonial era under the aegis of the old colonial powers has finally come to an end. It is now some time since the balance of commercial links began to swing towards the East, initially in the shape of Japanese imports. In 2030, all projections indicate that China will represent from 35 to 40 per cent of world production, and Africa too is making inroads into the world econo- mic system. These changes are traumatic ones for Africa, however. The continent is in the process of repositioning itself, breaking out of not only the colonial period but also the post-colonial one in which its governors believed that they could control the economy by political means. In this economic context, Africa is at the same time returning to the roots of its cultural values and uprooting itself in an attempt to join the world economy. The dual movements performed by China and Africa have placed the latter in a rela- tionship of strength. The big question is whether, with this geo-strategic shift, Africa is in a sufficiently powerful posi- tion. Sino-Congolese relations are sym- bolic of what is happening on the whole African continent. HG \u2013 What is special about Sino- African, and in particular Sino- Congolese, relations? In economic terms, China is seeking raw materials to feed the expansion of its economy. It does not have enough, and has to find them elsewhere, but all the major reserves in the rest of the world are already under the control of multina- tionals from the old powers. Only Africa has these resources, and China is another imperial power that is simply doing what every hegemonic power has done. There is, therefore, something of the colonial project here. What the Chinese are giving African countries in exchange for the raw mate- rials is public infrastructure, an area in which they are competitive, competent, and able to meet short deadlines. This is precisely what Africa, and especially Central Africa, needs. So why is this a colonial project? Isn\u2019t it what they need, and what classic colonialism did not provide? For Africa, the great danger here is of a development project going off the rails. It must also be remembered that the Chinese are rebuilding infrastructure which exis- ted before: it was in the nationalist period that no attention was paid to it. In the colonial era, the Congo (DRC) was as well equipped as South Africa. The difference with the Chinese approach is that it recognises the sovereignty of African peoples. It does not meddle with local politics and does business with bandits as readily as with the most impeccable democrats. And it does not criticise. It reinforces the status of those in power, whether in a democracy like South Africa or a repressive regime like that of Zimbabwe or Sudan. This is possible because decision-making is concentrated and there is no critical press, for example. Chinese policy has in this sense followed the same lines since Bandung*, where it set itself up as the leader of the non- aligned nations. China\u2019s response to criticism of its support for undemocratic regimes is that it does not grant budgetary aid to governments, In September 2007, the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and a Chinese state consortium signed the most important bilateral investment agreement ever agreed at the time between China and an African country. For Stefaan Marysse, professor at Antwerp University, it is symbolic of Sino-African relations today and of what is at stake given the new position held by Africa in the world economy.

So does Africa\u2019s economic develop- ment benefit from these exchanges with China, which endow it with sig- nificant infrastruc- ture? Europe has also inves- ted billions of dollars in infrastructure in Africa, but also in good governance and in elections. European countries, though, have done this with a scattergun approach, and their actions have suffered from a lack of visibility. China has concentrated on infrastructure. In a country like the DRC which has to import everything (eggs from South Africa, rice from Thailand, etc.), infrastructure is vital. The Chinese have understood this \u2013 that is clear. But if we look at a map of Chinese building in the DRC, Angola and Zambia, all are linked to each other, with the aim of exporting raw materials and bringing in imported products. It is the times that make the difference. My impression is that Africa is beginning to hold its head up high. There are major political actors like Mandela, or Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9 in Mali, and there is an increasing awareness that the political classes can only survive if they provide good government. Africa is repositioning itself. It is resisting the crisis much better than other regions. In the case of the Congo (DRC), however, the contracts signed with China have had to be reviewed under instruction from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which judged that DRC could not, just as it was on the point of finally moving out of the group of most indebted coun- tries, venture into new and colossal debts which could compromise future genera- tions. The guarantees required by the Chinese in the September 2007 contract were considered exorbitant. The IMF has therefore demanded changes in the con- ditions of the loans, and in October 2009 amendments were made to the agreement reducing the cost of the infrastructure by half. In one sense, it\u2019s positive, but in another, the DRC really does need this infrastructure. Greece has after all just borrowed around $US110bn, and we\u2019re only talking about $US6.5bn here. * Conference attended by 29 Asian and African countries, forming a group of non-aligned third-world countries .

        "17 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 China seen by African leaders as a flexible business partner Interview by H.G. W here has the Chinese expansion in Africa been the most significant? China has particularly expanded its trade relations with oil pro- ducing African nations. The fact that countries like Angola, Sudan and Nigeria are some of its most important African trade partners serves as a clear indica- tion. The nation takes a lot of initiatives to help it secure raw material sources in the long-term. Various state-owned enterprises like China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec Corp.) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) are carrying out this mission. As China has to compete for resource- rich African nations with other major powers, it is very careful in its foreign policies. It makes generous donations and supplies low and free interest loans. China is also very active in the construction of infrastructure and, above all, abstains from interfering in local political issues. Recently, for instance, China has been observed as being unwilling to put pres- sure on Khartoum in UN assemblies, despite the tragic atrocities committed in Darfur. Is China\u2019s capability in developing trade with the African continent due to its competitors, notably Europe, under-estimating China\u2019s dynamism? China\u2019s dynamism might have been underestimated in the early phase of its rise, but probably not in the 21st century. It is, rather, a matter of China\u2019s drive in Africa being motivated by the continent\u2019s exclusion from the EU\u2019s trade and inves- tment radar. For a long time, the EU had largely limited its trade ties with the conti- nent on account of political instability and \u2018conditionality\u2019. China, on the other hand, could not ignore the potential benefits earned from trading with this resource- rich and marginalised continent. China claims that it holds a policy of \u2018non- interference\u2019 in the internal affairs of its trade partners. Quite unlike the West, it refrains from criticising the governance problems and human rights abuses of its Africa in the world economy Dossier Trade relations between China and Africa, especially in countries within the conti- nent\u2019s east coast, are nothing new and extend back to medieval and even ancient times, emphasises the Ethiopian economist, Kelbesa Megersa. Nevertheless, significant economic and socio-political relations between the Asian giant and Sub-Saharan Africa started up during the Mao Zedong era (1950-1976). Since the start of the 21st century, however, a novel and massive scale of trade rela- tions has been witnessed, he adds. As a simple indication, trade between the two sides shot up markedly more than tenfold, from $US10.5bn to over $US106bn, between 2000 and 2008. Kelbesa Megersa \u00a9 Courtesy of Kelbesa Megersa ",
        "18 C urier The Africa was off the map in numerous important world stages. Most western nations were not willing to regard Africa as a trustworthy trade partner unless it solved its governance problems and fit with their \u2018expectations\u2019. Some strategic African countries especially have seen the revival of western interest following the arrival of China. Many analysts understate Africa\u2019s role. It is, however, possible that some analysts overstate Africa\u2019s role. As a newly growing and resource-rich continent, Africa has an important role in global dynamics. Specifically, it could play a significant role in the development of trade in mineral resources, agricultural commodities and various labour intensive commodities. It is also an untapped investment ground. Africa\u2019s trade relations with emerging economies hold both promises and perils. Sometimes African businesses (like the textiles sector) are seen as suffering from cheap imports from the Asiatic emerging economies. On the other hand, African nations are enjoying rising exports to these countries. However, it is a good thing that there are multiple trade partners. China should not be the only \u2018alternative market\u2019. Since the economies of emerging coun- tries are on the rise, huge markets are ope- ning up for African exports. Additionally, African nations could import essential inputs at a much cheaper price. Is poverty in Africa lessening as a result of the new partnerships being created, notably between numerous African countries and China? With the advancement of the Sino-African partnership, trade volumes are surely soa- ring and the GDP of most African coun- tries is growing. However, the poverty implications might be limited as the growth is often not inclusive. Further, quite unlike the western aid model which flows through project interventions to directly reach the poor, China is involved in big infrastructure projects and inves- tment ventures. Yet, it should be noted that in the long term such projects greatly assist the African war against poverty. These contributions, coupled with its donations and loans, might even position China as a good development partner for African nations.

Ah ... the pursuit of self-interest ... that great- est of all motivators of mankind ... can sometimes have wider benefits and it is indeed a cornerstone of modern society. My neighbour and I agree not to clobber each other over the heads because it is in our mutual and separate self-interest. Charles Visser * S elf-interest is then also the main driver of South Africa's keen pro- motion of the economic develop- ment of its immediate neighbours and indeed the whole of sub-Saharan Africa. It keeps their citizens at home and creates a market for South African products. It is not generally known, but South Africa has consistently endeavoured, even during the apartheid years, to improve the economic fortunes of its neighbours. This was the case from the very creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910 which also saw the creation of the world's old- est customs union, the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). The primary goal of this customs agree- ment between South Africa, Botswana, Swaziland and Namibia is to promote regional economic development through the coordination of trade. The 1910 agree- ment made provision for common external tariffs on all goods imported into SACU. A common pool of customs duties as per the total volume of external trade and excise duties based on the total produc- tion and consumption of excisable goods. SACU-produced goods could also cir- culate freely and without quantitative restrictions within SACU and a revenue sharing formula was agreed upon. The agreement was amended in 1969 and again in 2002. The 1969 agreement saw the inclusion of a multiplier in the revenue sharing formula that boosted the revenues of Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho by 42 per cent. Once again South Africa's self-interest was at stake. The apartheid state was eager to create a community of 'separate but equal' states within it and around it. It became a South African policy imper- ative to boost the economies of the already independent black states within it (Swaziland and Lesotho) and, border- ing it, Botswana. The reason for this was that independent black states had to be seen to work for 'Grand Apartheid' (the creation of 'independent homelands' for South African blacks) to be feasible. Main player In one of those typically African ironies, the revenue they earned from SACU became the main source of foreign cur- rency for Swaziland and Lesotho even if they were loudly calling for ever more stringent sanctions on apartheid South Africa at the time. P o s t - a p a r t h e i d saw South Africa join the Southern African Economic D e v e l o p m e n t Community (SADC). The SADC was established in 1980 to reduce the original nine members' dependence on South Africa. The organi- sation now boasts 15 members as far north as the Democratic Republic of Congo on the west coast and Tanzania on the east coast as well as Mauritius and Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. South Africa has, ironically but unsurprisingly, become the main player although it is coy about admitting that. The SADC has many lofty ideals, that they express in that language that is so beloved by bureaucrats the world over but that can put the most adamant insom- niac to sleep within minutes. Here is an example: \u2022 achieve complementarity between national and regional strategies and programmes; \u2022 promote and maximise productive employment and utilisation of resources of the region; \u2022 achieve sustainable utilisation of natural resources and effective protection of the environment; \u2022 strengthen and consolidate the long- standing historical, social and cultural affinities and links among the peoples of the region; \u201cSouth Africa exports its electricity to its neighbours.\u201d \u00a9 Chris Kirchoff, MediaClubSouthAfrica.com Dossier Africa in the world economy South Africa has endeavoured, even during the apartheid years, to improve the economic fortunes of its neighbours ",

Long on words and short on action. Meanwhile the South African private sec- tor did not need a second invitation to expand into Africa. As we speak South Africans are erecting cellphone towers in the DRC, opening supermarkets in Mozambique, breeding specialised broiler chickens in Zambia, extending SME loans in Africa. making money transfers easier ... and mining tanzanite in Tanzania. Whether these commercial activities are to the benefit of the peoples of those coun- tries is open for debate, but if one argues from the viewpoint that trade and industry is good ... it must be good. Then their is eco tourism. It is regarded by many as the only really longterm sus- tainable industry for many impoverished regions in Africa. On this front South Africa is doing well with the creation of several transfrontier parks that are set to attract tourists to areas of Mozambique and Zimbabwe that are currently under-utilised. The Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park is a joint initiative between South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe and is expected to cover an area of 35 000 km 2 in the first phase of its development and a whopping 100 000 km 2 upon full integration. South Africa also recently helped to return five endangered black rhino to their home in the Serengeti Game reserve in Tanzania. A further 27 are set to be returned to their native coun- try over the next two years. To return to the original question. Yes Africa is benefitting from many of the African solutions to African problems that were developed in South Africa over time. Yes it is benefitting from the hope for the continent that the country inspires. Yes it is benefitting from the infrastructural development brought by South African business interests, be it a supermarket or an upmarket eco-friendly game reserve being built, it will have longterm benefits. Yes it is benefitting from South Africa's successful conservation techniques... Is South Africa benefitting from sharing technologies and techniques with Africa?

Peace in Somaliland \u201cIn the so-called North-Western zone, in development circles known as Somaliland, where peace and stability have prevailed for over a decade, inter- national support should be scaled up in order to nurture the existing peace and encourage the exemplary democra- tic structures in that area \u2013 bearing in mind that there has been a free and fair election and smooth transition of power\u201d, says a representative of an NGO based in Hargeisa, Somaliland, who cannot be named for security reasons. He adds: \u201cThe peace dividend should be encouraged but at the same time; those who need humanitarian support in conflict areas should not be neglected, otherwise an exodus to more stable areas will occur which will ultimately endanger the peace and security of those areas. Capacity building should focus more on advocacy, peace-building, conflict resolution\u201d.

A strong civil society \u201cIt is critical and important to build the capacity of Somali civil society as they are the only non-profit organisations that bring checks and balances to the country, particularly in the context of Somalia, where the public sector is weak and it is mandatory to have a strong and capable civil society that lays down the founda- tion of a strong nation in the country and good democratic and governance prac- tices\u201d, says Jama Mohamed, Director of the Nairobi-based Somali Organisations for Community Development Activities (SOCDA). \u201cThis can only be achieved through the installation of good leadership, the buil- ding of committed and capable security forces and restoring the justice system in the country\u201d, he adds. \u201cDuring the stabilisation period the proliferation of political groups, as well as regional and international interferences, have to be firmly con- tained.

        "24 C urier The S ince last year, the duty and quota-free market is ushering in new investment opportuni- ties for sugar in Zambia\u2019s huge arable lands to supply new markets and new industries. It is predicted that Zambia\u2019s sugar industry will grow sub- stantially in the coming years, not only due to increased exports to both the EU and regional markets such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, but also due to diversification into biofuels and other by-products. Easier access to the EU market has come about through the phasing out of quotas under the EU\u2019s Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative for Least Developed Countries (LDCs). This 2001 EU trade incentive gave duty and quota free access to the EU market for the world\u2019s 49 LDCs for all products apart from rice, sugar and bananas, deemed to be sensitive. The remaining restrictions on sugar were eliminated on 1 July 2009 giving duty and quota free access to the EU market for Zambian sugar and that of other LDCs. Zambia is also one of the six countries in the East and Southern Africa region (the others are Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles and Zimbabwe) to have agreed a \u2018goods only\u2019 European Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU. This already ensures free access to the EU for the bulk of Zambian goods and for sugar, from 2015.

It means that Zambia has seen the price of sugar exported fall from \u20ac523.7/tonne to \u20ac335/tonne in 2009/10. To offset the cuts, the EU offered a \u20ac1.28bn package of assistance for the 18 signatories of the ACP Sugar Protocol to fund four-year Multi- Annual Adaptation Strategies (MAAS) such as upgrading production to reduce costs and help diversify into ethanol. ACPs feared even fiercer global com- petition when the EU followed up the price cut with the phasing out of the Sugar Protocol in 2007 which also set fixed annual quantities for ACP sugar exporters. Despite its worst fears, Zambia is adapting and now that the remain- ing EBA restrictions have been lifted, the country\u2019s sugar exports to the EU have increased from 30,000 to 135,000 tonnes, say industry insiders. It marks a new long-term confidence in the indus- try in Zambia. Expansion The commissioning of the one trillion kwa- cha (1 kwacha = \u20ac0.00016) Nakambala Sugar Estate Expansion Project run by Zambia Sugar , the country\u2019s premier agricultural enterprise, has resulted in the Estate doubling its production. The expansion, which started in April 2007, included the upgrading of an existing fac- tory, construction of roads and canals as well as planting sugarcane on over 10,000 hectares of additional land. From 1 April 2009, Zambia Sugar began full production at the plant, increasing output from its previous 246,000 tonnes to 440,000 tonnes. Some 130,000 tonnes of sugar will be for the Zambian market while 120,000 tonnes will cater for the booming regional markets. \"Our exports to the EU are expected to increase to around 200,000 tonnes in about three years while production capacity of the plant will rise to 465,000 tonnes\", said Lovemore Sievu, Zambia Sugar 's corpo- rate affairs manager. The 100 per cent increase in production will result in the creation of 10,000 jobs, including in the outgrower scheme where small-scale pro- ducers are encouraged to produce sugar. With the removal of EBA restrictions, the country\u2019s sugar exports to the EU have increased from 30,000 tonnes to 135,000 tonnes Zambia Sugar announced the comple- tion of the purchase of 85.73 per cent of shares in Nanga PLC . Nanga PLC previously owned 9,800 hectares of agricultural farm land in Mazabuka, Southern Zambia, of which 2,200 hec- tares are planted, primarily with sug- arcane. Zambeef , the controlling share- holder of Nanga Farms, elected to sell its stake to focus on their core business; the production and distribution of beef, chicken, pork, eggs, milk and dairy produce. Zambia Sugar \u2019s purchase of the stake has allowed the long term sup- ply of sugarcane for its expanded sugar refinery in Mazabuka to be secured. It is envisaged that a further stake in the farm will be sold to a consortium of indigenous investors, in line with the country's citizen empowerment policies. Zambia Sugar \u2019s controlling shareholder is Illovo Sugar of South Africa, which has a big out-grower scheme throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The Nanga Farm sale is a landmark deal in Zambia as it brings together some of the leading players in agricul- ture, with funding provided by one of the leading banks in Zambia, Zanaco , which is benefiting from credit support from Rabobank , a global leader in the food and agribusiness. Sugarcane is also grown and processed by Kalungwishi Sugar Estates in Kasama, Northern Province and Consolidated Farming Limited (Kafue Sugar ) on the outskirts of Lusaka. Zambia Sugar has also reduced costs by producing its own electricity and has thus stopped use of that provided by the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO). Zambia Sugar also plans to expand its biofuel production from sugar, producing ethanol from molasses used as feedstock. Molasses has a resi- due to production ratio of around 0.2 per cent, meaning that for each tonne of sugar produced, some 200 kg of the feedstock becomes available, in total some 88,000 tonnes. Ethanol has an average conversion ratio of around 35 per cent, thus the total biofuels produc- tion potential from the by-product in 2011 would be around 31,000 tonnes.

Marie-Martine Buckens A lthough Warsaw stole the status of capital from Krakow in the 16th century, for many Poles it is Krakow that remains the true heart of their country, and most certainly of \u2018Little Poland\u2019, one of the 16 Vo\u00efvodies (regions) of today\u2019s Poland. In Krakow you are also constantly reminded that Poland is above all a fervently Catholic nation, a religion that has left its mark on the entire history of the country. It began in 966 when the pagan King Mieszko I decided to convert to avoid a religious war with his Czech neighbours. The cathedral \u2013 where archbishop Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope Jean-Paul II, ministered \u2013 churches and Gothic or Baroque chapels serve as a reminder at almost every street corner.

S ince the 10th century Krakow has also been a city of trade, tes- timony to which remains today in the form of Rynek Glowny, the market square covering four hectares and one of Europe\u2019s biggest medieval squares. It is also a city of art and culture, with its many universities, including the famous Jageillonian University, Central Europe\u2019s second oldest after Prague University. This welcomed such famous names as Copernicus and even the astrologist and alchemist Faust, the latter serving as the inspiration for Goethe in his famous novel of the same name, regarded as the most important work in German literature. Beginning in 1386, Krakow experienced two centuries during which it flour- ished under the dynasty first of Queen Hedwig, daughter of Casimir the Great \u2013 the last member of the Piast dynasty \u2013 and her husband, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Ladislas Jagellon. Krakow at that time was the capital of a powerful and vast state. In 1410, Poland \u2013 and its Lithuanian allies \u2013 won the Battle of Grunwald against the Teutonic knights, marking the end of the latter\u2019s expansion along the Baltic coast. Fifty years later Poland regained the town of Gdansk, birthplace in the 1980s of the anti- communist movement, Solidarnosc.

        "28 C urier The Discovering Europe Little Poland The Vistula Krakus is the mythical first king of Krakow. He is said to have lived on the Wauwel, a hillside overlooking a bend of the Vistula, the great river with its source in South Krakow that flows right across the country to the Baltic. It is a capricious river that, due to the very flat nature of the regions through which it flows, frequently causes disastrous flooding, notably in 1813, 1888, 1934, 1960 and, to a lesser extent, in the spring of 2010. History and legend From the top of St. Mary\u2019s Church belfry, on the market square, every hour of the day a trumpeter plays a tune that stops suddenly, in memory of his predecessor who gave the alarm on the arrival of Tatar troops in 1241 and who was killed by an enemy arrow to the throat. Known as the Hejnal, it is a tradition that has continued uninterrupted for seven centuries. Decline The grandeur proved to be short-lived. In 1596, King Sigismond III Vasa transferred the royal residence to Warsaw. Krakow lost importance, especially as it was weak- ened by pillaging at the time of Swedish invasions and by the plague that claimed 20,000 victims. In 1795, the three pow- ers \u2013 Russia, Prussia and Austria \u2013 who were jealous of their neighbour\u2019s power and despite the insurrections, divided up the country. Krakow became part of the Austrian Empire\u2019s Province of Galicia and as such enjoyed a certain freedom, even being declared a \u201cfree town\u201d between 1815 and 1846. In 1846, after another attempted revolt, Krakow again came under the control of the Austrian Empire. After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 Austria granted autonomy to Galicia in return for a pledge of Polish loyalty. Krakow again became a national symbol. The Austrians being less harsh than the Russians or the Prussians, Krakow was able to blossom and regained its status as Poland\u2019s cultural and artistic centre. Famous painters, writers and poets came to work there. In 1795, after having been divided up and shared out on three occasions, Poland disappeared from the map for 123 years. There then followed a long period of submission, insurrection and waves of repression and emigration. The poet Adam Mickiewicz was not the only one to go into exile. Sinister memory At the end of the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles restored Poland to the map of Europe. A brief period of calm ended abruptly 19 years later with the German invasion. But it was not just the Germans. The Soviets, linked by a secret clause in the Germano-Soviet pact, invaded Poland at almost the same time as the Reich. The \u2018Blitzkrieg\u2019 was the most terrible of wars, Hitler being deter- mined to put an end once and for all to what he called \u201cthis bastard of Europe\u201d. The Soviets were scarcely any better and began by murdering 4,500 Polish officers and intellectuals in Katyn and deport- ing hundreds of thousands of Poles to Siberia. Six million Poles \u2013 20 per cent of the population, including three million Jews \u2013 perished between 1939 and 1945. At this time Krakow became the \u2018capital\u2019 of the territory occupied by the Germans. Governor Hans Frank set up concen- tration camps not far from Krakow, in Plazow and Auschwitz. More than a mil- lion Jews perished as well as Polish resist- ance fighters and gypsies in these death camps of sinister memory. After the Second World War, Poland seemed to count for little in the eyes of the major powers \u2013 Soviets and Allies \u2013 and it soon found itself under Soviet rule. Intellectual and bourgeois Krakow experienced it as a particular humiliation when, in the 1950s, Moscow decided to build the town of Nowa Huta (the \u2018new steelworks\u2019) and its steel-making com- plex just a short distance from the proud historical city. In addition to the purely economic aspects, Nowa Huta pursued an ideological objective. The plan was to make the Little Poland region a sym- bol of socialism and even to transform Krakow the bourgeois cultural capital of Poland into a town for the proletariat. Today Nowa Huta can be proud of its inhabitants despite all that has happened. It is they who, supported by Archbishop Karol Wojtyla, were one of the principal sources of popular support for the anti- communist movement. And the pleasant neighbourhoods of this \u2018new\u2019 town where the participative tradition remains alive and well today attract a growing number of young Krakowians who are often for- gotten by the new Western capitalism. St. Mary's Basilica, in the Rynek (the main square of Krakow) is home to the unmatched Oltarz Mariacki, the giant Gothic altarpiece carved by Veit Stoss, Europe's greatest sculptor of the period between 1477 and 1489. \u00a9 Marie-Martine Buckens ",

It was one that took him to Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt and the Occupied Palestinian Territo- ries. \u201cIn the United Kingdom, where I did my master\u2019s, I was struck by certain similarities between these minorities and the Muslim minority in Britain. They sometimes suffer from some forms of discrimination, even if their situation is stable.\u201d It is a subject that leads, as so often in Krakow, given its proximity to the former Dachau concentration camps, to the question of the Jews. \u201cIn the 16th century Poland was a refuge for all the persecuted of Europe, including the Jews. Before the Second World War there were more than 3 million Polish Jews\u201d, Konrad Pedziwiatr points out. \u201cThe Poles, by far, were the people who saved most Jews during the war. And today our government is by far the most pro-Israeli, and even goes so far as never to criticise Israeli policy\u201d, he adds. But times are changing.

M.M.B. \u201cT he \u2018Peace and Develo- pment Studies\u2019 pro- gramme that we launched in 2008 is a completely new specialisation in Poland\u201d, explains Konrad Pedziwiatr, lecturer and project coordinator for this new study cycle, taught in English, at the Tischner European University in Krakow. \u201cThe lack of a tradition in this discipline in Poland causes us to establish links with other universities and outside organisa- tions.\u201d The project has the backing of solid part- ners such as Polish Humanitarian Action (PAH), an organisation that has long aided victims of war and natural disasters. The Norwegians are also present with the Programme of Comparative Research on Poverty (CROP), Liechtenstein with the International Academy of Philosophy, and finally the University of Iceland. \u201cSince it joined the European Union, Poland has played an increasingly impor- tant role on the international stage in the field of aid policies and peacekeeping. It therefore needs to acquire experts in these fields\u201d, stresses Pedziwiatr. Despite the organisers\u2019 success in attrac- ting experts from all over the world to their study programme, the future of Peace and Development Studies is far from assured. Its very life blood is at stake: \u201cWe receive subsidies, from Norway in particular, but there is no guarantee they will be renewed\u201d. In Tischner, as with the NGOs, the hope is that the creation of the new National Agency for Development Cooperation will solve the problem, which is a recurring one for all involved.

        "30 C urier The Discovering Europe Little Poland As a rich country, we have to enact solidarity with the poorest Interview with Mr Marek Zi\u00f3\u0142kowski, Director of the Development Cooperation Department in the Foreign Affairs Ministry M.M.B. I n a speech given in Warsaw on May 17, EU Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgs said: \u201cIn Poland, the word \u2018soli- darity\u2019 is to this day associated with Solidarno \u015b\u0107 , that brave social move- ment. But it also has a wider mean- ing: uniting together for a common cause, for example to help others in need\u201d. Today, Poland, once a benefi- ciary country in terms of aid, has to reason in terms of being a \u2018rich\u2019 coun- try, part of the EU and as such bound to its development policy. How is this perceived by the population? Compared to the new member states of the EU, Poland is perceived as an eco- nomically successful country. Developing countries, particularly the less affluent ones, regard Poland as a wealthy country. The international community therefore expects us to share our success to a larger extent by increasing the volume of our for- eign aid. Although Polish society is aware of the economic difficulties experienced by groups of poorer Poles, we are still ready to help other countries. The driver of this readiness is our sense of moral duty and the belief that helping others is a way of paying the \u2018debt\u2019 incurred by Poland when we received aid from the West in the earlier transformation stages. This aid was instrumental in implementing social and economic changes in our country. Poles are well aware of the fact that this assis- tance has largely contributed to what we can enjoy today: freedom, democracy and membership in Euro-Atlantic structures. As a society we have not yet achieved the level of development which can ensure welfare for all Polish citizens. The majority of Poles understand that our membership in the elite \u2018clubs\u2019 \u2013 the EU and OECD \u2013 means that we also belong to the world\u2019s richest countries. We also know that this position obliges us to enact solidarity with the world\u2019s poorest countries. An over- whelming proportion of Poles (83 per cent according to the latest survey for the Development Co-operation Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) believe that Poland should provide less developed countries with assistance (in line with all other Member States: Eurobarometer sur- vey October 2009, Ed. ) It is also noticeable that the growing support for our assistance activities goes hand in hand with Polish people feeling more \u2018at home\u2019 in the EU. Support for Poland\u2019s development assis- tance has been rising systematically since 2004 and has not been affected by the opinions of the rare contesters who claim that before helping others we should first solve our own problems. On the government side, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Poland has been organising a number of international events related to development co-oper- ation, and is in the process of consoli- dating and reforming the structure of its development co-operation.

The key asset of legislative regulation is a clear division of roles and responsibilities among the public institutions involved in assistance activities. Such legislation will also be introduced in Poland as work is cur- rently in progress on the Polish Act on Development Assistance. The Act will co-ordinate various assistance activities implemented by a range of Polish administrative entities. It will also guarantee well-structured collaboration with the NGO sector through the relevant Minister (the Minister of Foreign Affairs). The co-ordi- nation task will be delegated to the National Co-ordinator of International Development Assistance ranked as Secretary or Under- Secretary of State. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be responsible for the totality of development co-operation, including selection of geo- graphical and thematic priorities as well as allocation of funding. Planning will take place within the relevant unit of the Ministry and will include the appropriate Polish Embassies. Our development policy will be defined by the Minister of Foreign Affairs assisted by the Development C o - o p e r a t i o n Programming Committee \u2013 an advisory body appointed by the Minister and com- posed of a few experts from the other Ministries involved in development assis- tance and representatives of NGOs. The Act on Development Assistance should trigger a more efficient, more co- ordinated and internationally standard- ised use of public funding. An important advantage of the Act will be the possibil- ity to implement projects over extended periods of time (e.g. two or three years) and make multi-annual commitments instead of the current system in which projects last a maximum of a few months. It must be emphasised that the draft takes into account many comments and opinions reported by the Polish NGOs engaged in international development co-operation and humanitarian aid. In more concrete terms, what are Poland\u2019s aid priorities on the ground, in terms of programmes and coun- tries? For instance, how will you balance your engagement towards Eastern countries and the traditional countries (the ACP) benefiting from EU aid? Similarly to previous years we will con- tinue to assist our priority recipients i.e. Afghanistan, Angola, Palestinian Autonomy, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. We attach particular impor- tance to development assistance directed to Afghanistan. Thanks to the Polish- Swedish Eastern Partnership* initia- tive adopted by all EU member states, an additional opportunity has material- ised to develop the EU\u2019s relationship with the region. We have to bear in mind that Poland is an attractive partner for the countries of Eastern Europe as we had a similar starting point in terms of the level of development and were able to make our way into the EU. We are per- ceived as a country which understands the problems of the region better and we can offer our unique experience in systemic transformation. As to the other directions of Polish aid \u2013 we will continue to support selected African and Middle Eastern countries, as well as the countries of Central Asia. Our presence in these regions will be a reflec- tion of our financial capacity and, most of all, our know-how: these two factors drive the thematic and geographical division of labour among all donor countries. * The \u2018Eastern Partnership\u2019 proposal constitutes a new initiative aimed at counterbalancing the project of the Union for the Mediterranean advo- cated by the French president Nicolas Sarkozy.

The PGN was set up nearly 15 years ago and includes 10 environmental protec- tion organisations. In addition to Cracow, the organisation has two other national offices. \u201cThe Warsaw office,\u201d continues Slimko, \u201cis part of the international net- work, \u2018Bankwatch\u2019, that monitors public expenditure against environmental and sustainable development criteria. The national office in Szczecin [port town on the German border, editor] works more specifically with programmes for southern countries\u201d. To return to the subject of responsible purchasing, in addition to programmes targeting schools or ethical fashion, there are also those that focus on \u2018local\u2019 purcha- sing. This inevitably raises the question of food sovereignty. A complex issue, but also one that can bring together local farmers in Poland and in the South, in Ghana for example, where the PGN is active. The Szczecin office in particular is involved in this and works closely with the French Committee for International Solidarity (CFSI). \u201cThey have the leadership\u201d, con- tinues Slimko, \u201cand they would like us to be more involved internationally.

Making Africa a priority The government view (read interview on page 30) is that cooperation that benefits Eastern European countries remains the priority. Zaragoza, which brings together all the many Polish organisations wor- king directly or indirectly on cooperation, believes this is a view that must change. It has made this clear to the national authorities at a time when they are pre- paring to reform their cooperation policy. Ola Antonowicz, PGN president, is one of the leaders putting pressure on the government to allocate more money to projects in Africa. Money that should be allocated on a multiannual basis and not year by year, as is the case at present. Hence the importance of setting up a National Cooperation Agency.

The whole of Little Poland was occupied by the Austrians at the time, under whom they suffered less than relative to the other provinces that were ruled by Russians and Prussians, who cracked down hard on any kind of free thinking. Less exposed than \u2018big\u2019 Krakow, Zakopane soon became a \u2018protected\u2019 centre of political and cultural life as well as a university town. It was to Zakopane that professors removed from their university chairs came to teach at the Summer University. Later, it was here that national militant organisations were born and victims of persecution were assisted in crossing the border. Upheavals Writers flocked to Zakopane in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of them was Stanis\u0142aw Witkiewicz. Like many Polish artists he expressed his talents in many genres, as a playwright, philosopher, pamphleteer, painter, pho- tographer and novelist. In 1914, at the age of 29, and devastated by the suicide of his fianc\u00e9, he left for New Guinea with Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski. Fiercely condemned by his contemporaries, he nevertheless wrote more than 30 plays that were neither published nor performed and produced a number of paintings. He committed suicide on 18 September 1939 as the Soviets marched into Poland. He did not gain international recognition until the late 1950s when director Tadeusz Kantor put on his plays. His friend Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski revolu- tionised the world of anthropology. Born in 1884 in Krakow, the author of The Argonauts of the Western Pacific travelled the world, a characteristic he shared with many Poles whose wanderings were often forced upon them by successive invasions of their homeland. It was after returning from what is now Papua New Guinea with his friend Witkiewicz that he described the Kula Ring system for trading in goods regarded as prestigious (shell jewellery) but of no direct value, as practiced bet- ween around 20 of the islands. This study made him famous as did his method of \u2018participant observation\u2019.

        "34 C urier The Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s 3Canal: Taking Rapso Global Zoom Debra Percival W e meet in their office in Ariapita Avenue, one of the liveliest areas of downtown Port of Spain. Although Lancelot Layne started Rapso in the context of the rise of the Black Power Movement in T & T in the early 1970s, Roberts explains the musical form rose to prominence in the late 1970s through \u2018Brother Resistance\u2019. \u201cWhereas the most popular form of music in T & T is nowadays Soca, which is more about party music and fun lyrics, 3Canal tends to go deeper into socio-political issues\u201d, says another of the group\u2019s members, Wendell Manwarren. He says that the group also has a Latin flavour since fellow group member, Stanton Kewley is from Venezuela and also, Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s music can\u2019t help but be influen- ced by its neighbour\u2019s music. A huge Rapso revival happened in the early 1990s, says Manwarren, when Kindred and Ataklan brought a whole fresh pers- pective to Rapso by fusing it with hip-hop rhythms. \u201cOur first song was called \u2018Blue\u2019, as homage to an iconic carnival character, the \u2018Blue Devil\u2019\u201d, he says. 3Canal always create a \u2018band\u2019 (a procession of people) for Carnival\u2019s \u2018J\u2019ouvert\u2019 event (meaning dawn or break of day) when people parade smeared with paint or mud and in simple costumes fashioned out of junk, coloured cloth or perhaps a feather. \u2018J\u2019ouvert\u2019 is also known as \u2018dirty mas\u2019 and is thought to be a symbol of the new found freedom of emancipated slaves. 3Canal \u2019s first three participations in \u2018J\u2019ouvert\u2019 in consecutive years covered the spectrum of colours in the national flag; \u201cthe first one was white, the second, black and third, red. But it was the \u2018blue devils\u2019 that put the group on the map\u201d, says Manwarren. In 2010, 3Canal is a three-member Trinbagonian \u2018Rapso\u2019 group combining \u201cpowerful lyrics with a strong rhythm\u201d says one of its members, Roger Roberts. Its music embod- ies the vibrancy, spirit and rich cultural mix of the twin-island Caribbean nation, Trinidad and Tobago (T & T). Roger Roberts. \u00a9 3Canal ",
        "35 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 the theme was \u2018Jam-It\u2019, a Creole expres- sion meaning a class of people below the social line. \u201cGoing back to the grassroots of the Carnival was what it was all about and then Haiti (a creole speaking nation) had just had its horrible earthquake\u201d, says Manwarren. Already in their thirties when they formed 3Canal in the 1990s, Manwarren says they were just a \u201cmixed bunch of characters coming together\u201d. All members previously took part in the Carnival \u2018band\u2019 of the country\u2019s former \u2018Master Masmaker\u2019, Peter Minshall (\u2018Mas\u2019 comes from the word \u2018masqueraders\u2019 or dressing up in a way disassociated with your everyday life). This provided grounding for 3Canal in \u2018Mas\u2019 culture, says Manwarren. Another former 3Canal member, John Isaacs who passed away in 2000, was also involved in Minshall\u2019s procession. \u201cRoger was a production manager with Minshall and I was artistic assistant\u201d, says Manwarren. Roberts, he says, has brought harmo- nies to 3Canal \u2019s Rapso, something learnt from his days singing in a church choir. \u201cStanton has more of a dance hall, street chanty sort of flavour and I have a big old rough voice. I\u2019m the inveigler. I take the artistic lead in terms of the artistic direction of things\u201d, says Manwarren. Universal lyrics He explains how Rapso puts emphasis on the poetry of the lyrics. \u201cWe try to deal with things happening on the ground and then pull back and make the mes- sage as universal as possible.\u201d He feels that some of the lyrics of musicians have now become almost too direct. In this respect 3Canal borrows from Calypsonian tradition whose most famous proponent was the Trinbagonian \u2018Mighty Sparrow\u2019. \u201cCalypso uses a lot of double entendre : you may say one thing but it has another meaning. You can never be sure. This sort of masking means that the message takes on a universal meaning\u201d, he says. \u2018Talk yuh talk\u2019, recorded in 1999 marked the group\u2019s emergence as social commen- tators. Its theme is the \u2018Midnight Robber\u2019, a character who claims all evilness to him- self and in doing so highlights the evils around. \u201cOne of the worst put downs you could get as a \u2018Midnight Robber\u2019 is that you would be called a \u2018Mocking Pretender\u2019 \u2013 you are not really as bad as you make out to be. The song is about challenging oppression, but not in a direct fashion\u201d, says Manwarren. At this point Roberts and Manwarren sing their hit to demonstrate its strong rhythm. \u201cIt\u2019s the same musical beat that resonates on a \u2018J\u2019ouvert\u2019 morning when at 4 or 5 am people are moving to a rhythm. We try to keep the beat very elemental so that you can dance to it\u201d, says Roberts. \u201cWe try to deal with things happening on the ground and then pull back and make the message as universal as possible\u201d Manwarren says that 3Canal has gone from \u201cunconsciousness to conscious- ness\u201d, becoming more specific about the career choices it makes. When we meet, they have just got back from gigs in New York and Canada. Paradoxically, the Trinbagonian Diaspora is more open to Rapso, he says, than people in neigh- bouring Caribbean nations; something the group wants to change. \u201cWhen we first surfaced, we were popular all over the Caribbean; Jamaica, Barbados, St Vincent, etc\u201d, says Manwarren. He feels that the Caribbean has become more musically insular. \u201cWhat is strange about Caribbean jazz festivals is that they always draw artists from the North Americas; R&B musicians who might appeal to a more well-to-do crowd.\u201d 3Canal has also recently toured seven cities in India, sponsored by the Trinidad and Tobago Entertainment Company, a government initiative to promote the country\u2019s viable entertainment enterpri- ses. Its future plans could include a visit to Japan. The group also wants to participate in more world music festivals. They would desperately like to perform in Africa. Rehearsals for Carnival, which takes place in 2011 between 7-8 March (two days before the Christian festival of Ash Wednesday), are already on the horizon. 3Canal usually perform 10 con- certs on consecutive days leading up to Carnival before leading their own band for \u2018J\u2019ouvert\u2019. They do not participate in \u2018pretty mas\u2019, more associated with French and European tradition on Carnival Tuesday when people dress up in elabo- rate costumes. The creative street vibe of \u2018J\u2019ouvert\u2019, the great leveller, is closer to their spirit.

        "36 C urier The Chroniclers and interpreters for the ACP Climate change and the media Our Planet With rising sea levels, drought and flood- ing throughout African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, it may seem surprising that the number of people unconcerned about climate change has risen in the last two years from 4 to 9 per cent globally*. The media\u2019s role in raising awareness of this global phenomenon, particularly in developing countries, is therefore more crucial now more than ever. This was the view of speakers at the Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum \u2018The Heat is On \u2013 Climate Change and the Media\u2019, June 21-23 in Bonn, Germany. Okechukwu Umelo S upported in part by the European Regional Development Fund, the forum gathered 1,500 participants from 95 countries representing the media, civil society, private sector and research and government institutions. The results of a global study conducted by market research company Synovate and international German media company Deutsche Welle were presented, highlight- ing that the media is expected not only to inform the public about climate change in a manner that is easy to understand, but to also educate about its consequences. Television, newspapers and websites were revealed as good sources of climate change information in the ACP, while web 2.0** was deemed as crucial for educating the younger generation in developing coun- tries through social media sites and blogs like Kenyan-based \u2018Ushahidi.com\u2019, which interactively compiles online or SMS information from \u2018citizen journalists\u2019. Mobilising action in the develop- ing world \u201cJournalists need to tackle difficult issues with well-researched stories and show every individual that they can do some- thing to help\u201d, said Deutsche Welle Director General Erik Bettermann. \u201cThe media must create a forum for the exchange of ideas and opinions \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t automatically buy in to those who offer sensational reports from questionable disasters or those who prematurely state that all is clear\u201d, he continued. Pointing out the media\u2019s role as \u201cchroni- clers and interpreters\u201d mobilising action, providing hope and offering different perspectives for developing countries, Betterman noted that the media can highlight the benefits of moving towards green technology and ecologically friendly consumption and production, while show- casing \u201ccreativity and innovation, new models of working and new fields of work \u2013 as well as a new quality of life\u201d. Betterman underlined an increased need for awareness raising in the developing world, where climate change is more greatly experienced than in Europe. He was also critical of the negative percep- tion by media in the industrialised world that developing countries are not making use of climate change measures, in light of economic disadvantages, adding that the substantial efforts made by people in developing countries to combat climate change often go unnoticed by the media. \u201cIt appears to me that these countries are ready to pass us,\u201d said Bettermann. \u201cThey aren\u2019t wasting time lamenting the risks of climate-friendly production and lifestyles, but rather realising the oppor- tunities that exist.\u201d * Synovate and Deutsche Welle Global Study on Climate Change 2010 (18 countries). ** Web applications that facilitate interactive information sharing, interoperability, user- centered design and collaboration online.

        "37 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 \u201cAgriculture is back in a big way on the international development agenda\u201d Michael Hailu New Director of the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) M.M.B. T o date, your professional career has been focussed in two important fields: communication and forest policy; first, at the World Agroforestry Centre and later at CIFOR (Center for International Forestry Research). You were also one of the promoters of 'Forest Day'. What lessons did you take with you? The key lesson from organising high profile events such as Forest Day and the World Congress of Agroforestry is the importance of strategic communication in advancing agricultural and environmental issues on the global and national agenda. Through Forest Day held during the conferences of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 2007, CIFOR and its partners were able to raise the importance of tropical forests and advance the interests of forest-dependent people in climate negotiations leading up to Copenhagen. The World Congress of Agroforestry, held in Nairobi in 2009 with 1,200 people from 96 countries, also provided a forum to debate the important role trees have for sustainable farming, food security and climate change mitigation and adaptation. In both situations, a well-planned and executed communication campaign helped to transform conferences that would otherwise have been entirely scientific into multi-stakeholder forums where key players could learn from each other and advance issues of global importance. In the coming six months, we\u2019ll develop a new strategy that will allow us to build on CTA\u2019s strong networks and experience and reposition the Centre to meet emerging challenges Unfortunately, most scientists do not pay much attention to the value of communicating beyond their peer groups. That is one reason why agricultural research in developing countries does not get the attention and resources it deserves. They fail to get their messages out to the wider world, learn from past experiences and capture lessons to share with others. Communication and knowledge sharing should be carried out throughout the life of a project and not be seen as activities that are left to the end with meagre resources. How do you envisage your leadership of CTA? Agriculture is back in a big way on the international development agenda following the recent food and energy crises. Its critical role for poverty alleviation, economic growth and meeting the Millennium Development Goals is widely recognised. In most ACP countries, agriculture provides about 30 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs 65 per cent of the labour force. However, small-scale farmers, who produce the bulk of agricultural outputs in the ACP, face myriad problems, such as low productivity, unpredictable weather patterns, poor market access, unfavourable prices and degradation of land and water resources. With these challenges and opportunities, CTA can play an important role in facilitating knowledge and information exchange to support ACP policy makers and agricultural experts. In the coming six months we\u2019ll develop a new strategy that will allow us to build on CTA\u2019s strong networks and experience and reposition the Centre to meet emerging challenges. It is a very exciting time to be working in agriculture and development, and I see a real opportunity for CTA to make a difference. Food security is a top priority for developing countries. How do you intend to influence related policie s? When we talk about food security, we have to look at both availability of food and access to food. In both cases, CTA\u2019s work in strengthening agricultural information and knowledge systems in ACP countries will help to achieve greater food security. CTA also will continue to work with key regional initiatives such as the African Union\u2019s Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), which aims to advance policies and strategies for ensuring sustained agricultural growth and food security.

Muna also presides over the powerful Pan African Lawyer\u2019s Union (UPA) and in January 2010, he was nominated to the Panel of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM). \u201cDespite the challenges, one should not forget that in Africa our civil society organisations and our democracies are still very young. The Organisation of African Unity (1963-2002) used to be just a club of governments. With the birth of the AU in 2002, our heads of state agreed to establish a statutory organ to represent NGOs, community-based organisations, volunteer bodies and professional asso- ciations, from both the African continent and its Diaspora. Despite the challenges, one should not forget that in Africa our civil society organisations and our democracies are still very young Some saw the move as a mere gesture to give African leaders a clear conscience that the views of civil society were being taken into account. However, if you look at the historical context, you realise that after decades of one-party systems, it was a very significant step forward\u201d, says Muna. \u201cAdmittedly, there\u2019s still a degree of mistrust between Africa\u2019s political class and its civil society, but I note that thanks to ECOSOCC\u2019s existence, this is dimi- nishing. The fact that some former civil society personalities such as Mali\u2019s former President, Alpha Oumar Konar\u00e9, are now in positions of authority, also signifies that non-state actors are becoming more accepted\u201d, says Muna. Obstacle course Despite eight years of existence, ECOSOCC is not yet operating at full speed. For Muna, the fault lies with \u201corganisational and electoral obsta- cles\u201d. The body numbers 50 members elected at several levels: a national level (two for each Member State), a regio- nal level (two for each of Africa\u2019s five regions) and a continental level (eight members). Twenty places are reserved for the Diaspora. \u201cThe nomination of representatives was long and complica- ted. Furthermore, equilibrium between the diverse civil society actors needed to be found, such as not advantaging men over women, etc.\u201d This explains why the first General Assembly only took place in 2005, with the nomination of the Noble Peace Prize win- ner, Wangari Maathai, chosen to head the body with very limited financial resources. Thanks to discreet but efficient lobbying in the African capitals, his competence and fat address book, Akere Muna was awarded the ECOSOCC presidency in 2008. Things are moving but, like his prede- cessor, Muna is contending with another obstacle: the African Citizens\u2019 Directorate (CIDO). Attached to the President of the African Union Commission\u2019s office, CIDO has the task of implementing the African Union Commission\u2019s directives in its partnerships with civil society and the Diaspora. Moreover, it happens to be ECOSOCC\u2019s secretariat. On paper, the body that Muna heads is independent and can count on administrative support from CIDO. However, sources draw attention to regular clashes between the two structures. But the challenges don\u2019t stop there. The election for the members representing the Diaspora has still not been held. Muna attributes this delay to \u201cthe overly broad definition of this Diaspora that includes the descendents of Africans in Brazil, Haiti or the Caribbean. The 20 availa- ble posts are highly coveted\u201d. His two short years of the presidency have clearly not sufficed for Muna to complete what he set out to do. Muna is counting on an extension of his mandate at the next ECOSOCC General Assembly to take place in September 2010, on home ground in Cameroon, to move the organisation ahead. His re-election seems a safe bet. * Journalist based in Brussels.

Members of the ACP-EU Follow-Up Committee arranged the meeting of about 58 representatives of civil society, employers\u2019 organisations and trade unions from the 16 countries of the East African Community (EAC) and Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA). Three main items were on the agenda: the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement signed on 22 June in Ouagadougou, imple- mentation of the EU-Africa strategy, and negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). In all three cases, the non-state African players expressed their dissatisfaction at their degree of participa- tion in decision-making processes. \u201cThe seminar\u2019s final document will serve as a legal instrument for the battles they will wage in their own countries\u201d, explained Luca Jahier, President of the ACP-EU Follow-up Committee of the EESC.

Dev Nadkarni T hough the effects of the global financial crisis in the region were not felt as severely as they were in other parts of the world, the fragile island economies did feel some pressure due to reduced tourist numbers and a dip in inward remittances \u2013 the islands\u2019 top two revenue channels. In Australia and New Zealand, their main source markets for tourists and remit- tances suffered milder recessionary trends than the United States and Europe, but reduced discretionary spending in these two countries affected leisure travel as well as the volumes of remittances, fol- lowing general global consumer spend- ing patterns that have seen a decline in discretionary spending. The dip in remittances, though, may have been to some extent cushioned by greatly reduced costs of money transfers that have been in place more recently thanks to joint initiatives between the islands\u2019 central banks, money transfer firms and commercial banks. These were facilitated by a World Bank programme that has been working on the problem of high remit- tance costs for the past couple of years. Individual islands\u2019 central banks have also put in place tighter fiscal disciplines and lending criteria to both individuals and businesses over the past eighteen months to meet the challenges of reduced inflows into their fragile economies. Unlike in the West, these were not government-spon- sored interventions aimed at propping up the financial system by pumping in cash. Rather, they have been more proactive than reactive, directed more at planning and strategising, identifying new oppor- tunities in the recovering global economic environment. EU workshop In June, the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organisation (PIPSO) carried out a regional workshop in Nadi, Fiji, under the auspices of the European Union (EU) on ways that could assist the private sector in the region to exploit global economic recovery opportunities. The workshop underscored the impor- tance of carrying forward the provisions of the Cairns Compact agreed upon by the Pacific Islands Forum leaders at last year\u2019s annual summit on working more closely with the private sector in the overall development process in the islands. Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General Tuiloma Neroni Slade said, \u201cGiven the influence of Governments on private sector performance, most of the actions that are needed to be implemented would have to be led or facilitated by governments.\u201d The region is developing strategies to confront future financial crises Ways to mitigate the impact of the crisis on various categories of vulnerable groups including women and children were dis- cussed at the workshop and a six-point strategy was developed in the conclusions of the event: improving efficiency and equity public funding; renewed focus in investing in social services; income crea- An East Timorese youth walks as a streak of rainbow is seen in the background in Dili, East Timor. \u00a9 Reporters / Associated Press ",

The participants worked on a draft two- year national action agenda, which will frame policy discussions in the Pacific countries in the ensuing months. These are broadly seen as solutions for giving the desired momentum to the islands\u2019 economies to better integrate into the resurging post-recession world economy. Following the February summit, a sum- mary of proposed national actions has been developed. Many of these contain opportunities for inter island co-operation to spur economic growth not only nation- ally but also regionally. The plans were due to be presented to regional leaders at the 41st Pacific Island Forum meeting in Port Vila, Vanuatu, in August. Now that Australia and New Zealand are officially out of the recession as declared by their respective governments, tourist numbers have been growing and central banks have also reported that remittances have been regaining their pre-crisis levels. Meanwhile the islands region has read- ied itself to meet the resurgent global economy and create hedges against the potential effects of future financial crises by developing these strategies. D. P. S ome leading International Finan-cial Institutions have come together to set up a $US850M (\u20ac696M) action plan to boost private sector investment across the Caribbean region.

For our part, we have estimated the cost of rebuild- ing basic facilities, such as laboratories, at \u20ac200M\u201d, explains De Noni. The plan is to create a national science and technology university of Haiti (\u201cAgriculture, fishing, social sciences and applied mathematics must be central priorities\u201d, adds De Noni).

Stefano Manservisi, former Director General of DG Development, at the European Commission*, took part in the \u2018Development Policy\u2019 briefing on 2 June, along with Marzia Sica, Director of the Fondazioni4Africa project, funded by four Italian foundations and carried out in Uganda and Senegal by several NGOs. This project was also presen- ted as an example of a fruitful multi- level partnership by representatives of Senegalese associations, which debated the innovative and controversial issue of migration and development, analysing cases in which migrants associations are proactively involved in the development of their countries of origin. Mark Walport, Director of the Wellcome Trust, outlined the role foundations should play in supporting the sciences, due to the fact that they have assets and are independent: \u201cWe can act on a global scale. For example, in the field of medi- cal research, we support a private-public partnership for tackling malaria.\u201d Gerry Salole, Chief Executive of the EFC, affirmed that, \u201cit is still a crisis period for Europe and foundations can play a critical role in the Europe 2020 agenda. They are important partners for the EC. There are at least 110,000 foundations in Europe, which collectively spend \u20ac150bn on the public good both within and out- side Europe.

The Spanish, who establis- hed their first settlement in 1592, enslaved many of Trinidad\u2019s native inhabitants to labour in their colonies and over the next two centuries, the Spanish and French (following the French revolution, plan- tation owners and their slaves from the neighbouring French island of Martinique emigrated to Trinidad) established an agricultural-based economy. Slaves were imported from West Africa to cultivate tobacco, cocoa and sugar plantations. In 1802, the island formally ceded to British forces. With the abolition of slavery in 1834, slaves left the plantations and the British imported thousands of indentured workers, mostly from India, to work in the cane fields.

First PM of Indian descent The country became a Republic within the Commonwealth in 1976. Williams died in office but the PNM remained in power until 1986 when the National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR), a multi-ethnic coalition of Trinbagonians of both African and Indian descent, was elected to power. In 1991, the PNM\u2019s Patrick Manning became the new Prime Minister. In November 1995, Manning called an early election and the United National Congress (UNC) of Basdeo Panday formed an alliance with the NAR and Panday became the country\u2019s first Prime Minister of Indo-Trinbagonian descent. Elections in 2000 returned Basdeo Panday to power but a hung parlia- ment resulted in Manning\u2019s re-election in 2002. He won another mandate in 2007.

An accusation of \u2018buildingitis\u2019 was leve- lled at the previous PNM government for investing in under-utilised expensive new structures such as the Waterfront Development built to house a services- based economy.

It has hence wel- comed the new government\u2019s moves to dust off a draft procurement bill which foresees the appointment of a procure- ment regulator. Donors in T & T say that one of the biggest issues is to ensure that services reach the poorest in the population.

Formerly known as the Interim Revenue Stabilisation Fund (2000), it saves and invests the country\u2019s surplus oil and gas revenues for times when oil and gas revenues fall and put a strain on public expenditure. Excess revenues from oil and gas also provide a heritage for future generations. Deposits and withdrawals are triggered by a 10 per cent fluctuation in oil and gas revenues. According to figures given by T & T\u2019s Central Bank, the fund, denominated in US dollars, currently stands at $US3.1bn The former government set up a Petro- leum Stabilisation Fund for CARICOM (Caribbean Community) countries in 2005.

A huge expansion of Atlantic Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has been seen in recent years. Trinidad is the largest exporter of LNG to the United States and supplies the United States with 70 per cent of its LNG imports, according to government statistics. \u201cOur goal is the balancing of the country\u2019s oil and gas production pro- file via efforts aimed at increasing crude volumes\u201d, the country\u2019s new Energy Minister, Carolyn Seepersad Bachan told a press conference in July in Port of Spain.

Calypso Rose\u2019s song, \u2018Matrimony\u2019, \u201cchallenges the whole idea of gender as a social construct, which dictates to us what a \u2018real woman\u2019 can and can\u2019t do\u201d, she says, which is further illustrated by another calypso, \u2018I am Doing My Thing\u2019 (1977) from which Dikobe borrowed the title for her book. \u201cCalypso Rose told me that when she started singing calypso, it was male dominated and wo- men were not expected to sing calypso, but she went ahead and did her own thing\u201d, says Dikobe. \u201cWomen have not been given their due for the distinctive roles they have played, and continue to play, as originators, developers, performers, and consumers of calyp- so in Trinidad and Tobago\u201d, she says. * LAP, Lambert Academic Publishing, ISBN 978-3-8383-0978-1, Paperback, 156 Seiten. D.P. A mongst its projects, the NGO runs a mentoring programme for girls 14-18 whereby they accompany professional women \u2013 or \u2018big sisters\u2019 \u2013 to work. Workshops, held with the girls\u2019 parents, \u201csensitise the women on trade and economy, sexual and reproductive rights and human rights generally\u201d, says Fulade Mutota. \u201cThere is a vibrant women\u2019s movement in Trinidad and the Caribbean, but it has not shifted how we do things. Women still under- value themselves\u201d, she adds. She says that the \u201cpatriarchal perspective\u201d still prevails: \u201cIt is not a natural evolution in our context\u201d, but rather imposed by the former colonial masters. Women against armed violence The NGO is especially worried about the rising level of gun violence in the country (see introduction) which, feels Mutota, began to take a grip in 2000. Last year, it organised \u2018women\u2019s conversations\u2019, a women\u2019s workshop on the current level of armed violence in Caribbean society spon- sored by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). Interestingly, the NGO invokes United Nations Security Council Resolution1325, the first international legal document requiring parties in con- flict to respect women\u2019s rights and their participation in peace negotiations, as a launch pad for women\u2019s involvement in opposing armed violence in her own society. For Mutota, there are numerous reasons for the high level of gun violence in T & T; the drugs trade, easy access to weapons, low detection rate by the police services and insufficient presence of secu- rity services in the country.

It has provided eq- uity for feature and short films, explains Carla Foderingham, its Chief Executive Officer. It\u2019s a one-stop-shop for foreign filmmakers interested in filming in many varied locations, providing help with vi- sas, accommodation, the importing of technical equipment and offering 30 per cent cash back on a maximum expendi- ture of $US2M accrued whilst filming in the country. The TTFC\u2019s outreach pro- gramme takes filmmaking techniques into schools and with the assistance of the all-ACP films project, has sponsored the participation of T & T\u2019s filmmakers at festivals. T & T\u2019s landscapes have been scouted for the Lost and Survivor TV shows. Participation at more film festivals, more co-productions and transfer of skills with Latin America, India and Africa are all part of future planning. www.trinidadandtobagofilm.com T & T\u2019s film industry Diversification drive D.P. \u201cT he Chamber of Industry and Commerce has been talking about this for two or three years, but now the economic downturn has happened, it will definitely be something that has to be taken more seriously than before\u201d, says Angella Persad, President of T & T\u2019s Chamber of Commerce which represents 570 private businesses. At the beginning of the decade, for seven or eight years, the country experienced tremendous annual growth of 8-10 per cent, largely because of high government revenues from the oil and gas sector.

A lot of our services went down too as they were servicing the oil and gas sectors\u201d, she adds. The economy is now stable, she says, although 2010 is expected to be the second consecutive year the country has experienced nega- tive growth. Last year, T & T\u2019s Chamber of Commerce commissioned a study on areas with the potential to generate exchange, including agricultural products; cocoa, (T & T pro- duces one of the best in the world but it is exported raw with little added value), green pineapples and tilapia (a fish). Deosaran Jagroo, Chief Executive Officer of Caroni , T & T\u2019s former sugar company, told The Courier that it was moving ahead with diversification into other agricultural pro- duction for which it has received some EU financial support (see interview with EU\u2019s Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires), including pumpkins, tomatoes and sweet potatoes. Persad says that another potential growth sector is ter- tiary education \u2013 some British and United States-based universities already having links with higher education institutions in T & T \u2013 also tourism. Tremendous potential Tourism today accounts for just 13 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) but it \u201chas a significant role to play in diversifying the economy\u201d, Rupert Griffith, Minister for Tourism in the new government, told The Courier , especially in hosting business and sports events. Angella Persad says that T & T\u2019s unique cultural blend is, \u201csomething tremendous that can be packaged\u201d. In this rich mix are: food (street specialities; \u2018doubles\u2019 and \u2018bake and shark\u2019 (a shark burger) at Maracas Bay, Trinidad); architecture (notably the \u2018magnificent seven\u2019 his- torical buildings around Port of Spain\u2019s Savannah); festivals and its heritage; Amerindians, African and East Indian settlers and British, Dutch, French, Spanish and Courlander (Latvian) colo- nisers. The former People\u2019s National Movement (PNM) government picked out other industries with growth potential; food and beverages, shipping, yachting, film and entertainment, fish and fish process- ing, printing and packaging, to give T & T developed country status by 2020. The outgoing government also invested in the financial services sector, building a new International Financial Centre, now a landmark in the Waterfront area of Port of Spain to accommodate finan- cial services companies, although the building is still largely unoccupied. It also spearheaded the development of Tamana In-TECH Park to house high- tech companies. Are \u2018Nollywood\u2019 and T & T\u2019s budding film industry in competition under EU trade policies? In parallel to diversifying the economy, Persad says the government also has to seek out new markets. Central America, she feels, has potential. Mahindra Satram Maharaj, Chairman of the National Carnival Foundation and one of the Directors of the Trinidad and Tobago Coalition of Services Industries (TTCSI)*, also sees scope to export products and expertise from its long Carnival tradition, including to the 700 festivals that take place every year in Europe. He told us of plans to mount a T & T trade mission to Europe, \u201cto ascertain the benefits\u201d of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), a free trade agreement signed between the EU and members of the Caribbean trading bloc, CARIFORUM, in 2008. TTCSI\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Nirad Tewarie, fears that the EPA could undermine the traditional South-South cooperation pro- moted by the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group since the individual regional EPAs pitch regions against one another. \u2018Nollywood\u2019 (the Nigerian film industry) could end up competing with T & T\u2019s budding industry, he said. * See: www.ttcsi.org Peppers on sale at San Juan Market \u00a9 D Percival T & T is known worldwide for the quality of its cocoa \u00a9 D Percival Trinidad and Tobago Report ",
        "52 C urier The Report Trinidad and Tobago Biodiversity v. Industrialisation Trinidad and Tobago needs to find new ways to confront the \u2018classic clash\u2019 of the protection of a rich biodiversity pitched against industrialisation, says world renowned Trinbagonian biolo- gist, Professor John Agard of T & T\u2019s St. Augustine Campus of the University of the West Indies. D.P. I n geological terms Trinidad and Tobago is a relatively new country, having disconnected from the South American mainland just 10,000 to 11,000 years ago. It means a distinc- tive South American fauna and flora (akin to Brazil\u2019s and Guyana\u2019s) yet, like many other Antillean islands, it has a high number of indige- nous fauna and flora including birds, rep- tiles, butterflies, frogs, marine turtles and mammals. \u201cOn a world tabulation of species per square metre, Trinidad and Tobago is right up in the top group which is quite extraordinary\u201d, says Professor Agard, who heads St. Augustine\u2019s Department of Life Sciences. Yet the twin-island state of Trinidad and Tobago is one of only two islands in the world that are net exporters of oil and related products, Bahrain being the other. It is the world\u2019s largest exporter of ammo- nia, the fifth largest exporter of liquefied natural gas and one of the top exporters of both ethanol and urea, says Professor Agard. Oil and gas fuelled industriali- sation means thought is being given to evaluating \u201cecosystem services provided by the biodiversity\u201d, he adds. One such service is what Professor Agard refers to as \u2018evapotranspiration\u2019 due to the fact that over a half of Trinidad and Tobago has forest vegetation. The forested areas cause moisture in the atmosphere to rise where it cools and rains in other non- forested areas. Tobago\u2019s Main Ridge Reserve is one of the oldest protected areas in the Western hemisphere. \u201cThere is a lovely document dating back to the 1600s declaring it a protected area for the preservation of the rains\u201d, says Professor Agard. Other \u2018ecosystem services\u2019 are the development of pharmaceuticals from plants and the erosion protection through coral reefs. A study done in Tobago by the World Resources Institute, together with some associations in Trinidad and Tobago, found that the coastline in Tobago is eroding faster where there are no coral reefs. It puts the value of erosion services of coral at US$30M per annum, a not inconsiderable sum given that Tobago has a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US$250M per annum. Lines of communication Together with other scientists and econo- mists, Professor Agard says he is working on an EU-funded study that is using the economists\u2019 bag of tricks to a do a proper cost/benefit analysis of ecosystem services in T & T. Although reluctant to place a value on everything, he sees advantages in Toucan, a bird native to Trinidad. \u00a9 shutterstock \u201cUnlike climate change, biodiversity is not on the lips of all the presidents and prime ministers\u201d ",
        "53 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 Trinidad and Tobago Report this type of approach since it opens lines of communications with the decision- makers on biodiversity who would oth- erwise view biologists as, \u2018hysterical tree huggers\u2019. This allows planning choices to be made, he says; the economic benefits of building a hotel weighed against the destruction done by blasting out coral for hotel construction. Another biodiversity service is eco-tour- ism. \u201cTobago has a unique character; low level development, mostly original vegeta- tion, ancient forests and a more genteel atmosphere. People like its \u2018islandness\u2019; the mangroves, coral, different vegeta- tion culture, its way of speaking. This has a value and without the biodiversity, this advantage would disappear\u201d, says Professor Agard. He says that naturally occurring bacteria that break down oil present in oil seeps on Trinidad are also being researched. \u201cIn the Convention on Biological Diversity, a target was set years ago for no significant loss of biodiversity by 2010 and this has not happened anywhere in the world\u201d, says Professor Agard. He would like biodiversity to have the same global status as climate change including the setting up of an Intergovernmental Panel. \u201cUnlike climate change, biodiversity is not on the lips of all the presidents and prime ministers\u201d, he says, adding, \u201cit costs more the longer you wait\u201d. And in Trinidad and Tobago, Professor Agard feels the government should embark on more long-term planning about where the country is heading beyond the exhaustible resources of oil and gas. This should include more emphasis on protecting biodiversity and encouraging renewable energy and a more information-based and services economy, not forgetting the need for more and better managed protected areas to preserve biodiversity, he says.

Jaramogi pioneered the project 27 years ago with her late husband, Tacuma and a \u201cbunch of people squatting in the hills\u201d. Now a community of 27 people, it sells organic plants and seedlings and is a place where schools, other groups and individuals go to find out more about the medicinal benefits of the flora on well- maintained trails cut through the forest vegetation. She explains how the forest cover also creates a fire climax zone, pre- venting the spread of fire towards heavily populated Port of Spain. The Community has been able to develop with backing from international donors, including a small grant from a three-year project, \u2018Practices and policies that improve forest management and the livelihoods of the rural poor in the insular Caribbean\u2019, funded under the European Commission\u2019s (EC\u2019s) Programme on Tropical Forests and other Forests in Developing Countries. Run by the T & T-based Caribbean Natural Resources Institute (CANARI) the project is empowering local communities to take the lead in forest management in similar projects in eight Caribbean nations, ex- plains Nicole Leotaud, CANARI\u2019s Execu- tive Director. Akilah Jaramogi would like to take the Fondes Amandes project to another level, including the development of an eco-tourism lodge where visitors can stay overnight. One issue she would also like to see resolved is the security of tenure of land occupied by Fondes Amandes to ensure the Community\u2019s longevity. Trailblazers: Fondes Amandes ",

S he is wearing a cool cotton dress from her own range in a fresh blue and white floral print for our meeting in Port of Spain together with Don Grant who is an organiser of Fashion Week. It would be a bestseller in any summer collection anywhere in the World. After 20 years in the busi- ness, Canada-trained Dianne Hunt, who is chair of fashion week, says her brand needs new development. She used to have 13 stores throughout the Caribbean but now owns just two in Trinidad and two in Tobago due to sluggish sales over the last four years, mainly because of competition from cheap garments made in China. Hot on the heels of the success of the third edition of T & T Fashion Week, held in Tobago, 20-31 May and Trinidad 2-6 June, she says it\u2019s time to revive her business. She\u2019s hopeful that her brother, Gary Hunt, who exited politics at the last general election in May, will draw up a new business plan for the label which is still 90 per cent \u2018Made in T & T\u2019. New inves- tment in industries with potential, says Dianne Hunt, is part of the long term 2020 vision for the country launched by the outgoing government. Dianne Hunt was just one of 50 Trinbagonian designers, including some of the country's nationals who live and work overseas, showcased at Fashion Week. Taking the event to the public, models strutted their stuff around the 2.2 miles (3.5 km) perimeter of Port of Spain\u2019s Savannah Park; \u201cunofficially the longest runway in the world\u201d, says Don Grant. Celeste Vincent, whose \u2018Johnny Vincent\u2019 label is worn by the Bajan sin- ger/superstar Rihanna, is another of the country\u2019s top designers. A Caribbean aesthetic What are Dianne Hunt's influences? \u201cThe Caribbean aesthetic: rum shops, relaxed lifestyle, colourful characters and integrated races. The Caribbean is the future. If you put all the people of the world together they would reflect the Caribbean.\u201d Growing up in Trinidad, she used to sketch clothes and made brooches which were much in demand from school friends, attaching a signature feather from her grandmother\u2019s chickens. The biggest challenge faced by the country\u2019s fashion designers, she says, is to raise capital. She also has ambitions to design and make her own fabrics, noting that \u2018Sea Island Cotton\u2019 grown on neighbouring Barbados is highly sought after by fashion houses around the globe. And Dianne Hunt feels that the production of fabric from bamboo currently being trialled in the country, has potential. Work has already started on next year\u2019s Fashion Week with a theme of \u2018Water\u2019. A former international model and now an actor, Don Grant is clearly upset by the effects of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The need to protect the Caribbean natural inheritance and fragile ecosystems is a message Fashion Week endeavours to put across.

        "55 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 EU by T & T\u2019s side in economic diversification D.P. W hat are the EU\u2019s priorities in Trinidad and Tobago (T & T) under the 10th EDF (2008-2013)? To assist the country in its efforts to diver- sify from oil and gas into other sectors and to help improve some areas of governance. There\u2019s also a Technical Cooperation Facility (TFC) to support implementa- tion activities for achieving the objectives of the National Indicative Programme (NIP). Almost everything we do in T & T is through sectoral budget support. The first sector budget support pro- gramme in T & T is the on-going 9th EDF programme in non- university tertiary education (\u20ac27.3M). The EU\u2019s support to the decision of the government to diver- sify out of sugar and minimise the socio- economic and envi- ronmental impacts of such a decision is also a sector budget support-based programme. Some regional projects are also being run from here \u2013 (those where the regio- nal organisations concerned have Port of Spain based headquarters); the CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (IMPACS) which fights against crime and drugs trafficking, the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) which is fighting money laundering \u2013 also linked to drugs traffic- king \u2013, the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) and the Caribbean Meteorological Organisation. Forty per cent of cocaine consumed in Europe is thought to tran- sit this sub-region and the bulk perhaps through T & T, so there is a mutual inter- est in backing the efforts of the gover- nment and authorities to fight against illegal drug trafficking. Other priorities are trade cooperation and implementa- tion of the EU-CARIFORUM Economic Partnership Agreement (Ed: up and run- ning since October 2008). What are the advantages of sectoral budget support for T & T? T & T is a middle income developing country, which has enough capacity to implement projects. What it needs now is international donors to act as partners in its efforts to improve its sector policies. With the sector budget support approach, rather than projects, you focus on a sector. Performance indica- tors are jointly agreed with the government, progress monitored and actions chosen. We are still focusing on non-university ter- tiary education. With sectoral support, the number of students enrolled has already gone from 20,000 in 2005/06 to over 75,000 in 2009. While we are still in preliminary policy dialogue and we do not know yet what we are going to do in the area of governance under the 10th EDF, we are more advanced with diversification. We are trying to help improve the enabling conditions for Trinidad and Tobago to become more competitive, dialoguing on a regulatory framework, and incentive-based fiscal and macro-economic indicators, but it is not our business to say whether the gover- nment should diversify into tourism, or aeronautics, because we don\u2019t know how competitive the country can be. Trinidad and Tobago Report Stelios Christopoulos is the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires of the European Union\u2019s Delegation in Port of Spain. In an inter- view with The Courier, he explains the EU\u2019s sectoral approach to disbursing the \u20ac25M of development assistance ear- marked for the country under the EU\u2019s 10th European Development Fund (EDF) which targets diversification of economy and governance. Stelios Christopoulos, Head of EU Delegation, T & T \u00a9 D Percival \u201cTo be effective in our efforts of clamping down on drugs trafficking in Europe, we must also do things here to help the authorities prevent drug trafficking more efficiently\u201d ",
        "56 C urier The In our support to the sugar adaptation strategy, although measurable targets were set, we felt that these could have been more ambitious. In 2007, when we started the sugar support programme, food-related inflation was around 25 per cent. We suggested that some of the \u20ac43M earmarked (T & T\u2019s allocation for 2007-2010 under the \u2018Accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol Countries\u2019 of which an initial tranche of \u20ac2.5M has been disbursed to date) might be spent on restructuring farming to retain more farmers, but the former government was not very keen to do this. Farming accounts for just 0.7 per cent of GDP in a country known for the quality of its products and where 15-20 per cent of its population are farmers. I believe that people would be more satisfied if the [new] government considers the possibility of diversifying into other food production cultures. You point out that T &T has a per capita GDP matching that of Portugal. How would you explain to EU citizens that the country still needs develop- ment assistance? The EU has to make sure that the deve- loping world also stabilises. You need to help the country to use the money in the right way to achieve its developed nation objective [Ed: the former government\u2019s vision was for T & T to reach developed country status by 2020]. The country is conscious of a gap between wealth and development: ten per cent of the popula- tion has no access to running water. The right sectoral policies are required. Our assistance is not enormous because what the country is doing in tertiary educa- tion is many times more than the funds we are giving; the same can be said for transforming the sugar sector, but T & T is appreciative that we are by their side in the process. Look too at the fight against crime: according to the press, there have been more than 300 reported murders since the beginning of 2010 in a country of 1.3M people, sixty per cent of which were allegedly related to trafficking cocaine, coming to more than 500 murders annually for 2010, or around 42 murders per 100,000, a figure that would put T & T amongst the five top countries in the world when it comes to murder. Indeed, a big amount of cocaine [ Ed : from South America] is transiting through T & T to West Africa and on to Europe. It is in our interests to have a good working partnership. To be effective in our efforts of clamping down on drugs trafficking in Europe, we must also do things here to help the authorities prevent drug tra- fficking more efficiently. What are the benefits of the EPA for T & T? Both manufacturing and services can benefit. By reducing the tariffs on pro- ducts that are imported from Europe, the price of some basic components of products manufactured in T & T will also go down which will help to reduce the cost of products so they can become more competitive. For the time being, the sectors likely to gain the most are tourism and health-related services, pro- vided that the security situation improves dramatically. Also cultural cooperation: for example, Carnival has created a whole school of culture, costumes, music groups, dancing groups. There are impediments such as meeting the high level standards in Europe for all products. The same goes for services; you don\u2019t want to get involved in a business partnership if you aren\u2019t certain about the professional standards of that partner. On a regional basis, a \u20ac36M sum is available under the 10th EDF\u2019s \u20ac165M regional package to assist Caribbean nations in meeting those stan- dards.

C hattering coconut trees, hidden sandy coves, sleepy fishing villages such as Charlotteville, and translucent coral reefs have drawn tourists to Tobago although hotel occupancy has slipped during the global economic downturn, according to Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Tourism Association. But it\u2019s easy to see why the island won the World Travel Awards\u2019 top eco-tourism destination in four consecu- tive years from 2003 to 2006. Its Main Ridge Reserve is the oldest protected forest in the western hemisphere and leatherback turtles, a critically endan- gered species, lay their eggs on Tobago\u2019s secluded beaches from March to June, the hatchlings emerging 55 to 70 days later. As Tobagonians say, their island is a place to \u201cbreeze out\u201d. Amerindian tribes, were thought to have settled on the island (the island takes its name from the Taino word for tobacco or pipe, \u2018Tabago\u2019) 10,000 years ago.and it remained in their hands until 1652. The first European settlers to arrive were the Courlanders (Latvians), the island changing hands a reported 33 times bet- ween Courland, Spain, England, France, Sweden and the Dutch republic. The Europeans established sugar, cocoa and coconut plantations and with a shortage of labour, they brought in African slaves. East Indians came to Trinidad under an indentureship system to work on the sugar plantations; a small percentage of them settled in Tobago. In 1783, Portuguese, Chinese, Syrian and Lebanese popula- tions arrived and others from Barbados, Grenada and Trinidad. In 1814, Tobago became part of the British Empire administered alongside Grenada, the Grenadines, Dominica and St Vincent, and in 1889 was united with Trinidad in a British crown colony, becoming inde- pendent with Trinidad in 1962. Tourism accounts for 60 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accor- ding to House of Assembly statistics and 15,000 workers are involved in all tourism services from running of guest house inns to bike rentals. More powers for Assembly? Tobago has its own House of Assembly for its 55,000 population, established in 1980 with its own budget from central government. In 2010, funding from T & T\u2019s central government (recurrent & deve- lopment assistance) will total an estimated $1.77bn T & T, according to Assembly figures. The Assembly can make decisions on where the money from central govern- ment goes, such as health and education, but it cannot collect taxes or establish local laws. It has 12 elected members and four appointed councillors; three on the Chief Secretary\u2019s advice and one on the advice of the minority leader.

An NGO, the Buccoo Reef Trust, is at the frontline in conserving the reef, collecting a raft of scientific data which is of use to the wider Caribbean. Ten thousand years old and covering 7 km2, it is the third largest reef in the western hemisphere with several species of corals and many sea creatures. As well as protecting the coastline, with an estimated annual income of $US119, 164M annually, it is important in tourism terms and provides many families with a livelihood. It was declared a protected area in 1973 under the Marine Areas Act in 1970 but Buccoo Trust Director, Kaye Trotman, told The Courier that it is more of a \u201cpaper park\u201d with a need to step up enforcement and public awareness about conservation. One project run by the NGO is the Land Use Planning and Watershed Restora- tion in the Courland Watershed and Buc- coo Reef Area Demonstration. Its project manager, Sandra Timothy, explains that increasing deforestation and poor farm- ing practices in the watershed have in- creased pollution in the reef. She has led land activities such as re-afforestation. The reef also suffered from the bleaching of coral that occurred Caribbean-wide in 2005. Although the reef\u2019s coral has 75 per cent recovered, there needs to be constant data collection and \u201ceducation, education, education\u201d about conservation, says Buccoo Reef Director, Kaye Trotman. The Buccoo Reef Trust has also taken the lead in a three-year regional pro- ject, the Coastal and Marine Manage- ment and Education in the South East- ern Caribbean (CaMMESEC) with the International Coral Reef Action Network (ICRAN) to exchange best practices on conservation of all the regions reefs in- cluding the setting up of Marine Parks, explains the project\u2019s coordinator for the Buccoo Reef Trust, Hyacinth Armstrong.

As Tobagonians say, their island is a place to \u201cbreeze out\u201d But at central government level, the two parliamentarians who represent Tobago are both from TOP, one of the parties which form the central T & T government\u2019s People\u2019s Partnership. We asked the Chief Secretary of Tobago\u2019s House of the Assembly, Orville London, whether the lack of representation of the House of Assembly\u2019s majority in T & T\u2019s Parliament might create an untenable position for the Assembly. \u201cThere is nothing unique about our political situa- tion\u201d, he replied. He said, however, that it would test the validity of the House of Assembly Act. Although there is no ground swell for independence from Trinidad, he told The Courier , there is room for reform. \u201cWe have a situation where there is no empowerment. The House of Assembly has no teeth or authority to act in Tobago\u201d, he added. He wants to see a greater level of autonomy to give the Assembly law- making authority in matters pertaining to Tobago and an ability to draw up financial agreements with local and international agencies without the say of the govern- ment in Port of Spain.

        "59 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 \u2018Visionary Africa\u2019 is a major cultural event to mark Belgium\u2019s presidency of the European Union (1 July to 31 De- cember 2010). It also celebrates the 50th anniversary of independence of 17 African countries. Supported by the Belgian government, the European Commission and the Secretariat of the ACP Group. It takes place from 30 May to 26 September 2010. The ACP Group, according to its Secre- tary general, Mohamed Ibn Chambas, considers this festival as \u201c the start of framing a long term vision of our rela- tion to the Africa cultural heritage and African art, in Africa and Europe alike \u201d. At the major \u2018Visionary Africa\u2019 festival at BOZAR (Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels), the headline exhibition \u2018GEO-graphics\u2019* and a wide range of other graphic arts and photography shows are enjoying great success, providing a dazzling window on the performing arts in Africa. The African country with the strongest historical links to Belgium, and also one of the crea- tive stars, is the Congo (DRC), which is particularly well represented. The festival takes place from 30 May to 26 September 2010. H.G. T he most spectacular \u2018Visionary Africa\u2019 event is undoubtedly the major concert \u201850 years of Congolese music\u2019, premiered in Kinshasa on 30 June and on an inter- national level exclusively performed at BOZAR on 16 July. This concert is the heart of \u2018Congo@Bozar\u2019, a festival within the festival. Most of the big names of the Congolese scene are there \u2013 Papa Wemba, Mbilia Bel, Werrason, Ferre Gola, Simaro and many others \u2013 and the renowned arranger Hilaire Ma\u00efka Munan is the artistic director. The show is designed as homage to now-departed greats such as Kall\u00e9 Jeff, creator of the evergreen \u2018Ind\u00e9pendance Cha Cha\u2019, in its time the hymn of Africa\u2019s quest for freedom, later to be transformed into despondency and disenchantment after the continent lost its way in the period after independence. \u2018Congo@Bozar\u2019 also involves a full pro- gramme of gospel concerts in different areas of Brussels, and acoustic rumba shows which each pay their respects to a particular period or personality of Congolese music, with the participation of the stars of \u201850 years of Congolese music\u2019. Other African stage artists and the Diaspora are far from being outdone, how- ever. Malian singer Rokia Traor\u00e9, award- winner at the BBC3 World Music Award and the French Victoires de la Musique and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 and Papa Wemba, has cast a spell on audiences with her Mandingo music, with its harsh sounds and winks at rock and blues. The same is true of the Beninese author, composer, singer, guitarist and 2007 Grammy Award winner Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, who has collabo- rated with Santana, Herbie Hancock and Peter Gabriel. Didier Awadi\u2019s performance takes us back to the illustrious history of rap. Awadi has orchestrated a show entitled \u2018Presidents of Africa\u2019, based on the speeches of the founding fathers of African independence and the writings of the major thinkers of the Diaspora. This forms an integral part of a special \u2018Day of Literature\u2019. And film plays its part in \u2018Visionary Africa\u2019 as well \u2013 it is the scene for the world pre- miere of Claus Wishman and Martin Baer\u2019s film \u2018Kinshasa Symphony\u2019, about the Kinshasa Symphony Orchestra, a group set up at the peak of instability and civil war by non-professionals with no more than what they themselves could contribute. Among other genres, the Orchestra plays classical European music with a rare sensibility, and their interpretation of Carmina Burana is a true hymn to joy and to life. It is easy to believe that most listeners have not been able to hold back tears of emotion. * See issue 17 of The Courier , pg. 62. See Agenda for more on \u2018Visionary Africa\u2019.

        "60 C urier The Creativity CONGO 50 Increased ACP support for the film industry Read now Mich\u00e8le Dominique Raymond ACP Assistant Secretary-General, Head of the Department of Political Affairs and Human Development Comic strip on 50 years of the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo The Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival was awarded to \u2018A Screaming Man\u2019 by the Chadian director Mahamat Saleh Haroun, financed by ACP Films. H.G. T his comic strip about DRC is a magical tour de force, or rather comic strips, as eight Congolese cartoonists pooled their talents to create and record on paper this exciting and frenzied story, like eight stanzas of a piece of music. To ensure con- tinuity between the comic strips, the car- toonists Asimba Bathy, Cara Bulaya, Jules Ba\u00efsol\u00e9, Didier Kawend\u00e9, Fati Kabuika, Djemba Djeis, Tshamala Tetshim and Jason Kibiswa associate the talented Alain Br\u00e9zault as script coordinator. He was also responsible for overseeing the production. The result is a comic strip which is full of emotion but which is free of fanaticism or extreme viewpoints \u2026 and difficult to put down. It is all told at an exhilarating pace. The title of the first comic strip is \u2018Ind\u00e9pendance cha-cha\u2019. \u2018Congo 50\u2019 by Asimba Bathy & co / Ed. Roularta Books www.roulartabooks.be and Africalia www.africalia.be Interview by H.G. \u201cI t is an historic event for an African film to be included in the Official Selection and to win an award at Cannes. The ACP Group and its Secretariat make no secret of their delight at the award. They see it as homage to, as well as a reward for their cultural policy which is designed to complement rather than be an alternative to the many programmes that have been implemented which are encour- aging sustainable development and the progressive integration of their countries into the world economy. The ACP-EU support programmes for the ACP film and audiovisual sector and ACP culture industries are the concrete expression of this policy. By the time the programmes are completed, the aim is that the ACP countries will have well-trained profes- sionals and quality films. Many festivals are already beginning to show an interest in ACP productions. Yet again, the very talented Mahamat Saleh Haroun has highlighted the poten- tial of the ACP film industry. The excel- lent performances by the actors draw attention to the pool of talent that exists in Africa and by extension in Caribbean and Pacific countries. The ACP Group, in continuing to provide its unflagging support for the cinema and audiovisual sector, hopes to see a repeat of this fantastic experience.\u201d HG - Does the film itself have a mes- sage for the ACP countries? It is true that the film contains a message for citizens of ACP states and beyond, in that the drama experienced by Adam, while peculiar to him, also invokes uni- versal existentialist concerns. A man with no future and no prospects and who is in danger of being robbed of what little he has finds the means to regain his dignity and maintain his freedom and ability to provide for himself. The story, filmed by Mahamat Saleh Haroun, is simple and very human. It deals with poverty, the effects of economic globalisation and war. In doing so, it encourages the audience to reflect on such issues. Mich\u00e8le Dominique Raymond. \u00a9 Photo ACP Secretariat ",
        "61 N. 18 N.E. \u2013 July August 2010 Creativity A.M.R. W hat is your professional history in the field of music? At the age of 12, I moved to Paris from Senegal. In the early 1980s, I started to get involved with Cape Verdean culture, through the local Association of Cape Verdeans, which organises the \u2018Cape Verdean Week in Paris\u2019. Then, I founded a group of Cape Verdean musicians, in which I played percussion. We started to play for the Diaspora, first in Paris, then in Rotterdam, Switzerland and Rome. As part of this experience I received \u2018trai- ning\u2019 on topics such as contracts, locations and logistics. Throughout this time, I was employed by the French Railways and worked with singers during my free time. Following requests for support from various Cape Verdean groups, I set up a small, informal company that organised Cape Verdean concerts in Paris. I met Cesaria Evora in 1987, at the musi- cian and cultural promoter Bana\u2019s Monte Cara restaurant in Lisbon, and in 1988 I founded LUSAFRICA in Paris. What difficulties did you encounter in promoting Cape Verdean music to the European public? In the beginning it was not easy. I star- ted to promote Cesaria Evora at celebra- tions and concerts, mostly amongst the Diaspora in Paris and Rotterdam. But the aim was to reach a public which did not belong to the Cape Verdean Diaspora. In 1989, Brazilian Lambada music was becoming popular, and there was growing interest in Cape Verde\u2019s slow dancing music. We produced the albums La Diva Aux Pieds Nus (1988) and Mar Azul (1991), which resembled the typical style of \u2018Noite Caboverdiana\u2019 (Capeverdean Night), the latter selling 50,000 copies. In 1992, we organised the first concert for a non-Diaspora audience, at the Angouleme Festival. Immediately after this, Miss Perfumado , Cesaria\u2019s most important album, was released, selling 400,000 copies in France and 800,000 copies internationally. That year was a turning point, because I was able to stop working for the railways and open a LUSAFRICA office in Paris. LUSAFRICA currently has offices in Paris, Lisbon and Prague. What\u2019s the secret of your success? Today I work in 60 countries and my artists have received important awards. I pro- mote artists from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and LUSAFRICA is well known all over the world. In addi- tion to our production and distribution companies in Lisbon and Prague, we have also founded the company Armonia , in Cape Verde. But we never received public funding for any of this work. Our success is due to the public\u2019s passion for Cesaria and our other artists. Jos\u00e9 da Silva and Cesaria Evora \u00a9 LUSAFRICA. Jos\u00e8 da Silva is the manager of Cape Verdean singer Cesaria Evora, and his company, LUSAFRICA Productions , represents a true success story in Africa\u2019s cultural industry. The Courier met him at the \u2018Girona Conference on Culture and Development\u2019, which was held on 4 and 5 May and organised by the Spanish Agency for Development Cooperation and the EC\u2019s DG Development.

        "62 C urier The The Biennial Visual Arts Festival \u2018 Regard B\u00e9nin 1.0 \u2019 Sandra Federici T he festival has been organi- sed by the Benin Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with Culturesfrance and the French Embassy in Benin, with the aim of \u201caffirming Benin as a place for the promotion of artists at the national and international levels\u201d. The desire to mark 50 years of independence in Africa has also been an important factor behind the promotion of the thriving arts scene in Benin. The Zinsou Foundation (see The Courier special issue on \u2018ACP Culture and Development\u2019, June 2009), Espace Tchif and the Laboratorio Association are just a few of the many organisations partici- pating in the festival. All events are free, and artists\u2019 studios are open to the public. The Zinsou Foundation has organised several exhibitions, including \u2018Raconte- moi l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance\u2019, an historical exhi- bition which aims to raise awareness amongst young people in Benin of the historic day of 1 August 1960 \u2013 when independence was gained \u2013 through the accounts of Beninese citizens, both famous and unknown. The Foundation has also organised an exhibition of two photographers, Malick Sidib\u00e9 from Burkina Faso and Baudouin Mouanda from Congo Brazzaville, who belong to different generations (the former is 74 and the latter is 29 years old) and represent the same subject from different historical points of view. The subject is the irresisti- ble need of African youths to distinguish themselves and to define a place for them- selves in a strict and repressive society, in a way which is often ironic and provocative. The Laboratorio Association has orga- nised \u2018Focus Zinkp\u00e9\u2019, a retrospective of the installations, drawings and paintings of the famous Beninese artist Dominique Zinkp\u00e9, which will be on display at the Abomey Museum until 30th August. The exhibition includes the famous Zinkp\u00e9 taxis, a typical means of transportation which was imported from the West and adapted to the economic and social sys- tems present on the African continent. Laboratorio also presented the work of the Beninese artist G\u00e9rard Qu\u00e9num, who is internationally renowned for his distinc- tive style of sculpture which makes use of recycled objects (mostly discarded dolls), whose diverse origins contribute to the overall significance of the pieces. Another interesting initiative that forms part of the varied programme of the festival is the \u2018Footculture\u2019 initiative, organised by Espace Tchif. This initia- tive is dedicated to football and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The venue has organised a range of events, including concerts, an exhibition that explores soc- cer through the eyes of artists, debates between sports experts and, of course, World Cup matches shown on big screens. Creativity The inaugural edition of \u2018Regard B\u00e9nin\u2019 ('a look at Benin') opened on 8 June and will run until 31 August 2010, in the Beninese cities of Cotonou, Porto-Novo, Abomey and Ouidah. This is the first biennial festival of visual arts in Benin, and features exhibitions and performances in various disciplines, including art, photography, music and dance.

[Issue 16] celebrates youth. We the young people of the world, and of Africa in partic- ular, welcome this very much. My message is addressed especially to young Africans from all the continent\u2019s many countries who face huge difficulties. I call upon these young people, of whom I am one, to be more determined than ever and to adopt the thinking of the new and emerging Africa. I ask them to believe in themselves and to stop thinking that without aid we are lost. To make an effort to silence the divisions of all kinds (ethnic, racial, etc.), to commit themselves to the common cause, that of a united and emerging Africa. Yes we can! On the sole and unique condition that we are committed to it, that we believe in it, and that we work for it. In short, that we ourselves resolve to think differently, to act differently, to behave differently, than we do at present. Long live Africa. Long live African Youth!
