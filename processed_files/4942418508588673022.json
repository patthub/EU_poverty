        "3 Abstract This report is meant to document the use of the Global Food Security Index (GFSI) to inform the food security situation in countries of interest for DEVCO. Since the GFSI is a composite indicator, a clear understanding of its modelling choices is needed to insure a well-informed use of the indicator. The reports is structures as follows. In the introduction of the report, we briefly remind the usual flow of composite indicators and derive the specific implications for measuring countries food security. The second section presents the conceptual framework behind the GFSI and the 2016 results. The assessment of the indicator follows. First, the conceptual framework is examined and the scope of the GFSI is defined. Second, the robustness of the GFSI country ranking is tested against the presence of outliers and missing values, and, against a change of the weighting scheme and aggregation method. In its 2016 release, the GFSI score was computed for 113 countries. Among the 62 DEVCO priority countries, 37 countries received a GFSI score. The classification is globally consistent with other food security ranking. Yet, several country ranks are different from what is obtained with other food security indicators. The indicators included in the GFSI are indeed covering only a portion of the food security determinants. Moreover, the age of the data varies across countries and indicators. For example, countries hit by the 2015-2016 El Nino phenomenon rank better than expected because the impact of El Nino was not recorded in the indicator used for computing the score. The review of conceptual framework indicates that the GFSI has to be interpreted as a food security environment rating. It focuses on the food security determinants rather than on the food security outcomes. It includes some of the usual food security determinants such as food supply, food share in total expenditure, poverty or nutritional policies and enlarges to less direct determinants like access to financial services, corruption, political stability and so on. It thus only partially overlap with existing food security indicators. Indicators included in the GFSI are measured at the national level and not at the household level. Inequality indicators are not included. The GFSI is thus measuring the average situation in the countries rather than focusing on food insecure households. The GFSI exhibits good statistical properties. The GFSI is statistically coherent and robust to changes in the weight and aggregation methods. The data coverage is good and the effect of outliers on the final score is not important. The indicators are on average ",
        "4 strongly correlated with their respective dimension and the principal component analysis suggests that the three dimensions composing the GFSI are indeed apprehending one single phenomenon. The uncertainty analysis also shows that although a few country ranks in the GFSI are sensitive to the methodological choices, the published GFSI ranking can be considered, for the vast majority of countries, robust to variations in the weighting scheme and the aggregation method. Yet we note that the information contents of two indicators and two variables are lost at the dimension and overall index levels. In addition, the comparison of the weighting scheme with the statistical importance of each indicator suggests that there are differences between these two measures of importance. While this might have been done intentionally by the developers of the GFSI, this could be clarified. It is thus recommended to use the GFSI in conjunction with other indicator of food insecurity namely those measuring the outcomes of food security in terms of food consumption and the nutritional status of the population. ",
        "5 1 Introduction Tracking progress towards global food security is critical for designing and evaluating policies and programs. Nonetheless, finding appropriate indicators is challenging. It has been discussed widely that the concept of food security is multidimensional, dynamic and even context specific. The complexity of the concept, compounded by the challenge of collecting data led to a veritable proliferation of indicators in the last two decades (Hoddinott 1999; CFS 2011). The Global Food Security Index (GFSI) is a composite indicator aiming at monitoring progress towards food security at country level. It was designed by the Economist Intelligence Unit and sponsored by DuPont. It is produced annually since 2012 and covers more than 100 countries. The conceptual framework of the GFSI is based on three dimensions of food security - namely affordability, availability and quality and safety. It uses a total of 28 indicators grouped in 3 domains: affordability (6 indicators), availability (11 indicators), and quality and safety (11 indicators). The index focuses on contributing factors to food security rather than on outcomes such as food consumption or the nutritional status of the population. Data sources include the Economist Intelligence Unit database as well as World Bank, FAO, WFP, and the World Trade Organization indicators. The individual indicators included in the GFSI and their weight in the final score have been decided by an expert panel coming from the academic, non- profit, and public sectors. In this report, we will examine the soundness of the framework chosen and the statistical validity of the weight and aggregation method used. The choice of a composite indicator has the advantage to summarize a big amount of information in one unique score. It is a very appealing approach when monitoring countries food security progress because it simplifies dramatically trends analyses and comparisons between countries. However, if the composite is poorly constructed, interpreted or understood, it can lead to misleading conclusions and policy decisions. The pros and cons of composite indicators are well summarized in Table 1 copied from the OECD-JRC Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators (OECD-JRC, 2008). ",
        "6 Table 1 Pros and Cons of Composite Indicators. Pros and Cons of Composite indicators Pros Cons \u25cf Can summarize complex, multi- dimensional realities with a view to supporting decision makers \u25cf Are easier to interpret than a battery of many separate indicators \u25cf Can assess progress of countries over time \u25cf Reduce the visible size of a set of indicators without dropping the underlying information base \u25cf Make it possible to include more information within the existing size limit \u25cf Place issues of country performance and progress at the centre of the policy arena \u25cf Facilitate communication with general public (i.e citizens, media, etc) and promote accountability \u25cf Help to construct/underpin narratives for lay and literate audiences \u25cf Enable users to compare complex dimension \u25cf May send misleading policy message if poorly constructed or misinterpreted \u25cf May invite simplistic policy conclusions \u25cf May be misused e.g. support a desired policy if the construction process is not transparent and/or lacks sound statistical or conceptual principles \u25cf The selection of indicators and weights could be subject of political dispute \u25cf May disguise serious failings in some dimensions and increase the difficulty of identifying proper remedial action if the construction process is not transparent \u25cf May lead to inappropriate policies if dimensions that are difficult to measure are ignored Source: (OECD-JRC, 2008) The \u201cPros\u201d and \u201cCons\u201d are both exacerbated in the field of food security because it is a very complex concept that is not well defined in terms of measurement. This renders the construction of a composite indicator of food security both appealing and very daring 1 . The final index is necessarily partial and subject to dispute. It is then crucial to understand how the individual indicators included in the model have been selected, how the weight have been chosen, and more generally how the design of the indicators affects the results obtained. This report aims at enlightening what aspects of food security the GFSI is measuring. It tries to assess its fitness for purpose for measuring food insecurity in food insecurity prone countries. The goal is to understand the advantages and risks of using this index to inform decisions in selection and prioritization of countries (and at a less extent intervention areas) for fund allocation by the European Commission (DG DEVCO). To that 1 For example, the FAO preferred monitoring a set of individual indicators rather than computing a composite indicator (http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/ess-fadata/en/#.WeCx4tOCxaQ) ",
        "7 end, the theoretical soundness of the framework used for the construction of the GFSI is reviewed. A statistical assessment is conducted. It first evaluate the impact of missing data and outliers. Second, it compares the actual statistical importance of each indicator to its assigned weight. Third, it assesses the robustness of the weights schemes and the aggregation method. Finally, the countries ranking obtained with the GFSI is compared with the one obtained with the IFPRI Global Hunger Index (GHI) and the FAO Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU). ",
        "8 2 Conceptual Framework of the GFSI 2.1 Pillars, Aggregation and Weights The Global Food Security Index (GFSI) is produced annually since 2012 by the Economist Intelligence Unit and covers more than 100 countries. The conceptual framework of the GFSI, based on three dimensions of food security, namely affordability , availability and quality and safety. It is is summarized in Table 2. The three dimensions are populated by 19 indicators formed by 28 individual indicators . The indicators were selected on the basis of EIU expert analysis and consultation with a panel of food-security specialists. As mentioned in Table 2, the GFSI includes \uf0fc Quantitative indicators from national and international statistical organizations. Where there were missing values in quantitative or survey data, the EIU has used estimates. \uf0fc Qualitative indicators either created by the EIU, based on information from development banks and government websites, or drawn from a range of surveys and data sources and adjusted by the EIU Nine out of the 28 indicators are calculated by qualitative scoring by EIU analysts. Qualitative scoring requires the subjective judgement of the team of experts who designed. The qualitative scorings are summarized in Table 3. The main data sources used in the GFSI are the EIU, the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the World Food Programme (WFP), Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) and national statistical offices. Indicator scores are normalized (min-max rescaling) and are scaled from 0 to 100, with 100 corresponding to the most favorable situation. The scores at the dimension level correspond to the weighted mean of underlying indicators. The overall GFSI score is a weighted average of the dimension scores. The default weights (see Table 2) are averages of the weightings suggested by the members of an expert panel. To assess how the weighting scheme is affecting the final ranking of countries, an uncertainty analysis is conducted in section 3.2.5. ",

Depth indicates the quantity of funds available to recipients; breadth indicates the range of services available. Access to financing for farmers Measured on a 0-4 scale based on the depth and range of financing for farmers: 0 = Virtually no access to government or multilateral financing programmes (typically, but not necessarily, a developing economy). 1 = Limited multilateral or government financing programmes (typically, but not necessarily, a developing economy). 2 = Some multilateral or government financing (typically, but not necessarily, an emerging-market economy). 3 = Broad, but not deep, financing (typically, but not necessarily, a developed economy) OR well-developed multilateral financing programmes (typically, but not necessarily, an emerging-market economy). 4 = Access to deep financing (typically, but not necessarily, an advanced economy). Depth indicates the quantity of funds available; range covers credit and insurance. Dependence on chronic food aid Measured on a 0-2 scale: 0 = Received chronic food aid on an increasing basis over the past five years. 1 = Received chronic food aid on a decreasing basis over the past five years. 2 = Receives little or no food aid or received food aid only on an emergency basis.

For example, a national strategy covering 2010-20 would receive credit; a strategy covering 2010-15 would not receive credit. Credit may also be assigned if there is clear evidence that an expired strategy is currently being re-implemented or updated. Nutrition monitoring and surveillance A binary indicator that measures whether the government monitors the nutritional status of the general population. Examples of monitoring and surveillance include the collection of data on undernourishment, nutrition-related deficiencies, etc. 0 = No 1 = Yes Agency to ensure the safety and health of food Binary indicator that measures the existence of a regulatory or administrative agency to ensure the safety and health of food: 0 = No 1 = Yes Presence of formal grocery sector measured on a 0-2 scale: 0 = Minimal presence 1 = Moderate presence 2 = Widespread presence ",
        "11 2.2 Main results for the 2015 GFSI 2 In the June 2016 release of the GFSI country ranking, the GFSI score was computed for 113 countries. Among the 62 DEVCO priority countries, 37 countries received a GFSI score, as listed in Table 4. Table 4: List of DEVCO priority countries that received or did not received a GFSI score Country that did not received a GFSI score in 2016: 25/62 -40% Afghanistan Fiji Namibia CAR Suriname Bhutan Gambia North Korea Sao Tom\u00e9 Swaziland Cuba Guinea Bissau North Sudan* Solomon Islands Timor Djibouti Liberia OPT Somalia Vanuatu Eritrea Mauritania PNG South Sudan* Zimbabwe Country that did received a GFSI score in 2016 : 37/62-60% Angola Chad Honduras Nepal Sri Lanka Bangladesh Colombia Kenya Nicaragua Tanzania Benin Cote d\u2019Ivoire Laos Niger Uganda Bolivia Dem Rep Congo Madagascar Nigeria Yemen Burkina Faso Ethiopia Malawi Pakistan Zambia Burundi Ghana Mali Rwanda Cambodia Guatemala Mozambique Senegal Cameroon Haiti Myanmar Sierra Leone *: The GFSI gives a score for Sudan. It is not mentioned if Sudan means the former Sudan (North and South) or only North Sudan. The country ranking and the GFSI scores are summarized in Table 5. The bottom 5 countries are Congo (Dem. Rep.), Haiti, Mozambique, Niger, Chad, Sierra Leone and Burundi. The country ranking obtained with the GFSI will be compared with the one obtained with the PoU and the GHI in section 4. It may be worth noting that the GFSI is similar to a prevalence of food insecurity and not to the number of food insecure in absolute terms. For example, at the last place in the 2016 GFSI ranking (113/113), we find Burundi that has around 4 000 000 food insecure who represent 37% of the population in 2016, according to JRC, 2016, compared to a country like Ethiopia that rank much better (98/113) and that has a much larger number of food insecure, around 10 000 000 who represent 10 % of the population in 2016 according to JRC, 2016. 2 These are the latest results at the time of the writing of the report. They were published in June 2016. ",

        "13 The GFSI ranking does not capture the impact of El Nino on the food security. For example, in the 2016 GFSI ranking, South Africa, El Salvador and Guatemala ranks quite improved compared to the despite the important food security crisis linked to the consequences of El Nino. Similarly, Ethiopia improved its GFSI score in 2016 despite the large food crisis that hit the country following 2016 drought and floods. This supports what was already mentioned in section 2 that the GFSI does not capture the recent changes in the food security situation. Below, several cases are examined more thoroughly to illustrate how the GFSI scores are obtained. Syria ranks quite low (96/113) because of the consequence of the conflict. All indicators related to public policies \u2018Presence of food safety net programmes\u2019, \u2018Public expenditure on agricultural R&D\u2019, \u2018Political stability risk\u2019, \u2018Corruption\u2019 and \u2018Nutritional standards\u2019 are set to the worse score ( zero on a 0 to 100 scale). This explains the ranking of Syria at the 96 th rank over 113 even if sufficiency of supply, volatility of agricultural production , poverty rate and protein quality are quite good (see Figure 1). Zambia ranks in the lower end of the ranking (102/113). This may be surprising since Zambia witnessed a rapid economic growth recently. In the GFSI, the low ranking comes from the country having a zero score for indicator of public expenditure (worse-off country) and a low score for GDP, protein and micronutrient availability, diet diversification and poverty rate. This is consistent with the results obtained from the IFPRI Global Hunger Index which indicate a very poor nutritional situation in Zambia. The FAO indicators \u2018Prevalence of undernourishment\u2019 and the \u2018Dietary supply adequacy\u2019 are also quite bad in 2015 3 . Chad has the third worse ranking. It is behind Niger. Chad scores zero (worse country) for corruption and political stability, nutritional standard, safety nets, public expenditures on agricultural R&D, and almost zero for the GDP. Niger has also a zero score for these indicators except for corruption where it reaches a 25% score. Niger has a much better sufficiency of supply than Chad, that explains (partly) why Niger scores better than Chad. 3 The data quality for the computation of the PoU have been discussed. The nutrition figures on the opposite seems to be right and malnutrition seems highly prevalent in Zambia (see for example, http://www.renapri.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IAPRI_TP5.pdf) ",

        "18 3 Assessment of the GFSI 3.1 Conceptual Framework 3.1.1 Conceptual choices and scope of the GFSI Food security is defined as a situation where \u201call people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.\u201d (1996 World Food Summit). This definition has been used to identity food security as a four-dimensional object (FAO, 2009). The four dimensions are: availability, access, utilization and stability. A hierarchy exists between the dimensions in terms of geographic scale and logic relationships. Availability is understood as the availability of food at the national or regional level. Access corresponds to the household level and is describing if the household have the physical and financial means to access food. Utilization corresponds to the individual level and to what extent an individual is making a good use of nutrients in the food consumed. It includes good care and feeding practices, food preparation, diversity of the diet, intra-household distribution of food, and biological utilization. In terms of logic relationships, availability is necessary but not sufficient for ensuring access, access is necessary but not sufficient to ensure utilization. Availability, access and utilization at all times are necessary to ensure stability and food security. GFSI uses a different conceptualization. It understands food security as a tridimensional object. The three dimensions are affordability, availability and quality and safety . Affordability is described as \u201cthe capacity of country\u2019s people to pay for food, and the costs, that they may face both when the food supply is stable and at time of food related shocks\u201d. Availability is \u201cthe capacity of the country to produce and distribute food, including risks of food shortages\u201d. Quality and safety refers to \u201cthe nutritional quality of average diets and the food safety environment of each country\u201d. Table 6 Standard and GFSI conceptualization of food insecurity Standard Conceptualization of Food Security GFSI Conceptualization of Food Security Availability Affordability and capacity to cope with shocks Access Availability and Risk of Food Shortages Utilization Quality and Food Safety Stability ",
        "19 From the conceptual point of view, having stability inside each dimension rather than separate seems reasonable. However, it is not straightforward to match the GFSI dimension to the \u2018usual\u2019 ones. Affordability contains part of the access dimension (the financial access) and part of the stability dimension, plus other information. Availability contains information on food supply and food aid that are also recorded in the \u2018FAO availability\u2019 concept, as well as, information usually recorded in the access dimension (such as infrastructure which describes the physical access) and in the stability dimension (such as volatility of agricultural production, political stability and food loss). It also embeds other information such as the research budget, the corruption level and the urban absorption capacity. Finally, the Quality and safety dimension includes a lot of information on nutrition policies that are not usually recorded in the utilization dimension, even if they are contributing factors. The theoretical model thus only partially overlaps with the standard FAO conceptualization of food security. An important feature of the GFSI is that it focuses on the national level. The GFSI is country-centered whereas FAO conceptual framework is people-centered. The index is also not aimed at giving information about the food security status of vulnerable households neither on inequalities. Information on inequalities or specific groups of people such as the poor or the food insecure, for example, are not included in the index. All the indicators included are national averages. The GFSI is intended to measure food security worldwide. It is not focusing on food security prone countries. It tries to embed the food security issues of rich countries and middle-income countries. In that sense, it is different from the Global Hunger Index (GHI) or the results from the Integrated food security classification analysis (IPC) that focus on food security prone countries. Moreover, it is focusing on the average (also called structural or chronic) level of food security over a certain period. It is generally not describing the acute situation, especially in case of recent food security changes. The main reason is that the data covers a time window of approximately ten years. This is usual and almost unavoidable when computing a composite index with global coverage. The index is thus representative of the situation of the country only to the extent that the data (still) depict the current situation. More specifically, if the situation is stable in a country (regarding the indicators measured), the score will well represent the current situation. In a country where the situation is changing quickly, the score will not represent the current situation. A direct implication of that is also that the index cannot be used to monitor the food security condition in real time. It is reacting with some delay. A fortiori, it means that it ",
        "20 does not give information on the acute situation during a crisis for deciding on humanitarian aid allocation. The GFSI is thus designed to monitor trends in food security in a country. Alternative indicators with similar purposes 4 include: \u2014 the indicators chosen to monitor the goal 2.1 and 2.2 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): The Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU), the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) both calculated by the FAO, the prevalence of Stunting (low height-for-age) in children under 5 years of age, the prevalence of overweight children under 5 years of age. \u2014 the FAO set of indicators food security that can be found at http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/ess-fadata/en/#.V_N-gZPhCfc \u2014 the Global Hunger Index (GHI) by IFPRI \u2014 the IPC Chronic product 5 . Last but not least, the GFSI contains only contributing factors to food insecurity. It does not contain outcomes such as food consumption or nutritional status of the population like the Global Hunger Index for example. This may be a valid choice. An index based on contributing factors is useful when informing how to improve the food security environment of a country. Looking at individual indicator or dimensions by \u201cdeconstructing\u201d the final score helps to identify where the country is performing or is rather lagging behind. When interpreting the GFSI, it should be remembered that it is measuring the conditions able to lead to food security but not the results in terms of food consumption or nutritional status of the population. The final score tends to measure the conditions for food security, or an enabling environment for food security instead of actual food security level . 3.1.2 Selection of indicators Regarding the selection of indicators (see Table 2), the choice has been driven by both data availability at global level and expert judgment about which indicators to be included. Subjective (but well informed) interpretation of data is common when evaluating food insecurity in food insecurity prone countries. This is linked to the 4 Others indicators have the purpose to inform the severity of food insecurity and/or the number of food insecure in almost real time. This is for example the product of the IPC acute analysis or the WFP indicators such as the Food Consumption Score or the Coping Strategy Index. 5 This product is more ambitious and wants to give population estimates in different severity of food insecurity. Moreover, it wants to work at the second order administrative level. ",
        "21 complexity of factors contributing to food security and the importance of context in interpreting these factors. It is thus important to apprehend correctly the scope of an indicator before using it. The GFSI contains usual food security determinants such as supply, losses, poverty, share of food in expenditures but it also extends to governance and policy areas that have a less direct relationship to food security measures even if they are recognized as contributing factors. Because of that, both the relationship to the dimension and the placement in one dimension rather than another can be discussed. For example, the availability dimension contains political risk, corruption, urban absorption capacity and agricultural infrastructure. They could also be well related to affordability of food. Similarly agricultural import tariff and access to finance for farmers could also be conceptually linked with availability rather than with affordability. In fact, the statistical analysis confirms that the three dimensions (availability, affordability and quality) are strongly inter-related and not independent. Regarding individual dimension, \u2018affordability\u2019 is defined as \u201cthe capacity of country\u2019s people to pay for food, and the costs, that they may face both when the food supply is stable and at time of food-related shocks\u201d. It includes six indicators (Table 2). Average income and poverty prevalence fully make sense in this dimension given the definition of the dimension. The agricultural import tariffs indicator may make sense for developed countries but it is more questionable in food insecure countries. It may bring information on food price levels, but only very partially, or on trade openness 6 depending on the context. Additionally, the population 7 average of \u2018Food Consumption as a share of household expenditure\u2019 and the ability of the population only very partially capture the ability of the food insecure to cope with shocks. The availability dimension is built on 11 indicators (Table 2). Sufficiency of supply, trend of food aid over the past five years, and food losses do not call discussion for inclusion in that dimension. Including public expenditure on agricultural R&D may be questionable in food insecure countries. A limited budget can lead to divert expense from R&D to food security intervention. The volatility of agricultural production over the most recent 20 years period capture the risks of food shortages. Political instability and corruption surely play a role in determining food insecurity but are quite indirect determinants. The Quality and safety dimension includes several indicators (protein quality, micronutrient availability, diet diversification) that are describing the production side 6 The link between trade openness and food security is not straightforward. Both the existence of a link and the polarity of the link between tariffs may be questioned in food security prone countries. 7 The average on the poorest quintiles of the population is generally preferred when assessing food insecurity. Here, the GFSI focuses on the average situation rather than the poorest quintile of poverty distribution. ",
        "22 rather than the actual consumption of individuals or households. Following the FAO conceptualization of food security, these indicators would rather be included in the availability dimension, unless we assume that food consumption reflects very well the domestic food production. This dimension also includes indicators that measure nutrition governance and the food safety environment. The Quality and Safety dimension is thus quite different from the utilization dimension in the standard FAO model of food insecurity. The latter focuses on nutritional outcomes at the individual level, whereas the former focuses on contributing factors to food safety and diet quality at the national level. 3.2 Statistical assessment The statistical assessment of the GFSI presented below is based on the normalized scores of the 2016 GFSI version. 8 3.2.1 Estimated data and outlier detection In this section, we examine whether the indicators include missing values and/or contain extreme values. Assessing the quality of the data, in particular the percentage of imputed data, is an important component of the statistical evaluation of any composite indicator. Missing data can indeed hinder the development of robust composite indicators (OECD/JRC Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators, 2008). The data coverage of the GFSI is very good with more than 60% of the indicators containing no estimated values at all for the year 2016. In addition, for 25% of the indicators, the percentage of imputed values is less than 5%. Similar findings are reported at the country level. For more than 46% of countries (52 out of 113 countries), the 28 indicators are fully covered. One or two have been imputed for more than 50% of countries. Imputed values are mainly concentrated on two indicators, i.e. Proportion of population under global poverty line (dimension affordability) and Public expenditure on agricultural R&D (dimension availability). For both indicators, the share of estimated values amounts to around 30%. Two countries \u2013 Bahrain and Qatar stand a bit apart with the values of the indicators having been imputed in 28% and 25% of cases in the two respective countries. 9 8 However, we also checked if similar conclusions are reached while relying on data collected for the entire period available, i.e. 2012-2016. The results could be discussed for the complete audit of the GFSI. 9 Estimated values for Oman and Singapore amounts to 14%. ",
        "23 We then examine if some indicators and variables contain observations with unusually large or small values, i.e. extreme values called outliers. These outliers might be the results of value incorrectly recorded or simply infrequent data values. Outliers are problematic in the context of composite indicators because they may become unintended benchmarks and bias the correlation structure. In order to identify potential outliers, we study the shape of the distribution of each of the indicators and compute the kurtosis and the skewness. Indicators with the absolute values of the skewness and kurtosis respectively greater than 2 and 3.5 are considered problematic and should be carefully examined. Table 7 shows that there are six such indicators. In Figure 4 we plot these indicators so as to identify countries for which extreme values are observed. In this case, outliers are infrequent values rather than wrong values. Table 7 Outlier detection- Indicators with an absolute value of skewness greater than 2 and an absolute value of kurtosis greater than 3.5 Dimensions Indicators/Variables Absolute values of Skewness/Kurtosis Affordability Gross domestic product per capita (US$ PPP) 2.16/7.65 Agricultural import tariffs 2.36/7.68 Availability Public expenditure on agricultural R&D 2.44/6.30 Urban absorption capacity 2.04/7.05 Food loss 3.03/13.67 Quality and Safety Agency to ensure the safety and health of food 2.44/4.05 ",
        "24 Figure 4 Outliers detection \u2013 countries with extreme values To correct for the possible effect of extreme values on the aggregated scores, we have winsorized the problematic indicators. This implies that the highest/smallest value of the indicator is replaced by its next highest/smallest value and the procedure is repeated until the skewness and kurtosis values are respectively above 2 and above 3.5. This classical method employed to correct for the effect of extreme values works well for continuous variables but not for discrete ones. Hence the winsorization has been done for all 6 indicators but the one measuring Agency to ensure the safety and health of food Qatar 0.0 20.0 40.0 60.0 80.0 100.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 12 Gross domestic product per capita (US$ PPP) Egypt Norway South Korea 0.0 10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0 60.0 70.0 80.0 90.0 100.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 12 Agricultural import tariffs Ireland Netherland s Oman United States 0.0 10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0 60.0 70.0 80.0 90.0 100.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Public expenditure on agricultural R&D Yemen 0.0 10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0 60.0 70.0 80.0 90.0 100.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Urban absorption capacity Sierra Leone 0.0 20.0 40.0 60.0 80.0 100.0 120.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Food loss 0.0 20.0 40.0 60.0 80.0 100.0 120.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Agency to ensure the safety and health of food ",
        "25 (Quality and safety dimension). We then compared the ranking of the countries obtained with the GFSI and the winsorized version of the GFSI. As shown in Table 8 Difference of country ranking before and after the winsorization, most of the countries only shift by one or two positions. The countries for which we observe a shift by more than four positions the outliers identified in Figure 2. Table 8 Difference of country ranking before and after the winsorization Rank difference Percentage Countries 0 60.18% +/-1 30.09% +/-2 3.53% +/-3 2.65% Shift by more than 4 positions Qatar (-6), Netherlands (-6), Egypt (+5)South Korea (+4) The comparison of the rankings of countries without and with winsorization suggests that the effect of the outliers on the final score is not important. 3.2.2 Correlation analysis We analyze below the correlation structure of the GFSI. Correlation analysis is an important component of any statistical assessment as it allows identifying if there are silent indicators, negative and significant correlations and up to which level the indicators/variables maintain their information content. Table 9 Spearman\u2019 rank correlation coefficients between the indicators, the three dimensions and the overall GFSI. The Spearman\u2019s rank correlation has the advantage to be insensitive to outliers (contrary to the Pearson correlation coefficient). Most of the bivariate correlations between the indicators and their corresponding dimension range between 0.3 and 0.9. Yet, some indicators and sub-indicators exhibit low or very low correlations with the corresponding pillar and the overall GFSI score. This is the case of the following indicators Volatility of agricultural production and Urban absorption capacity (dimension Availability), and of two variables, namely National nutrition pla n or strategy and Dietary availability of vegetal iron belonging to the third dimension Quality and Safety. Note that while these two variables are relatively influential at the indicator level, their information content is lost at the dimension and overall GFSI index levels. Moreover, the correlation coefficients of these four indicators with all the others indicators included in the GFSI are very low and insignificantly different from zero. This might suggest that the inclusion of these indicators in the framework is cosmetic. ",
        "26 The bivariate correlations reported in Table 9 Spearman\u2019 rank correlation coefficients between the indicators, the three dimensions and the overall GFSI also show that most of the indicators are strongly correlated with the dimension to which the indicators belong to as well as with the two other dimensions. This suggests that most of the variables could be placed under the different pillars. We normally expect the indicators to be more strongly correlated with their corresponding dimension than with the other dimensions composing the overall index. This is indeed, on average, the case in the context of the GFSI. ",

        "28 3.2.3 Principal Component Analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) is a method of extracting relevant information from a high data dimensional space. In the context of the assessment of the GFSI PCA is useful to identifying patterns of association across indicators. More specifically this will allow us to examine whether the indicators grouped under each of the three pillars are all positively associated with the given dimension and are well balanced. Intuitively, for each pillar, the first principal component corresponds to the weighted arithmetic average of the underlying indicators with the weight assigned to each indicator being set in a way to maximize the proportion of the variance explained by this first principal component. The second principal component accounts for the maximum of the remaining variance and so on. The last principal component contains all the remaining variance not accounted in the previous components. The result of the principal component analysis at the level of the three dimensions is reported in the Table 10 below. The Kaiser\u2019s rule recommends retaining only components with eigenvalues greater than one. In our context, this implies that the three dimensions are properly capturing one underlying phenomena . The first component explains 86% of the total variance of the three dimensions and is equally correlated with each of them. The index seems to measure the conditions for food security. The statistical analysis confirms the conceptual analysis. The three dimensions in the GFSI framework, availability, affordability and quality and safety are strongly inter- related despite that the design gives the impression of independent dimensions.

        "29 3.2.3.1 Dimension Affordability The results of the principal component analysis for the Affordability dimension are displayed in Table 11. The principal component analysis reveals that the dimension is composed of two statistical dimensions that capture together 83% of the variance. Table 11 shows that the first component is mainly described by five out of the six indicators equally. Only the indicator Agricultural import tariffs do not correlate much with the first component while the second component is entirely made of this stand-alone indicator Agricultural import tariffs . Should this indicator be excluded from this pillar, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha would increase from. 0.88 to 0.92. The cronbach\u2019s alpha is a measure of correlations for all pairs of indicators, which assesses the reliability of the indicators composing the dimension. When the cronbach\u2019s alpha is above 0.7, the indicators are considered to reliably measure the underlying dimension.

The ratio of nominal weights inform on the relative importance of two indicators under scrutiny (Paruolo et al., 2013). This importance given to each indicator can then be compared with statistical measures of the importance of variables based on the squared of the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients. Comparisons of the nominal weights to the statistical importance of the dimensions are reported in Figure 5. The bars represent the statistical importance of each dimension while the dots correspond to the weights assigned to each of the three dimensions. The associated figures are displayed in Table 14. Column 1 displays the weight while column 2 reports the squared person correlation (equivalent to the R-squared) associated with each dimension. The squared Pearson correlation coefficients measure the percentage of the variance of the overall GFSI score explained by each dimension. While the designers of the GFSI have assigned more than twice the weight to each of the first two dimensions (Affordability and Availability) than to the third dimension, the statistical importance of the three dimensions is roughly the same. 01234 E i g e n v a l u e s 1 2 3 4 5 Number 95% CI Eigenvalues ",

While this might have been done intentionally by the developers of the GFSI, this should be certainly clarified. 3.2.5 Impact of Modelling Assumptions on the GFSI index results Country ranks depend in large part on modelling choices, ranging from the selection of indicators and imputation of missing values, to the normalization, weight and aggregation methods employed to combine the indicators into a single index. The purpose of the uncertainty analysis below is to complement the country ranks with some confidence intervals and see if some countries positions are particularly sensitive to the modelling choices. In what follows we examine the robustness of the GFSI to two modelling assumptions, namely, the choice of the weighting scheme and the aggregation function at the dimension level. Note that other uncertain parameters entering into the calculation of the GFSI could have been taken into account in particular the normalization scheme or the imputation method for the missing data. However, previous uncertainty analyses show that these two assumptions (aggregation method and weighing scheme) are those having the strongest impact on composite indicators-based rankings. For the robustness assessment of the GFSI, we have carried out Monte Carlo simulations as follows. First 1,000 different weighting schemes were generated, each one corresponding to a different set of weights applied to the three dimensions of the GFSI, i.e., Affordability , Availability and Quality and Safety . The weights were randomly sampled from a uniform distribution centered at the weight value adopted for the GFSI (respectively 40%, 44% and 16% for the dimensions Affordability, Availability and Quality and Safety). A perturbation of the weights \u00b1 25% around these reference values was adopted. For each simulation, weights are rescaled so that they always sum up to 1. Second, we have relaxed the assumption of perfect substitutability between the three dimensions induced by the use of a weighted arithmetic mean as aggregation method. ",
        "35 This aggregation method has been challenged in the literature because of its fully compensatory nature, i.e. a comparative high advantage in one dimension can be compensated by comparative disadvantage in another dimension (Munda, 2008). For the robustness assessment, we thus considered an alternative aggregation method - the geometric average - which is only partially compensatory. 10 Two models were then tested based on the combination of the aggregation method (arithmetic versus geometric average) and the 1000 simulated weighing schemes. The GFSI score was thus simulated 2,000 times. Table 18 summarizes the uncertainties considered for the robustness assessment of the GFSI. Table 18 Uncertainty analysis: weighing and aggregation methods Uncertainty in aggregation method at the dimension level Reference: weighted arithmetic mean Alternative: Weighted geometric mean Uncertainty in the weights at the dimension level Dimension/Sub-index Reference value for the weight Distribution assigned for robustness analysis Affordability 0.40 U[0.30, 0.50] Availability 0.44 U[0.33, 0.55] Quality & Safety 0.16 U[0.12, 0.20] The main results of the robustness analysis are shown in Figure 6. Countries are ordered from best to worst according to their reference rank (black line), the dot being the median rank. Error bars represent, for each country, the 90% interval across all simulations. The same information, reported in Table 19, allows to more closely examine the impact of the two modelling choices \u2013 aggregations method and weighing scheme - on each country rank. The uncertainty analysis suggests that the country ranks are robust to changes in the methodological choices with the median rank being very closed (less than \u00b1 4 positions differences) to the GFSI reference rank for 92% of countries. Similarly, the 10 Note that we have not changed the aggregation method and the weighing scheme within each dimension. ",
        "36 simulated confidence intervals are narrow for most of the countries (less than \u00b15 positions for more than 75% of the countries) and all GFSI ranks lay within the simulated 95% confidence intervals. However, we note that for a small number of countries, the ranks are sensitive with variations in the weighting scheme and aggregation function. This is particularly the case for Qatar , Botswana , Egypt and Kazakhstan . For these four countries, the difference between the median rank and the GFSI reference rank amounts to 10 or more positions. Those large swings are due to performance variations across the three dimensions. Quatar ranks first in Affordability dimension and 43 th in Quality and Safety dimension. Similarly, Kazakhstan ranks 45 th in the Affordability dimension and 97 th in the Quality and Safety one. More generally, if we compute the coefficient of variation across the three dimensions for each country, it is apparent that the top performer countries tend to perform well across the three dimensions (low coefficient of variation) while the low performer countries, on contrary, show uneven performance across the dimensions. Figure 6 Robustness analysis GFSI rank vs. median rank, 90% confidence intervals) Overall, although a few country ranks in the GFSI are sensitive to the methodological choices, the published GFSI ranking can be considered, for the vast majority of countries, robust to variations in the weighting scheme and the aggregation method.

        "39 4 Comparison of the GFSI with other indicators 4.1 Comparison with the IFPRI Global Hunger Index In this section, we compare the ranking of countries obtained with the GFSI with the one derived from the Global Hunger Index (GHI). The GHI is designed to measure and monitor hunger globally and by country and region. This index, produced annually by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), is based on four indicators, (i) the percentage of the population that is undernourished, (ii) the percentage of children under five years old who suffer from wasting (low weight for height), (iii) the percentage of children under five years old who suffer from stunting (low height for age), and (iv) the percentage of children who die before the age of five (child mortality). The indicators on undernourishment and mortality are assigned a weight of one- third while the other two indicators on malnutrition weight one-sixth each. Additional information on the GHI can be found at http://ghi.ifpri.org/results/. We rely on the 2015 GHI version and limit the analysis to the set of countries for which an overall score has been computed for both indices. The sample is composed of 78 countries. Table 20 Countries common to the GFSI and GHI rankings The rank correlation between the two indices is very high with the spearman rank correlation coefficient being equal to 0.90. Figure 7 clearly shows that the two rankings are highly correlated to each other.

        "40 We then examine how the two rankings differ for each country. Results reported in Table 21 show the following: - The rankings based on the two indices differ by 2 positions or less for 19 countries (i.e. 24.3% of countries), - There are substantial differences in the rankings for 50% of the countries. In particular, for 35% of countries, the rank difference with the two indices is equal to 10 or more, - The median rank difference amounts to 7, - 17 countries ranking in the bottom 25% \u201cless food secured\u201d are common to both rankings while five countries are ranked in the bottom 25% in one ranking only.

Results reported in appendix in Tables 24-26 are twofold. First, the indicators composing the GFSI are on average strongly correlated with the GHI. Second, the indicators that were very weakly associated with the overall GFSI index are also unrelated to the GHI. This is the case of two indicators belonging to the Availability dimension, i.e, volatility of agricultural production and urban absorption capacity . 4.2 Comparison with the Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) In this section, we compare the ranking of countries obtained with the GFSI with the one derived from the Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU). The prevalence of undernourishment, or proportion of population below the minimum level of dietary energy consumption, was a Millennium Development Goal indicator (MDG 1.9) and is a Sustainable Development Goal Indicator. It is published annually by the FAO in the State ",
        "42 of Food Insecurity (SOFI) report. The PoU is estimated, by computing the value of the cumulative distribution of the food consumption evaluated at the minimum dietary energy requirement . For the comparison, we rely on the 2015 PoU and limit the analysis to the set of countries for which an overall score has been computed for both the GFSI and the PoU. The sample composed of 73 countries is reported in Table 22. Table 22 Countries common to the GFSI and PoU rankings The spearman rank correlation is equal to 0.73. Figure 8 shows that the GFSI ranking is less correlated with the PoU ranking than with the GHI one. Thirteen countries placed in the bottom 25% of the GFSI and PoU rankings are common while almost the same number of countries (12) ranks in the bottom 25% in only one of the two rankings (see Table 23). The correlation rank between the GFSI indicators and the PoU is reported in Tables 27-29. As for the GHI, we find that two indicators belonging to the Availability dimension, i.e., volatility of agricultural production and urban absorption capacity are not correlated with the PoU index. Furthermore, two additional indicators, i.e. Political stability risk and Agricultural Import tariffs (belonging respectively to the GFSI availability and affordability dimensions) appear to be not related to the PoU index. The comparison of the country ranks obtained with the two rankings cannot be replicated for the PoU because of ties related issues, the PoU having for instance 24 countries with the index value equal to 5. The comparisons of the GFSI with other indicators show that the GFSI is relatively strongly correlated with the GHI. In comparison, the PoU and the GFSI differ much more substantially. Two indicators belonging to the GFSI i.e, volatility of agricultural production and urban absorption capacity, appear to be uncorrelated with GFSI index himself but also with the GHI and PoU indices. 11 11 While not reported in the document, note that the rank correlation between the PoU and the GHI is higher than the rank correlation between the PoU and the GFSI. Around 17 out of the 25 countries ranking in the bottom 25% are common to both rankings. 99 countries are common to both rankings.

        "45 5 Conclusions Like any measurement, the GFSI has its specific characteristics and limitations. The GFSI is that it is based on contributing factors rather than outcomes of food security. It does describe the food security conditions. However, it does not measure the outcomes of food security, namely food consumption or malnutrition figures. It tends to measure the conditions for food security, or an enabling environment for food security instead of actual food security level . In addition, given constraints linked to data availability (timeliness, frequency) and the choice of indicators included, the indicator is meant to measure structural levels food insecurity. It tends to integrate the changes in the food security situation of a country with some delays, depending on how recent the data are. The GFSI does not capture the entire spectrum of food security. It reflects specific aspects chosen by the team of experts that designed the index. The index namely focuses on the GDP as well as poverty and on the agricultural production side. The GFSI extends to governance and policy areas that are usually not directly included in food security indicators. It is thus complementary to other food security measures but it is not a substitute. The GFSI, like any other composite indicator, does not allow to draw any causal inference between the dimensions of the indicators (affordability, availability, quality and safety), or the individual indicators included, and food security. Any change in an individual indicator included in the composite will mechanically change the final score, proportionally to the weight of the indicator in the final score. This will happen even if the individual indicator has nothing to do with food security. Any causal relationship between an individual indicator and food security should be tested outside of the composite indicator construction process by a regression analysis between the individual indicator and valid measure of food security, ideally an \u201coutput variables\u201d like food consumption. The statistical assessment of the GFSI shows that the index exhibits good statistical properties. Data coverage is very good. The percentage of imputed values is low both at the country and indicator levels. Six out of the twenty-eight indicators contain outliers. The comparison of the rankings of countries without and with winsorization suggests that the effect of the outliers on the final score is not important. The indicators are on average strongly correlated with their respective dimension. Yet we note that the information contents of two indicators and two variables are lost at the dimension and overall index levels. The principal component analysis reveals that the three dimensions composing the GFSI are indeed apprehending one single phenomenon. ",
        "46 The comparison of the weighting scheme with the statistical importance of each indicator suggests that there are differences between these two measures of importance. While this might have been done intentionally by the developers of the GFSI, this could be clarified. The uncertainty analysis has shown that although a few country ranks in the GFSI are sensitive to the methodological choices, the published GFSI ranking can be considered, for the vast majority of countries, robust to variations in the weighting scheme and the aggregation method. Overall the statistical analysis suggests that the index is statistically coherent and robust to changes in the weight and aggregation methods. The GFSI and the GHI are strongly correlated to each other. Seventeen out of twenty countries ranking in the bottom 25% of the two rankings are common. In comparison, the correlation between the GFSI and the PoU is lower. We thus recommends to use the GFSI in conjunction with other indicator of food insecurity namely those measuring the outcomes of food security in terms of food consumption and the nutritional status of the population to have a good assessment of the actual food security and nutrition situation in food insecure countries.
