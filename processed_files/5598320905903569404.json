        "1 Introduction This joint staff working document (SWD) complements the joint communication to the European Parliament and the Council \u2013 \u201cGender Action Plan III: an ambitious vision on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment for EU External action\u201d 1 , by providing a set of objectives and indicators to monitor progress in the implementation of GAP III and measure its results at country, regional and international levels. The Joint Communication and this Joint SWD should be read together 2 . Part I \u2013 EU institutional and strategic objectives and indicators \u2013 focuses on the implementation of GAP III and presents for each objective a set of actions, indicators, baselines and targets . Data sources and actors are also indicated where possible . These indicators will be monitored on an annual basis. They will apply to the Commission services 3 and the EEAS, covering interventions and actions at country, regional/multi-country, and international levels. Member States are invited to use them and report accordingly in order to strengthen joint efforts. Part II \u2013 Objectives and indicators for GAP III thematic areas of engagement - - presents for each thematic area of GAP III a menu of objectives to be selected and used in different processes. For each objective, a set of \u2018key thematic outcome indicators\u2019 is highlighted. They will be integrated in the corporate monitoring system (OPSYS or equivalent) and used in priority to monitor results at country, regional and global levels in 2023 and 2025 4 . Member States are encouraged to use the \u201ckey outcome indicators\u201d in order to build aggregate reporting. See additional information in the Introduction to Part II. The EU action plan on Women, Peace and Security (2019-2024) 5 - endorsed by the Council in July 2019 6 - is to be read in conjunction with the joint communication on GAP III and with this SWD. Joint reporting will be ensured to the extent possible, in line with respective reporting timelines and obligations. The mid-term and final review of the action plan on Women, Peace and Security should follow GAP III timeline. 1 JOIN(2020)17. 2 See in particular chapter 5 on \u201cReporting and Communicating on results\u201d of the Joint Communication. 3 In view of its specific mandate the European Commission's European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations Directorate- General (DG ECHO) reports solely on activities and indicators that are relevant to humanitarian action. 4 For some indicators under the thematic area of engagement \u2018Integrating the women peace and security agenda\u2019 reporting might be annual. 5 EEAS(2019)747. 6 The EU Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security/WPS (2019-2024), https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11031- 2019-INIT/en/pdf ",

        "11 PART II Objectives and indicators for GAP III thematic areas of engagement As indicated in the Introduction, Part II of this staff working document presents a menu of objectives and indicators for each thematic area of engagement as presented in chapter 3 of the joint communication \u2018Towards a gender-equal world: focusing on six thematic areas of engagement\u2019. Indicators in Part II include selected Sustainable Development Goals indicators, the thematic indicators of the Women Peace and Security action plan, other relevant regionally and internationally referenced indicators, including a selection taken from the Spotlight Initiative, and relevant indicators part of the European Union results framework 30 . There are also selected qualitative indicators which seek to capture the hard-to-measure changes in social norms and attitudes and transformations in gender power relations. The list is offered as a menu to frame and support different processes: i) country and regional programming, including preparation of GAP III \u2018country level implementation plans\u2019 - as indicated in section 2.1 on \u2019working together at country level\u2019 of the joint communication - as well as the annual implementation plans in CSDP operations and missions; ii) design of actions and programmes funded by the EU; (iii) monitoring, reporting and evaluation; iv) any other relevant initiative and process. The list of objectives and indicators is therefore not exhaustive. Rather it signposts particular attention towards thematic issues and areas central to the vision and ambition of GAP III. Overall the intention is to measure short to medium and longer-term progress on reaching GAP III objectives to which EU-funded interventions should contribute in collaboration with partner governments, civil society organisations and other funding providers. In line with the principles of aid effectiveness and effective development co-operation that put a strong focus on building partnerships and country ownership, Part II indicators should be reported on a \u201ccontribution basis\u201d. This means that the reporting should cover overall results achieved jointly with our partners (including country governments), rather than just the results linked to the funding provided by the EU. Each section presents a selection of \u2018key thematic outcome indicators\u2019 which will be included in the corporate monitoring systems - including in OPSYS and other relevant systems - and used for corporate and consolidated reporting. Their use is recommended when preparing country implementation plans and in programming. The set of \u2018other thematic outcome indicators\u2019 is meant to support intervention design and qualitative analysis. The list of \u2019key thematic outcome indicators\u2019 might be updated including to take into account the 2021-2027 programming exercise. Most of the indicators should be at least sex-disaggregated. Depending on national definitions, contexts, data collection capacity and \u201cdo no harm\u201d approach, data should be broken down as a minimum by sex and age. Whenever relevant and feasible (i) sex-disaggregation should be replaced by gender-disaggregation and (ii) data should be disaggregated by other relevant intersectional 31 aspects and indicators such as disability status, migrant status and rural-urban residence. Further guidance will be developed to support the correct use of the \u201ckey thematic outcome indicators\u201d. 30 These indicators may change with the regular revision of the European Union Results Framework. 31 EIGE defines \u2018intersectionality\u2019 as an \u201canalytical tool for studying, understanding and responding to the ways in which sex and gender intersect with other personal characteristics/identities, and how these intersections contribute to unique experiences of discrimination\u201d (See: https://eige.europa.eu/thesaurus/terms/1263). See Article 10 TFEU, when \u201cdefining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union shall aim to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation\u201d.
