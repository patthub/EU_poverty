        "1 Sustainable development in the EU Sustainable development has been at the heart of European policy for a long time, firmly anchored in the European Treaties. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015, have given a new impetus to global efforts to achieve sustainable development. The EU has fully committed itself to delivering on the 2030 Agenda and its implementation, as outlined in the reflection paper \u2018Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030\u2019 ( 1 ) and \u2018The European Green Deal\u2019 ( 2 ). Regular monitoring of progress towards the SDGs in an EU context is essential for this purpose. ( 1 ) European Commission (2019), Reflection paper: Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030 , COM(2019)22. ( 2 ) European Commission (2019), The European Green Deal , COM(2019) 640. EU SDG indicator set This regular monitoring is based on the EU SDG indicator set, developed in cooperation with a large number of partners and stakeholders. The indicator set comprises 100 indicators distributed over the 17 SDGs. Thirty-six of these are multi-pur- pose indicators and monitor more than one goal. ",
        "Eurostat supports the SDGs 2 Monitoring progress towards the SDGs in an EU context ( 3 ) For a more detailed description of the approach for assessing EU progress towards the SDGs, see the introduction chapter (section 3.3) and Annex III in the 2020 edition of the EU SDG monitoring report. This brochure presents a statistical overview of the most recent trends of the EU SDG indicators over a five-year period (\u2018short term\u2019); the specific years depend on data availability for the individual indi- cators. It shows EU progress towards the SDGs for the individual indicators and also presents the aver- age progress for each of the 17 SDGs, based on the mean score of the selected indicators for the respec- tive goal, including the multi-purpose indicators ( 3 ). Studies and reports that consider current status rather than progress, different indicators or different time spans may come to different conclusions. The overall assessment of EU progress towards the SDGs presented in this edition of the brochure is not fully comparable with the assessment presented in previous editions due to changes in the selection of indicators for some goals and due to the switch from EU-28 (including the UK) to EU-27 (excluding the UK). The brochure does not show any effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic, because it covers the situation in the EU and its Member States up to 2019 at the latest. How has the EU progressed towards the SDGs? On average, over the last five years of available data \u2014 based on the mean scores of the selected indicators \u2014 the EU has made progress towards almost all goals. Progress in some goals has been faster than in oth- ers, and within goals there has been movement away from the sustain able develop ment objectives in some areas. A more detailed description of each indicator trend can be found in the 17 thematic chapters of this brochure. Over the most recent five-year period, the EU has made strong progress towards fostering peace and personal security, access to justice and trust in insti- tutions (SDG 16). Good progress, although markedly slower, was visible in reducing certain aspects of poverty (SDG 1) and improving the health of the EU population (SDG 3). The advances in these areas have also helped to increase the quality of life in cities and communities (SDG 11). These favourable trends can be seen against the background of continued improve- ment in the EU economy up to 2019, which was also reflected in the labour market (SDG 8). Improvements were also visible in the viability and sustainability of the EU\u2019s agriculture sector (SDG 2), although some of its environmental impacts have intensified. In contrast, goals dealing with environmental aspects of sustainability indicate slow or no EU progress over the past few years overall. Progress towards the EU\u2019s climate and energy targets (SDG 7 and SDG 13) has in part stalled, as has the shift towards a circular econ- omy (SDG 12). Pressures on ecosystems and biodiver- sity (SDG 15) have therefore have been increasing in some areas. The goals on education (SDG 4), innovation (SDG 9) and global partnerships (SDG 17) show an equally mixed picture. The slow progress towards reduc- ing inequalities (SDG 10) reflects a growing divide between EU nationals and non-EU citizens in relation to poverty and employment. Similarly, in relation to gender equality (SDG 5), the gap between men and women in acquiring education and on the labour market has been widening. Since SDG 5 shows more unfavourable than favourable trends for the EU, the aggregate past five-year progress has been moder- ately unsustainable. In the case of two goals \u2014 SDG 6 \u2018clean water and sanitation\u2019 and SDG 14 \u2018life below water\u2019 \u2014 overall EU trends cannot be calculated due to insufficient data for the past five years.

        "Eurostat supports the SDGs 4 EU indicator trends The following thematic chapters present short- term indicator trends for each of the 17 SDGs. These trends are assessed following specific quantitative rules. For indicators with quanti- tative EU targets, the brochure assesses their progress towards those targets. This applies to 16 out of the 100 indicators, mainly in the areas of climate, energy consumption, education, pov- erty and employment. Indicators with an associ- ated quantitative EU target are marked with the following symbol . Target values for each indicator are listed in the Annex. All other indicators are analysed accord- ing to the direction and speed of change. The assessment of indicator trends is presented visually in the form of arrows. The direction of the arrows shows whether an indicator has moved towards or away from the sustainable develop- ment objectives. Depending on the presence or absence of a quantitative EU target, the indica- tors are assessed differently. The following pres- entation illustrates the different cases. Eurostat\u2019s publication \u2018Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 2020 monitoring report on progress towards the SDGs in an EU context\u2019 describes the methodology applied and provides a detailed analysis of progress for the individual indicators. Assessment of trend not possible (for example, time series too short) Significant progress towards the EU target or Significant progress towards SD objectives Moderate progress towards the EU target or Moderate progress towards SD objectives Insufficient progress towards the EU target or Insufficient progress towards SD objectives Movement away from the EU target or Movement away from SD objectives ",
