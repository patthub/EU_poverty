        "Opinion of the European Committee of the Regions on revised Trans-European Energy Infrastructure Regulation fit for the Green and Digital Transition (2021/C 440/15) Rapporteur: Robert Sorin NEGOI\u021a\u0102 (RO/PES), Mayor of District 3, Municipality of Bucharest Reference document: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 COM(2020) 824 final I. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMENDMENTS Amendment 1 Recital 1 Text proposed by the European Commission CoR amendment (1) The Commission has set out, in its Communication of 11 December 2019 entitled \u2018The European Green Deal\u2019, a new growth strategy that aims to transform the Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive econo- my, where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. The Commission's communication on the Climate Target Plan propos- ing to increase the greenhouse gas emissions' reduction level to at least 55 % by 2030 \u2014 an ambition that was endorsed by the European Council on 11 December 2020 \u2014 and its underlying impact assessment confirms that the energy mix of the future will be very different from the one of today and underpins the necessity to review and if necessary to revise the energy legislation. The current energy infrastructure investments are clearly insufficient to transform and build the energy infrastructure of the future. That also means infrastructure needs to be in place to support the European energy transition, including rapid electri- fication, scaling up of renewable electricity gener- ation, the increased use of renewable and low-carbon gases, energy system integration and a higher uptake of innovative solutions.

        "Reason Self-explanatory Amendment 2 Recital 5 Text proposed by the European Commission CoR amendment (5) The evaluation of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 has clearly shown that the framework has effectively improved the integration of Member States' net- works, stimulated energy trade and hence contrib- uted to the competitiveness of the Union. Projects of common interest in electricity and gas have strongly contributed to security of supply. For gas, the infrastructure is now well connected and supply resilience has improved substantially since 2013. Regional cooperation in Regional Groups and through cross-border cost allocation is an important enabler for project implementation. However, in many cases the cross-border cost allocation did not result in reducing the financing gap of the project, as intended. While the majority of permitting proce- dures have been shortened, in some cases the process is still long. The financial assistance from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has been an important factor as grants for studies have helped projects to reduce risks in the early stages of development, while grants for works have supported projects addressing key bottlenecks that market finance could not sufficiently address.

Projects of common interest in electricity and gas have strongly contributed to security of supply. For gas, the infrastructure is now well connected in most regions and supply resilience has improved sub- stantially since 2013. However, to this day there are entire regions that have not been able to improve sufficiently their gas networks, energy security and resilience capacity. There are still projects for gas distribution which are in different phases of implementation and which have yet to be com- pleted.

        "Amendment 3 Recital 11 Text proposed by the European Commission CoR amendment (11) Security of supply, as one main driver behind Regulation (EU) No 347/2013, has been significantly improved through projects of common interest. Moreover, the Commission's climate target impact assessment 27 expects the consumption of natural gas to be reduced significantly because its non-a- bated use is not compatible with carbon-neutrality. On the other hand, the consumption of biogas, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and synthetic gaseous fuels will increase significantly towards 2050. Therefore, the natural gas infrastructure no longer needs support through the TEN-E policy. The planning of energy infrastructure should reflect this changing gas landscape.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS 1. welcomes the proposal for a regulation to revise the guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure (TEN-E). Recognises that while the objectives of the current regulation remain largely valid, the current TEN-E framework does not yet fully reflect the expected changes to the energy system that will be brought about by the new political context and the rapid technological developments aimed at upgrading the 2030 targets, as well as the 2050 climate neutrality objective under the European Green Deal (EGD). Emphasises that climate change that cannot now be prevented will have a significant impact in Europe in spite of the mitigation and adaptation efforts, and therefore calls on the Commission and the Member States to step up their efforts to update energy infrastructure as a key enabler for the energy transition, while ensuring climate action and nature conservation, and compliance with sustainability criteria in line with the SDGs; C 440/114 EN Official Journal of the European Union 29.10.2021 ",
        "2. is pleased to see that the future framework will preserve the key role of the regional groups in the projects of common interest (PCI) identification and selection process, where it is of paramount importance to guarantee a relevant regional and local representation; 3. welcomes the proposal to update the list of PCIs to sufficiently reflect the latest technological developments and cover all the relevant infrastructure categories, with a view to the climate neutrality and security of supply objectives. It specifically welcomes the inclusion of smart grid solutions, smart system integration (power-to-gas system and other sectors), production of hydrogen and synthetic gases from renewable energy sources, electrolysers, offshore grids and distribution systems. Stresses that there is a large potential for district heating and cooling, from renewable energy sources and waste heat, sometimes also on a regional scale and across member state borders. It is pleased to see the exclusion of gas infrastructure for methane and oil pipelines, where this does not have an adverse effect or unwanted side-effects due to the specific local or regional situation; 4. welcomes the obligation for all projects to meet mandatory sustainability criteria and to follow the \u2018do no harm\u2019 principle as set out in the EGD (in accordance with art. 17 of the EU taxonomy regulation ( 1 )) as a big step forward towards meeting the EU's collective green goals; 5. remarks that assessing projects within the TEN-E framework involves many elements to be taken into account notably the specific local and regional challenges due to energy transition and climate targets, the importance of energy stability, security and supply, the access to energy for all European citizens while also keeping energy affordable, the fight against energy poverty, the link with national, regional and local energy strategies and the coherence with already existing programmes and projects; 6. highlights that the energy infrastructure has a crucial role to play in energy transition and can have significant environmental and economic impact. Calls, therefore, on the Commission to establish a permanent mechanism for regional groups to dialogue with local and regional authorities concerned which is consistent with the framework for the Multilevel Climate and Energy Dialogue as established by the governance of the energy union regulation; 7. stresses the need for a robust permit granting framework. Currently, permit granting procedures, even for projects of common interest, are still very lengthy. Conflicting pre-existing procedures, sometimes combined with a specific institutional context, can make progress difficult in certain Member States. In addition to this there can also be public opposition due to insufficient attention to stakeholder buy-in; 8. calls for the priority status of PCIs to be carefully considered and for priority not to be given to any projects that would have a negative impact on climate or protected habitats or species; 9. underlines that permit granting procedures need to be completed with the necessary due diligence. However, the CoR supports steps proposed in article 10 of the regulation proposal to ensure a reasonable completion time of the permitting procedures by the different instances involved. The setting up of one-stop shops with sufficient competences, power of decision and bound by clear deadlines is essential in this regard. This in turn will lead to more security for project participants and a better estimation of their exposure to risk when entering into this process; 10. welcomes the growing attention being given in the European Union to the role of clean hydrogen, preferably obtained from renewable energy sources, and welcomes this proposal from the European Commission, which responds to a call from the CoR for a more supportive EU legal framework for market development and infrastructure to be put in place by revising the relevant EU legislation on trans-European energy networks and especially, appropriately adjusting the requirements for PCIs based on TEN-E ( 2 ) and the EU-wide Ten-Year Network Development Plans (TYNDPs); also supports the introduction of specific categories for hydrogen infrastructure in the TEN-E regulation such as hydrogen transmission networks (incl. converted existing natural gas pipelines for pure hydrogen), distribution and storage as well as electrolysers, which must be able to receive funding from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF); 29.10.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 440/115 ( 1 ) Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13).

        "11. highlights the need for electrification and the role of clean hydrogen in moving away from fossil fuels and reducing persistent emissions from polluting sectors such as industry and heavy transport, where direct electrification may be limited; recalls that renewable hydrogen should be the priority and low-carbon hydrogen should be used for decarbonisation purposes until renewable hydrogen can play this role alone; calls therefore on the EU institutions, Member States and industry to ramp up renewable electricity and hydrogen capacity in order to avoid a counterproductive competition between electrolysers for the production of hydrogen and other direct uses of renewable electricity ( 3 ). Furthermore, calls on the Commission for a clear taxonomy of \u2018renewable\u2019 gases; 12. notes that climate-neutral transport (mobility) and the production of clean hydrogen will require substantial expansion in production capacity for renewable energies and relevant technology in the EU in the near future; 13. underlines the importance for activities under the TEN-E regulation to be fully in line with the relevant planning instruments, particularly the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECP). In this regard, reiterates the importance of local and regional authorities being able to contribute fully to their Member State's NECPs and calls for optimum representation of local and regional authorities throughout this process; 14. recalls that the transport sector is responsible for a quarter of CO 2 emissions in the EU and is the only sector where emissions have not been reduced compared to the 1990 baseline; underlines the potential of hydrogen to be one of the instruments used to reduce CO 2 emissions in transport modes, in particular where full electrification is more difficult or not yet possible; stresses that the deployment of refuelling infrastructure is necessary to boost hydrogen use in the transport sector; 15. believes that the revision of the Trans-European transport network (TEN-T) regulation ( 4 ) should place much greater emphasis on low-carbon propulsion technologies for lorries, coaches, and inland shipping, such as electric motors powered by hydrogen fuel cells or overhead lines together with biogas and other energy forms that meet sustainability and emissions reduction requirements. Building the corresponding infrastructure, initially along core and comprehensive network corridors, is a prerequisite for the deployment of these technologies. The CEF should provide sufficient funding for this purpose; 16. underlines the need to create synergies between TEN-T, TEN-E and alternative fuel strategies; in this regard welcomes the Commission's intention to develop hydrogen refuelling infrastructure under the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and to review the revision of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive, which provides the opportunity to set specific requirements and harmonised standards for a phased deployment the density of hydrogen filling stations in Member States, regions and cities; 17. believes that a more open-minded approach to the definition of cross-border projects should be adopted, in order to consider not only large transmission projects but also local, decentralised and often participative smart grid projects without physical borders. Regional and local decentralised projects across national borders could indeed bring positive effects not only to regional and national systems, but also across different Members States, e.g. by integrating renewables, solving congestions and avoiding negative externalities; 18. stresses that in order to best serve the achievement of the EU's energy and climate targets as well as empowering customers, the TEN-E framework must be revised to fully encompass and benefit from the contributions of \u2018prosumers\u2019, local energy communities and new technologies ( 5 ); highlights the importance of the low and medium-voltage electricity grid, where the required infrastructure for a multitude of new, decentralised producers feeding electricity into the system must be created; underlines that there is also a need to connect new small-scale producers to the low and medium-voltage networks; calls on the Commission to provide a framework for the aggregation of several smaller projects, in order to allow them to meet the criteria under the current legislation. Flexibility in this regard is of high importance for local and regional authorities to be able to set up certain aggregated projects and to potentially obtain financing for these efforts; C 440/116 EN Official Journal of the European Union 29.10.2021 ( 3 ) The additionality principle has been put forward by the European Parliament in its report \u2018A European Strategy for Hydrogen\u2019 (A9-0116/2021 ITRE Jens Geier).

        "19. remarks that the TEN-E regulation, as a central pillar of the European Union energy infrastructure development and, as such, a crucial contributor to achieving climate neutrality broadly respects the principles of active subsidiarity and proportionality; stresses the added value of regional cooperation in implementing cross-border projects, transparency, regulatory certainty and access to financing; calls for the full envolment of local and regional authorities as partners, not just stakeholders, in line with these principles of active subsidiarity and proportionality.
