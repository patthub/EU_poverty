Stresses that a clear definition of strict protection needs to be produced; notes the Council conclusions of 16 October 2020 on biodiversity, which state that a stricter level of protection may allow for certain human activities to be carried out in line with the conservation objectives of the protected area; considers that human activities that are compatible with protection goals, or even positively contribute to biodiversity, should be admissible in areas under strict protection; calls on the Commission, in cooperation with Member States, to clarify what kind of human activities might potentially be considered as allowed under strict protection status when they leave natural processes essentially undisturbed and are compatible with the ecological requirements of the areas, on the basis of a case-by-case assessment based on the best available science; 19. Underlines that in order to achieve the objectives of the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, the degradation of the remaining EU marine and terrestrial area will also need to be prevented; calls for measures to address biodiversity loss outside protected areas; notes that restoring nature and ecosystems in protected areas does not make up for continued loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems in other areas; 20. Underlines the importance of including overseas countries and territories in conservation and restoration efforts; 21. Considers it important to take into account biogeographical regions and to adopt a whole-of-government approach to protected areas which involves Member States evaluating the need for financial support and compensation measures in the context of the designation of protected areas; stresses the need to involve all relevant stakeholders, including landowners; 22. Highlights the importance of the Natura 2000 forest sites in preserving forest biodiversity; notes, however, that sufficient financial resources are needed to manage such areas and to ensure enforcement; 23. Underlines the importance of strengthening sustainable forest management in a balanced manner for the health, climate resilience and longevity of forest ecosystems and the preservation of the multifunctional role of forests, including for maintaining forest biodiversity, as well as for the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the implementation of the European Green Deal; highlights the value of incorporating genetic diversity into planting considerations, as this limits the risk of pest attacks and of the spread of disease, and of local/native species; 24. Recalls that the EU has the largest coordinated network of protected areas in the world; 25. Notes the commitment to ensure no deterioration in conservation trends and the favourable status of all protected habitats and species by 2030 and to ensure that at Member State level at least 30 % of species and habitats that do not currently have a favourable status are in that category or show a strong positive trend; believes, however, that favourable conservation status should be achieved for all protected species and habitats under the Birds ( 57 ) and Habitats ( 58 ) Directives as soon as possible; stresses that there are existing obligations to ensure no deterioration of species; calls on the Commission, together with the EEA, to set a clear baseline, to ensure harmonised and regular reporting, and to address shortcomings in the current methodology for trend estimates; 26.

Strongly welcomes the commitment to draw up a legislative proposal on the EU nature restoration plan, including on binding restoration targets, and reiterates its call for a restoration target of at least 30 % of the EU\u2019s land and seas ( 66 ), which should be fully implemented by each Member State throughout their territory, within and outside protected areas, on the basis of biodiversity and ecosystem needs reflecting the country\u2019s specific characteristics; stresses that restoration targets should build on the EU\u2019s existing legislation and that restoration efforts should support natural regeneration to the extent possible; 37. Considers that in addition to an overall restoration target, the legislative proposal on the EU nature restoration plan should include ecosystem-, habitat- and species-specific targets at the EU and Member State levels on the basis of their ecosystems, with a particular emphasis on ecosystems for the dual purposes of biodiversity restoration and climate change mitigation and adaptation; emphasises that the instrument should include forests, grasslands, wetlands, peatlands, pollinators, free-flowing rivers, coastal areas and marine ecosystems; stresses that after restoration, no ecosystem degradation should be allowed; believes that progress on the restoration goals must be regularly assessed at both the Member State and EU levels, including through the use of intermediate goals towards the 2030 targets; 38. Underlines that positive incentives and participatory processes should be developed to increase commitment to biodiversity restoration; 39. Strongly highlights the importance of fully integrating the EU\u2019s nature restoration objectives into other related policies and strategies; reiterates its call for binding targets on the restoration of forests ( 67 ), including to increase and restore connectivity between forests; requests the inclusion in the nature restoration plan of the restoration of at least 25 000 km of free-flowing rivers in the EU through the removal of barriers and the restoration of floodplains; 40. Strongly regrets the decline of pollinators, which are a key indicator of the health of the environment; stresses that this decline means not only a loss of biodiversity but also a threat to food security; reiterates the position expressed in its resolution on the EU Pollinators Initiative and calls for an urgent revision of the initiative; underlines that the revised initiative should include a new EU-wide pollinator monitoring framework with robust measures, clear time-bound objectives and indicators, including impact indicators, and necessary capacity building; 41. Recalls its objection of 23 October 2019 as regards the assessment of the impact of plant protection products on honeybees ( 68 ) and regrets that the EFSA bee guidance document has not been formally adopted by the Member States; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that the revision of the EFSA bee guidance document and the future implementing acts ensures as a minimum an equal level of protection as that laid down in 2013, addressing both acute and chronic toxicity and larvae toxicity, and also covering wild pollinators; emphasises the need for increased transparency in the review process; notes that EFSA is designing its own modelling system, ApisRAM, which is expected to be more in line with the biology of honeybees than BeeHAVE and less open to conflicts of interest; 42. Highlights the importance of high-diversity landscape features in agricultural areas in contributing to biodiversity and pollinator protection and restoration, as well as the role of beekeepers; stresses that increasing green spaces in urban areas can also contribute to these goals; calls on the Member States to include measures targeting various groups of pollinators in their draft strategic plans; Drivers of biodiversity loss 43. Underlines that the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030\u2019s actions must adequately tackle all five main direct drivers of change in nature: changes in land and sea use, direct exploitation of organisms, climate change, pollution and IAS; stresses that underlying causes of change, or indirect drivers, should also be tackled, such as unsustainable production and consumption patterns, population dynamics, trade, technological innovations and governance models; 8.2.2022 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 67/37 Wednesday 9 June 2021 ( 66 ) Resolution on the COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity.

Highlights that soil biodiversity provides vital ecosystem services and mitigates climate change, making it one of the most important elements of terrestrial carbon sinks; notes with concern the increase in soil degradation and the lack of specific EU legislation on this topic; acknowledges that there are some provisions in different laws that indirectly contribute to soil protection, but considers that this has resulted in partial protection and highly fragmented governance in the EU; calls, therefore, on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for the establishment of a common framework, with full respect for the subsidiarity principle, for the protection and sustainable use of soil and for the effective integration of that protection in all relevant EU policies; 45. Stresses that this common framework on soil should address all the main soil threats, including loss of soil biodiversity, loss of soil organic matter, contamination, salinisation, acidification, desertification, erosion and soil sealing; emphasises the need to include therein common definitions, clear targets and a monitoring framework; also supports the establishment of a specific decontamination target; 46. Underlines that healthy soil, including fertility and structure, is crucial for the agricultural sector; points out the negative impact that unsustainable farming and forestry practices, land use change, construction activities, sealing and industrial emissions, among others, have on soils; stresses that forest harvesting and agricultural methods that are less damaging for soils should be implemented; 47. Invites the Commission to review Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions ( 69 ) and Directive 2006/21/EC on the management of waste from extractive industries ( 70 ) in order to better address soil degradation caused by industrial and mining activities; recalls its call for a material recovery target for excavated soils ( 71 ); 48.

Expresses its support for the 2030 targets of bringing at least 25 % of agricultural land under organic farm management, which should increase in the medium to long term; strongly welcomes, furthermore, the target of ensuring that at least 10 % of agricultural land consists of high-diversity landscape features, which should be implemented at an appropriate level to provide ecological connectivity for habitats across and in between farmed landscapes; stresses that both targets should be incorporated into EU legislation and be implemented by each Member State, also within the common agricultural policy (CAP) strategic plans; 53. Notes with great concern that according to the ECA report on biodiversity on farmland, the number and variety of species on farmland in the EU has been continuously declining; regrets the fact that the EU\u2019s Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 did not set measurable targets and actions for agriculture, making it difficult to assess progress; recalls that the tracking of CAP spending for biodiversity has been unreliable and that there has been a lack of coordination between EU policies and strategies, one result of which is that they do not address the decline in genetic diversity ( 75 ); calls on the Commission to follow the recommendations of the ECA on biodiversity on farmland and to build on the lessons learned in the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 ( 76 ); 54. Stresses that biodiversity is crucial for safeguarding food security in the EU; highlights the important role that the EU agricultural sector plays in the production of healthy, safe and affordable foods; emphasises that farmers have a key role to play in the success of this strategy and that this strategy should be aligned with the measures, goals and targets of the Farm to Fork Strategy; 55. Considers it imperative that EU agriculture be transformed to make it sustainable and ensure high animal welfare standards, in line with the ecological and climate transitions, with minimised use of fossil and chemical inputs and antibiotic treatments; stresses that agriculture should contribute to protecting and restoring biodiversity; 56. Considers it imperative, in view of potential socio-economic impacts, that farmers receive support, including economic support, and training in relation to the transition towards sustainable agricultural systems to promote agro-ecological and other innovative sustainable practices; highlights, therefore, the importance of ensuring well-defined and sufficient financial support, including under the multiannual financial framework, to help reach these objectives, and calls in this regard on the Member States to use the CAP strategic plans and its green components for these purposes while developing win-win solutions for biodiversity protection; 57. Calls on the Commission to develop a strategy to support local value chains in reaching the proposed targets and stresses that small-scale agricultural businesses require specific support in contributing to the strategy; 58. Welcomes the recognition of organic farming as one of the strong components on the EU\u2019s path towards more sustainable food systems, namely as regards biodiversity concerns, and in achieving the public policy objectives of economic development, rural employment, environmental protection and climate action; stresses the importance of the European action plan for organic farming in increasing the uptake of organic farming; 59. Underlines that the development of organic food production must be accompanied by market-driven and supply chain developments and measures that stimulate demand for organic food, including through public procurement and a broad variety of promotion measures, research, innovation, training and scientific knowledge transfer, aiming to support the stability of the organic products market and the fair remuneration of farmers and promoting measures that support 8.2.2022 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 67/39 Wednesday 9 June 2021 ( 75 ) ECA Special Report of 5 June 2020 entitled \u2018Biodiversity on farmland: CAP contribution has not halted the decline\u2019.

Notes that Member States will contribute differently to these Union-wide targets depending on the level of development of their organic sector and therefore calls for the definition of national targets; highlights that these targets will not be met without strong financial support, solid training programmes and advisory services; calls on Member States to shape their CAP Strategic Plans accordingly and on the Commission to make sure that these Strategic Plans are up to the task; 61. Recalls the importance of encouraging a collective approach and taking advantage of its multiplier effect in order to promote the actions of the Biodiversity Strategy, and calls on the Commission to promote and support associative enterprises, such as agri-food cooperatives, in the implementation of measures to protect biodiversity in a collective manner; 62. Stresses the key role that the CAP should play in the protection and promotion of farmland biodiversity, together with other policies of the European Green Deal; regrets that the CAP has not been effective in reversing the decades-long decline in biodiversity; recalls that agricultural productivity and resilience depend on biodiversity, which is essential to guarantee the long-term sustainability and resilience of our food systems and food security; considers that the small changes introduced by the various reforms of the CAP have not sent a strong signal to farmers to change their practices and is of the opinion that significant change based on experience of and predictions about climate and biodiversity crises is necessary; 63. Reiterates that the CAP should be fully consistent with the EU\u2019s increased climate and biodiversity goals; urges the Commission and the Member States to use the CAP strategic plans to implement the objectives of the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the Farm to Fork Strategy, including on further mainstreaming biodiversity-friendly and agro-ecological approaches, and urges the Member States to set ambitious baselines for sustainability and biodiversity when establishing conditionality standards and to ensure the ambitious and prompt development and uptake of measures, in particular eco-schemes and agri-environment-climate measures; stresses that adequate financial resources should be earmarked for restoration; calls on the Member States to build on the Commission recommendations to these ends; 64. Calls on the Member States to develop the necessary measures with regard to high-diversity landscape features, in particular under their CAP strategic plans, using for example hedges or buffer strips, which should also aim to promote ecological interconnectivity between habitats and the creation of green corridors; 65. Stresses the need to strengthen the monitoring framework within the CAP, including through the development of more reliable indicators to measure its impacts; calls on the Commission to carry out an independent assessment of their aggregated expected impact once national strategic plans are approved; calls on the Commission, where this analysis considers insufficient the efforts to achieve the goals of the European Green Deal, to take appropriate action such as asking the Member States to amend their strategic plans or reviewing the CAP Strategic Plan Regulation as part of the mid-term review; 66. Underlines the importance of balanced diets; considers that the Commission and the Member States should facilitate the adoption of healthy and balanced diets, while introducing appropriate measures to assist farmers in this transition, taking into due consideration the need to safeguard the economic sustainability of EU farms; 67. Regrets the fact that agricultural production and consumption are being increasingly focused on a limited range of agricultural crops, and within them, limited varieties and genotypes; underlines that enhancing and preserving genetic variability through natural means is crucial to promoting the diversity of agricultural ecosystems and preserving local genetic resources, in particular as a repository of solutions to face environmental and climatic challenges; highlights the importance of using local breeds and varieties best suited to the local ecosystems; 68. Calls on the Commission to assess whether the development of natural capital accounting can limit and rationalise the exploitation and impact on ecosystems and therefore contribute to halting and reversing biodiversity loss; expresses reservations, however, about the feasibility of accurately measuring the value of nature in quantitative terms and stresses that nature has intrinsic value; calls on the Commission, in this regard, to provide more information on the potential international natural capital accounting initiative; C 67/40 EN Official Journal of the European Union 8.2.2022 Wednesday 9 June 2021 ",

Calls on the Member States to develop the necessary measures under their CAP Strategic Plans to promote biodiversity-rich areas, including landscape features, with the aim of achieving an area of at least 10 % of high-diversity areas beneficial for biodiversity, for example hedgerows, buffer strips, areas in which no chemicals are used and temporary fallow land, as well as extensive farmland dedicated to biodiversity on a long-term basis, and promoting interconnectivity between habitats and the creation of green corridors as much as possible in order to maximise the potential for biodiversity; 70. Notes that fur production, which involves the confinement of thousands of undomesticated animals of a similar genotype in close proximity to one another under chronically stressful conditions, can significantly compromise animal welfare and increases their susceptibility to infectious diseases including zoonoses, as has occurred with COVID-19 in mink; 71. Regrets that the EU\u2019s commitment to fully respect maximum sustainable yields (MSY) by 2020, a key objective of the common fisheries policy (CFP), has not been achieved; stresses that all fish populations should be restored to levels above those that are able to produce MSY while respecting the precautionary principle, ensuring they exhibit a population age and size distribution indicative of a healthy stock; calls on the Commission and the Member States to commit to the full recovery of marine habitats and fish stocks with respect for MSY using an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management without delay, to improve selectivity and the survival of non-target species, and to reduce the impact of fisheries on marine ecosystems when implementing this approach, including by limiting practices or uses that have detrimental impacts; 72. Recalls also that, according to the new Technical Measures Regulation ( 77 ), the Commission must submit a report to Parliament and the Council by 31 December 2020, and that in cases where there is evidence that the objectives and targets have not been met, the Commission may propose measures; 73. Calls on the Commission to address ocean degradation, eutrophication and acidification by presenting an ambitious action plan to protect marine ecosystems and conserve fisheries resources; considers that all measures, including legislation, should be adopted to reduce potential negative impacts of economic and other activities on marine habitats; 74. Stresses the importance of establishing fish stock recovery areas or no-take zones to allow fish populations to recover, including in nursery and spawning areas; emphasises the importance of prohibiting all fishing and other extractive activities in no-take zones; 75. Strongly supports the objective of zero tolerance of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing; points out that IUU fishing has an extremely negative impact on the state of stocks, marine ecosystems, biodiversity and the competitiveness of EU fishers; calls for greater consistency between EU trade and fisheries policies in order to ensure that IUU fishing is tackled effectively; 76. Calls on the Commission to establish an ecosystem approach to all drivers of marine biodiversity loss, which takes account of the pressure of fishing on stocks, biodiversity and marine ecosystems, but also of other factors such as pollution, climate change, shipping and coastal and near-shore uses, including through ecosystem impact assessments of all fishing and other marine activities, taking into account the capacity of ecosystems to contribute to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and prey-predator interactions; 77.
