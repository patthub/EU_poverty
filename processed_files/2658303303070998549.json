The Council recommended that the Member States take appropriate measures to deposit instruments of ratification in respect of the United Nations Convention against Transna tional Organised Crime, the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, espe cially women and children, and the protocol against illicit trafficking of migrants by land, air and sea. It also recommended implementing, be fore 1 August, the framework decision on traf ficking in human beings. It urged the Member States to consider as policy priorities the creation of a European database of missing persons, the re inforcement of judicial and police cooperation be tween the European Union and neighbouring third countries, and the introduction of measures providing effective penalties for illegal practices which support trafficking in human beings, and protecting the victims. 1.2.3. Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament 'Rein- vigorating EU actions on human rights and d\u00e9 mocratisation with Mediterranean partners \u2014 Strategic guidelines'. Reference: Commission communication on the European Union's role in promoting human rights and d\u00e9mocratisation in third countries: COM(2001) 252; Bull. 5-2001, point 1.2.2 Adopted by the Commission on 21 May. This communication sets out guidelines on how to make the most of the instruments available to the European Union and its Mediterranean partners for consolidating their common objective of pro moting and defending universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. In order to improve dia logue and financial cooperation on human rights issues, the Commission has identified ten areas where the instruments could be used more effec tively: deepening of political dialogue; greater sharing of knowledge and experience; better co ordination between Commission delegations and Member States' embassies; establishment of reg ular contacts between Commission delegations and civil society; development of national action plans; establishment of regional action plans; drawing-up by the Commission of country strat egy papers and national indicative programmes, as well as regional strategy papers and a regional indicative programme; enhanced complementa rity between the MEDA programme and the Eu ropean initiative for democracy and human rights (EIDHR); and greater efforts in the improvement of electoral frameworks. Implementation of the measures set out in this communication will be enhanced by three levels of complementarity: be tween the political dialogue and financial assist ance, between the MEDA programme and assist- Bull.

Reference: Copenhagen European Council con clusions: Bull. 6-1993, point 1.13 Adopted on 15 May. While noting that Turkey had amended most of its legislation regarding free dom of speech and association, Parliament regret ted that these amendments still left ample scope for repressive actions by the police. It urged the Turkish Government to take concrete measures to prove its commitment to respecting human rights and to review its legislation. It also called on the Turkish Government to implement the judicial re forms it had announced and to abolish the State security courts, which represented an obstacle to the development of the rule of law. Parliament pointed out that the implementation of reforms was an element that would be taken into account by the Commission in its December 2004 evalua tion of Turkey's fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria. It stressed that political will on the part of Turkey to make radical changes to ensure respect for the rule of law was an essential part of progress towards EU membership. Vietnam 1.2.5. European Parliament resolution on freedom of expression and religion in Vietnam. Adopted on 15 May. Parliament condemned the fact that the national government was violating the right to freedom of expression, religion and the press through improper recourse to classified offences relating to 'national security', such as es pionage, 'abusing democratic rights to encroach upon the interests of the State' or 'public distur bances'. It called on the Vietnamese Government: to release all prisoners of conscience and to guar antee their full political and civil rights; to stop the continuing arrest, harassment and detention of indigenous Montagnard Christians; to abolish Decree 31/CP of 1997 on 'administrative deten tion' (detention without trial) and all other laws suppressing peaceful activities that are consid ered to be a threat to national security; and to stop the continuing arrests, harassment and imprison ment of peaceful dissidents and journalists.

        "3. The Community economic and social area Economic and monetary policy Economic and monetary union 1.3.1. Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament entitled 'Public fi nances in EMU \u2014 2003'. Previous report: Communication from the Com mission to the Council and the European Parlia ment 'Public finances in EMU \u2014 2002': COM(2002) 209; Bull. 5-2002, point 1.3.2 Adopted on 21 May. This is the fourth report de voted to public finances in economic and mone tary union (EMU). After looking at the Member States' budgetary results in 2002 and assessing their prospects in the short and medium term, the Commission examines some issues arising in the framework of the debate on budgetary policy at EU level, more specifically in relation to EMU. Part I of the report considers current develop ments and short-term budgetary prospects, along with the medium-term plans presented in the most recent stability and convergence programmes. This analysis is based on the spring 2003 fore casts drawn up by the Commission. It also con tains a section on the candidate countries. Part II looks at four aspects of the evolving framework for budgetary surveillance at EU level: imple mentation of the Stability and Growth Pact, strengthening the coordination of budgetary poli cies, public debt and the establishment of budget ary statistics in EMU. Part III focuses on public investment, its impact on growth and the link be tween public investment and fiscal rules. Part IV deals with the effect of budgetary consolidation on growth and seeks to determine the conditions under which budgetary consolidation in EMU may have an expansionary effect. Part V looks at expenditure rules and fiscal relations across dif ferent levels of government, analysing how they enable the Member States to meet the budget bal ance requirements and to attain other policy ob jectives, including better control of spending. Part VI summarises the developments and prospects on the budget front for each Member State. COM(2003) 283 1.3.2. Draft Council decision on a revision of the Statutes of the Economic and Financial Commit tee. Commission opinion delivered on 21 May. In ac cordance with Article 209 of the Treaty establish ing the European Community, the Council asked the Commission for its opinion on a draft decision aimed at revising the Statutes of the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC), in preparation for the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union. The proposed solution entails organising the committee into two formations: a restricted one, involving only representatives of national administrations plus the Commission and the Eu ropean Central Bank (ECB), where most of the meetings would be held; and the plenary, bringing in also the representatives of national central banks. The Commission recognises that the pro posed revision maintains the effectiveness of the EFC decision-making process in a substantially enlarged European Union. It proposes that, in the draft Council decision, the references in Article 2 be adapted in line with current Treaty provisions (replacing the reference to Article 151 of the EC Treaty with a reference to Article 207), and that the wording of Article 5 of the proposal be im proved as follows: 'However, when advice or an opinion is given on questions on which the Coun cil may subsequently take a decision, members from national central banks, when they are present, the ECB and the Commission may partic ipate fully in the discussion but shall not partici pate in a vote'.

        "Economie and monetary policy Coordination of economic policies Broad economic policy guidelines 1.3.3. European Parliament resolution on the Com mission recommendation on the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community (for the 2003-05 period). Reference: Commission recommendation on the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community (for the 2003- 05 period): COM(2003) 170; Bull. 4-2003. point 1.3.1 Adopted on 15 May. Parliament broadly endorsed the economic policy guidelines proposed by the Commission. At the same time, it regretted the lack of ambition and failure to implement struc tural reforms. In this context, it called on the Commission to introduce a new action plan for structural reform, to be carried out in accordance with a strict timetable to be fully completed by 2010. This plan should identify the existing rigid ities hindering growth and establish the priorities for action. As far as specific policy elements were concerned, Parliament supported the Stability Pact and the proposal to improve the budgetary situation by at least 0.5 % of GDP per year. It con sidered also that public deficits should be evalu ated and proposed the creation of a budgetary re serve in growth periods to be used for future downturns, advocating also the full coordination of budgetary policies. Parliament backed an in crease in the effective retirement age, and wanted initiatives to be taken to promote entrepreneur- ship and risk-taking. Lastly, Parliament proposed the creation of a European social label to identify companies which uphold principles of ethical be haviour. Stabiliti' and Growth Pact Stability and convergence programmes Austria 1.3.4. Council opinion on the updated stability programme of Austria for 2003-07. Reference: Council opinion on the updated stabil ity programme of Austria (2001-05): OJ C 33, 6.2.2002; Bull. 1/2-2002, point 1.3.14 Commission recommendation: 20 April 2003 Adopted on 13 May. The Council notes that Aus tria's report was presented after the date required in the revised 'code of conduct on the content and format of stability and converge programmes', and therefore the update complies only partly with the requirements of the code. The Council notes with satisfaction that, in spite of growth being lower than projected, govern ment finances in 2001 improved more rapidly than expected, although this favourable result was brought about mainly by a strong increase in tax revenues. However, government finances weak ened noticeably in 2002 and deviated from the targets set, reaching a deficit of 0.6 % in cycli cally-adjusted terms according to Commission calculations. The Council notes, moreover, that the debt ratio, which is still above the 60 % of GDP reference value, increased substantially in 2001/02, mostly due to a reclassification in the Austrian gross debt reporting. The Council notes with concern that, as a consequence, the goal of bringing gross consol idated debt below the 60 % of GDP reference value has now been significantly delayed. The up date projects the general government deficit to widen from 0.6 % of GDP in 2002 to 1.3 % in 2003, mainly due to deferred payments for flood damages and a widening output gap. After a tem porary improvement in 2004. the deficit is pro jected to increase markedly to 1.5 % in 2005. ow ing to a sizeable income tax reform. Thereafter, the deficit is estimated to narrow gradually to 1.1% of GDP in 2006 and 0.4 % of GDP by 2007. The cyclically-adjusted deficit follows the pattern of the nominal figures: it widens by 0.5 percent age points in 2003 to some 1 % of GDP. improv ing by virtually the same amount in 2004, before rising strongly to 1.3 % in 2005 due to the planned net tax relief. Despite narrowing thereaf ter, the deficit in cyclically-adjusted terms re mains at 1.1 % of GDP in 2006 and improves by the required 0.5 percentage point to 0.5 % of GDP only in 2007. The government gross debt is ex pected to decrease from its peak of 67.8 % of GDP in 2002 to slightly below the 60 % reference value in 2007. Bull. EU 5-2003 I I ",
        "Statistical system The budgetary projections of the programme are based on a macroeconomic scenario expecting economic activity to gradually resume from the current cyclical slowdown. Real GDP growth is forecast to accelerate from 1 % in 2002 to 2.5 % by 2005 and thereafter, amounting to annual aver age growth of 2.1 % over the entire programme period. Although somewhat above trend, the Council considers this growth outlook feasible, given that no significant macroeconomic imbal ances prevail in the Austrian economy, and pro vided that the external environment improves as projected. The Council regrets that the Austrian Govern ment will not reach its previous target of main taining budgetary balance and moving to a small surplus in 2004 and 2005. While recognising that this is due to the planned tax reform, the Council recalls that in its opinion on the last update, it con sidered a budgetary surplus in the medium term crucial to bringing down the debt level decisively, which the Council regarded as appropriate in view of the long-term expenditure pressures re sulting from population ageing. Indeed, on the ba sis of current policies, the risk of unsustainable public finances in the light of ageing populations cannot be excluded. In this context, the Council welcomes the attention paid to longer-term is sues, as demonstrated by the fundamental pension reform which is being prepared to tackle financial and economic pressures from population ageing. The Council strongly encourages the Austrian Government to implement with determination the ambitious reform projects in the fields of pensions and healthcare, addressing many of the key prob lems in these areas, including raising the low ef fective retirement age in Austria and encouraging labour-force participation, in particular of older workers and women. Beyond these undertakings, the national stability pact should be fully imple mented, which would require spending restraint to attain sustainable structural surpluses at the Lander level. The Council notes the Austrian Government's in tention to reduce, as recommended, the high tax burden significantly. In particular, the Council in vites the Austrian Government to implement the reduction in non-wage labour costs, already post poned several times. The Council recalls, how ever, its opinion on the last update, stating that revenue reductions should be accompanied by equivalent reductions of expenditure. Therefore, in order to avoid the projected sizeable increase in the cyclically-adjusted deficit and the risk of a pro-cyclical stance, the Council urges the Aus trian authorities to offset the cost of the tax reform by additional structural expenditure cuts. Past ex perience shows that tax cuts only partly matched by commensurate spending restraint are a partic ularly risky strategy. Given the considerable widening of the deficit, in both nominal and structural terms after 2004, and the current debt level, the Council considers that the envisaged path of government finances in the updated stability programme is only partly in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, because the cyclically-adjusted deficit stays close to balance only in the years 2004 and 2007. Although the projected path of government fi nances would leave sufficient safety margin to prevent the deficit from breaching the 3 % of GDP reference value in the event of a normal cy clical downturn, the risks to the government's strategy are non-negligible. In particular, if the announced expenditure savings were only partly implemented, Austria would not have sufficient budgetary leeway to let the automatic stabilisers work fully in the event of a cyclical slowdown. The Council therefore considers that the expendi ture cuts need to be implemented as planned. In addition, the envisaged tax relief ought to be ac companied by additional expenditure restraint in order to avoid the risk of budgetary slippage and to allow Austria to return earlier than foreseen to a budgetary position close to balance. Already in 2003, the government should seek to achieve a better deficit outcome than projected, especially if growth should turn out higher than expected or if the flood-related emergency funds are not fully called upon.

In this communication, the Commission responds to the Brussels spring European Council's invitation to look at ways of streamlining cooperation and co\u00ad ordination at EU level in the field of social protec\u00ad tion. After outlining the main stages in the devel\u00ad opment of policy cooperation at EU level in relation to the modernisation of social protection and the fight against poverty and social exclusion, with particular reference to the Lisbon European Council's decision to apply the open coordination method to social protection, the Commission ex\u00ad plains that the streamlining process should: give rise to greater consistency as regards instruments for coordinating economic and employment poli\u00ad cies within the Union; give greater prominence to social protection under the Lisbon strategy; and simplify the existing coordination processes in terms of Member States' objectives and contribu\u00ad tions. The Commission goes on to make specific proposals for streamlining social protection mechanisms, taking account of various require\u00ad ments (respect for subsidiarity, use of the open method of coordination, fields covered, flexibility and progressiveness): \u25a1 definition of common objectives structured around the three pillars of social inclusion, pen\u00ad sions, and healthcare and long\u00adterm care, for adoption by 2006 and applicable for three years; thought should also be given to ways of stepping up coordination of policies in the field of health and long\u00adterm care as part of the streamlined so\u00ad cial protection process; D from 2004 onwards, the Commission and the Council should draw up a joint annual report on social protection, supplemented by contributions from the Member States (comprehensive, for\u00ad ward\u00adlooking reports every three years following the adoption of common objectives across the board, interspersed with lighter reports); \u25a1 development of a set of agreed indicators, limited in number and reflecting fully the com\u00ad mon objectives; D progressive introduction of this new stream\u00ad lined approach, according to a timetable and spe\u00ad cific provisions for the 2003 to 2006 transitional period, taking account of enlargement; D full implementation of the streamlined method according to a detailed timetable over the years 2006 to 2009.

Welcoming the setting-up of the EU Multi-Stakeholder Forum on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Parliament took the view that CSR policy ought to be developed on a voluntary basis, although companies should be required to contribute to a cleaner environment by law. It stressed the need for the work of the multi- stakeholder forum to respect the requirements and nature of small and medium-sized enterprises, with emphasis also on increasing the number of women in business and involving them more in dialogue and decision-making, in order to strengthen companies' sense of social and envi ronmental responsibility. Parliament pointed out also that the integration of CSR into EU policy making ought to be in line with the integration of sustainable development as agreed at the Gothen burg European Council. It called for CSR to be promoted at international level as well as in the candidate countries, and for steps to be taken to improve companies' performance in the environ mental, social and, more generally, sustainable development fields. As regards the provision of information, Parliament sought transparency and access for citizens from the environmental, social, public security and human rights viewpoints, and wanted speedier development of eco-labels and social labelling.

It must meet the chal lenges of enlargement and the ageing of the pop ulation and maintain the course it has already em barked on: becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.

In this Green Paper, the Commission fully re-examines its policies regarding services of general interest and states its intention to organise an open debate on the overall role of the European Union in de fining the general-interest objectives to be pur sued by these services and on the way in which they are organised, financed and evaluated. The Green Paper reaffirms the significant contribution the internal market and competition rules have made to modernising and improving the quality and efficiency of many public services to the ben efit of Europe's citizens and businesses. It also deals with globalisation and liberalisation, raising the question of whether a general legislative framework should be established at Community level for services of general interest. It seeks to address these matters by asking questions on: the scope of possible Community action that imple ments the Treaty in full respect of the principle of subsidiarity; the principles that could be included in a possible framework directive or another gen eral instrument concerning services of general in terest and the added value of such an instrument; the definition of good governance in the area of organisation, regulation, financing and evaluation of services of general interest; any measures that could contribute to increasing legal certainty and to ensuring a coherent and harmonious link be tween the objective of maintaining high-quality services of general interest and rigorous applica tion of competition and internal market rules.

Commission decision concerning Post Of fice Limited. Adopted on 27 May. The Commission has ap proved additional financing measures taken by the UK Government in favour of Post Office Lim ited (POL), the retail subsidiary of Royal Mail Group pic. POL is loss-making primarily on ac count of its statutory obligation to cover the entire territory of the United Kingdom, which requires it to maintain counters that are structurally unprof itable. The new series of measures is designed to offset the net costs of this service, especially in rural areas. In addition, the government will give POL the minimum means necessary to enable it to return to profit by 2006. Lastly, it will grant POL a rolling working capital loan to help it fulfil its public service obligation to make over-the-coun ter cash payments. As these financing measures simply compensate for the net additional costs connected with the performance and continuity of its public service obligation, no real advantage will be conferred on POL. In accordance with the latest case law, the measures in question do not therefore constitute aid. Multi-purpose aid schemes Regional aid Germany 1.3.52. KGaA.

Regional development aid amount ing to EUR 16.46 million has been approved (EUR 17.61 million was requested). The training and research aid projects have been approved in their entirety, while the investment aid towards innovation has not been approved as the project was not truly innovative and did not contain any incentive to take industrial and technological risks.

The Council welcomed the Commission communication on industrial policy in an enlarged Europe, which stresses the impor tance of the contribution of industry to competi tiveness. The Council emphasised that industrial policy is horizontal in nature and involves the ap plication of enterprise policy instruments, aiming at securing framework conditions favourable to industrial competitiveness while taking into ac count the specific needs and characteristics of in dividual sectors; that the coherence between the different Community policies requires that the balance between the three pillars of sustainable development \u2014 economic, social and environ mental \u2014 is such that competitiveness is im proved; that an effective industrial policy implies the search for the appropriate balance between the different objectives of Community policies that have an impact on the competitiveness of indus try; the importance of actively pursuing efforts to develop knowledge, innovation and entrepre neurship as key factors affecting industrial com petitiveness; and the importance of competition policy in reinforcing global industrial competi tiveness, while ensuring complementarity and synergies between competition and industrial pol icy. In this respect the targets set by the Barcelona European Council must be fully met, taking due account of services of general interest.

The Council welcomed the Commission's intention to increase its efforts to foster a European innovation policy that contrib utes to strengthening European competitiveness and progress towards a knowledge-based econ omy. It emphasised that innovation goes beyond technological innovation and can take many other forms, such as through the development of new business concepts, new means of distribution, marketing or design and through organisational or presentational change; that the speed and effi ciency of the spreading of innovation through the economy is critical to productivity, economic growth and job creation; that advanced electronic communications are a powerful engine within the information society which contributes to the mo mentum of this process; that enterprises must be considered as central to innovation in Europe and small firms should benefit from improved busi ness support services facilitating access to techni cal, financial and legal information and advice; that R &D and technology transfer are essential for long-term economic growth, while recognis ing that they must be accompanied by measures to facilitate the successful exploitation of results, such as prototyping, testing and adaptation, engi neering, reengineering and demonstration. The Council invited the Member States, acceding countries and the Commission to cooperate in fur ther developing the analysis and discussion of the innovation process, policies and performances; to ensure appropriate coordination of innovation policy, on a voluntary basis, at EU, national and regional levels; to strengthen existing processes, in the framework of the Trend Chart on Innova tion in Europe, enabling Member States to learn from each other's experience in innovation policy development and implementation; to contribute to promoting innovation in the public sector by promoting training and awareness activities on policies and factors shaping the innovation per formance of firms; and to exchange good prac tices and consider launching initiatives offering, on a voluntary basis, independent evaluations of individual national programmes, schemes and support agencies for the promotion of innovation in the Member States. 28 Bull.

As part of the follow-up to the conclusions of the Tampere European Coun cil, the Commission presents in this communica tion a summary of the progress made since De cember 2002 and the priorities for the next six months, in the key areas for creating an area of freedom, security and justice, namely immigra tion, asylum, justice, fighting and preventing crime, external borders, policy on visas, citizen ship and stronger external action. The Commis sion points out that this report is presented just one year ahead of the deadline set by the Amster dam Treaty for the completion of an area of free dom, security and justice, within the context of the forthcoming enlargement of the European Un ion to ten new Member States. It calls on the Council to strive to achieve notable progress, par ticularly as regards immigration, asylum and management of the external borders, thereby making a meaningful contribution to the aims in itially set out at Tampere. Progress is required also in respect of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, particularly as regards the prin ciple of mutual recognition, with parallel action taking account of the specific characteristics of the future Member States. Stressing the impor tance of the year 2003 for determining the future shape of European action in the justice and home affairs area, the Commission considers it essential that in a new Single Treaty and in a Union of at least 25 Member States, greater use should be made of qualified majority voting in the Council and the European Parliament should be granted the right of codecision.

It stressed that the proposed Constitutional Treaty should grant EU citizenship to third\u00adcountry nationals who reside on a stable or long\u00adterm basis in the European Union. It be\u00ad lieved, moreover, that this would help create plu\u00ad ral, inclusive and participatory European citizen\u00ad ship, and called for the granting of political rights to third\u00adcountry nationals, such as the right to stand as a candidate or to vote in local and Euro\u00ad pean elections.

Stressing the need for a more comprehensive, multidiscipli- nary EU-levcl approach to the problem of corrup tion, the Commission identifies areas where the EU institutions could usefully take new initiatives with a view to implementing an overall anti-cor ruption strategy. To this end, the Commission be lieves that the Member States and the EU institu tions and bodies should show strong political commitment against all forms of corruption at the highest levels. The implementation of existing anti-corruption instruments should be strength ened through the adhesion of the European Union to the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), with improved investigative tools and stronger action to combat political corruption and the illicit financing of social partner entities and other interest groups at EU and national level. Common integrity standards applicable to public administrations across the EU should be devel oped and support should be given to the private sector in its efforts to raise integrity and corporate responsibility. Acceding, candidate and other third countries should be given assistance in deal ing with corruption-related problems and imple menting national anti-corruption policies, and the fight against corruption should become an inte gral parto!\"the Union's external and trade policy.

Under the monitoring and evaluation procedure for the Eu ropean Training Foundation, established by Reg ulation (EEC) No 1360/90, the Commission is re porting on the work of the Foundation since 1997. It considers that within the Community's new ex ternal relations policy framework, the Foundation has a useful contribution to make as a centre of expertise in the field of vocational education and training and labour market reform in its four part ner regions. It recommends that the Foundation should accelerate its adaptation to the new exter nal relations environment by consolidating activ ities in the partner countries, in line with the Com mission's priorities. The Foundation should also concentrate its available resources in order to cap italise on its current expertise and consolidate its reputation as regards its stakeholders, in particu lar the European institutions.

It also pointed to the possibility of making education systems more attractive by using sport as an educational instru ment to boost the involvement of young people both in formal education and non-formal learning. It stressed the role that could be played by sport for social cohesion, especially among disadvan taged young people, and in contributing to inter- cultural understanding and combating racism, xenophobia, sexism and other forms of discrimi nation. Lastly, the Council considered that volun tary activities in sport should be fostered, whilst safeguarding the specific characteristics of sport and promoting its ethical values and Olympic ide als, thereby avoiding excessive development of the economic dimension of sport. 1.4.26.

By contrast, it reported that the situation with the definition of hazardous Bull. EU 5\u00ad2003 49 ",
        "Environment waste had improved although a few Member States still had not fully transposed every part of this definition. In addition, the Commission found that the number of countries which had established separate collection systems for hazardous house hold waste had increased since the 1995-97 re port. Similarly, the success of waste recycling dif fered widely from one Member State to another. The mean recycling rate for domestic waste for the 15 Member States was 26 % (ranging from 8 % to 63 %). The overall trend was upward but still not enough considering the environmental damage caused. Despite the positive results achieved, the Commission therefore concluded that not all the principles and mechanisms provided for in the various directives on waste and waste treatment had been implemented satisfactorily and that fur ther progress was needed on this subject.

Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the development of energy policy for the enlarged European Union, its neighbours and partner coun tries. Adopted on 13 May. The Commission points out that the countries neighbouring on the EU, as at present constituted and in its future composition, play a vital role in the EU's energy policy by meeting much of its natural gas and oil require ments and for the transit of primary energy to the EU. It therefore sets out three energy policy ob jectives: enhancing the security of energy sup plies for the European continent; strengthening the internal energy market in the enlarged EU; and facilitating the carrying-out of major new en ergy infrastructure projects. The Commission highlights in particular the problems raised by nu clear energy, dialogue with Russia in this field, the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean En ergy Forum, the northern dimension, and the Cas pian Basin. COM(2003) 262 1.4.49. Council conclusions on energy relations with third countries. Reference: Kyoto protocol on climate change: Bull. 4-1998, point 1.2.114 Adopted on 14 May. The Council stressed that co operation with third countries in the field of en ergy should be promoted on the basis of certain principles such as: mutual recognition of the ob jective needs of the parties; sustainable develop ment, taking into account the environmental im pact of different energy sources and technologies; the involvement in this cooperation of all the third-country partners, without exception, and consideration for the national characteristics of the third countries; adequate involvement of all energy stakeholders, including the private sector, industry and relevant financial institutions; and good use of forums. Also, with regard to the energy dialogue with Russia, it reaffirmed the importance of long-term contracts, urged Russia to ratify the Kyoto proto col within the deadlines set, and underlined the necessity to move forward on the questions of reciprocity concerning market access and envi ronmental and nuclear standards. As regards Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in this area, the Council welcomed the progress achieved, in particular concerning security of sup ply, environmental protection through the promo tion of new and renewable energy sources, the promotion of competitiveness, and regional and national electricity and gas development and in vestment projects. As regards the energy dimension of south-eastern Europe, it reiterated the importance of establish ing open, reliable and competitive markets, and stressed the principles which should guide this cooperation: closer dialogue with industry, liber alisation of the energy market, infrastructure completion and interconnections, and the devel opment and strengthening of environmental as pects. Lastly, as regards the northern dimension, the Council reiterated the importance of energy rela tions with the Union. Security of supply and international cooperation 1.4.50.

The Com mission's proposal for a framework decision aims to strengthen the criminal-law measures to ap proximate the provisions laid down by law or reg ulation in the Member States concerning ship- source pollution offences and to facilitate and en courage cooperation between the Member States to deal with such offences. The Commission is therefore proposing the adoption of common def initions, indictments and penalties, as a reflection of the EU's determination to legislate to ensure that disasters such as that of the Prestige oil tanker do not occur. To this end, the proposal con tains provisions concerning a minimum harmo nised level of maximum penalties, jurisdiction, criminal investigations in the port State, joint in vestigation teams, the commencement of pro ceedings, the notification of information and the designation of contact points.

In its communication, the Commission gives an overview of the potential threats, such as international terrorism, and of the economic data concerning maritime transport within the Community, taking stock of the re sources, players and infrastructure concerned, and describes the actions under way in the various international bodies (G8, International Maritime Organisation \u2014 IMO, World Customs Organisa tion), and also the US security initiatives and Community action in this area. It then goes on to examine the issues at stake in establishing inter national rules and adapting them at Community level, with regard in particular to port security, the security of the transport logistics chain, and the monitoring and administration of maritime secu rity. Lastly, the Commission puts forward a set of\" legislative actions to be undertaken such as en hancing the security of seafarers' identification and additional security measures to be applied in Community ports. In its proposal for regulation, the Commission is proposing the implementation within the Commu nity of the international instruments adopted at the IMO diplomatic conference in December 2002 (amendments to the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the International Ship and Port Fa cility Security Code). It even goes beyond the IMO requirements by making certain recommen dations concerning the level of security manda tory; by requiring a single national authority re sponsible for ship and port facility security; by bringing forward the application of certain meas ures; by providing for a process of inspections su pervised by the Commission; by assigning the European Maritime Safety Agency the role of as sisting with the performance of these tasks; by ex tending certain provisions (security assessments, security plans and the designation of security of ficers by companies and ships) to ships engaged in domestic traffic and not just ships engaged in in ternational traffic.

COM(2003) 230 1.4.70. Council conclusions on severe acute res piratory syndrome (SARS). Adopted on 6 May. The Council noted that the network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Commu nity had provided an effective basis for the rapid exchange of information within the EU and for a coordinated response. It pointed out that the ap plication of health protection measures fell to the authorities of the Member States and that Com munity action should continue to focus on efforts within the communicable disease network and the Community action programme on public health. Moreover, the Council approved the approach taken by the network committee, entailing rapid detection, isolation of SARS patients, standard ised screening measures, advice and information, cooperation with other countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and airlines. It un derlined the need for continued cooperation be tween the Member States, the Commission and the WHO in assisting the affected areas, in devel oping a validated diagnostic test and in promoting research on vaccines and anti-viral agents. The Council supported the efforts of the WHO to speed up the revision of international health regu lations and urged the Member States and acceding countries to: implement the guidelines adopted by the network committee; contribute to setting up a specific expert group and provide by 15 May all relevant information on the measures taken to address SARS. Lastly, the Council noted the Commission's intention to submit a proposal to create a European centre for disease prevention and control. Bull. EU 5-2003 59 ",

It also adopted an annex on orientations by the presi dency on the reinforcement of cooperation in the field of armaments. In the area of crisis management, the Council wel comed the successful start of operation Concordia in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (an EU-led military operation designed to posi tively underpin the implementation of the Ohrid framework agreement). It welcomed the progress made by the first ESDP operation, the EU Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUPM), since it was launched in January 2003. The EUPM's initial priorities, i.e. returnee security and the fight against organised crime, were yield ing successful results in good cooperation with the Bosnia and Herzegovina police authorities. In this context, the Council welcomed the participa tion of acceding States and third countries in these two EU-led operations. On the subject of military crisis management, the Council welcomed the implementation of perma nent arrangements between the EU and NATO. The Council welcomed the important work un dertaken and the progress made in improving EU military capabilities since November 2002, through the implementation of the European ca pability action plan (ECAP). The Council took note of the 'Helsinki Force Catalogue 2003' and the 'Helsinki Forces Catalogue 2003 Supple ment'. In the context of the provisions of the EU capability development mechanism (CDM), the Council approved the 'Progress report on military capabilities'. Recognising the importance of the coherent and mutually reinforcing development of military capabilities where requirements over lap, it welcomed the first meeting of the EU- NATO Capability Group. Recognising the impor tant role of the defence industry in delivering ap propriate interoperable and cost-effective capa bilities, the Council called for a sufficient level of resources and better coordination in the field of research and development; underlined the need to strengthen the European defence, technological and industrial base and ensure security of supply as a contribution to the development of European military capabilities; pointed out the need to en hance European defence industrial cooperation as Member States consider appropriate. The Council welcomed proposals and initiatives, including also in the context of the Convention on the Fu ture of Europe, concerning a defence capabilities development and acquisition agency within the EU. The Council welcomed the presentation by the Commission of its recent communication on an EU defence equipment policy and encouraged the Member States and the Commission to work together in considering the relevant proposals. The Council concluded that the Union had, in principle, the ability to conduct EU military crisis management operations requiring rapid response. Nevertheless, there remained some important strategic limitations and their resolution de pended on the political willingness and ability to accelerate decision-making, which would allow timely military crisis response planning and force preparation, and on Member States' readiness rapidly to contribute the required interoperable assets and capabilities for the conduct of the oper ation. It requested the Political and Security Com mittee (PSC) to continue guiding the necessary EU developments in this field. On the issue of civilian crisis management, the Council welcomed the continued progress in the four areas of police, rule of law, civilian adminis tration and civil protection. On conflict prevention, the Council welcomed the continuing implementation of the programme for the prevention of violent conflicts. In this context, it welcomed the Presidency's emphasis on the re gional dimension of conflict prevention. 7.6.7. Council declaration on EU military capa bilities.

Previous report: COM(2002) 622; Bui point 1.6.41 -2002, Adopted by the Commission on 6 May. The report highlighted the serious difficulties in world ship building, with decreasing order intake in the ma jor shipbuilding regions and prices locked at a very low level. The main reasons given were pro duction over-capacity, past over-supply, slowing economies around the world and the effects of 11 September in the United States. COM(2003) 232 1.6.44.

Parliament blamed the de cline of the European shipbuilding industry on unfair competition from subsidised South Korean shipyards, pointing out that the EU's share of the shipbuilding market had fallen from 19 % in 2000 to only 10 % in the first half of 2002. Parliament also drew attention to reports that South Korea was continuing to offer prices lower than costs, with negative margins varying between 20 % and 40 %, which was driving other shipyards bank rupt. It strongly supported the Commission in the dispute settlement procedure against South Korea within the World Trade Organisation. Parliament also urged the Commission and the Member States to speed up the investigations into the dam age being done by South Korean shipyards to cat egories of vessels not included in the temporary defence mechanism set up so far.

Since these products are to be used to treat the very poor suf fering from one of the three diseases referred to in the action programme, deflection of trade involv ing their reimport and resulting disruption of the EU market should be prevented.

Emphasising that universal, compulsory, free, public and high-quality pri mary education was the foundation for an educa tion strategy for the developing countries, Parlia ment asked the Commission to adopt measures to promote education in these countries. In particu lar, it proposed: the setting of a budgetary target for education (doubling of funds allocated to edu cation); a more substantial allocation of funds for education on the occasion of the mid-term review of national indicative programmes; and consist ency and complementarity of development poli cies on education. Parliament also asked the Commission and the Member States to give pref erential support to countries committed to educa tion strategies, and to support the 'Fast track' ini tiative both financially and in terms of opening it to a larger number of countries. It stressed the im portance of developing education measures to ad dress certain categories of the population, in par ticular women and girls, homeless children and victims of conflicts; enhancing complementarity between education and health policies; adapting education systems to the local culture; banning child labour and ensuring that teachers have ap propriate training and pay; using the best technol ogy and forms of communication to transmit knowledge; promoting cooperation between local actors, and; harmonising education programmes in the countries concerned. 1.6.51.

Welcoming the Commis sion's communication advocating a complete un tying of aid, including food aid and transport, in the interests of greater effectiveness, the Council asked the Commission to present proposals and an implementation timetable for achieving this objective. It thought that the proposals should be based on the following principles: untying of aid for developing countries, the conditions for unty ing aid by the developed countries, case-by-case assessment of the situation, and reciprocity. The Council believed that the untying of aid also had to be applied in the context of cooperation with international organisations, such as UN agencies, funds and programmes. The Commission was asked to make appropriate proposals to that end and to examine the consequences on the develop ing countries of further untying of aid from geo graphical financial instruments. 1.6.52.

Adopted on 15 May. The Committee put forward a series of\" proposals for strengthening civil soci ety in the countries of the former Yugoslavia and Albania. Its proposals concerned both the social partners in south-east Europe (building mutual confidence and training in social dialogue mat ters) and civil society organisations (notably, con tinuation of efforts to determine their representa tiveness). The Committee considered that EU organisations should support the establishment in the region of appropriate networks of organisa tions covering relevant fields of activity. In the field of media and communications, the European Union should consider funding an event at which the promotion of civil dialogue and the strength ening of independent media in south-east Europe could be discussed. As the economic and social councils of south-east Europe develop, where ap propriate via twinning arrangements with the Eu ropean Economic and Social Committee or Mem ber State committees, they should be encouraged to cooperate with EU ESCs, and at the right time a body could be established with membership of south-east Europe civil society organisations and European Economic and Social Committee repre sentatives. 1.6.68.

Reiterating its concern at the deteriorating politi\u00ad cal situation in Zimbabwe and the domestic and external repercussions of this situation, Parlia\u00ad ment stressed the inconsistency of the European Union's sanctions policy and the derogations granted to certain public figures from Zimbabwe. Parliament considered that, to avoid repetition of the kind of incident that led to the cancellation of the fifth session of the ACP\u00adEC Joint Parliamen\u00ad tary Assembly in November 2002, it would be more legitimate and effective if sanctions were to be imposed against a country or a regime only after a joint decision had been taken by that As\u00ad sembly.

OJL 115,9.5.2003 1.6.116. European Parliament resolution on the situation in Ituri. Adopted on 15 May. Parliament considered that the presence of the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) in the Ituri region, and its mandate, remained clearly insufficient and needed boosting. Parliament condemned the crimes and human rights violations, the acts of pillage committed against the population by the troops and armed militias \u2014 especially the use of sexual violence against women and girls as a tool of warfare \u2014 and expressed serious concern at the grave humanitarian situation in the area. It also condemned the enlistment of child soldiers, called for the rapid disarmament of the paramili tary forces, for the immediate and permanent withdrawal of the foreign militias and troops still present on DRC territory and for neighbouring governments immediately to cease providing fi nancial support to any of the parties engaged in the armed conflict. Parliament called on all par ties to pursue the efforts begun with a view to con solidating peace and national reconciliation and on the Commission to continue its support in this direction, particularly by setting up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission charged with deter mining who had responsibility for the serious vi olations of human rights and international human itarian law.
