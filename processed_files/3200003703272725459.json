        "Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union Eurostat\u2019s mission is to be the leading provider of high quality statistics on Europe. Eurostat publishes official, harmonised statistics on the European Union (EU) and the euro area which offer an objective portrayal of social and economic trends. These statistics are available for EU Member States, and are sometimes broken down by region. Furthermore, some of the indicators are published for candidate countries, EFTA countries and other non- member countries. Eurostat collects data from national statistical institutes; the statistics are harmonised according to Europe-wide methodologies. Data are, therefore, genuinely comparable across the whole of the EU. Website Eurostat\u2019s website: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat provides free access to EU statistics, and is also available in German and French. Statistics Explained is a wiki-based system that presents statistical topics in an easy to understand way. Together, the articles make up an encyclopaedia of European statistics. There one can also access the online publications Eurostat yearbook , Regional yearbook and The EU in the world . An overview of all Eurostat online publications is available under \u2018Full list\u2019. Eurostat releases a range of publications, all of which are free of charge on its website in PDF format; some of these are also available in German and French. Among these, the pocketbook Key figures on Europe 2014 provides a comprehensive set of information introducing readers to most statistical themes that are covered by Eurostat. Contact details Eurostat 5, rue Alphonse Weicker 2721 Luxembourg LUXEMBOURG E-mail: estat-user-support@ec.europa.eu More information: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat ISSN 2363-2380 \u00a9 European Union 2015 Cover: Luxembourg \u00a9 fotolia K S - G L - 15 - 003 - E N - N General information Coverage This short guide shows information for the EU, the euro area, the EU Member States and three EFTA countries. The euro area (EA- 19) is composed of: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland. The EU-28 includes the EA-19 countries and also: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The three EFTA countries covered are: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. In an effort to give readers a better overview of the data available in the Eurostat database, each edition of Basic figures on the EU will introduce a set of three alternating indicators. In this edition they are \u2018number of asylum seekers\u2019, \u2018cattle and pig population\u2019 and \u2018use of internet and cloud services\u2019. For the EU, the information presented in this short guide is generally based on data for the EU-28 and EA-19 aggregates. However, the data for inflation is based on moving aggregates that reflect the membership of the EU and euro area over time (coded EU and EA in the graphs). Quarterly growth rates are expressed in relation to the previous quarter. Quarterly rates are generally calculated using seasonally adjusted data, although rates for the government surplus and debt are based on non seasonally adjusted data. Furthermore, annual rates of change for inflation are also based on non seasonally adjusted data. Symbols and abbreviations : not available Figures in italics are estimates, provisional or forecast. Extraction date Data were extracted on 29 July 2015. The next edition (extraction planned: 31 October 2015) will be issued in November 2015. The most recent data is available at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/ database Data codes The Eurostat online data code, which is given at the bottom of each column of data in the tables and as part of the source for figures, provides users with a quick and efficient way of accessing the most up-to-date statistics. When used through the \u2018search\u2019 facility of Eurostat\u2019s website, each data code directs users to the corresponding dataset offering the freshest data and longer time-series. "
