        "Preface Across the EU today Member States are faced with similar challenges with respect to integrating immigrants into society. This is an increasingly important task and also a very complex and sensitive one. With the prospect of an ageing and declining population, more immigration into Europe is both likely and necessary in the coming years. Integration of immigrants is vital for social cohesion and economic development. To enable immigrants to feel part of our society we must treat them fairly, and ensure that they have the right tools to participate fully in our societies. Integration is a continuous, two-way process which is based on mutual rights and corresponding obligations both of immigrants and of the host society. At the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003, the Heads of State and Government stressed the importance of developing cooperation, exchange of experiences and information on integration at EU level with a view to learning from each other. In order to respond to this call, the National Contact Points on Integration, experts from the Member States who meet together regularly, decided to prepare a handbook of good practice. I very much welcome the publication of this first edition of the handbook on integration which provides a variety of examples and practices for successful integration implemented in the European Union. It sheds light on the many different projects and programmes existing across Europe at national, regional and local level and offers some general conclusions and lessons learned. I hope that this handbook will be of use for policy-makers and practitioners throughout the EU. It will also contribute to the development of a common European framework on integration. I am sure that both \u201cold hands\u201d and newcomers involved with the integration of immigrants will derive inspiration from this manual and that it will support our common goal of finding the best solutions to the challenges of integration.

        "Context The idea of developing a handbook on integration emanates from the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003, where Heads of State and Government stressed the importance of developing cooperation and exchange of information within the newly established group of National Contact Points on Integration. With a view to structuring this exchange of information and to obtaining some concrete results on which Member States could draw when developing and promoting policy initiatives for more successful integration, it was decided to compile a handbook on integration. The main objective of this handbook is therefore to act as a driver for the exchange of information and best practices between Member States. This handbook has been prepared for the European Commission by an independent consultant, the Migration Policy Group, and has been developed in close cooperation with the National Contact Points on Integration. It is based on the outcomes of a series of technical seminars held in Copenhagen (February 2004), Lisbon (April 2004) and London (June 2004). These seminars, organised by the ministries responsible for integration of these countries, with the support of the European Commission and facilitated by the Migration Policy Group, brought together governmental and non- governmental policy-makers and practitioners to exchange information and best practices on three issues: introduction programmes, participation in civic and political life and the development of indicators. The three chapters of the handbook reflect the structure of the seminars, each of which concentrated on one of these topics. In the preparation of each seminar, and with a view to framing the discussions, a series of issue papers was developed by the Migration Policy Group, which also drafted the concluding documents for the seminars. These were subsequently discussed within the group of National Contact Points on Integration. Both during the seminars and in the process of compiling the handbook the National Contact Points on Integration have contributed with examples of good practices and promising initiatives on integration from their respective countries. Together, all these elements have constituted the essential building blocks for this handbook on integration. This handbook is for policy-makers and practitioners. Who are they and what do they have in common that can make this handbook useful for both? Generally speaking policy-makers formulate overall integration goals, make resources available, monitor implementation and evaluate outcomes. Practitioners translate integration goals into concrete programmes, set targets and undertake activities to reach them. Clearly, it is beyond the scope of this handbook to deal with the formation of overall integration policies. Neither can a European handbook go into too much detail describing concrete programme activities. Therefore, this handbook depicts best practices and offers lessons drawn from practices in Member States on two kinds of integration programmes, namely introduction courses for newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees 6 Handbook on Integration ",
        "(Chapter 1) and civic participation (Chapter 2). In order to be better able to track the success of integration programmes and to measure their results both policy-makers and practitioners can develop integration indicators and benchmarks. Their use in public policy and integration programmes is explored in Chapter 3. On the basis of these chapters a scheme is proposed for the translation of integration goals into integration programmes (Annex). The scheme can help policy-makers and practitioners to clarify the goals of integration programmes, to report on their implementation and to measure achievements. In this way the exchange of good practices will be facilitated and becomes more fruitful. Throughout the three chapters best practices are briefly described. Where a particular country is mentioned in relation to a specific activity, this does not preclude the practice also existing in other countries. The lessons learned from the practices are highlighted throughout the text and are also reproduced as conclusions at the end of each Chapter. It is important to underline that the lessons learned and recommendations in this handbook should only be taken for what they are: suggestions to policy makers and practitioners and a catalogue of inspiring ideas. It should be underlined that the development of this handbook is intended to be an on-going process, a living instrument which will not only be developed over time on a step by step basis, but up-dated according to progress, new developments, solutions and results. A second edition with new chapters is therefore planned for 2006. The three topics chosen for this first edition of the handbook reflect the priorities identified in the Communication on Immigration, integration and employment , but the handbook will over time cover all policy fields related to integration, including housing, healthcare and labour market aspects. Brussels, November 2004 7 Handbook on Integration ",
        "Introduction Immigrant integration is generating much debate across the enlarged European Union in which most Member States are affected by migratory movements. Some countries have turned from emigration into immigration countries and are confronted with the issue of integration for the first time. Older immigration countries join them in the focus on newly arrived immigrants, but they also continue to promote the participation of settled immigrants while changing previous policies which have turned out not to be successful enough. As in other policy fields, the diversity of approaches represented across Europe suggests different answers to the question of \u2018how\u2019 to promote integration. The concept and practice of integration vary not only as a result of specific immigration histories. Different policy regimes and variations in the role of government and civil society have led to divergent approaches to the integration of new immigrants and refugees. An illustration of this diversity is the open question of which groups are or should be targets of integration policy. Different definitions are used for \u2018immigrants\u2019 or \u2018ethnic minorities\u2019. Second generation immigrants may be identified by their nationality or, if they are citizens, by their parents\u2019 birthplace. New Member States have historically placed emphasis on addressing minority issues, rather than on the integration of immigrants. Neither is there agreement on whether \u2018immigrants\u2019, however identified, should be considered as one group. Rather, they may be considered as individuals or as members of specific sub-categories defined by national or ethnic origin, religion, gender, age or by reason of their arrival (economic migrants, refugees, or family members) or their skills (from high-skilled to low skilled). Society as a whole may also be an appropriate policy target if integration is perceived as a process towards social cohesion. Policies are then a response to the disintegrating effects of the rapid social, economic and cultural change that most European societies are going through and target various groups among the population, whether or not they have a migration background. Consequently, under the heading of integration one can detect a mixture of general and specific approaches targeting different groups and addressing a variety of issues. European countries all adhere to human rights standards and share values such as equality, anti-discrimination, solidarity, openness, participation and tolerance. Governments at various levels are influencing each other through ongoing policy exchanges, leading to a certain degree of convergence in policy approaches, goals and targets, nationally and internationally. A great deal of common ground can be found in the identification of core areas or dimensions of integration. While a single exact definition of integration may prove to be too narrow, the identification of core integration dimensions can serve as a useful \u2018working definition\u2019. The overall goal of integration is often considered to be self-sufficiency: governments seek to enable immigrants to lead an independent life concerning housing, job, education, social networks and participation in society. The Commission\u2019s first Annual Report on Immigration and Integration demonstrates that in all Member States access to the labour 8 Handbook on Integration ",
        "market as well as language skills and a sufficient level of education constitute the most important objectives for securing successful integration. At the European level, labour market integration is the area with the most concretely defined policy objectives, as the 2003 Employment Strategy Guidelines propose to achieve a significant reduction in the unemployment gap between non-EU and EU nationals by 2010. Being in employment contributes to better living conditions, as does access to affordable and good quality housing. Lack of availability, low-quality housing and immigrant overrepresentation in deprived urban neighbourhoods are problematic for most Member States. This dimension of integration directs attention to local and urban policies and to the central role of local authorities in the process of integration. While the focus on socio-economic topics continues, governments also increasingly emphasise the importance of the socio-cultural sphere, the personal dimensions of integration and the frequency and intensity of social interactions. This approach stipulates the need for integrating immigrants into all aspects of society, including the civic, cultural and political fields. Moreover, the conception of integration as a two-way process directs attention towards the attitudes of the recipient societies, their citizens, structures and organisations alike. The different dimensions of integration are inter- related and outcomes in one domain reinforce the others. For instance, jobs are valuable in developing language and broader cultural competence and in establishing social connections. In turn, social connections widen economic opportunities. Language is useful in the labour market as well as providing further opportunities for education. At the same time, it indicates knowledge of the host population and society. Integration policies seek to achieve positive outcomes for immigrants within the domains of employment, housing, education, health etc. Newcomers and resident immigrants will be better able to achieve these outcomes if they develop certain skills, such as language proficiency and knowledge of the host society. In this sense, introduction programmes help newcomers acquire the skills to fully participate in society. At the same time, a focus on individual adaptation and human capital issues must be complemented with an emphasis on social cohesion and equality in diverse societies. Demand for skills must be matched with strong mechanisms for the acquisition of these skills and possibilities for using them. Society and its institutions must be active in opening themselves to immigrants. It is not only up to the immigrant to achieve skills, but also to governments and societal actors to ensure that ample opportunity is available for participation on the basis of equality and non-discrimination. Getting the balance of responsibility right is crucial for devising fair and effective integration policies. Besides being a relationship between \u2018state\u2019 and \u2018individual migrant\u2019, integration is a process in which close partnerships exist between different levels of government and non-governmental actors, such as employers, unions, religious organisations, civil society, migrants\u2019 associations, the media and NGOs supporting immigrants. Political 9 Handbook on Integration ",
        "leaders for example have a strong responsibility in their role as public educators and in promoting a positive attitude towards immigrants to counter xenophobic and racist tendencies. Employers may give access to jobs, provide skills training and language teaching, offer induction, facilitate access to housing, and inform the public debate about the economic benefits of immigration. The media also plays an important role in providing balanced reporting and informing the public\u2019s attitudes towards newcomers. Openness and good neighbourliness from the public are essential ingredients of successful integration and can be encouraged through volunteer programmes. Integration is a shared responsibility and involves the participation of many actors. The active participation of immigrants rests on rights and obligations gradually being brought in line with those of nationals. Access to institutions, services and means of civic participation create the conditions for the exercise of active citizenship by migrants. The openness of associative life, ranging from sports clubs to political parties, is decisive for the outcome of the process. Organisations of all types need to give visibility to inter- cultural realities by applying equal-opportunity policies, employing migrants at all levels, and cooperating with associations of migrants. Migrant organisations are also key partners in the exercise of participatory government. Political decisions especially at the local level significantly affect non-citizen residents, who can participate through various consultation mechanisms. At the same time, migrants can be encouraged to naturalise. 10 Handbook on Integration ",
        "11 Handbook on Integration What does it take to share best practice A possible definition of best practices could be: approaches that have been shown, through research and evaluation, to be effective and sustainable and produce outstanding results, and that can be applicable in and adapted to a different situation. \u2022 Lessons can be learned from both good and bad practices \u2022 Most practices have both strong and weak elements \u2022 No practice can be replicated in its entirety \u2022 All practices need to be adapted to local circumstances Documentation on best practices needs to capture \u2022 What was the problem the practice addressed and who identified the problem? \u2022 Who initiated the practice and who was involved? \u2022 How did the practice develop and what were the stages? \u2022 What were the positive and/or negative consequences? \u2022 What is the long-term financial viability? \u2022 Effectiveness: the impact of the practice \u2022 Efficiency: the ratio of impact to cost \u2022 Sustainability: lasting impact and replicability \u2022 Externalities: i.e. any unintended positive and negative impacts of the practice on other than the immediate beneficiaries \u2022 Relevance: the significance of the practice for the target group ^ ^ ",

        "This chapter looks at the design and implementation of introduction programmes. Participants can learn the language, establish links with the labour market and gain knowledge of the host society in well-planned and resourced programmes. Governments can work with local authorities, social partners and NGOs as partners and regularly evaluate programmes for a successful effort at introduction. Integration is a process lasting several years, in many cases beyond naturalisation or into the second and third generations. Commitment underpins the process when receiving societies undertake to welcome immigrants and provide them with opportunities to become familiar with the language, basic values and customs and when from their side immigrants show a determination to become part of the receiving society. Introduction programmes are an investment in the future which both the immigrant and society should be willing to make. They give immigrants a start enabling them to acquire vital skills to become self-sufficient and are therefore well worth the effort. The return on investment for society is that immigrants become better-equipped citizens capable of contributing to society. The early stages of a migrant\u2019s residence in the receiving country are of particular importance. Some governments have launched introduction programmes for the early phase of a migrant\u2019s stay. Introduction programmes generally consist of three main components: language tuition, civic orientation and professional labour market training. 14 Handbook on Integration Introduction of newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees * An example of an introduction programme comes from the city of Gent (Belgium), which has a municipal integration service, funded by the City and in large part by the Flemish Community (under the headings of urban policy and integration). Its reception programme puts into practice Flemish legislation (2003, implemented since 1 April 2004) which entails introduction courses for newly arrived family members, regularised migrants, recognised refugees, victims of trafficking and minors. The legislation also covers asylum seekers who have reached a certain stage in the determination process where their claim is being examined in detail. For some groups the introduction courses are obligatory. The introduction programme includes Dutch classes (up to 1200 hours in four levels, of which 120 are given in the centre itself) and 75 hours of \u2018society orientation\u2019 classes. The \u2018society orientation\u2019 classes have modules on practical and administrative questions and provide information on how to access cultural and social activities. In Gent, they are provided in Turkish, Arabic, French, English, Russian, Spanish, Persian, Albanian and Somali as well as Dutch. The city also seeks to provide a \u2018custom- made\u2019 individual reception programme together with other organisations, including guidance on employment, education and training. At the moment around 500 adult newcomers follow the introduction programme. www.gent.be/integratiedienst/, Kom-Pas Centre: kom.pas@gent.be Z$ ",
        "1.1 Designing programmes Offering courses at several levels using different formats and a range of teaching methods can help to achieve successful language training for immigrants with different educational backgrounds or previous knowledge of the country and language. This leads to usable qualifications. Ideally the programmes provide for tests after the courses in order to validate the learning level of participants. Language training Especially in countries where newly arriving immigrants and refugees do not yet have knowledge of the local language through colonial or other ties, language teaching constitutes the centrepiece of introduction efforts by governments. Courses are generally aimed at legally resident adults who do not have sufficient knowledge of the official language or languages. Although governments devote a lot of resources to language programmes, many are concerned that optimal results are not reached. Participants are often allocated to different levels of language training. In Sweden, the given language skills of the participants are evaluated to distribute them over four levels (two levels are used to differentiate participants with an academic background). In the integration courses provided under the 2004 German immigration law, the class allocation will reflect prior language skills as well as educational experiences. In contrast, the migratory group which the participant belongs to will not be relevant for the allotment into a language class as has been the case in the past. Many countries offer separate literacy classes - generally with more intensive teaching - and special courses for young migrants. Often, courses conclude with a language test. In Denmark for instance, language courses and tests are related to the levels of the \u2018Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, teaching, assessment\u2019 (CEFR) of the Council of Europe. When course certificates are of a format which is known to employers and other educational institutions, they prove to be useful to the participants in accessing further labour market or training opportunities. The content and methods of teaching are to be designed with these opportunities in mind. A German evaluation of language courses commissioned by the Interior Ministry points out that the teaching and validation of written language skills are crucial, since to function in the German society and labour market often requires proficiency in writing. Although oral communication skills are indispensable, they should not be the sole emphasis of language courses. The evaluation suggests that language training should focus on the public and work situations where the migrant is likely to require knowledge of German. 15 Handbook on Integration * * ",
        "Vocational content of introduction courses Best practice suggests designing introduction courses in a flexible way, allowing for parallel teaching of language and labour market participation rather than relying on strict sequential models for language learning, vocational training and higher education. Ideally courses integrate language and vocational training and validate existing skills. If self-sufficiency is the goal of introduction programmes, establishing a close link with the labour market must be central to their design. Many participants will not have affiliations with the labour market upon arrival if they entered via family reunification schemes or as refugees. Job-seeking assistance, professional advice centres, partnership contracts and vocational training can all be a part of introduction programmes, offered in addition to or integrated with language learning. For instance, in Denmark labour market training may include short-term education, on-the-job training or recruitment with a wage subsidy. The immigrant or refugee may also be offered a mentor in order to support the development of his or her social, linguistic and vocational qualifications. Combined employment-language programmes are often valuable, as participants especially benefit from language teaching where it is placed in the context of work or training. Newcomers reach goals faster if they are allowed to do many things at once, so programmes should run in parallel rather than sequentially. For instance, in the Netherlands so-called \u2018dual path\u2019 programmes consist of a combination of the Dutch language with another element (i.e. support in raising children, work, vocational training, voluntary jobs or social activation). Individuals with professional training and/or previous experience of working life, in particular, can receive an introduction that is work-oriented and within their professional area. In this way, the content of the programme can actively support the individual\u2019s entry into the labour market as well as facilitate the learning of the local language. In the interest of the participants\u2019 sustained motivation, it should be avoided that people have to learn the same things over and over again. Introduction courses should serve the goal of allowing every newcomer to make use of his or her full potential on the labour market, so that vital human resources will not be wasted. Dynamic ways of assessing the skills of newcomers, relying less on formal criteria and valuing different kinds of experience, are most useful for the validation of experience and knowledge obtained in the country of origin. The ESF-funded SPECIMA project in Finland targets immigrants with an academic or other higher degree. The project seeks to identify motivated experts, to determine their level of know-how, and to place them in Finnish companies and organisations. Measures associated with this include recognition of degrees, continuing training and acquisition of qualifications as well as networking. www.mol.fi/migration/ 16 Handbook on Integration Introduction of newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees * * ",
        "Swedish government funding in 2003 was directed towards labour market training for persons with foreign post-secondary education in areas where there was a shortage of staff (health and medical care workers, teachers, technologists and scientists) as well as in nurse\u2019s training for unemployed immigrants. The purpose of the latter was to meet the need for bilingual workers in primary care and care of the elderly. Dropout rates in introduction programmes are high often because participants find jobs before the end of the course. However, many governments are concerned that such jobs may be low skilled and that, considering the lack of job security in this sector of the economy, immigrants may need to fall back on social welfare if they do not have the skills to obtain a qualified position. A better solution could be to adapt the form and content of introduction programmes for immigrants who are already working. For instance, Denmark is developing IT-based language learning programmes for home use so that language learning does not interfere with job training. Courses can also take place at the public or private enterprise where the participant receives work training or has obtained employment, or at the public educational institution where the participant receives further education. Offering part-time courses, distance or e-learning and similar models enables participants to continue with introduction programmes while at the same time taking on a job. In several countries, the municipalities which carry out introduction programmes draw up individual work plans and allocate courses according to the person\u2019s needs. Although the aim is always to find the best matching programmes for each individual, it is not always possible to offer the whole range of services needed for individually targeted training. This is particularly true in less densely populated areas. The pooling of resources enables adjacent municipalities to offer different types of courses. It also makes it possible for participants to live in one municipality and do training or work in another, in this way avoiding the loss of family contacts or networks in case of a move. Civic content of introduction courses Introduction courses ideally convey the message of a welcoming society which gives incentives to the newcomer to feel responsible for the community he or she is going to live in. Besides language, introduction courses also often stress the importance of \u2018social orientation\u2019 and of giving immigrants knowledge of the functioning and the values of society. Courses can cover the fundamental elements of the constitution, such as respect for human rights and democracy, and the functioning of the political system including opportunities for political and civil society participation. Orientation about gender equality and children\u2019s rights are important components of many programmes. 17 Handbook on Integration ** * ",
        "Practical elements are also considered important in many countries. For instance, the Dutch integration programme includes courses to familiarise participants with the Dutch healthcare, education and welfare systems, as well as national customs. The planned citizenship classes in the UK will include information on how to obtain services, how to access the labour market, knowledge of the different community and faith groups in the UK, and of the norms of society. With regard to values, it should be recognised that the resident population is also very diverse in terms of values and behaviours, and does not always live up to the standards presented to immigrants. An introduction to values is best framed as a common endeavour in which both newcomers and the receiving society strive to meet the standards set by the country\u2019s norms and rules. How does civic content fit into the design of introduction programmes? It may be that governments wish to place civic orientation at the beginning of the immigrant\u2019s course trajectory, rather than leaving it until a later stage when his or her language skills would be more suited to complex material. On the other hand, some governments aim to combine civic content with language teaching, as it can provide relevant and interesting content for adult training classes. In Austria, there is no special course \u2018block\u2019 on societal themes, which are covered within the language training. The 2004 German immigration law foresees integration courses which include a basic and an advanced language course (each has 300 hours and both should take about a year) followed by a 30-hour orientation course on Germany\u2019s legal system, culture and history. Language and orientation courses include a final test. 1.2 Matching ambitions to resources What governments ask of newcomers should be balanced with the sustained availability and quality of introduction programmes. 18 Handbook on Integration Introduction of newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees * * In Frankfurt, a 600-hour language course is preceded by 40 hours of orientation in the city. This includes a trip by underground, a walk through the city and a visit to a municipal administration as well as information about institutions and the German legal system. The course is offered in eight languages and taught by local settled migrants. Office for Multicultural Affairs Frankfurt, www.stadt-frankfurt.de/amka/ Z$ ",
        "While the format of introduction courses and the number of hours envisaged varies from country to country, introduction courses generally require substantial resources and administrative capacities. This is the case especially where programmes aim to match the skills and needs of individuals as precisely as possible. In addition to providing the classes, governments financially support participants during full-time orientation programmes. Often, the aim is to provide a form of compensation that resembles a salary as much as possible. In Denmark for instance, the introduction programme is free of charge, and immigrants or refugees who cannot maintain themselves through work or family are entitled to receive an introduction allowance. The three-year programme includes Danish classes, classes on Danish culture and society and labour market activation, and has a scope of at least 37 hours per week on average. In Sweden, the introduction period generally lasts up to two years and includes an estimated average number of 525 hours Swedish language tuition and preparations for participation in the labour market. In Finland, it is now envisaged to extend the integration period beyond three years for certain immigrants such as sick persons, mothers of small children, people with literacy needs, and some young people. Even introduction programmes of a more modest scope always imply resource commitments. Waiting lists are often an issue and potential attendees cannot always be assigned a class. At the same time, some countries are making course attendance compulsory and use sanctions related to the renewal of residence permits or to social security payments. In Denmark, the introduction allowance is reduced if a participant does not attend his or her programme without an accepted reason. In Austria and under the yet to be introduced Dutch system, participants pay for courses, with a possible (partial) refund upon successful completion. The 2004 German immigration law foresees possible sanctions for non-attendance and some financial contribution from the participants, which is projected to be 1 Euro per hour. Recipients of social welfare are exempted. In France a good attendance record facilitates the process of naturalisation. Strategies can rely not (only) on sanctions, but also on incentives rewarding attendance and the completion of courses. Compulsory programmes and the use of sanctions and/or incentives should be evaluated after some time so as to establish whether this enhances the quality of the courses and increases attendance. Where classes are free, the considerable expense is controversial within government and the departments responsible are under pressure to make a case for the long-term economic and social benefits of language instruction to immigrants. In new Member States, the budgetary implications of introduction activities are even more salient than in the EU-15, and contributions from external or Community sources might be explored. Private sector contributions may also be discussed further in the future. 19 Handbook on Integration * ",
        "Best practice suggests that programmes should be accessible, affordable and of high quality and that their impact should be assessed regularly. Where labour market measures are included in introduction courses, governments are faced with especially great challenges regarding implementation. Individualised course programmes cannot always be offered. Introduction programmes sometimes provide uniform solutions although they should be adapted to each person\u2019s educational background and labour market prospects. For some countries with larger arrival numbers or with fewer resources, open \u2018clearinghouses\u2019 where immigrants can receive individual guidance and discuss specific \u2018integration plans\u2019 without entering a complex tracking process may be more suitable. As an alternative to comprehensive \u2018civic orientation\u2019 courses, countries can offer one- day courses such as the French \u2018civic training days\u2019, which are part of the state\u2019s commitment in the framework of an \u2018integration contract\u2019. A civic training day covers the fundamental rights and the main principles and values of France, as well as French institutions. There is also an information day on life in France, which addresses the themes of health, schooling, housing, training and employment. These one-day courses are offered in the four main languages of origin of migrants to France. In Portugal, the citizenship module of the national \u2018Portugal Shelters\u2019 programme lasts 12 hours. It promotes the exercise of active citizenship and is divided into three training units: \u2018the individual, the state and intermediary bodies\u2019 (4 hours), \u2018equal opportunities and treatment in access to work, employment and professional training\u2019 (6 hours) and \u2018forms of access to information\u2019 (2 hours). Besides varying the number of hours, different levels of introduction can be offered for specific categories of migrants. The main target groups for introductory integration programmes include legally resident immigrants with the perspective of staying and recognised refugees who are third country nationals. When appropriate and in accordance with national integration policies the target groups for introductory integration programmes may be extended to other groups such as EU migrants, temporary immigrants, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, asylum seekers, long established immigrants, returning nationals and ethnic or national minorities. In view of scarce resources, integration courses will generally remain accessible mostly for permanent migrants and recognised refugees. However, temporary migrants may also require some initial and basic information about their host society, for example how to access hospital emergencies, churches, police, etc. This basic information can help to avoid social isolation and support temporary immigrants in their daily life with their neighbours and community. Handbooks or pamphlets covering specific aspects of community life and general information about habits and customs in the host society are useful examples along with local welcome events. Handbooks can be published in printed and digital format or as audio books, and can be translated into 20 Handbook on Integration Introduction of newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees * ",
        "different community languages. Such introduction offers, with a focus on reducing community tensions rather than on employability, are a good way of including temporary migrants without making far-reaching resource commitments. It is practice in some countries to provide beyond the more extensive introduction programmes offered only to certain categories of newcomers, an appropriate level of introductory assistance to other groups of immigrants. Undocumented migrants and asylum seekers are typically excluded from introduction courses, as governments wish to avoid raised expectations in the absence of a secure legal status. Asylum seekers are sometimes given limited access to integration activities. This is to enhance their skills and guide them in developing their futures, regardless of whether they are granted asylum or not. Persons with temporary protection status are covered in some countries such as Poland where like recognised refugees they can complete a 12-month individual integration programme. Local level or non- governmental actors often do not make a distinction on the grounds of legal status among the participants of their integration-related activities. 1.3 Working with partners Integration is a shared responsibility and many actors work together to develop good policies and outcomes. It is crucial that all involved are responsive and open to feedback from those they work with as implementing partners, funders, or clients. Whether policies are implemented by government at different levels or by non- governmental organisations, the degree of consultation between the commissioning body and the implementing agency is a crucial point. In order to avoid becoming too removed from programme delivery, ministries in charge should systematically provide the implementing agencies with feedback channels and access to policy design. Local Many countries have developed handbooks for immigrants. For instance, the Immigrant Council of Ireland\u2019s \u2018Handbook on Immigrants\u2019 Rights and Entitlements in Ireland\u2019 seeks to provide information for immigrant groups and all public, private, and non-governmental bodies in contact with immigrants. It gives an overview of relevant legislation and distinguishes between different groups such as migrant workers, business and self- employed people, international students, families of migrants and Irish nationals, visitors, persons granted leave to remain, parents and siblings of Irish citizen children, and persons residing in the State without permission. Rights and entitlements are covered for each of these groups, and an annex gives the addresses of relevant agencies and organisations. www.immigrantcouncil.ie/handbook.htm Z$ 21 Handbook on Integration ** ",
        "and regional government, social partners, NGOs and migrants associations are all part of the \u2018integration nexus\u2019 along with the state and the individual migrants it admits. Where many actors work together, it is important to ensure easy access and transparency for immigrants. For instance, in Finland the Internet-based Info Bank in different languages ( www.caisa.hel.fi ) makes it possible to search for information by subject, so that the user does not need to know which authority handles what. The local level Partnerships between various levels of government are governed by shared responsibilities and consultations on policy design and budget allocations. Several European countries have a strong tradition of extensive local government, and local authorities are responsible for many of the services provided to the population including newly arrived immigrants and refugees. For instance, Lithuania has transferred responsibility for the implementation of its refugee integration programme to the local level. Local authorities are particularly strong in bringing together all departments and organisations which are relevant in the introduction process, making it easier for immigrants to access services and support. France is one of the countries which take advantage of this strength by relying on a system of regional and local reception points throughout the country which welcome newcomers, establish their needs in terms of education and social assistance, advise them on governmental services and give them a first introduction into French society. In Italy, Framework Agreements signed between the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies and the regions coordinate integration policies implemented at the local level. Language training is a central component, especially in the agreements for the Toscana, Umbria and Veneto regions. In some countries, the (central) lead agency enters into formal agreements with municipalities to reflect the responsibilities of each level of government. Typically, such 22 Handbook on Integration Introduction of newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees * In Portugal, the National Immigrant Support Centres (CNAI) in Lisbon and Oporto involve departments of six Ministries (Service for Border Control - SEF, Labour Inspectorate, Social Security, Health and Education) as well as offices that provide specific support with regard to immigration law, family reunion, recognition of qualifications, and labour market insertion. To be enhanced is the involvement of socio-cultural mediators, who originate from the different immigrant communities and have a key role in the process of contact and problem resolution. Linked to the CNAI there is a network of 25 Local Immigrant Support Centres (CLAI) that provide information services, and a Call Centre - SOS Immigrant , which is available 12 hours a day in four languages. www.acime.gov.pt Z$ ",
        "agreements specify the number of persons who are to settle in each municipality. The government then gives standard grants, consisting of a fixed amount for each person. The standard grants are meant to cover additional costs that the municipality incurs due to the reception of refugees, such as living expenses, language courses, and costs related to additional resources that may be needed in day-care centres and schools. This system aims to avoid detailed directives from government while at the same time creating economic incentives to reward municipalities for efficient introduction programmes. For instance, if the participant achieves the programme goals in less than the planned time period, the full grant is still paid out to the municipality. The Danish system is an example of this approach. Under the 1999 Act on Integration, municipalities are responsible for carrying out introduction programmes, but the government finances all expenses. The subsidies are structured to create incentives for municipalities: higher subsidies are paid for higher levels of activity, and specific subsidies are paid out for any immigrant or refugee who successfully passes a Danish language exam or who is in regular employment for at least six months. Legislation on the integration of newly arrived immigrants and refugees includes specific provisions on cooperation between municipalities and on leaving the performance of specific tasks to private companies, educational institutions or non-governmental organisations. In every city or municipality in the Finnish province of West Uusimaa, there is an immigrant office under whose guidance immigration work teams operate. In addition to representatives of the immigrant office, the teams generally include representatives of the social welfare office, the employment office, the health centre, the school office, the adult education system, the social insurance institution and the local housing office. A card is compiled on every immigrant, by means of which his or her plan and path are monitored. Different members of the team update the card and keep in regular contact with the person in question. Children have their own teams, the so-called \u2018kid teams\u2019. They cover all immigrant children and young persons who attend school or day-care centres, charting their situation and their need for support and other measures. The municipal chief education officers, school social workers, many headmasters and teachers, as well as remedial teachers participate in these teams. While the priority of central governments is to ensure the quality of services provided by the municipalities, for instance by making funding results-oriented, it can be argued that what is needed is more influence on the policy-making process so that national framework regulations respond better to the local realities. More explicit partnerships and a permanent framework can make the local level not only a performer but also give access to policy design. 23 Handbook on Integration ",
        "Social partners The social partners stand to gain from self-sufficient immigrants and are ideally involved in the design, financing and implementation of integration programmes. As immigration and integration become more closely connected with the socio- economic goals of European societies, increased attention is paid to the role of the social partners in integration. Trade unions are particularly active in the areas of anti- discrimination and equal opportunity, and in providing training. In the introduction period, employers can also put into practice their co-responsibility for integration by organising reception events, offering assistance with finding accommodation and accessing services, and providing language courses including courses teaching specific vocational vocabulary. Companies providing trainee positions to newcomers can take on responsibility for language training and thus promote the combination of language and vocational content. In particular, large companies employing foreign workers on an ongoing basis can establish programmes for new arrivals. For more established immigrants, companies can provide financial and other training to support ethnic or immigrant entrepreneurs in becoming suppliers. In Italy, in the framework of the Territorial Immigration Council, the Province of Belluno (Veneto), in collaboration with the Chamber of Commerce and a local Social Cooperative, has promoted a reception and housing programme for non-EU workers with the aim of facilitating labour and societal integration. As a first step in this direction an agreement has been signed by entrepreneurs and professional associations interested in seeking adequate housing and facilitating the matching of demand and supply of houses for migrants. Governments at all levels could engage companies more in the debates on immigrant integration linking governmental programmes with companies\u2019 corporate social responsibility programmes. While governments often take on primary responsibility for the introduction of those immigrants who are likely to stay permanently, the private sector could have a particular role to play in providing support to immigrants of other categories, such as temporary migrants. In Spain, the law requires the provision of adequate accommodation by employers in the case of temporary migration. In Cyprus, all arrangements for the reception (including housing) of temporary labour migrants are carried out by or with the assistance of the employers (temporary work permits of less than six years are for a specific position and employer). In case of non-fulfilment of their obligations, the employers are penalised and no further permits are granted to them for the employment of foreign workers. 24 Handbook on Integration Introduction of newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees * * ",
        "Governments could offer assistance to smaller companies and other business organisations as well as trade unions in sectors of the economy where many immigrants have found employment by complementing these organisations\u2019 training capacities. Non-governmental organisations A wide variety of non-state actors are involved in the introduction of newcomers. Church-based and other welfare organisations as well as \u2018classic NGOs\u2019 of different sizes are playing a key role in implementation, often putting state structures on immigrant introduction into operation. For instance, the Spanish government sees funding lines for NGOs as crucial instruments of its integration policy, and the autonomy given to the organisations funded is considerable. In the UK, there are currently no nationally agreed arrangements for the reception of newly arrived immigrants and NGOs provide a wide variety of orientation programmes. The Czech Republic and Slovenia also work closely with NGOs in the implementation of projects on housing, language training, labour market insertion, psychosocial counselling and cultural activities. In Estonia, the structure primarily responsible for implementing integration policies is the Integration Foundation, a foundation operating under provisions of private law and established by the Estonian Government. The foundation\u2019s responsibilities include, inter alia, launching public project tenders and co-ordinating the efficient use of various resources in this field, including the implementation of several large-scale projects funded by foreign donors. Non-governmental organisations share responsibility for the integration process and provide for direct contact between local residents and migrants. Because they cooperate with different levels of government, the private sector, foundations, other NGOs and local groups as implementing organisations and as partners, they contribute to the dialogue in society about the desired outcomes of and paths to integration. Non- governmental and church organisations can also mobilise volunteers and organise \u2018host 25 Handbook on Integration * The Uni\u00f3 de Pagesos is a Catalan farmers\u2019 union which offers mentoring to seasonal workers during their stay in Spain. It runs a \u2018Course for Development Agents\u2019, which has as its objective the training of seasonal immigrants in Catalonia so that upon return to their country of origin they can share their experience and promote collective projects for economic and social improvement. The content of the course may cover different subjects: IT, agriculture, developmental cooperation projects, languages, etc. In the UK, the company Fusion Personnel , which supplies casual labour to horticultural businesses, has developed a training scheme for its employees who are mostly recently arrived immigrants. Literacy, numeracy and language training is provided and staff are allocated time out of their work each week to take part. www.bitc.org.uk/resources/case_studies/fusionsfl.html Z$ ",
        "programmes\u2019 or other exchange activities. For instance, in Portugal the Catholic Church, through its parishes, provides language classes throughout the country taught mostly by volunteers. Within the range of non-governmental actors, it is important that migrants\u2019 associations play a larger role in the introduction process. At a basic level, migrants\u2019 associations are often good providers of services, such as language teaching at beginner\u2019s level or \u2018civic orientation\u2019 courses. Members of the newcomers\u2019 own communities are also typically the first source of informal information and advice, and often act as role models. Individuals and networks of migrants engage in significant volunteer work especially towards their own community, which needs to be built upon rather than taken advantage of. Access to funding for migrants\u2019 associations is important in this context. In Belgium the King Baudouin Foundation, with its \u2018Mutual support for Newcomers\u2019 grant, supports projects that groups or associations of new migrants develop for their own benefit or for the benefit of other new migrants. The aim is to empower newcomers\u2019 networks of mutual help so that they can better match the private and public services offered by the hosting communities or authorities. A new call for projects also addresses community organisations, residents\u2019 groups, public services and businesses which want to forge links with new migrants. ( www.kbs-frb.be ) Migrants\u2019 associations as possible sources of advice and information to newcomers can be built into introduction programmes by including them for the provision of training and as role models for successful integration. They could receive support for capacity building and be linked with professional organisations so as to ensure quality control. 26 Handbook on Integration Introduction of newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees * The city of Southampton organised in 2003 a one-day induction for refugees, including meetings with city council departments, other statutory agencies, and voluntary organisations. The aim was to strengthen refugee community organisations (27 refugee leaders and representatives attended) and to introduce them to the institutional framework and culture of the host community. Working groups were held whose agendas were built around the issues, concerns and questions tabled by refugee leaders well before the event. Follow-up actions were decided on initiatives such as homework clubs, training events by refugee assisting organisations RETAS and CLEAR, training of youths as swimming and football coaches, etc. gavin.barker@southampton.gov.uk, anthony.pascoe@southampton.gov.uk Z $ ",
        "1.4. Evaluating and adapting programmes Programmes are ideally based on evaluations showing what has worked and what has not worked with previous groups of newcomers. Introductory programmes or projects for newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees can play a central role in \u2018putting integration on the right track\u2019 for individual migrants and their families. At the same time, they constitute a significant resource commitment for governments. Future decisions about scarce resources must be based on evidence rather than assumptions in order to achieve the best possible results. Evaluations can have commonly agreed goals as their starting point. In Sweden, the Integration Board has developed a set of \u2018national goals\u2019 for the orientation programme. Each municipality and authority formulates its objectives based on these comprehensive goals and carries out its own follow-up and evaluation procedures. The Integration Board assists the municipalities in designing appropriate evaluation tools. In Denmark, municipalities are obliged to regularly follow up on the individual integration contracts to ensure that progress has been achieved and that the contract still reflects the needs of the immigrant or refugee. In Italy, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies monitors the evolution of its Framework Agreements with regions using quantitative and qualitative indicators to evaluate the gap between objectives and results. A number of governments use results-based funding to ensure the quality of programmes where they are outsourced. For instance, the UK Home Office is planning to employ such methods under its citizenship education programme. Most of the programme will be provided through adult education colleges or private providers of language classes, which will receive 85% base funding and 15% based on results. A number of pilot projects on introduction courses have preceded the adoption of the 2004 law on immigration in Germany. They have often been \u2018accompanied\u2019 by academics or evaluated extensively by the authorities responsible. An example is the pilot integration course with \u2018knowledge of society\u2019 content, conducted in N\u00fcrnberg in 2001-2003. This was not an introduction course for new arrivals but sought to communicate political, historical and practical knowledge to immigrants with knowledge of German and with long-term residence permits who had been in Germany for some time and were possibly already candidates for naturalisation. The evaluation noted difficulties in reaching the target group and suggested stronger incentives or a legal obligation to attend. For instance, an incentive could be to make participation in an integration course the equivalent of the language test required for naturalisation. The evaluation also suggested developing materials for e-learning. ( www.uni-bamberg.de/~ba6ef3/main_g.htm ) 27 Handbook on Integration * ",
        "In addition to project or programme evaluations, reporting on the implementation of legislation in the area of integration can be a useful tool for evidence-based policies. For instance, the 2004 German immigration law requires the government to present a report on the implementation and financing of integration courses to the Parliament by July 2007, two and a half years after entry into force of the law. Similarly, when the Finnish Parliament passed the 1999 Integration Act it demanded that the government should within three years of entry into force give a report on its implementation, the results attained, and recommendations for the future. Based on the government\u2019s 2002 report, an amendment to the Integration Act is being drafted to define more closely the division of duties and responsibilities of different authorities, as well as the division of responsibility between municipalities and government and between administrative branches at all levels. It is anticipated to form advisory boards at national and regional level to increase the efficiency of cooperation between different parties. Evaluations made in various countries could be brought together and on the basis of experiences in as many countries as possible, a series of voluntary quality standards could be designed for language and civic training. Ideally this would be done in close consultation with internationally operating educational organisations. 28 Handbook on Integration Introduction of newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees In Schleswig Holstein, the Interior Ministry commissioned a gender analysis of integration courses: was there equal access for men and women? Courses similar to those envisaged under the new immigration law were examined. Contrary to expectations, the analysis revealed that a higher percentage of women than of men participated in the courses and that additional incentives were needed for male rather than female migrants. The reasons for men and women to follow language training were almost the same: they wanted to learn German primarily for use in the labour market, to communicate with authorities, and to talk with neighbours. Moreover, men and women had very similar results in the initial test before starting their language course, excepting \u2018classical\u2019 guest workers with 20-30 years of residence. Pilot projects can be small. In Hungary, a \u2018MATRA\u2019 six-month pilot integration programme included six single adult men, a married couple with three children and two single women (both with children). The programme was intensive, comprising 1200 hours of language training, 700 hours of cultural and legal orientation, free accommodation and transport, and financial assistance for other living expenses. The evaluation of this pilot project is now used in formulating a comprehensive integration policy for Hungary, with the recommendations going to a high-level group of state secretaries of the relevant branches of government. $$ * ",

        "Chapter 1: Conclusions 1. Introduction programmes are an investment in the future which both the immigrant and society should be willing to make. They give immigrants a start enabling them to acquire vital skills to become self-sufficient and are therefore well worth the effort. The return on investment for society is that immigrants become better-equipped citizens capable of contributing to society. 2. Offering courses at several levels using different formats and a range of teaching methods can help to achieve successful language training for immigrants with different educational backgrounds or previous knowledge of the country and language. This leads to usable qualifications. Ideally the programmes provide for tests after the courses in order to validate the learning level of participants. 3. When course certificates are of a format which is known to employers and other educational institutions, they prove to be useful to the participant in accessing further labour market or training opportunities. The content and methods of teaching are to be designed with these opportunities in mind. 4. Best practice suggests designing introduction courses in a flexible way, allowing for parallel teaching of language and labour market participation rather than relying on strict sequential models for language learning, vocational training and higher education. Ideally courses integrate language and vocational training and validate existing skills. 5. Dynamic ways of assessing the skills of newcomers, relying less on formal criteria and valuing different kinds of experience, are most useful for the validation of experience and knowledge obtained in the country of origin. 6. Offering part-time courses, distance or e-learning and similar models enables participants to continue with introduction programmes while at the same time taking on a job. 7. The pooling of resources enables adjacent municipalities to offer different types of courses. It also makes it possible for participants to live in one municipality and do training or work in another, in this way avoiding the loss of family contacts or networks in case of a move. 8. Introduction courses ideally convey the message of a welcoming society which gives incentives to the newcomer to feel responsible for the community he or she is going to live in. 9. An introduction to values is best framed as a common endeavour in which both newcomers and the receiving society strive to meet the standards set by the country's norms and rules. 10. What governments ask of newcomers should be balanced with the sustained availability and quality of introduction programmes. 11. Compulsory programmes and the use of sanctions and/or incentives should be evaluated after some time so as to establish whether this enhances the quality of the courses and increases attendance. 30 Handbook on Integration Introduction of newly arrived immigrants and recognised refugees ",
        "12. Best practice suggests that programmes should be accessible, affordable and of high quality and that their impact should be assessed regularly. 13. It is practice in some countries to provide beyond the more extensive introduction programmes offered only to certain categories of newcomers, an appropriate level of introductory assistance to other groups of immigrants. 14. Integration is a shared responsibility and many actors work together to develop good policies and outcomes. It is crucial that all involved are responsive and open to feedback from those they work with as implementing partners, funders, or clients. 15. Partnerships between various levels of government are governed by shared responsibilities and consultations on policy design and budget allocations. 16.

        "33 Handbook on Integration Chapter 2 Civic participation ",
        "This chapter addresses the wide field of civic participation from two angles: first, it looks at organisations delivering services and illustrates how they can become more accessible to immigrants, thus enhancing a sense of belonging. Second, it looks at engaging people in active participation in society. Immigrants and non-immigrants can be mobilised around religious dialogue or around the different facets of active citizenship: participation in elections or in consultative bodies, naturalisation, and social participation including volunteering. At the end of the chapter, a box on \u2018becoming open and inclusive organisations\u2019 details the steps than can be taken to open up mainstream institutions and organisations to all citizens. Strategies responding to immigrants\u2019 special needs and circumstances and capitalising on their skills enhance their sense of belonging and participation in society. Public and private organisations should base these strategies on equality and anti-discrimination. Ideally they are tailor-made, flexible and subject to regular evaluation. Public and private organisations should be responsive to all citizens - with and without an immigrant background - as members, customers, employers and employees, as consumers and service providers, political leaders and voters, parents and children, teachers and pupils. Much interaction between immigrants and non-immigrants takes place in mainstream organisations and their openness encourages immigrants to actively take part in the life of these organisations and thus in society. Immigrants\u2019 willingness and motivation to play an active role and the organisations\u2019 commitment to be inclusive reinforce each other. Opening up mainstream institutions and organisations is not an automatic process; rather, it needs the continuous and active support of stakeholders at all levels. Policy-makers and practitioners need to understand the specific nature of a diverse population in order to allow the full participation of all citizens irrespective of their cultural, ethnic and national origin. Responsiveness to particular needs and close cooperation with specialised organisations such as migrants\u2019 associations or NGOs dedicated to the assistance of immigrants and refugees are all part of a successful strategy of engaging them. 2.1 Intercultural competence Tailoring services to the special needs of different groups among the population is a collaborative effort requiring the development of intercultural competence in public and private service. A basic requirement of an equitable society is the accessibility of services to all. Public and private service providers have a responsibility to lower and eliminate any access barriers that specific groups may face. Immigrants are one of the groups which 34 Handbook on Integration Civic participation * * ",
        "frequently meet obstacles due to linguistic or cultural differences. Their active participation in society therefore depends on a collaborative effort to address and remove these obstacles. Public and private organisations can employ different techniques to make their services more accessible to immigrants. While any effort to lower access barriers will have a positive effect on immigrant participation, the most successful inclusion strategies will be those which are embedded in an overall change of organisational culture. In this way, measures to adapt the organisation to diversity do not remain isolated efforts but fit into the goals and identity of the organisation as a whole. Having individuals of immigrant background on boards and committees helps to bring a broad range of views to bear on all key decisions. Organisations can make use of existing registers of people from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds to make appointments to these bodies. Local authorities or governments can maintain a database of suitably qualified persons from diverse backgrounds who are willing to serve on decision-making or advisory bodies. Whether an organisation is still in the early stages of a change in organisational culture or has gone through the whole process, a crucial element is the building up of staff equipped to implement and drive inclusion strategies. Recruitment and training are two of the ways in which organisations can build up a pool of interculturally competent staff. Intercultural competence can be used as a component of job profiles in the recruitment of educators and school personnel, local authority employees, hospital staff, social workers and others. Although the cross-cultural awareness of those members of staff who come into contact with the public is particularly important, recruitment for higher- level positions without such direct contact should also use diversity criteria. Moreover, organisations active in policy making or planning rather than in direct service delivery also need to take diversity seriously. Government initiatives can promote the recruitment of immigrant-origin staff with respect to both the public and the private sector. For instance, as a part of the implementation of the Danish white paper and action plan \u2018The Government\u2019s Vision and Strategies for Improved Integration\u2019, launched in June 2003, the government will publish a toolbox with ideas to encourage the diverse composition of public sector workforces by the end of 2004. In Italy, sixty cultural mediators who can be immigrants or Italians are attached to the public social structures of six regions of Southern Italy, and thirty mediators work in local employment offices. While paying attention to recruitment, organisations can also utilise existing staff skills. For instance, they can recognise and, if appropriate, remunerate the linguistic skills, cultural knowledge and community contacts of their staff. Skills registers or databases can be created in larger organisations, listing staff members who have an immigrant background or who are familiar with immigrant languages or cultures. Managers can encourage and 35 Handbook on Integration ",
        "financially support the study of languages by employees. Training on intercultural issues should be given to staff at all levels and can be incorporated within functional training units. In Austria, the EQUAL-funded project \u2018Interkulturlotsen\u2019 ( www.interkulturlotsen.at ) offers training to key persons in organisations from the field of public administration as well as private enterprises and NGOs. These organisations either have a largely immigrant workforce or many customers with a migrant background. The curriculum offers a mix of cultural awareness training, seminars on special issues like mobbing, gender mainstreaming, legal issues of anti-discrimination, and diversity management. In addition, it focuses on and offers training in communication skills and (intercultural) mediation. Participants become \u2018intercultural pilots\u2019 who act as mediators, contact persons for people who have experienced discrimination, and experts on equal treatment in employment. Recruitment and training are complementary strategies in building up staff with intercultural competence. Ideally developing intercultural competence among employees is an ongoing priority rather than a one-time effort. Even with targeted recruitment and training, mainstream service providers are unlikely to cover the whole spectrum of linguistic, cultural and religious diversity through their own personnel. For this reason, it is important that employees have easy and immediate access to trained interpreters or to specialised advisors on, for example, cultural and religious matters. Training can be given on the best use of interpretation and translation services. Where the competence or capacity of the mainstream institution is insufficient, close links with specialised organisations can be of great benefit. In the Autonomous Community of Madrid immigrants may be referred to special advice centres if the general services \u2013 which remain the first port of call \u2013 decide that the individual migrant would benefit from a more in-depth consultation. Over the course of two years, the Social Assistance for Immigrants Centres (CASI), which are managed by NGOs, have nearly doubled their number of cases. Service providers can apply their intercultural knowledge in all interactions with clients. Personal communication can be made easier by adapting opening times and transport possibilities. Information strategies can use different languages and media to reach out to 36 Handbook on Integration Civic participation * As an example of training, the Czech Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs runs a pilot e- learning educational programme to assist in dealing with the integration of foreigners. This programme will gradually provide training courses to employees of the Ministry and of Employment Agencies in the districts. One of the goals is to prepare a methodology in order to train tutors at the Employment Agencies in intercultural know-how. These tutors can then independently train the officials on how to work in a multicultural environment. $ ",
        "particular communities. For organisations relying heavily on websites, specialised software can be installed which enables electronic distribution of information in different languages without the layout, printing and readability problems which often affect non-Latin scripts. Information should be communicated actively, rather than waiting for immigrants to approach the organisation. Information strategies should be based on knowledge of the communities, and collaboration with migrant networks is recommended. Best practices demonstrate that mainstream organisations which work closely with experts or specialist organisations greatly improve the accessibility of their services to immigrants. Mainstream organisations are best equipped to service immigrants if they continuously improve their level of intercultural competence. Structured feedback and complaint- handling mechanisms can be used to gather responses. At the same time, immigrants are best able to use services if they are informed about the range of options and about the rules involved in accessing services. 37 Handbook on Integration The municipality and hospital administration of Alessandria (Northern Italy), under the auspices of the Territorial Immigration Council, work to address the difficulties of Maghrebi women to fully access the health service during their pregnancy and for delivery. First, a study was carried out about the personal situation and the attitudes prevailing among foreign women in general with regard to motherhood and birth as well as about their opinions on the relevant health structures. Then, staff of the province\u2019s health service (consulting rooms, obstetrics and paediatrics departments) and of the municipalities\u2019 services for childhood (nursery schools) was trained in multiethnic matters. The last step directly addresses the population from the Maghreb, both men and women, with the purpose of increasing the level of knowledge of the purposes and of the methods used by the health and social services. In the case of an Austrian project looking at immigrants in the health service, training for immigrants sparked activities for the intercultural competence of mainstream staff. Starting in 1997, the organisation ZEBRA in Graz gave immigrants training to assist members of their communities in accessing the health system, to give advice and to translate during visits to the doctor. They became volunteer \u2018link-workers\u2019. Subsequently, a training course for \u2018health consultants\u2019 was developed, building on the recognition that the health service itself would also benefit from intercultural knowledge and competence. The migrants now trained as health consultants not only assist members of their community but also advise mainstream healthcare organisations. www.zebra.org.at Z$ $* ",
        "Intercultural competence can be introduced as a (European) quality management standard which is considered when governments determine their support to organisations or in public tenders. Because of the wide range of service providers in the public and private sphere, various strategies must be used to promote intercultural competence. Organisations should have the choice between a number of techniques to adapt themselves to cultural and linguistic diversity. The German Land Nordrhein-Westfalen has responded to this need for different options in its publication of the \u2018Implementation Handbook on Integration\u2019. This handbook is aimed at municipalities and contains descriptions of successful \u2018administrative solutions\u2019 for the implementation of integration policies. Examples are offered for large and for small municipalities and give information on the instruments used to introduce the practice, costs and benefits, as well as success factors. Municipalities can choose those examples which best fit their situation and use the tools provided to facilitate the participation of immigrants in their structures and services. Also in Germany, the \u2018migratory services\u2019 (Migrationsdienste), which are run by church-based and secular welfare organisations, use different models of opening themselves up to immigrants. 2.2 Engaging citizens and immigrants Active citizenship highlights immigrants\u2019 skills and suggests ways of making the most of them both for the immigrants and for society as a whole. Access to services is an important aspect of participation in society, but it is one of many. Immigrants and non-immigrants engage with each other and with society in voluntary associations, in religious groups or in the political arena. This is where active citizenship takes place and where participation in common endeavours contributes to integration. Whereas in service provision much attention should go to obstacles to inclusive service provision and how to remove them, a focus on active citizenship highlights skills and suggests ways of making the most of them for both immigrants and society as a whole. While organisations across all sectors face the task of maximising the potential of participation, there are ways of engaging citizens and immigrants that are specific to certain areas of society. Correspondingly, organisations active in these areas can take particular steps to create opportunities for immigrant participation. In the area of religious participation, dialogue can be a way of engaging immigrants and non-immigrants across different faiths and denominations. Consultative bodies and electoral rights are steps on the way to full citizenship that comes with naturalisation. And facilitating immigrant volunteering is a good way of promoting civic participation in the social sphere. 38 Handbook on Integration Civic participation * * ",
        "2.2.1 Religious dialogue Religion often plays a positive role in the integration process, which can be enhanced by facilitating a dialogue among immigrant faith communities and between them and mainstream society. Religion can be beneficial to societal integration and provides many opportunities for positive interaction. Like culture more broadly, religion is an element of integration. It can form an important framework for the development of citizenship and citizenship competences. The major Christian denominations have a long tradition of setting up dialogue structures between themselves, and these are often taken as a starting point for conversations with other denominations or religions. Host churches can open up ecumenical dialogue structures to migrant churches. They can also participate in and encourage inter-religious dialogue. Inter-religious dialogue can take place between specific communities (such as the Abrahamic Forum in Germany which includes Christians, Muslims and Jews \u2013 see www.interkultureller-rat.de ), or it can be broad- based. For instance, the UK Interfaith Network works to build good relations between the communities of the Baha\u2019i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, and Zoroastrian faiths. A survey carried out by the network suggests that there are now over 130 local inter-faith groups, councils and forums in the UK. ( www.interfaith.co.uk ) Governments should provide support for inter-religious dialogue by facilitating the establishment of dialogue platforms and contributing resources where appropriate. Governments have specifically encouraged inter-religious dialogue as a way of preventing conflicts or tensions between communities and, especially since 11 September 2001, as a way of counteracting fundamentalism. Authorities at different levels can assist the dialogue between religions by providing platforms for discussion or by helping to resolve the legal status of migrant churches. Despite the success of such initiatives in many cases, it is important to note that dialogue, including inter-religious dialogue, is not a \u2018quick-fix solution\u2019 and cannot always resolve immediate conflicts. Beyond strengthening communication between different religious groups, governments can also seek to establish dialogue structures between government and religious representatives. For instance, in 1992 in the UK the government set up the Inner Cities Religious Council (ICRC), a body which is chaired by a Government Minister and composed of representatives of Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh communities. The ICRC focuses on urban renewal and social inclusion and provides input to Home Office community cohesion policies. ( www.neighbourhood.gov.uk/faith_communities.asp?pageid=169 ) There is also a 39 Handbook on Integration * * ",
        "\u2018community cohesion faith practitioners group\u2019 addressing similar issues. A challenge can be posed by the fact that no single interlocutor exists for all religions or faith groups. Public authorities sometimes have to make difficult decisions as to which organisations they interact with. Many of the consultations between government and religious groups concern the implications of the state-church separation which is common to many, although not all European countries. Different models exist across the spectrum from strict \u2018la\u00efcit\u00e9\u2019 to the existence of a state church. In several countries, the religious/secular distinction has become a topic of discussion in relation to Muslim residents. In negotiating the role of religion in public life, it is essential that all participants in the debate are well informed. For instance, the French government will publish a \u2018republican guide\u2019 for distribution in schools, explaining the rules behind la\u00efcit\u00e9. Conversely, knowledge about religion is essential for the government and for the public at large. All relevant stakeholders can contribute by developing appropriate information materials and methods to strengthen the knowledge of religions among government staff, journalists and the public, including school pupils. Such programmes have so far been more frequent in the area of culture, and successful models could be adapted for the religious domain. 2.2.2 Citizenship Participation in political processes is one of the most important elements of active citizenship. Political participation of immigrants provides opportunities for integration and should be supported in its different forms, including acquisition of nationality, local electoral rights and consultative structures. Political participation has many facets: activities such as voting, affiliation to political parties, following political debates in the news, participating in electoral campaigns, contacting politicians, writing letters to government representatives, and becoming a candidate in an election, among others. Immigrants will attain the fullest degree of political rights if they become citizens of the country they reside in. With regard to non-citizens, some attention has focused on the concept of civic citizenship. In its November 2000 Communication on a Community Immigration Policy , the Commission defined civic citizenship as guaranteeing certain core rights and obligations to immigrants which they would acquire gradually over a period of years. Civic citizenship would help immigrants to settle successfully into society and could also be a first step in the process of acquiring the nationality of the Member State concerned. The Commission further elaborated the concept in its June 2003 Communication on Immigration, Integration and Employment which recommended granting the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at least in local elections to all residents. 40 Handbook on Integration Civic participation * ",
        "Outside the electoral process, immigrants often have the opportunity to participate in consultative chambers or forums. These can be valuable tools for political participation, representation and defending the interests of foreign residents, especially at local level. With all forms of political participation, immigrants tend to participate more with increasing length of residence and depending on individual factors such as age, education and income. However, participation also depends crucially on the creation of opportunity structures for immigrants and on the openness of societal institutions. Electoral rights The representativeness and democratic legitimation of policies is enhanced by extending formal political rights to immigrants. Where formal rights exist, they need to be put into practice with commitment from all sides including political parties. Electoral rights are at the core of political participation in democracies. At the local level in particular, electoral rights provide immigrants with political representation in decisions that affect their most immediate interest. For instance, many immigrants are particularly concerned by policies in areas such as public housing, health services, and education where municipal authorities tend to have strong competencies. The majority of EU Member States have now granted some level of electoral rights to immigrants at the local level, with varying degrees of restriction. Governments should grant electoral rights to all residents at least at local level and minimise obstacles to the use of these rights, such as fees or bureaucratic requirements. Immigrants can be encouraged to make use of electoral rights through information campaigns and capacity building, relying in particular on the networks offered by immigrant organisations. Ireland is a country where few limitations are placed with regard to local elections in that the residence requirement is comparatively short (ordinary residence since 1 September 2003 for the 11 June 2004 local election) and asylum seekers as well as recognised refugees and immigrants of all nationalities can register to vote. In Luxembourg, non-nationals acquire electoral rights after five years of residence (non- EU nationals can only vote, whereas EU nationals can also stand as candidates). A national campaign was launched in 2003 to encourage foreigners to register on the electoral rolls. This is not an automatic process and individuals must go to the town hall to register. A working group was created at the level of the Government Commission for Foreigners, including representatives of different departments and ministries as well as non-governmental organisations. Leaflets and posters were produced in different languages. A successful strategy was found to be the targeting of influential individuals of foreign communities. 41 Handbook on Integration * * ",
        "Immigrant interest in voting grows with the presence of candidates who have an immigrant background. While immigrants can stand as independents (this was true for the majority of immigrant candidates in the June 2004 local elections in Ireland), mainstream political parties are also called upon to actively encourage the participation of immigrant candidates. It is important that immigrant candidates have the possibility to stand for cross cutting issues rather than only for immigrant issues, which could have a segregation effect. Political parties will see increased involvement of immigrants where they refrain from using anti-immigrant rhetoric in their public pronouncements. In this context, the Irish NCCRI has launched an Anti-Racism Protocol for Political Parties in relation to the conduct of election campaigns, which has been signed by all political parties in Parliament. ( www.nccri.com/elections.html ) Many political parties do promote the inclusion of immigrants into society and its institutions but neglect their own exemplary role and the need for specific educational or outreach programmes. Immigrants often have less access to the financial resources and social networks that contribute to success in elections, and in most countries increased efforts are needed to support their participation. Consultative bodies Consultative bodies at the local and national level have a potential to stimulate political participation by immigrants and to improve integration policies by communicating the views of immigrant representatives to governmental and other stakeholders. Ideally their work is proactive and their members are supported in producing high quality contributions. Consultative structures grant only a low level of political rights, but they can be successful in encouraging the participation of immigrants in public life. At the local level, they can improve and harmonise relations between foreign residents and other sectors of the community (authorities, administrative bodies, nationals). At the national level, governments may take into account immigrant opinions on draft bills or programmes related to integration. Consultative structures exist in most European countries, with governments often taking the lead in setting them up. For instance, in the Czech Republic the Commission of the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs plays the role of an advisory and policy making body. In Estonia, a Presidential Roundtable on National Minorities holds discussions on matters of political and public life including issues related to ethnicity. In some cases, the establishment of consultative bodies is required by law once the community of non-citizens reaches a certain size. For instance, in Luxembourg municipalities with more than 20% foreigners are obliged to set up advisory commissions. In Denmark, the Act on Integration provides for the setting up of the 42 Handbook on Integration Civic participation * ",
        "national Council for Ethnic Minorities, which is composed of representatives of the local integration councils. These bodies can be established by municipalities; around 70 local integration councils exist to date. Consultative bodies, especially at the national level, often include representatives of non-governmental and migrants\u2019 associations along with representatives of public authorities and of the social partners. For instance, the Portuguese Consultative Council for Immigration Matters, the Italian National Organisation for the Co-ordination of Integration Policy for Migrants, and the Spanish Forum of Immigration all include these three groups. At the local level, consultative bodies are often composed of local elected representatives together with immigrants. In some cases, \u2018purely\u2019 immigrant bodies hold regular meetings among themselves and from time to time come together with the authorities and other stakeholders. Consultation has to take into account the diversity of immigrant populations, and accepted mechanisms for the selection of representatives need to be found. In Luxembourg, the 15 immigrant representatives on the National Council for Foreigners are chosen depending on their community\u2019s proportional representation in the population according to the most recent census. In the Dutch national dialogue structure, minorities are represented by federations of organisations of minority groups. To be admitted, federations are checked on their representativeness, a check which is repeated periodically. In some countries, elections are held for consultative committees. Others rely on experts or known individuals active in the area of immigrant integration. However, it is not always clear whether members are primarily individuals or representatives of their constituency or their organisation. It can also be difficult to gain access to certain communities within the immigrant population. Flexibility in the composition of consultative bodies will best serve the purpose of consultation, keeping in mind that representativeness can be achieved in different ways. Allowing observers or non-voting members to take part in sessions can increase transparency and trust in consultative structures. While consultative chambers have no decision-making power, they are usually entitled to deliberate and make proposals. Own-initiative opinions can be given, but generally consultative bodies respond to policy- or legislative proposals of the government by contributing to hearings and submitting written comments on draft bills. As a result the government\u2019s agenda usually determines theirs. Frequently, the input given comes at a late stage in the policy-making process and has limited impact on the shape of the final legislation or programme. Because of these limitations, advisory bodies cannot be a substitute for full electoral rights and remain a parallel opportunity for government to receive feedback from 43 Handbook on Integration * ",
        "communities concerned by its policies and actions. They also offer opportunities for immigrant visibility and influence that should be used fully, since the existence of one well organised \u2018reference point\u2019 makes it more difficult for both public and private actors to avoid consultation. Their function as a \u2018school of democracy\u2019 for immigrants should be encouraged, without allowing them to remain mere talk-shops. In particular, closer links with Parliament or with municipal councils should be sought. In a number of Italian municipalities including Rome and Turin, non-voting immigrants playing a consultative role sit on the municipal council along with elected officials. Immigrant influence is highest where the input is of high quality and where groups are proactive. However, in order to develop contributions that can have an early and significant impact on the policymaking process, communities must have the capacity to engage in informed and continuous debate. While capacity building initiatives can have considerable success, the work of consultative bodies is often significantly limited by the fact that its members are generally unpaid. In the UK \u2018community networks\u2019 are eligible for project funding under the race equality grant Connecting Communities . In Portugal, the Programme Choices 2nd generation seeks to promote the social inclusion of young people from underprivileged neighbourhoods, especially those from the second or third generation of immigrants. Building partnerships with civil society, the programme offers training and makes a strong investment in the creation of Digital Inclusion Centres (CID), which seek to develop young people\u2019s competences for full participation in the information society. Addressing political participation more specifically, the Swedish government has introduced a special programme of grants to national immigrant organisations in order to increase immigrants\u2019 opportunities to promote their participation in public life. At present, there are about 30 national immigrant organisations. Several of them have small secretariats. Consultation does not necessarily have to take place in specific \u2018immigrant bodies\u2019. A number of municipalities have set up local consultative structures to deal with specific subjects (family, education, finance, energy, environment, economic and commercial development, housing, employment, mobility, youth, sport, etc.). Immigrants can be encouraged to participate alongside citizens in the work of these consultative bodies. Naturalisation The attribution of nationality can be an integration tool. Facilitating naturalisation diminishes the rights gap between citizens and long-term resident immigrants and can open up a fuller range of opportunities for participation. 44 Handbook on Integration Civic participation * ",
        "In most European countries, the normal path of legal integration involves a gradual consolidation of status and extension of rights in several stages over a number of years. Quick naturalisation is generally not foreseen. However, continuous immigration and the presence of a growing group of permanently residing non-nationals has led many governments to change their naturalisation rules, often making acquisition of nationality easier. In response to changing rules, application rates for naturalisation have increased, although they remain below expectations in some cases. The UK Home Office has commissioned a study on factors influencing decisions to apply for naturalisation, looking in detail at triggers and barriers including those specific to certain nationalities. Although lack of information is a frequent reason for low application numbers, immigrants also choose to take up different rights depending on their situation. Some immigrants do not seek naturalisation because they would lose citizenship in their country of origin or because they would forfeit hereditary titles or the right to own land there. Extending electoral rights and making naturalisation easier are therefore complementary strategies. Moreover, narrowing the rights gap between citizens and non-citizens would make the choice for naturalisation less a strategy to achieve legal security and more a positive expression of a change in political identity. In some countries naturalisation is considered to be the result and ultimate proof of the integration of immigrants. Language and other tests are used to verify the level of integration of applicants. Such tests can have a negative effect on naturalisation rates due to their difficulty or due to the fees associated with them. Where tests for naturalisation are used, they can be linked to the particular circumstances of the persons concerned. Preparatory courses should be available to immigrants and should be affordable and of good quality. Although naturalisation is sometimes seen as the \u2018end point\u2019 of the integration trajectory, access to nationality is not a \u2018magical measure\u2019. Second and third generation migrants who are citizens may still experience discrimination and lack a feeling of belonging. Therefore, the focus should also be on other opportunities for participation, although a continued trend towards facilitated naturalisation is desirable. 2.2.3 Social participation Volunteering is a form of social participation in which immigrants play an important role as active citizens. Facilitating their participation and valuing their contribution promotes their inclusion and mobilises their skills. 45 Handbook on Integration * * ",
        "Social participation encompasses a wide set of activities in mainstream as well as immigrant organisations. Through participating in social institutions and projects, immigrants take an active part in society and build bridges to the host society and its members. Social participation includes a broad range of activities: active participation in groups such as hobby groups, service clubs, sports and recreation organisations, school councils, environmental groups, heritage associations, neighbourhood associations, or international solidarity groups. The aspect of migrant volunteering illustrates the value and special characteristics of immigrant social participation. Newly arrived immigrants often come into contact with the voluntary sector at an early stage, since in most European countries volunteers play an important role in the introduction of newcomers. They take on a wide range of functions including advice, information and welfare services. Personal \u2018host\u2019, \u2018mentor\u2019 or \u2018contact\u2019 schemes often establish valuable links between newcomers and host society. In Estonia, a family exchange programme for children of non-Estonian and Estonian speaking families has been successful in improving the children\u2019s language skills as well as their social competences and mutual tolerance. Under this scheme , mainly non-Estonian youth can spend from one week to two months in an Estonian family located in the countryside and actively take part in their daily life. The aim of the exchange is to lower the language barriers of children, to introduce Estonian culture, history and traditions, and to promote association between non-Estonian and Estonian families. Migrants themselves volunteer both in migrants\u2019 associations and in mainstream organisations. The involvement of many persons in immigrant \u2018self-organisations\u2019 is not always recognised as a form of volunteering, despite the fact that most migrants\u2019 organisations depend heavily on the voluntary work of their members. Such organisations often concentrate on self-help, but they also cover a wide range of other activities. Many migrants are active in organisations promoting co-development. Others participate in the environmental movement. Indeed, migrants\u2019 associations are often less \u2018monofunctional\u2019 than mainstream clubs, fulfilling a variety of functions including leisure, sports, cultural, religious and political functions as well as the discussion of practical problems. Involvement in mainstream organisations is the second facet of immigrant social participation. In the voluntary sector, successful immigrant involvement often depends on the openness of recruitment structures. Recruitment into voluntary associations takes place mostly through word of mouth, so that the lack of informal contacts between immigrants and majority population tends to be replicated in the membership of voluntary organisations. There is also sometimes among immigrants a lack of knowledge of the range of roles in voluntary organisations. However, increasingly volunteer- involving organisations are seeing the benefits of diversifying their volunteers to reflect the communities in which they work. In Ireland, many asylum seeker support groups 46 Handbook on Integration Civic participation ",
        "have successfully adopted asylum seekers to their management committees. In the UK, national charities have designated outreach workers recruiting from all local communities. The evaluation of a relevant UK government programme (Black and Minority Ethnic Twinning) suggests that mainstream organisations need to be proactive about finding volunteers, that some potential volunteers may lack confidence but that stressing the potential to develop skills is also important. Immigrant involvement in mainstream volunteer organisations should be promoted. Ideally, recruitment strategies for volunteer members take into account cultural diversity. At the level of urban neighbourhoods, there is particular scope for social participation by all groups \u2013 young and old, minority or majority. Improving housing and residential environments, promoting local economic development, and making improvements to general public services such as health, education and housing services are objectives common to immigrants and non-immigrants and can serve to bring them together around a shared commitment. Opening up mainstream institutions and organisations to all citizens, whether they have an immigrant background or not, takes place over time. It often involves organisational change and different stages can be discerned (from planning to evaluation). It could be 47 Handbook on Integration In Germany, the project \u2018Support for civic involvement of resettled people (Sp\u00e4taussiedler)\u2019 of the foundation Citizens for Citizens has received state funding since 2001. The target group consists of both locals and resettled people. Local project partners such as voluntary agencies, welfare agencies and adult education institutes participate in organising seminars and workshops about civic involvement. The goal of these events is to motivate resettled people for civic involvement and to suggest concrete ways of participating. $ The Dutch organisation FORUM sees its Residents\u2019 Planning Studios as an innovative way of stimulating social participation. A planning studio is typically organised in neighbourhoods that are about to undergo urban restructuring. It consists of a group of 10 to 20 primarily ethnic minority residents who follow a set programme over a three-month period. In a series of up to 10 workshops, they discuss their wishes and dreams relating to housing issues and systematically catalogue the problems and opportunities that exist in their neighbourhood. They collaborate with experts in working their ideas into viable proposals, using photographs, diagrams and drawings. The draft plans are presented to officials from the local authority, housing associations and property developers and are designed for inclusion by the decision-makers into their official development plans. www.forum.nl Z$* ",

Such a charter could be developed in consultation with European initiatives in the area of quality management.

        "49 Handbook on Integration 2.3 Becoming open and inclusive organisations Strategic planning and policy development The first stage involves the formulation of an organisational plan for responding to the diversity of the population in terms of culture, language, religion, etc. Strong leadership from the top is required. All parts of the organisation should be aware of the plan and align their own planning processes with it. In large organisations, not just overall but also divisional plans should reflect a concern for diversity. The priorities set out in the plan should be reflected in resource allocation. Planning starts with knowledge of the organisation\u2019s membership and reach: how many immigrants participate in the organisation, and what are their roles and characteristics? An inventory of people involved in the organisation can be the starting point for the identification of needs, but also of skills to be mobilised. Policy implementation In a next stage the organisation integrates considerations of diversity into the functioning of the organisation at all levels. The organisation ensures accessibility of all services or activities and communicates regularly with persons from diverse backgrounds. The organisation rewards intercultural competence in recruitment, offers training or seeks outside assistance to help staff or members to respond effectively to diversity. Reporting and evaluation The organisation reports on the numbers and background of customers or participants, the involvement of these persons in policy design and implementation, on the number of staff undertaking cultural diversity training, etc. Reports also show which efforts are made to reach out to a diverse population (and how this is reflected in resource allocation) and how these efforts are appraised by the target groups. The regular assessment of outcomes informs the planning and implementation of the organisation\u2019s policies. ^ ^ ^ ",
        "Chapter 2: Conclusions 1. Strategies responding to immigrants' special needs and circumstances and capitalising on their skills enhance their sense of belonging and participation in society. Public and private organisations should base these strategies on equality and anti-discrimination. Ideally they are tailor-made, flexible and subject to regular evaluation. 2. Tailoring services to the special needs of different groups among the population is a collaborative effort requiring the development of intercultural competence in public and private service. 3. Recruitment and training are complementary strategies in building up staff with intercultural competence. Ideally developing intercultural competence among employees is an ongoing priority rather than a one-time effort. 4. Best practices demonstrate that mainstream organisations which work closely with experts or specialist organisations greatly improve the accessibility of their services to immigrants. 5. Intercultural competence can be introduced as a (European) quality management standard which is considered when governments determine their support to organisations or in public tenders. 6. Active citizenship highlights immigrants' skills and suggests ways of making the most of them both for the immigrants and for society as a whole. 7. Religion often plays a positive role in the integration process, which can be enhanced by facilitating a dialogue among immigrant faith communities and between them and mainstream society. 8. Governments should provide support for inter-religious dialogue by facilitating the establishment of dialogue platforms and contributing resources where appropriate. 9. Participation in political processes is one of the most important elements of active citizenship. Political participation of immigrants provides opportunities for integration and should be supported in its different forms, including acquisition of nationality, local electoral rights and consultative structures. 10.

        "53 Handbook on Integration Chapter 3 Indicators ",
        "This chapter looks at indicators as a tool for policy-makers and practitioners. Indicators can measure the real situation of immigrants and identify to what extent integration is progressing. They can also track the development of policies over time. A successful use of indicators builds on appropriate data collection and on the careful selection of indicators in line with the overall targets for integration. At the cross-country or European level, indicators allow for comparisons between countries and can create momentum for more dynamic integration policies. To better measure integration and the impact of integration policies governmental and non-governmental organisations could develop sets of integration indicators. Indicators of immigrant integration can help to measure and compare progress, monitor trends and developments, reflect immigrant participation rates and sense of belonging, as well as the level of acceptance of immigrants among the population. In short, they can provide insight into the process of integration. Indicators can also help to measure the role and impact of policy measures, identify gaps and aid the effective targeting of resources. Given the complexity of the integration process, societal integration can be disaggregated into particular aspects where the measurement of developments and results and policy-relevant impact assessments may be possible. Indicators allow for comparisons between particular groups of immigrants and between them and the overall population, between countries and regions, and between various phases of integration or stages of policy development. Indicators are used in benchmarking, where comparative measures are employed to identify areas for improvement and successful practices. In current government practice, indicators are most often used for evaluating the effectiveness of national policies and comparing the performance of groups of countries (for example, within the UNDP on development and 54 Handbook on Integration Indicators * Making the case for indicators on integration Indicators can be used as a tool for \u2022 Quantifying and qualifying integration processes \u2022 Summarising complicated integration policies \u2022 Monitoring developments and trends and measuring progress \u2022 Setting targets and benchmarks for integration processes and policies \u2022 Identifying unintended impacts of laws, policies and practices \u2022 Identifying actors having an impact on the realisation of integration \u2022 Revealing whether the obligations of actors are met \u2022 Giving early warning of potential distractions \u2022 Prompting preventive action \u2022 Enhancing social consensus on trade-offs in case of resource constraints \u2022 Exposing issues that have been neglected or silenced ^ ",
        "within the OECD on economics and on education). There is also a growing interest in using indicators for comparisons between EU Member States. While no comprehensive set of indicators exists on immigrant integration at national and international levels, there is an existing repertoire of concepts and methods in related policy areas such as employment, enterprise, education and social inclusion. On the one hand, the possibility of including immigrant integration related indicators in existing mechanisms of indexing and benchmarking could be explored. On the other hand, a mechanism uniquely for immigrant integration could be developed incorporating the socio-economic, cultural and civil and political dimensions of integration. Many Member States are keen to make use of indicators outside the socio-economic and the legal spheres. For instance, in the Netherlands biannual \u2018integration monitors\u2019 are produced which look at the position of ethnic minorities on the socio-structural level (labour market, ethnic entrepreneurship and education), on the socio-cultural level (inter-ethnic relations, acceptance of minorities and cultural orientation of minorities), and on the political-institutional level (political participation and representation of minorities in the government administration). Designing relevant and reliable indicators covering all dimensions of integration is an ambitious task which comes up against many difficulties, especially but not only on the European terrain with its diverse immigrant populations, policy instruments, definitions and statistics. Disagreements about \u2018who should be counted\u2019 are particularly salient here: who is an immigrant? Do we look at nationality or country of birth? How are second and third generations defined? Are we looking at immigrants as individuals or groups? In EU- wide comparisons, the definition used most frequently is \u2018third country nationals\u2019. Is this a workable compromise, or does it \u2018hide\u2019 crucial dimensions of integration? Another issue is what is meant by integration. While all Member States combine elements of both \u2018assimilation\u2019 and \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 in their understanding of integration, the weight given to the one or the other differs significantly between countries. Although these debates are ongoing, some common ground can be found in the identification of goals for integration. With their policies, Member States hope to contribute to positive outcomes for immigrants in the areas of employment, housing, education, health, etc. They seek to make services accessible to immigrants, and they wish to see immigrants participate as active citizens in the social and political realms. These outcomes can, to an extent, be quantified or otherwise defined, and their achievement can be compared over time and between countries. However such measuring holds further complexities. Who do we compare immigrants to? The Dutch monitoring system has typically compared groups of immigrants with the 55 Handbook on Integration * ",
        "indigenous population. Is this the right yardstick in all cases? For instance, regarding the use of social security migrants do not always have the same entitlements as non- migrants. Differential age structures and socio-economic levels also need to be taken into account when comparing migrant and non-migrant communities. The Netherlands is now working on developing threshold levels to set a standard for each dimension of integration. Once these threshold levels have been determined, the distance of a group to this level can be measured. One way of using and developing indicators is through the process of benchmarking. Benchmarking originated in a business setting, but the public sector increasingly recognises its potential for evaluating and advancing policies. Benchmarking includes identifying areas for improvement, setting standards, comparing one\u2019s own performance to that of others, and engaging in continuous evaluation and adaptation to meet the standards set. Benchmarking works through setting standards for comparison. Indicators should have a clear and explicit normative interpretation: users should know which direction of change represents progress. The model which is being developed by the Dutch WODC (Research and Documentation Centre) identifies \u2018chances\u2019 and \u2018risks\u2019 for integration: having a paid job is a chance while living on social security is a risk, marriage migration is identified as a risk, while observing prevailing standards and values constitutes a chance. In many countries, questions may arise whether a certain outcome is a \u2018chance\u2019 or a \u2018risk\u2019 for good integration. For instance, is a certain level of segregation in housing always a risk? Could it not be a chance for creating an ethnic infrastructure including economic opportunities for immigrants? 3.1 Creating the conditions Avoiding the pitfalls and using indicators to their full potential requires a clear understanding of the techniques involved in the development and use of indicators such as stakeholder analysis and data collection. Stakeholder consultations If indicators are to contribute valuable insights about integration, they must be connected as closely as possible to the real experience of integration. Those who are going through it and those who observe it closely have their own impressions and opinions about what best describes successful integration, which areas need improvement, and what impact policies have made. Their views must be included in the 56 Handbook on Integration Indicators * ",
        "formulation of indicators and targets. Integration as a process involving society as a whole also concerns mainstream stakeholders at different levels, who should have an opportunity to express their priorities and experiences with regard to immigrant integration. Extensive stakeholder consultations should be organised regarding the priorities and targets connected to indicators, and should include in particular immigrants and immigrant-assisting organisations. The practises of stakeholder consultations and stakeholders analysis have become part and parcel of, for example, the design and implementation of development projects in developing countries and are increasingly applied in other policy fields and other countries. Data collection and use Appropriate and reliable data can be produced for different types of indicators, the relationship between outcomes and policy can be analysed carefully and international comparisons can be facilitated by developing indicators at different levels. Governments\u2019 most immediate concern is often with the success of their policies and programmes, and it is here that many preconditions for the successful use of indicators can be created. Thorough planning and evaluation of integration programmes or projects both generate data and spark reflection about the goals and assumptions of integration policy. Ideally indicators are used in the planning as well as the evaluation phase of integration programmes and projects. In publicly funded projects, evaluation should be a part of project implementation and should receive a realistic budget share. As is the case in many countries with developed integration programmes, Denmark studies the effectiveness of municipalities\u2019 activities. Reports measure for instance the expected and actual length of time from the granting of a residency permit to the participants\u2019 attainment of regular work or enrolment into education. In Finland, the Ministry of Labour in cooperation with the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities has launched a project for the drafting of quality criteria to support municipalities and other local actors in implementing and monitoring integration programmes under the Integration Act. A study of the Act from the point of view of immigrants has also been carried out in an effort to promote immigrant participation. The \u2018quality criteria\u2019 project responds to the results of a 2002 survey of municipalities, which called for more concrete and practical instruction in the implementation of the Integration Act. Detailed questions are now being developed to guide evaluation, e.g. on the range of services available, on personnel and financial resources, on immigrant participation in planning and in implementation as paid workers, on the division of tasks and responsibilities, and on available diversity and equality training. 57 Handbook on Integration * * ",
        "Building on evaluation, best practice exchanges have been initiated in many countries. For instance, the Danish government has established a database aimed at the exchange of best practices ( www.erfaringsdatabasen.dk ). A newsletter published by the Ministry of Integration also contains information on best practices within the field of labour market integration. Indicators can be developed to broaden the lessons of evaluation into a long-term strategy. An essential precondition is long-term planning on integration policy. For instance, the Estonian state programme \u2018Integration in Estonian Society 2000-2007\u2019 is a conceptual and strategic document laying down basic principles, objectives and activities. Data availability is perhaps the most crucial condition for a successful use of indicators. The European Commission is currently preparing a draft Directive concerning harmonisation of data collection in the Member States to facilitate the development of indicators and benchmarking. DG Employment and Social Affairs is exploring the different ways of data collection and use in the fields of equality and anti-discrimination. DG Justice and Home Affairs is exploring how common definitions in the migration field can be developed and used uniformly throughout the Union. In this context, Eurostat and the European Community Household Panel can also be mentioned. The Czech Republic explicitly adapts its own efforts to current international trends in the collection of statistical information and data on migration and integration. Gradually, it is creating an overall \u2018Concept for Selection and Processing of Statistic Data on Migration and Integration of Foreigners on the Territory of the Czech Republic\u2019. Portugal has established an Immigration Monitoring Centre whose main task it is to provide reliable and comparable data and to undertake studies. The Monitoring Centre comprises eight research institutes, and government works closely with academic partners. The most comprehensive statistical data sources are available in countries which use a national population register. For instance, the Netherlands Central Statistics Bureau generates statistical information by connecting registration data to the country of birth of citizens. The registration of country of birth by the municipalities makes it possible to monitor the Dutch born second generation as well as the first generation. The measurement instrument which is being developed by the Dutch WODC also draws on the general national population register with its individualised entries. From this register, it draws \u2018panels\u2019 of individuals belonging to different groups. Large and small immigrant populations may be identified, or groups may be formed according to other characteristics (such as age, gender, migration motives, or background situation such as educational level at the time of arrival). There is a condition that groups must contain over 100 individuals and that aggregate data must be used. The Netherlands also uses supplementary data of different types such as assessments by interviewers of Dutch language proficiency, scores on educational achievement tests, or answers to a questionnaire on modern values. Regular surveys are held among immigrant groups. 58 Handbook on Integration Indicators ",
        "Finland also has a national population register and Statistics Finland has carried out a comprehensive study of immigrants\u2019 living conditions ( www.tilastokeskus.fi ). The survey used both registration data and interviews, but did not combine them. In all countries, a decision to collect information on specific groups implies a decision to invest resources. Here, indicators act as an incentive to gather more comprehensive data. There is a need to set priorities: rather than accumulating data on many different issues governments need to focus on questions which are central to the success and effectiveness of their integration policies. Disaggregated data may often be desirable, but its collection can be difficult in terms of resources or political traditions. Due to various historical experiences and national traditions, a significant number of European countries remain averse to registration of ethnic origin or belonging to an ethnic group. The improvement and expansion of data collection on issues related to immigrant integration must be in line with international and European guidelines (including those on data protection). Indicators can be used to identify areas of data deficiency and to formulate priorities. Where particular immigrant groups are singled out for examination, the criteria for their choice and definition should be clear, and the information collected should not be used for discriminatory purposes. 3.2 Selecting indicators There are different types of indicators ranging from statistics to more qualitative indicators. They are used for different purposes and different audiences. Which and how many indicators are being used also depends on available resources. Ideally a mix of different indicators is used and governmental and non-governmental actors are encouraged to use similar indicators. \u2018Objective\u2019 and \u2018subjective\u2019 indicators can be developed to capture the different aspects of integration. \u2018Objective\u2019 or \u2018hard\u2019 indicators are often statistical or legal in nature and measure, for instance, employment and unemployment rates or access to certain legal rights such the right to vote in local elections. \u2018Subjective\u2019, or \u2018soft\u2019 indicators look more at attitudes or perceptions, for instance job satisfaction or feelings of belonging in a particular country or environment. As governments pay increasing attention to the personal dimensions of integration and in particular to the frequency and intensity of social interactions, subjective indicators are growing in importance. In its monitoring efforts, the Netherlands considers the dimension of \u2018culture\u2019 including leisure, religion, family, and the values concerning these areas of life. Denmark seeks to measure the incidence of contacts between migrants and non-migrants, particularly in 59 Handbook on Integration * * ",
        "the private sphere. Similarly, the Italian Commission on integration has formulated the goal of looking at immigrants\u2019 relationships with the community of reception, trying to assess the tendency to stabilisation and interaction with the national population. Although subjective indicators are often more difficult to measure than objective ones, they should not be considered as unreliable or unimportant. Surveys (such as the Eurobarometer), interviews with migrants or public opinion data can be used to answer questions about subjective integration. Finding information often involves participatory methods, which makes the indicators relevant for immigrants. The attitudes of the receiving society are equally important, for instance feelings about citizenship and nationhood (or on foreigners and minorities). Information on attitudes can also serve to explain \u2018objective\u2019 indicators, for instance, the attitudes of employers towards immigrants could explain the number of immigrants employed in \u2018local\u2019 companies. A large public opinion survey has been carried out in Estonia to explore the changes in ethnic relations and the related opinions of the two language communities. Approximately two thirds of the (more than one thousand) respondents were Estonian, with the other third made up of representatives of other nationalities. Continuous media monitoring takes place in order to systematically assess integration processes in the Estonian- and Russian-language media. Quantitative analysis and qualitative text analysis are used to determine the main integration-related issues and the opinions disseminated. Within its Foreigners Administration Information System, Lithuania also carries out assessments of the media coverage of integration-related issues and the public perception of foreigners. Comprehensive monitoring systems include both objective and subjective indicators. The Council of Europe already in 1995 resolved to develop indicators of three types: indicators of accessibility dealing with the legal framework in which migrants live, indicators describing the actual situation of migrants in their host country and indicators on the attitudes of migrants and of the majority population. The Council\u2019s Committee of Experts on Integration and Community Relations continues to work on an indicators tool as a reference for policy makers. The tool now looks at eight key areas: employment, housing, health care, nutrition, education, information and culture. In addition, it proposes indicators on ensuring basic public functions for immigrants on a more general level, including equality before the law, combating discrimination and access to possibilities of self-organisation. Under each heading, the tool lists a number of questions, followed by the corresponding indicators. A distinctive characteristic of the indicators tool is that it addresses so-called \u2018invisible elements\u2019. These elements refer to the attitudes of immigrants, for instance immigrant job satisfaction or immigrants\u2019 level of trust in financial institutions. They also refer to the indigenous population by proposing indicators on the level of solidarity with immigrants. Surveys are suggested as a source of information, but for many of the questions relating to \u2018invisible elements\u2019 specific indicators have not yet been formulated. 60 Handbook on Integration Indicators ",
        "Both objective and subjective indicators can be developed to address the different aspects of integration, and definitions and methods of data collection can be refined for both categories. Particular consideration could be given to developing innovative survey methods which can capture the perspectives of immigrants and host populations. Outcome and policy indicators It is essential to distinguish clearly between policy and outcome indicators. Outcome indicators assess the actual situation of immigrants, for instance in terms of labour market participation rates. Policy indicators look at the amount of resources that have been used for a specific service or programme (such as new health programmes), or at legal conditions (such as recognition of qualifications). Outcome indicators are often preferred because they are seen to reflect the real situation of immigrants rather than the intentions of governments. For instance, the EU Social Protection Committee in its suggested set of indicators agreed to address outcomes rather than the means by which they are achieved. Policy effort was considered to be an inappropriate subject of evaluation, since Member States differ in their choice of means to combat social exclusion and poverty. A government\u2019s lower investment in a particular type of programme may thus be design rather than a lack to be remedied. Moreover, the Committee considered that focusing on outcomes might foster a co-operative attitude between the different national bodies whose policies have an impact on the result. Policy effort indicators should therefore only be used as a supplement where outcome indicators were not available. On the other hand, outcome indicators do not necessarily answer the question whether and to what extent policy measures actually have an impact on immigrant integration. Immigrants may succeed in integrating independently of, or even despite government policy. If individuals are the unit of analysis, this difficulty is particularly significant, since individual decisions are composed of many different factors and motivations. Policy indicators can be valuable especially in areas where legal standards are important. For instance, the proposed indicators of the Council of Europe include, as indicators on \u2018equity\u2019, the ratification of specific legal instruments, the existence of certain legal provisions, specialised bodies or services, consultative committees etc. Many countries use both outcome and policy indicators. For instance, the Danish government has formulated a number of integration indicators including how quickly foreigners are employed and learn Danish, whether foreigners complete an education that qualifies them for a trade or profession, and whether and to what degree municipalities use sanctions when foreigners do not participate in or are absent from employment, activation or Danish language education. 61 Handbook on Integration * ",
        "Governments frequently use indicators in order to track progress over time. Following immigrant cohorts could be a way of doing this, as could other forms of longitudinal research and data gathering. As integration is a process rather than a situation, the time perspective is particularly important. Progress on certain indicators (for instance, educational achievement) can be evidence of integration as well as providing further opportunities towards integration in this or other domains. In order to identify the impact of a particular policy measure, a temporal scheme could be used: outcomes could be measured before and after the implementation of the policy measure, and the difference attributed to its impact. However, it is possible that other intervening factors have been present or even that success has taken place despite policy rather than because of it. Moreover, the functioning and accessibility of institutions (such as the health service) over a long period of time could be more important in terms of integration than isolated policy measures. Policy indicators can be employed in particular to monitor legal standards, entitlements and policy arrangements which facilitate integration, and outcome indicators can be used to track the situation of immigrants and the achievement of targets set for integration. Caution should be used in establishing connections between policies and outcomes. Regular reviews should be held of the performance and suitability of indicators, assessing their reliability, any technical difficulties and the availability of data. Levels of indicators Indicators used for international comparison need to allow for diversity in definitions and data availability. Different types of indicators can be used at the European, national and local levels. Indicators used at the various levels can be specific for a particular level and address the circumstances of particular groups. There are various models for differentiating between levels of indicators. For instance, within the Employment Strategy indicators are developed on two levels: key (or primary) indicators measure progress in relation to the objectives defined in the Employment Guidelines, and context (or secondary) indicators support key indicators by putting national policies and performance into perspective. In 2002, there were 35 key indicators and 64 context indicators. A complete review of all indicators took place in 2003, with the new list including 40 key indicators and 26 context indicators. Social Inclusion indicators are developed on three levels: Level 1 indicators are the lead indicators and cover those elements that are considered the most important. Level 2 indicators support the main indicators and describe other dimensions to the problem. Level 1 and level 2 indicators are \u2018commonly agreed and defined\u2019. Level 3 indicators can 62 Handbook on Integration Indicators * * ",
        "be more country-specific, determined by individual Member States to highlight specificities in particular areas, and to help interpret the Level 1 and 2 indicators. Level 3 indicators need not be harmonised at EU level. It is necessary to differentiate between levels of indicators. For European or international comparisons, the higher-level indicators should have the greatest degree of uniformity regarding definitions and data formats. Setting targets As data availability increases and monitoring systems become more dynamic, targets can be set to give direction to integration policies and to demonstrate political will for improving integration. Targets work best where they are specific and where there are strong incentives to reach the stated objectives. For instance, the Enterprise Policy Scoreboard, a monitoring instrument within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, contains quantitative targets set by Member States for seven priority areas of enterprise policy. Time horizons vary with a maximum of seven years and regular scoreboard updates list the targets announced by Member States together with their current position, the position to be achieved and the date set for achievement. Also at the EU level, the Social Inclusion Process seeks to increase the number of targets set by Member States. The Common Outline for the 2003 National Action Plans contains an appendix on \u2018setting targets\u2019, suggesting that Member States use headline targets, accompanied by more detailed targets, to set goals regarding social policy issues including immigrant integration. However, the Joint Inclusion Report of 2003 notes the lack of data on vulnerable groups, and in particular migrant and ethnic groups, with only a small number of countries (including the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain and France) listing data or indicators for people of immigrant origin. Few targets are set and few countries attempt to identify positive or negative trends in the living and working conditions of immigrants. Targets work as a dynamic instrument of policy making where there is political will to reach them and to learn from monitoring and evaluation. Target setting builds on a close link between monitoring and implementation. As the execution of integration policy is often decentralised, different levels can work with indicators. 3.3. European cooperation Governments can use indicators to measure results and to facilitate judgements about whether or not their policies have been effective. However, indicators also constitute a 63 Handbook on Integration * * ",
        "powerful comparative instrument. Charting countries\u2019 performances on different facets of integration policy can create a sort of positive competition between them. Action or inaction, commitments or non-commitments can be measured and compared. Comparing policies and performance is most likely to be possible at the level of general indicators. A common core of such lead indicators could be devised, covering only those elements that are considered to be important by all and using data sets which are available to the great majority if not all Member States. Countries with similar conditions in terms of data collection, definitions of immigrant categories and privacy rules could decide to use some of the same lower level indicators in order to benefit from the comparisons. Those Member States who already have comprehensive monitoring systems could work to make them more comparable over time. Alternatively, Member States in similar stages of policy formation and with similar policies could improve on using the same indicators, set targets and benchmarks. These Member States could gradually share their practices with a wider group of countries. Different methods are available for carrying out measurements of Member States\u2019 performances against each other. For instance, the European Enterprise Scoreboard normalises the values of indicators by calculating indices, whereby the EU index is 100. Country results are thus compared against the benchmark of the EU average for each of these indicators. An arbitrary band of 25 % above and below the EU average is established. Departures from the EU average represent relative strengths or weaknesses, such that indicators higher than 125 % or lower than 75 % are considered to reflect strong (or weak) performances. Furthermore, a policy area is considered to be a country\u2019s strength if 50 % or more of the indicators in this area reach an index of 125 or more and the remaining indicators reach an index of at least 95. On the contrary, if 50 % or more of the indicators lie below 75 and the remaining ones do not exceed 105, this area is considered an area of weakness. The Council of Europe\u2019s indicators tool, looking at eight basic spheres of life, proposes comparisons over a whole range of indicators addressing both outcomes and legal rights. On employment and living conditions, it proposes to compare e.g. the number of jobless households of immigrant origin, the number of immigrants who have been unemployed at least once, the availability of vocational reintegration for immigrant workers who have been made redundant, and the percentage of immigrants who hold a position that corresponds to their qualifications. It also proposes to compare the indigenous/immigrant ratio for low-paid jobs and early retirement, for the average renewal time for contracts, and for the amount of aid spent on parental leave and childcare. Indigenous/immigrant differences in the percentage of households in debt to unofficial lenders, and in the percentage of households without a bank or building society account can all be measured and compared across countries. 64 Handbook on Integration Indicators ",
        "Comparisons can also generate concrete benefits for policy-makers in the form of ideas or \u2018best practices\u2019. Practices can be compared within one country, which has advantages in that access to sensitive data and information are easier, standardised data is often readily available, and there may be less barriers to transferring practices. With international comparisons, more time and resources are necessary to ensure the comparability of data and information. However, looking to the outside for best practices often generates more innovation. Where the scope of the subject is clearly defined and where \u2018benchmarking partners\u2019 are in continuous communication with each other, benefits can be significant. When employing indicators on immigrant integration, use can be made of the innovative potential of cross-country comparisons. EU-wide comparisons can be undertaken on a limited number of core indicators. Countries with similar preconditions can engage in more far-reaching comparisons using lower-level indicators. Civic citizenship indicators While socio-economic aspects of immigrant integration have found a partial \u2018home\u2019 in various EU level mechanisms, no structures exist to address the other dimensions of integration which are important to Member States. Three steps can be taken to remedy this shortcoming without creating constraints through new institutional mechanisms. First, coordination can be improved between the different socio-economic policy mechanisms that have, to a greater or lesser extent, taken up issues related to immigrant integration. The European Employment Strategy, the Social Inclusion Process, Enterprise Scoreboard and other mechanisms all touch upon questions relevant to integration such as employment, income, or minority and immigrant entrepreneurship. The different Directorate-Generals and Units involved in managing these mechanisms can, by working towards closer co-ordination, contribute to greater coherence in the monitoring and target setting on socio-economic dimensions of immigrant integration. Second, the \u2018other\u2019 elements of integration, which go beyond the socio-economic domain, need to be defined more positively and given a distinctive identity. What are the unique issues which make up the civic dimension of immigrant integration? A number of core topics can be decided upon to give a clear shape to those areas of integration which fall under or are related to the mandate of Justice and Home Affairs. The heading of civic citizenship can be used to express the specific character of these issues. Third, civic citizenship issues can be linked with general issues of Justice and Home Affairs such as human rights. This linkage will consolidate the place of civic citizenship within Justice and Home Affairs and ensure coherence with other policies in the field. 65 Handbook on Integration * ",
        "Existing groups such as the European Immigration Network or the National Contact Points on migration and integration can be made partners in this development. Groups of independent scientific experts can be involved for data analysis tasks. Varying arrangements could be used for different types of indicators focusing on policy or outcomes. Civic citizenship issues lend themselves to monitoring and target setting through both policy and outcome indicators. Policy indicators are important in this field because it is closely related to legal standards. Which entitlements immigrants have, what residence periods are required to receive these entitlements, and whether administrative arrangements facilitate the take-up of these entitlements, are crucial measures of a country\u2019s commitment to integration. Many of the relevant measures are contained in the paragraphs of two adopted EU Directives: the Directive on family reunion and the Directive on long-term residents. The standards set out in the Directives can serve as indicators and monitoring their transposition can be a benchmarking exercise involving all EU members. The benchmarking of integration policies can be closely linked to the legislative agenda. This would strengthen the overall impact of Justice and Home Affairs policies on third country nationals. Outcome indicators and targets are equally important. How many immigrants choose naturalisation where it is possible? How many vote or stand as candidates? Can targets be set for naturalisation rates or electoral participation? Outcome indicators give a perspective on the real progress of integration and can indicate priority areas for policy initiatives at the EU or national level. Knowing about outcomes can help to direct funding programmes at all levels. It can also improve the impact of best practice exchanges, since policy-makers can deliberately seek out examples from countries which are high achievers in a particular field. The abovementioned structures can generate the information necessary for an effective monitoring of civic citizenship policies and outcomes, and help countries to make the best use of indicators for immigrant integration. 66 Handbook on Integration Indicators * ",

        "Chapter 3: Conclusions 1. To better measure integration and the impact of integration policies governmental and non-governmental organisations could develop sets of integration indicators. 2. On the one hand, the possibility of including immigrant integration related indicators in existing mechanisms of indexing and benchmarking could be explored. On the other hand, a mechanism uniquely for immigrant integration could be developed incorporating the socio-economic, cultural and civil and political dimensions of integration. 3. Benchmarking works through setting standards for comparison. Indicators should have a clear and explicit normative interpretation: users should know which direction of change represents progress. 4. Extensive stakeholder consultations should be organised regarding the priorities and targets connected to indicators, and should include in particular immigrants and immigrant-assisting organisations. 5. Ideally indicators are used in the planning as well as the evaluation phase of integration programmes and projects.

        "This annex summarises seven steps for the design and implementation of integration programmes. They are based on the examples given in the previous chapters and on principles of programme management and strategic planning. They help policy-makers and practitioners to translate overall policy goals into integration programmes. In addition, the seven steps may be used as headings for groups of targets and performance indicators as well as chapters in the programme\u2019s activity report. Finally, the seven steps could be used as a framework for exchanging good practices at national and European levels. 1. Providing the rationale for action In order to obtain the necessary political and public support for the allocation of resources for integration programmes and to get the most out of the commitment of stakeholders, it is important to provide a rationale for these programmes and to communicate this with stakeholders and the wider public. The rationale demonstrates that there is a problem, illustrates what the programme will bring about, describes the targets, and connects a specific programme with overall integration goals. For example, the rationale for introduction and language training programmes \u2022 Demonstrates that significant groups of persons - be they immigrants or not - lack knowledge of language and principal values and customs to such a degree that this hampers their participation in society \u2022 Illustrates how such knowledge enhances beneficiaries' confidence and self-sufficiency \u2022 Describes the targets - who are the beneficiaries - and focus - which skills are to be developed \u2022 Connects these programmes with the overall goals of integration and social cohesion, participation and citizenship For example, the rationale for civic participation \u2022 Demonstrates that significant groups of persons do not have real access to mainstream organisations because of their particular cultural or socio-economic characteristics to such a degree that this deprives them from enjoyment of their citizenship rights to the detriment of their well-being. It also deprives organisations from the participation of people with valuable assets to the detriment of the organisations' vitality \u2022 Illustrates how organisations responding to cultural and socio-economic diversity improve the quality of their services, increase customer satisfaction and promote a sense of belonging; Illustrates how organisations, by engaging members of different groups, contribute to an active and participatory society \u2022 Describes the targets - who are the beneficiaries - and focus - which services are to be improved, whose talents to be mobilised and which groups engaged 72 Handbook on Integration ",
        "\u2022 Connects these programmes with the overall goals of societal integration - access and equality, participation and belonging 2. Formulating the programme For the sake of effectiveness it is important that programmes are well formulated and based on a thorough analysis of the problems to be addressed. This includes: \u2022 Mapping exercises \u2022 Scientific research \u2022 Expert advice \u2022 Learning from other programmes \u2022 Stakeholder consultations 3. Stakeholder consultations In order to ensure that programmes are addressing the real problems, that different interests are well represented and that stakeholders take ownership of the programmes, it is crucially important to consult with stakeholders at an early phase. \u2022 The identification of stakeholders will make a distinction between those who call for and those who implement programmes, as well as between those who benefit directly and indirectly from the programmes \u2022 The recognition and valuing of their different views and interests - often depending on gender, socio-economic position and migration history - will make it possible to differentiate in the assessment of needs \u2022 An inventory of sensitive issues, possible deficiencies and pitfalls, as well as opportunities and changes for success, will enable the design of tailor-made measures to address them \u2022 A serious and ongoing dialogue with stakeholders will generate political and public support and the co-operation of beneficiaries, as well as reinforcing commitment and dedication to participate in the programmes 4. Defining the problem To be able to set priorities, the programmes must describe in detail and analyse thoroughly the problems they want to address. \u2022 A problem analysis demonstrates for example what the language deficiencies are among which groups, or it demonstrates which barriers to participation exist for which groups 73 Handbook on Integration ",
        "\u2022 A stakeholder analysis assesses the number of people directly and indirectly affected \u2022 A technical analysis establishes what needs to be done to solve the problems \u2022 An organisational analysis points to which organisations should be included or targeted in the programme 5. Defining objectives In order to reach agreement on the programme among stakeholders, it is essential to describe \u2013 in terms of means and ends - what the programme aims at. \u2022 A description of the desired situation lays out the positive effects and advantages - for beneficiaries and society as a whole \u2022 The description demonstrates what should be achieved and enables the establishment of a set of clear and precise objectives and of a hierarchy between them \u2022 This description also enables stakeholders to select and agree upon programmatic objectives - in terms of target groups, type of training, etc. \u2022 An assessment of objectives ascertains whether these objectives can be achieved by this or possibly other programmes 6. Deciding on strategies In order to enhance the effective implementation of the programme, it is key to identify and consider various possible strategies to deliver on the programme objectives. \u2022 The identification and selection of strategies is governed by the programmatic objectives \u2022 Stakeholders are consulted on the identification and choice of strategies and their opinions are given significant weight \u2022 Resource allocation includes budget matters - such as level of subsidies, own contribution of beneficiaries, private sector sponsorship - co-operation with the voluntary sector, etc. \u2022 An assessment of how strategies contribute to achieving gender and ethnic equality is an essential part of the strategy selection process 7.
