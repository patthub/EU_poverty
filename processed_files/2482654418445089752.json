        "40% of energy consumed Buildings account for: 36% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions KEY PROPOSALS FOR HOMES AND BUILDINGS The proposals presented today support the development of renewable and less polluting energy systems for our homes and public buildings. They will: The revised Energy Efficiency Directive and Renewable Energy Directive will make buildings more energy efficient and boost the use of renewable energy in buildings. The new Effort Sharing Regulation sets emission reduction targets for all Member States by 2030 for sectors including buildings. Emissions Trading for building fuels will speed up emissions reductions and stimulate investments in renewables and energy efficiency. The new Social Climate Fund , funded by revenues from emissions trading in road transport and buildings, will provide financial support to citizens , in particular the vulnerable households, to invest in renovation or heating systems and ensure a fair transition. More measures for promoting the decarbonisation of buildings will follow before the end of the year with a proposal for revising the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. MAKING OUR HOMES AND BUILDINGS FIT FOR A GREENER FUTURE July 2021 \u2022 decrease emissions \u2022 save energy \u2022 tackle energy poverty \u2022 improve quality of life \u2022 generate jobs and growth ",
        "THE REVISED RENEWABLE ENERGY DIRECTIVE WILL: THE STRENGTHENED ENERGY EFFICIENCY DIRECTIVE WILL: \u2022 Introduce indicative Member State contributions to the EU-level energy efficiency target \u2022 Introduce a legal requirement to put energy efficiency first in planning and investment decisions \u2022 Require Member States to renovate at least 3% of the total floor area of all public buildings annually \u2022 Establish a new target for Member States to reduce energy use in the public sector by 1.7% every year \u2022 Encourage public bodies to use Energy Performance Contracts for renovation of large non-residential buildings \u2022 Prioritise energy efficiency measures for vulnerable consumers and energy poor households \u2022 Take further steps to empower final customers - basic contractual rights on heating, cooling and hot water SET BOLDER TARGETS FOR ENERGY SAVINGS BY 2030 9% increase compared to the ambition pledged by Member States in 2020 within their National Energy and Climate Plans ENHANCING THE USE OF RENEWABLES AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN OUR BUILDINGS 39% 36% for primary energy consumption for final energy consumption Set a new EU-level target of 40% renewables in the energy mix Set a benchmark of 49% of renewables in buildings Raise the use of renewable energy in district heating and cooling by 2.1 percentage points every year Increase the use of renewable energy in heating and cooling by 1.1 percentage point every year \u2022 Make it easier to integrate renewables into the grid (e.g. developing new technologies, integrating storage facilities and improving cross-border cooperation) \u2022 Provide stronger incentives for electrification (e.g. heat pumps and electric vehicles) and the incorporation of new fuels such as renewable hydrogen \u2022 Encourage energy efficiency and circularity (e.g. facilitating the use of waste heat) ",
        "GIVING PRICE SIGNALS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM BUILDINGS EMISSIONS TRADING FOR BUILDING FUELS WILL: \u2022 Put a price on polluting fuels, encouraging producers to innovate and invest in clean energy , and offer it to end-users \u2022 Finance a Social Climate Fund to provide financial support to citizens, in particular vulnerable households, to invest in renovation or heating systems and ensure a fair transition \u2022 Ensure a level playing field for all heating options, by complementing the existing carbon price on electric heating and district heating with a carbon price on domestic heating \u2022 Create revenues for Member States which can be used to support the decarbonisation of buildings INCENTIVISING MEMBER STATES TO CUT EMISSIONS IN BUILDINGS THE NEW SOCIAL CLIMATE FUND WILL: \u2022 Use \u20ac72.2 billion in current prices of auction revenues generated by the new ETS for buildings to address social impacts \u2022 Bene fit vulnerable households, especially those in energy poverty \u2022 Support national measures and investments fostering building renovation for these households. \u2022 Co-finance Member States\u2019 direct income support to vulnerable households until investments have been undertaken NATIONAL EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS UNDER THE EFFORT SHARING REGULATION WILL: \u2022 Maintain the incentives for Member States to take action \u2022 Allow Member States to make emissions cuts in cost effective ways, with some flexibility P r i n t I S B N 978 - 92 - 76 - 39756 - 4 d o i : 10 . 2775 / 081949 N A - 02 - 21 - 847 - E N - C P D F I S B N 978 - 92 - 76 - 39728 - 1 d o i : 10 . 2775 / 100333 N A - 02 - 21 - 847 - E N - N \u00a9 European Union, 2021 Reuse of this document is allowed, provided appropriate credit is given and any changes are indicated (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license).
