        "Following the Brexit referendum, in October 2016, the EESC took the decision to set up a Brexit ad-hoc committee. This committee was given the remit to monitor the Brexit negotiations and to report back to the EESC Bureau as to how the negotiations were progressing. Towards the end of 2018, I was asked by President Jahier to take over the chairmanship of the Brexit ad-hoc committee and to map out how this committee would continue to function as the negotiations progressed. Following some discussions with Mr Jahier and the members of the committee it was decided that we would take a more pro-active and forward-looking role. The remit of the Brexit ad-hoc committee was then redefined to that of mapping out what kind of EU-UK post-Brexit relationship could exist between civil society in the UK and the EU. With this remit firmly in mind, a work programme covering all four nations forming the United Kingdom was designed. The idea was that the Brexit ad-hoc committee would carry out missions in each of the four nations of the UK during which one-to-one meetings \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n 2 0 1 9 \u00a9 S h u tt e r s t o c k / M e l i n d a N a g y ",

The scope of these meetings would be to establish: \uf0b7 What are the main problematic issues identified by UK civil society as arising from Brexit? \uf0b7 Is there an appetite on the UK side to have some form of structured relationship in a post-Brexit scenario? \uf0b7 What kind of relationship does UK civil society aspire to have in place once Brexit takes place? During the course of 2019 and in the first few weeks of 2020, the Brexit ad- hoc committee undertook all four missions, holding meetings in Belfast, Glasgow, Cardiff and London. By the end of these four missions, meetings had been held with some 150 different organisations representing employers, trade unions, environmental NGOs, charities, farmer organisations, etc. The committee is now in possession of a wealth of information that no other EU institution has. For each mission a country report has been generated, and these reports have been sent to the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, to all the UK organisations that participated and to the EESC Bureau. We are now also in a position to clearly understand the significant desire on the part of UK civil society to have in place a formal and structured relationship with EU civil society once the transition period comes to an end. Key concerns on the UK side In a nutshell, the following are the key concerns regarding Brexit that were raised by civil society in the different nations of the UK: Northern Ireland \uf0b7 The issue of security and the possibility of the peace process being derailed \uf0b7 The inability to participate in EU-funded projects Scotland \uf0b7 A slowdown in immigration, which is considered to be essential for the functioning of the economy \uf0b7 A reduction in the number of non-UK students coming to study in Scotland \uf0b7 A significant reduction in the amount of funding available for the poorer regions Wales \uf0b7 Not having a direct voice in the development of the future relationship with the EU \uf0b7 Not having access to funding \uf0b7 Not being able to participate in EU projects England \uf0b7 Not being able to exchange information and experiences with EU counterparts \uf0b7 Not having access to the single market \uf0b7 Having no formal relationship with EU civil society in place due to reluctance by the UK government \uf0b7 Not having access to EU funding and programmes What is the view of the UK government? Whilst it is clear that UK civil society is very eager to have a post- Brexit relationship in place, what is still very unclear is whether the UK government will entertain such an idea. During the meetings held, we were repeatedly told that there is considerable reluctance from Whitehall to engage with civil society. Significant doubt thus exists as to whether the UK government will want to put in place a formal mechanism that gives UK civil society the opportunity to engage with their EU counterparts whilst at the same time monitor any future EU-UK relationship. What is interesting however is that the political declaration appended to the Brexit withdrawal agreement contains a paragraph (para. 125) which states that \"the Parties (EU - UK) should encourage civil society dialogue\". Based on this paragraph 125, our mission is now to make a clear and structured contribution to the consolidation of the future EU- UK relationship and to assess options for doing so; \uf0b7 Civil society \u2013 the social partners and the many NGOs that represent a vast number of interests \u2013 is a key element of any modern democracy: \uf0de Civil society voices hands-on interests and concerns \uf0de It is where realistic, solution-orientated debates can take place \uf0de It can make pragmatic, consensus-based proposals \uf0b7 In order to be heard, this debate and these proposals need a structured, formal platform that is recognised by both parties. With this firmly in mind we have made representations to Michel Barnier to ensure that the EESC plays a key role in the functioning of any structured formal dialogue that takes place once (if) a formal agreement on the future relationship is reached between the EU and the UK. If a free trade agreement is put in place then a Domestic Advisory Group (DAG) could be envisaged, which would give us a formal role, albeit a limited one. We have in fact been clear in our discussions with Mr Barnier that we do not view the UK as just any third country and that any future relationship will have to be more intense and wider in scope than any of the current third country relationships that the EU has today. At this current moment, formal negotiations between the EU and the UK have not yet started and therefore it is still early days to predict how things will pan out. What is certain is that we will continue to engage with UK civil society and with the EU's chief negotiator to try to assist in any way possible with the achievement of a deal. We would hope to see a deal that reduces as much as possible the negative impacts of Brexit whilst providing us with a solid foundation on which to continue to build a meaningful future relationship whereby the priceless role of civil society can continue to come to the fore. \u00a9 S h u tt e r s t o c k / F G C ",
        "Phil Hogan, the EU Trade Commissioner, has warned that a \u201ccrash- out\u201d Brexit remains possible. Under the Withdrawal Agreement the deadline for these negotiations is 31 December 2020, very tight but already written into UK legislation. Any extension therefore would cause political problems. Both the UK and the EU have been setting out their initial negotiating positions, with strong rhetoric on both sides. The EU is insisting that, in return for tariff-free access to the single market, the UK must sign up to \u2018level playing field\u2019 commitments, in terms of social, environmental, taxation and state aid standards. As Commissioner Hogan has said, \u201cthe more (the UK) diverge away from the single market ... the more difficult it\u2019s going to be to have a free trade agreement\u201d. Against that, many leading UK politicians, not only Boris Johnson, stress that they do want to move away from EU standards and regulations, not least to underline that they can now do so. Brexit marks the biggest success for the hard right in British politics in living memory, now backed by the largest Conservative Parliamentary majority for 30 years, which followed the purge of many of the Party\u2019s more moderate MPs. Brexit is the culmination of an anti-EU campaign that started with the Maastricht Treaty some 30 years ago. Rather than British pragmatism, they want their \u201cpound of flesh\u201d. The UK wish for a limited trade deal would not be helpful to business and industry, or consumers, on either side. Ominously business leaders were not invited to Johnson\u2019s keynote speech setting out the UK negotiating guidelines. Johnson has repeated that he wants an agreement comparable to CETA, the EU \u2013 Canada Agreement, or perhaps \u201cCanada-plus\u201d. That would also be comparable to EU agreements with Japan and Korea: significant but not close. Joining the EEA, like Norway, or remaining in the Customs Union, like Turkey, are not options. The proposed border in the Irish Sea is not likely to disappear. CETA removes duties for 98% of goods traded between the EU and Canada. The key export of food is still restricted by quotas and phytosanitary (health) controls. Nor is it \u2018frictionless trade\u2019 \u2013 as it involves extra costs, paperwork and border checks. Whilst this would meet the \u201czero tariffs, zero quotas\u201d both sides seek, the EU also wants to ensure \u201czero dumping\u201d. Over services, CETA is much lighter. It does not cover so-called \u201cpassporting\u201d that UK financial firms are keen to retain to continue operating in the single market. This will undoubtedly become core to the negotiations. If the deal is to be ratified in time, there can only be four or five rounds of negotiations. Strategies for these will need to be well established. The alternative to a CETA type agreement threatens to be the \u201ccliff -edge\u201d, no-deal, hard Brexit, to avoid which so much effort was made last year. At least the threat to the Good Friday Agreement in Ireland has been reduced. Johnson refers to this as the \u201cAustralian\u201d option, being a fall-back to WTO rules. In that case the main tariffs will fall on food, ceramics and textiles. Some food tariffs are notably high (e.g. average EU diary tariffs are 44%), but most products would incur a tariff of roughly 10%. The 1994 GATT/WTO Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture being so thin, it scheduled negotiations to restart in 1999. This in turn led to the Doha Round, which has never been finalised. Although the Uruguay Round did reduce most other industrial tariffs to under 4%, even these can be very harmful where business margins are tight. Described by The Economist as a \u201cbrilliant opportunist\u201d, Johnson is nothing if not pragmatic. Strategic visionary or not, there are several other factors that he has to take into account. With a hard Brexit, the food, automotive, chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries would suffer most. Thanks to global supply chains, some 650,000 jobs in the UK are dependent on exports originating from EU Member States. Again the automotive industry is most notably affected. The jobs that could be most at risk are mainly in the towns in the north of England (40,000 jobs) and in the West Midlands (54,000 jobs): the same areas where the so-called Labour \u201cred wall\u201d voted Conservative in December. Jobs here have been hemorrhaging away over many years. This is where Johnson must show that he has effective answers. Then there is the \u2018gravity model\u2019 of trade, where trade is influenced by size and proximity of partners. Due to climate change and moves to a circular economy proximity will become ever more important. Why buy meat from New Zealand when it can be sourced nearby? The UK exports more to Ireland (5%) than to China (4%). Seven of the UK\u2019s top ten export markets are in the EU and, whilst the lure of the US (19%) is strong, UK exports to India, Brazil and Australia are notably low and will be difficult to grow. As my history teacher in Ireland used to point out, UK foreign policy is based on three core principles \u2013 trade, keep the Low Countries on side and prevent Europe uniting against it. So will British pragmatism win out in the end \u2013 and will the City prove to be more critical than fisheries? The UK departure from the EU at the end of January, described by the Irish Times as \u201cBritain\u2019s great leap backwards\u201d, marks only \u201cthe end of the beginning\u201d (to quote Churchill). The harder part of the Brexit negotiations \u2013 to agree the future trading relationship - lies ahead.

        "The first EU-Japan Joint Dialogue with Civil Society to discuss various aspects of the Trade and Sustainable Development Chapter of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) took place in Tokyo on 31 January 2020. The meeting was very successful, particularly taking into account that it was the first time for Japan to include such a wide range of civil society organisations in monitoring the implementation of trade and sustainable development aspects of the trade agreement. The meeting brought together the members of the EU Domestic Advisory Group (DAG) and the selected members of the Japanese Central Environmental Council and Labour Policy Council. The EU's DAG has 12 members including three from the EESC. Japan has yet to create its DAGs and has therefore included the members of the two existing advisory committees that unite civil society organisations, assigning experts based on their profile and the topics that would be discussed. The representatives of the EU's and Japan's civil society organisations exchanged views on Corporate Social Responsibility / Responsible Business Conduct (CSR / RBC), Japan's growth strategy: Society 5.0 for SDGs , trade and climate, the circular economy, commitment to a low carbon society and progress regarding the ratification of the core ILO conventions (particularly regarding ILC 111 \u2013 Prohibition of Discrimination in Employment and Occupation and ILC 105 on Abolition of Forced Labour ), as well as the latest ILO convention concerning the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work, and female participation in the labour market. The first civil society dialogue demonstrated clearly how the involvement of non-state organisations can add value to the discussions on trade and sustainable development. The involvement of civil society organisations does not only facilitate the implementation of sustainable development principles but also strengthens the dialogue between our two societies. The next joint dialogue for civil society is to take place within 12 months in Brussels. This followed the regular visit to Japan by the EESC EU-Japan Follow-Up Committee on 27-29 January. This was full of productive and interesting meetings with both our long-term Japanese partner organisations, such as the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren), the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (JTUC- RENGO), COOP and the European Business Council in Japan (EBC), as well as the Tokyo offices of various international organisations, such as the ILO and the OECD. We managed to gain some new valuable contacts by meeting the Japan Women's Innovative Network (J-Win) and the representatives of the social action platform Social Innovation Japan. On our visit, we discussed the impacts of the EU-Japan EPA, debated the ratification of the core ILO conventions and talked about women's participation in the labour market, economics and politics. In addition, we organised a round table debate on introducing the ambitious European Green Deal, while also highlighting the potential of the circular economy to create new economic activities and jobs. We also had an opportunity to learn from each other's best practices related to the circular economy, including the contribution of NPOs/NGOs and businesses. We found out how the Tokyo Olympics 2020 are aiming to be the most sustainable Olympics ever. The Olympic medals will be made from recycled electronic waste, the podiums from plastic waste, including marine plastic, and beds from recycled cardboard. The Olympics' Podium Project is an excellent example of raising awareness of the global issue of plastic waste, while also promoting the benefits of recycling and the circular economy. What else did we learn? Just like in the EU, the biggest challenge for Japanese businesses is the shortage of workers and necessary skills caused by an ageing and declining population. In addition, businesses need to cope with digital transformation and the transition to a low carbon society. To alleviate the shortage of workers, businesses have started to get more women involved in the labour market and some sectors have also turned to foreign labour (\"guest workers\"). As for climate and energy policies, like some EU Member States, Japan continues to be heavily dependent on coal. After the Fukushima disaster, there was a huge drop in nuclear energy and although Japan has tried to compensate for it with hydro, wind and biomass energy, its energy mix is still largely centred around coal and LNG. Europe's ambitious Green Deal raises questions not only in Europe but also among Japanese businesses (carbon tax, for instance), plus the goals of the Green Deal are understood to require huge investments. At the same time, the fact that both the EU and Japan are technologically highly advanced countries that have well- established funding instruments for research and innovation means that Japan and the EU have a great opportunity to jointly develop innovative, green, energy efficient technologies and energy storing solutions. Japanese employment and wage policies are very traditional. The mandatory pension age in the country is still 60. The remuneration system tends to reward the length of service rather than skills and ",

The Order of the Rising Sun is the highest Japanese Orders for civil and military merits awarded to foreign nationals. employee contribution. The longer you have worked for the company, the higher your pay. The majority of businesses hire employees en masse once a year straight after university graduations. Japanese business leaders are realising that such inflexible recruitment and wage policies in a fast-paced digital economy have a hindering effect on the companies' innovation and competitiveness. Japanese women are highly educated. Thanks to Prime Minister Abe's \" Womenomics \" programme the employment rate among women has increased, but women's situation in the labour market has not improved that much. Many women still work on temporary contracts, which means lower pay and missing out on training and promotions. Based on the OECD statistics, the employment rate of women in Japan (68% of the 15-64 population) is above the OECD average of 60%. These figures, however, are not reflected in the number of women in leadership positions and politics. In terms of the Global Gender Pay Gap Index, which measures gender equality in each country, Japan ranked 121st out of 153 countries in 2019. (World Economic Forum) New opportunities The EU-Japan EPA is the biggest trade deal concluded for either side to date. It jointly accounts for almost a third of global GDP and 40% of global trade. It has already been in place for more than a year (it entered into force on 1 February 2019). Within this time, the EU's exports to Japan have increased by 6.6% (agri-food sector: 20.8% increase, industrial goods: 7% increase) and Japan's exports to Europe grew by 6.3%. The entry into force of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA), the signing of the EU-Japan Connectivity Partnership, plus the adoption of the EU's Research and Innovation programme \u2013 Horizon Europe and the Japanese Moonshot programme, together with the Erasmus + programme \u2013 all open up a whole range of new cooperation opportunities for businesses and universities for both sides and will have both a major and a positive impact on our innovation capacities.

        "area; it is perceived as a long-term opportunity but will entail huge financial costs in the short and medium term. It can be seen as a fundamental parameter for the implementation of necessary structural reforms. A symbiosis of the European Green Deal and structural reforms can significantly strengthen the conditions for long-term sustainable economic growth and eliminate negative social and environmental externalities along with certain other market failures. These reforms are particularly important for those Member States whose growth potential is well below the euro area average. Only robust investments targeting productive sectors will enable them to bridge this gap in the coming decade. 2020 will most likely be a turning point, with a shift in the economic paradigm leading to the integration of environmental criteria that will form part of market decision-making. This will have far-reaching consequences far beyond 2020. The European Green Deal is seen as an opportunity to respond to the challenges and needs that have arisen; its implementation will be an important test as to whether the interests of euro area members and the EU as a whole are coherent. In that regard, each Member State must not only defend its own needs, but also respect the needs of the other Member States and seek a common position that will benefit everyone. Meeting the European Green Deal goals will necessitate a healthy injection of funding, not all of which has yet been secured. National public and private resources will have to be enlisted and the mechanism provided for these to be allocated to meet the Green Deal goals. About the author: Petr Zahradn\u00edk Member of the Employers\u2019 Group Czech Chamber of Commerce The current economic viewpoint shows that the performance of the euro area's economy is slowing down, unemployment has ceased to decline and, despite the weakening economy, inflation has increased slightly (although it is still well under control). Although the euro area is still in a period of economic growth, this is starting to flag. It is crucial to bear in mind that without adequate and sustainable investment the euro area risks entering into a longer period of low potential growth and productivity, low wages, growing inequalities and unpredictable inflation. The outlook for 2020 is associated with a higher incidence of risk factors and the resulting uncertainties. These risks may result in a longer period of weak growth and rising inflation over the coming years, unless there is a strong upturn in investment, especially in high-productivity sectors in which the euro area and the EU can compete globally. There has been a moderate increase in real wages, which has led to a rise in living standards and an increase in private consumption. The large current account surplus has decreased and the gap between the deficit and surplus Member States has narrowed slightly. However, the euro area's current account is primarily influenced by weakening external demand. An important marker of economic development is the enduring geographical disparity and differences within the EU, which remain despite some relatively successful convergence over the past few years. The asymmetries in the euro area's economic development remain a challenge, caused by both the profound effects of the earlier economic crisis and the diversity of structural problems in individual Member State economies, which prevent the economic potential in each Member State from being fully harnessed. These asymmetries also lead to serious social consequences, in particular persistent poverty and social exclusion. Convergence within the euro area and throughout the EU over the recent period has been relatively satisfactory, with high economic growth demonstrated mainly by less economically developed countries, leading to a very partial reduction of the differences between these countries and the EU average. At the same time, the most successful countries from central, eastern and south- eastern Europe have overtaken or are catching up with some of the more traditional EU economies, and this process is likely to continue in the coming decade. The situation, stability and functioning of the financial sector in the euro area have improved considerably since the crisis, yet risks persist and there are still areas that do not enjoy full health, particularly in the case of certain national financial systems. The European Green Deal represents a fundamentally new element, including for the short-term economic future of the euro \u00a9 S h u tt e r s t o c k / D a n t e B u s q u e t s ",

In order to achieve this goal, there is a significant need for investment that can only be provided by a combination of the public and private sectors. The transition can be successful if it has an inclusive and flexible approach that includes all technologies that can reduce emissions. As the Member States and regions are not all starting from the same position, a \"just transition\" should ensure that no sector or technology is left behind if they have a positive impact and contribute to EU targets. This is why we have chosen this very topic for a constructive discussion to be held in March with the Members of the European Economic and Social Committee's Employers' Group, and representatives of the Croatian government and of Croatia's business and civil sectors. The European Green Deal focuses on decarbonising the energy sector but also requires the mobilisation of industry and the transformation of its value chains. Green and digital transformation brings additional challenges to industry, and is challenging to Croatian business. Our industry therefore needs fair conditions in the global market and the EU must continue to shape international standards, in line with the EU's climate ambitions. A Green Deal creates opportunities for our companies, and develops new markets, while creating new quality jobs, thus contributing to a social Europe. The CEA and the UN Global Compact member companies \u2013 some of which will be at the March seminar in Split discussing how they have integrated sustainable development goals into their business strategies, and what activities they are undertaking to ensure competitiveness and market growth \u2013 will position themselves, we believe, as leaders of this transition in this part of Europe. By working with members to achieve corporate sustainability and through partnership with the government and trade unions, the Croatian Employers Association is continuously working to improve business conditions and create an environment that will enhance the competitiveness of our companies in the international and global markets. In addition, there is the important role to be played by the Croatian government, and also by European policy-makers, which need to provide fertile ground and conditions for effective transformation, especially when talking about transforming the EU's economy for a sustainable future. The March seminar and the discussion on the European Green Deal and its importance for the European business community will certainly contribute to opening up further dialogue with all stakeholders and, hopefully, forge closer cooperation towards fulfilling Europe's ambition to be the first climate-neutral continent. The current climate challenges we are witnessing on daily basis require action and major transformations, or at least adaptations, by the business sector. The consequences of climate change can only be reduced if key corporate and other stakeholders embrace the resources and technology already available to them, and \u2013 through cooperation and the reallocation of resources, financial and human, including investments in community resilience and adaptation \u2013 work together to reduce the risks related to climate change.
