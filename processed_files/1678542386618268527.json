It is expected that the programme will lead to high absorption rates of the SCF for energy efficiency in SMEs. Croatia Consumer Information - Energy efficiency information campaign - Croatia Consumer Information (CT6) The interest in energy efficiency has significantly increased as well as implementation of EE measures by citizens. Public opinion surveys have revealed the following: \u2022 number of citizens familiar with energy efficient products available on the market has increased from 33,4% to 43,9% \u2022 number of citizens using CFLs increased from 48% to 67,4% \u2022 number of citizens using A+ appliances increased from 22% to 30,8% \u2022 number of citizens using low-e windows increased from 14,8% to 23,4% In addition, the number of requests for subsidies from the Fund has increased significantly since the start of the campaign. Croatia IPMVP obligation for public energy performance contracts - Croatia Energy Services (CT5) On-going It is expected that Measurement & Verification based on IPMVP in the public sector will enable better evaluation of expected and achieved savings and eventually increase the trust in energy services, which could become the solution for large-scale refurbishment of the public buildings in stock Czech Republic Energy audits - Czech Republic Energy Services There are more than 350 energy auditors and more than 1 500 energy audits are prepared ",

Finland Study of Cost Effectiveness of Individual Heat Meters and Heat Cost Allocators in Apartment Buildings - Finland Metering and Billing (CT3) The most important outcome about the project was to get reliable facts and results about the cost effectiveness of heat meters or heat cost allocators in apartments in Finland. The topic i.e. heat metering in apartments, is not new in Finland but it has been under discussion and judgment for decades. The heat meters or cost allocators have faced mistrust and critics for many reasons (listed e.g. in the statement of Technical Board of Helsinki City 1.4.2008) though cost effectiveness have not been lately studied in deep details like in this study. Now the study, that was focusing clearly to the direct costs, shows the heat meters and cost allocators in apartments not to be cost effective in the Finnish circumstances (taking into account the state of energy efficiency, typical HVAC solutions in apartment buildings and ",

The study will give a clear indication to the authorities when formulating the energy efficiency law for implementing EED. France Writing the French 2014 NEEAP - France NEEAPs (CT1) \u2022 The key achievement is the NEEAP itself, and the comprehensive overview it gives about our energy efficiency policies. The evaluations in the NEEAP (especially TD calculations using EC recommended methods) are also very helpful to identify sectors generating most energy savings, and sectors where more efforts are needed. \u2022 The NEEAP is a very useful communication tool for us. After its publication in spring 2014, we will update a synthesis brochure, with the communication team of the ministry, like we did after our 2nd NEEAP.

To date businesses participating in the programme have shared savings in excess of EUR 50 million The key opportunities for energy savings among many participants are in the following areas. Many of these can be implemented at relatively low cost: \u2022 Energy management practices \u2013 becoming more organised about understanding & monitoring energy performance and taking action to exploit opportunities for savings. \u2022 Lighting \u2013 switching off, changing to more efficient fittings, daylight & occupancy sensors, e.g. 16% electricity saving (EUR 4,700 saving per annum) in a school by replacing light fittings; \u2022 Refrigeration, heating, ventilation & air conditioning \u2013 designing, procuring, operating, maintaining & controlling these systems more efficiently, e.g. refrigeration can account for up to 65% of consumption in the retail sector. Range of Savings Although the average annual energy saving attributable to participation in the programme is over 11%, the range of savings enjoyed by specific participants varies significantly: \u2022 82% of participants save at least 5%; \u2022 Over half make at least 10% savings; \u2022 Nearly a third saves more than 15%.

Citizens are more active in making contact with them than SME\u2019s. The local advisors are, together with the regional agencies and supported with national training programmes, developing strategies and schemes to actively reach SME\u2019s. Recently, a survey has been conducted, where individuals who were given energy advice via telephone during 2008 and 2009 were interviewed twice, one and two years respectively after the advice was given. The survey showed that 78% of the interviewees had taken action to save energy (behaviour change and investment). 39% of these had made a change of their heating system, among other actions. The single most important source of information for these people in influencing their decisions was the municipal energy and climate advisor (26%). ",
