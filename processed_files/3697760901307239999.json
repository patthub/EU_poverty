        "3 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Foreword F oreword In response to the demographic challenge which all EU Member States are facing, the European Union has designated 2012 as the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations. Active ageing is defined by the World Health Organisation as the process of optimising opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age. Eurostat is marking the European Year 2012 by presenting in this book statistics on topics related to Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, such as demography, healthcare, pensions, volunteering and adult learning. This publication has been produced in collaboration with the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and Eurofound, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. I hope that you will find information of interest both for your work and for your daily life. I wish you an enjoyable reading experience!

        "7 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Introduction I ntrod u ction A n ageing pop ul ation: iss u es and cha ll enges The European Union\u2019s (EU\u2019s) population structure is changing and becoming progressively older \u2013 there were slightly more than 87 million persons aged 65 and over on 1 January 2010 in the EU-27, some 17.4 % of the total population. These latest figures can be compared with data from 1 January 1985, when there were 59.3 million persons aged 65 and over in the EU-27 (12.8 % of the total population). A steady increase in life expectancy across the EU during the last century led to increased longevity, while in more recent decades \u2013 from the 1970s onwards \u2013 the EU has experienced falling fertility rates. These two developments impact upon demographic ageing, a process that has become established in the EU in the last 30 or 40 years and which is expected, by many, to become further entrenched during the next half century, as the absolute number and the relative importance of the population of older persons continues to grow. These demographic changes will lead to significant challenges for families and individuals \u2013 for example, it could become commonplace for people to move into retirement while still having one or both of their parents alive. These profound changes present a key challenge to society, with the ageing of the population having serious implications for public policies and budgets. At the current moment in time, there are severe constraints on fiscal policies and a strong need for fiscal consolidation over a number of years in the EU, aggravating adverse budgetary developments arising from ageing. At the same time, changes in the demographic profile of the EU will also impact on labour and product markets, families and individuals. In order to tackle the challenges posed by population ageing, a long-term view seems necessary, well beyond the horizon of electoral cycles. Many of the challenges that arise from population ageing are universal and include: (cid:116)(cid:1) pressure on public budgets and fiscal systems; (cid:116)(cid:1) strains on pension and social security systems; (cid:116)(cid:1) adjusting the economy and in particular workplaces to an ageing labour force; (cid:116)(cid:1) possible labour market shortages as the number of working age persons decreases; (cid:116)(cid:1) the likely need for increased numbers of trained healthcare professionals; (cid:116)(cid:1) higher demand for healthcare services and long-term (institutionalised) care; (cid:116)(cid:1) potential conflict between generations over the distribution of resources.

        "8 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Introduction While many older Europeans lead active, healthy and participative lives well beyond their retirement into what is often referred to as the \u2018third age\u2019, others are faced with problems, such as poverty, illness or disability, that can potentially confine or restrict their lifestyles. Various measures seek to address these challenges, including efforts to: (cid:116)(cid:1) promote the active participation of older persons; for example, the European Commission\u2019s 2011 annual growth survey recalled that pension ages should be increased and linked to life expectancy, while early retirement schemes should be reduced; (cid:116)(cid:1) provide accessible and effective healthcare services that promote early detection of diseases and help older people to maintain their health and capacity to live independently, while ensuring that healthcare spending remains under control; (cid:116)(cid:1) ensure that older persons have adequate incomes generally through pensions systems and support mechanisms that seek to reduce the proportion of older persons that are at-risk- of-poverty. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion has noted that \u2018the key to tackling the challenges of an increasing proportion of older people in our societies is \u201cactive aging\u201d: encouraging older people to remain active by working longer and retiring later, by engaging in volunteer work after retirement, and by leading healthy and autonomous lives.\u2019 Active ageing is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as \u2018the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age\u2019. The definition therefore includes the notion of extending the activity of older persons, both: (cid:116)(cid:1) within the labour force, through delaying their retirement, and; (cid:116)(cid:1) within society, through participation in a range of social, economic, civic or cultural activities. Within this context, it is perhaps revealing to look beyond basic measures of demographic change, such as the rising proportion of older persons in the total population or gains in life expectancy and to supplement this with a focus on indicators that measure the propensity of older people to continue in work, to participate in society and to lead an active retirement with a high quality of life \u2013 this is the goal of this publication which seeks to celebrate the increasingly important role that older persons will occupy in society in the coming decades, through a portrayal of their lifestyles.

        "9 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Introduction Eu ropean Y ear for A cti v e A geing and So l idarity between G enerations The European Union designated 2012 as the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations on 23 September 2011 ( 1 ). This initiative aims to: (cid:116)(cid:1) help create better job opportunities and working conditions for the growing numbers of older people in Europe; (cid:116)(cid:1) help them play an active role in society, and; (cid:116)(cid:1) encourage healthy ageing and independent living. One of the main goals of the European Year 2012 is to reverse the idea that older persons are a burden on society. As Europeans live longer and healthier lives, governments are looking for ways to involve older persons more in society and to keep them active; these changes could result in economic benefits for society as a whole, while at the same time promoting the physical, mental, and social well-being of older members of society. The demographic changes that are likely to be experienced across the EU in the coming decades also present an opportunity for the development of new products and services that are geared to the needs of older people. There is the potential for a wide range of new technologies to be developed that could allow older people to stay autonomous and live longer in their own homes, to transform the delivery of care, or to personalise services in response to patients\u2019 needs. The European Year 2012 is designed to raise awareness of these issues, identify and publicise good practices, while encouraging policymakers and stakeholders (at all levels of governance) to promote active ageing. Without further institutional and policy changes, demographic change could potentially impinge on inter-generational solidarity, as working populations are increasingly asked to pay for the needs of an expanding group of older persons. A cti v e ageing po l icies in the Eu ropean U nion The EU has recognised the importance of the ageing challenge for many years and has developed policy in several areas. The Stockholm European Council meeting in 2001 laid the groundwork for a strategy to cope with the principal economic and budgetary challenges linked to an ageing population ( 2 ), namely to encourage Member States to: (cid:116)(cid:1) reduce debt at a fast pace; (cid:116)(cid:1) raise employment rates and productivity, and; (cid:116)(cid:1) reform pensions, healthcare and long-term care systems.

        "10 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Introduction At an informal summit held at Hampton Court in 2005, heads of state and of government recognised that demographic ageing would be one of the main challenges the EU will have to face in the years to come. As a result, in October 2006, the European Commission presented its views on demographic challenges that would need to be faced in a Communication titled \u2018The demographic future of Europe \u2013 from challenge to opportunity\u2019 ( 3 ). It identified five policy responses through which Member States could respond to demographic change and make population ageing manageable, promoting: (cid:116)(cid:1) demographic renewal through better support for families; (cid:116)(cid:1) employment \u2013 especially through more jobs and longer working lives of better quality; (cid:116)(cid:1) a more productive and competitive Europe; (cid:116)(cid:1) the receiving and integrating of immigrants in Europe; (cid:116)(cid:1) sustainable public finances in Europe \u2013 guaranteeing adequate social security and equity between generations. On 29 April 2009, the European Commission issued a Communication on dealing with the impact of an ageing population in the EU ( 4 ). It presented age-related expenditure projections in the light of the financial and economic crisis. It stressed the need to introduce further reforms to counter ageing-induced budgetary costs in the future, notably for pension and healthcare spending programmes and encouraging people to stay in the labour market rather than retire early. Active ageing features as part of the flagship policy \u2013 Europe 2020 \u2013 a strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as announced on 3 March 2010 ( 5 ). This growth strategy for the coming decade stressed the \u2018importance of the European Union\u2019s ability to meet the challenge of promoting a healthy and active ageing population to allow for social cohesion and higher productivity\u2019. Indeed, one of the five headline Europe 2020 indicators is to reach an EU-27 employment rate of 75 % for those aged 20-64 by 2020. If this target is to be achieved then a higher proportion of the population needs to remain in employment up to a later age. This will be particularly important given, that as of 2012, the size of the working age population in the EU is projected to start shrinking. The European Employment Strategy (EES) has a range of actions and guidelines targeted at older people, including measures calling for improved (occupational) health status and incentives to remain in work and discourage early retirement. The guidelines also promote social protection systems that are based on financial sustainability, so as to support participation and retention within the labour market and longer working lives.

        "11 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Introduction Employment policy also seeks to improve human capital through better education and skills. As such, efficient lifelong learning strategies including workplace training may enhance the prospects of older workers to remain in the workforce. Indeed, the EU\u2019s employment strategy seeks to establish a lifecycle approach, putting in place conditions that allow people to prolong their working lives, such that employment rates for older workers and average exit ages are raised. The European Social Fund (ESF) has, since 1957, helped millions of Europeans to get (better) jobs and acquire skills for work. It is one of the EU\u2019s structural funds, which was set-up to reduce differences in the prosperity and living standards that are experienced between Member States and regions of the EU. On 6 October 2011, the European Commission proposed a new set of rules relating to how the ESF might work during the period 2014 to 2020 ( 6 ). The goals of the ESF during this programming period \u2013 namely, to improve employment opportunities, promote education and lifelong learning, enhance social inclusion and contribute to combating poverty \u2013 are closely aligned with the Europe 2020 initiative. In order to achieve these goals, greater emphasis will be placed, among others, on promoting active and healthy ageing and supporting the most disadvantaged groups and marginalised communities. The open method of coordination (OMC) on social protection and social inclusion is a framework for political cooperation which aims to spread best practices and achieve convergence towards the EU\u2019s main goals, including among others: to combat poverty and social exclusion, reform welfare systems and tackle the challenges posed by demographic change. On 7 July 2010, the European Commission launched a debate on the future provision of pensions through a green paper, titled \u2018Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems\u2019 ( 7 ). This aimed to stimulate a debate in relation to: (cid:116)(cid:1) achieving the right balance between work and retirement, facilitating a longer active life; (cid:116)(cid:1) reforming pension systems, which is one of ten actions identified as part of the annual growth survey (part of the monitoring process for the Europe 2020 strategy); (cid:116)(cid:1) making pensions safer in the wake of the recent economic crisis; (cid:116)(cid:1) ensuring adequate incomes in retirement and making sure pension systems are sustainable in the long-term; (cid:116)(cid:1) making sure pensions are more transparent so that people can take informed decisions about their own retirement income.

        "12 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Introduction Active ageing, both in employment and after retirement, will only happen if people age in good health. The Innovation Union is one of seven flagship policies revealed in October 2010 as part of the broader Europe 2020 strategy. European innovation partnerships (EIPs) form part of the Innovation Union and are designed to provide a framework to bring together all relevant stakeholders across policies, across sectors and across borders to speed up innovations that address a major societal challenge, and gain competitive advantages for growth and job creation in Europe. The first EIP was announced on 4 February 2011 as a joint initiative between Neelie Kroes, Commission Vice-president for the Digital Agenda and John Dalli, Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy and is a partnership for active and healthy ageing. It has three main objectives, namely to: (cid:116)(cid:1) enable EU citizens to lead healthy, active and independent lives while ageing; (cid:116)(cid:1) improve the sustainability and efficiency of social and healthcare systems; (cid:116)(cid:1) boost the competitiveness and markets for innovative products and services that respond to the ageing challenge. The partnership for active and healthy ageing is focused on prevention and health promotion, integrated care as well as active and independent living for older persons. Its overarching target is to increase by two years the average number of healthy life years at birth within the EU-27 population by 2020. Statistics on ageing and the str u ct u re of this p u b l ication Most people tend to associate the term \u2018old\u2019 with the generation(s) before their own, or they choose to use this adjective as a relative term to categorise a particular subset of the population \u2013 for example, older students, older workers, or older pensioners. A Eurobarometer survey (Special Eurobarometer No. 378) conducted in September and October 2011 asked interviewees (aged 15 and above within the EU-27) at what age people can be considered \u2018old\u2019 \u2013 the average of the answers given was 63.9 years. Only one in six (16 %) of the persons interviewed described themselves as being \u2018old\u2019. In a similar vein, there is no recognised statistical definition of \u2018old\u2019 or \u2018older\u2019 upon which to base the analysis presented within this publication. Rather, the picture of ageing across the EU is complicated by issues, such as: (cid:116)(cid:1) administrative differences: for example, a variety of retirement ages across the EU; (cid:116)(cid:1) demographic differences: for example, different observed patterns in life expectancy between countries; (cid:116)(cid:1) subjective variations: for example, differences of opinion with respect to the quality of life experienced by older persons. ",
        "13 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Introduction Most statistics do not concern the process of ageing, per se, but rather they may be analysed by age classes, thereby showing differences between younger and older people. The age classes that are used can vary from one statistical survey to another, and it is common for the boundaries between the young, middle-aged, and older populations to be further blurred by this lack of consistency. Nevertheless, a wide range of statistical domains do provide data analysed by age classes. Official statistics can provide long time-series for a range of basic demographic events, as well as more detailed information in areas such as the labour force, health, education or the information society. This publication is divided into six chapters that draw on a wide selection of official statistics; supplemented by opinion surveys and other sources. Most of the data were extracted from Eurostat\u2019s online database that may be accessed at the following address: http://ec.europa.eu/ eurostat. The first chapter provides details in relation to population ageing: setting the scene as regards the dynamics of demographic change, detailing the past, present and (projected) future structure of the EU\u2019s population. The remaining chapters depict different stages and generations, as people move from the age groups in which employment is common (see Chapter 2) towards retirement and receiving a pension (see Chapter 3). One of the main concerns of many older persons is the increased possibility of becoming sick or frail in older age: Chapter 4 presents information in relation to the demand for healthcare services, as well as the budgetary implications facing governments as their populations continue to age. Once retired the spending patterns of older persons often change, both in terms of their levels of spending, as well as the types of goods and services that they purchase; the consumption patterns of the \u2018silver economy\u2019 are covered as part of Chapter 5, alongside aspects such as housing and living conditions. The publication closes with information relating to the active participation of older generations within society, with a particular focus on inter-generational issues; it also includes information on the leisure pursuits and social activities undertaken by older persons (see Chapter 6).

        "15 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 D emographics Ageing is a process which no individual can escape. However, the impact of ageing can vary depending not only on genetic factors but also reflecting a range of characteristics, such as profession, income, lifestyle or quality of life. Viewed from a societal perspective, the structure of the population can deviate considerably between countries, as a result of the interaction of demographic events \u2013 such as fertility rates or migration rates \u2013 and other factors, such as lifestyle choices or the provision and efficiency of healthcare services. The EU\u2019s current population structure is characterised by a particularly high number of people who were born in the two decades following the end of the Second World War, although when this increase in births took place varies greatly between Member States; this generation is often referred to as the baby-boom generation and comprises the population cohorts that were born between the mid-late 1940s and the late 1960s. The first of the baby-boom cohorts have now entered retirement. Eurostat population projections foresee that the number of people aged over 60 years will increase by about two million persons per annum in the coming decades, while the working age population will start to shrink (as a result of lower fertility rates among post baby- boom generations). This will result in an increasing number of very old persons (aged 80 or over) and fewer young persons to care for them (family members or healthcare professionals). This chapter begins by providing a range of demographic indicators that depict the current structure of the EU\u2019s population. These include a set of demographic dependency ratios, which measure the potential level of support received by young (aged 0 to 14) and old people (aged over 65) from the population of working age (conventionally considered as those aged from 15 to 64). Concerns have been expressed that accelerated ageing across the EU could lead to older generations becoming too heavy a burden on younger, working age people. While the focus of this chapter is restricted to demographic aspects of ageing, it is interesting to consider that economic dependency ratios (as opposed to demographic dependency ratios) may have a greater relevance in the current economic climate, given they focus on comparing the population actually in work with the number of dependents (hence, not just the elderly, but also those who are underemployed, unemployed or inactive). Economic dependency ratios therefore provide greater clarity with respect to the relative burden that is faced by those in employment. ",
        "16 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 1 Demographics 1 . 1 T he pop ul ation of o l der peop l e in the Eu ropean U nion The median age divides the age distribution of the whole population into two equal parts, with 50 % of persons below the median age and the other 50 % above. The EU-27 median age on 1 January 2010 was estimated at 40.9 years.

Among the EU Member States, Sweden reported the highest median age as of 1 January 1960 at 36.0 years. In the mid-1990\u2019s its position was supplanted by Italy (38.5 years in 1995), which in turn was overtaken by Germany a decade later (41.8 in 2005, rising to 44.2 in 2010). ",
        "18 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 1 Demographics The EU, in common with most other regions of the world, is undergoing a significant change in its population structure. Europeans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before and this pattern is expected to continue on the back of continued medical breakthroughs and improved standards of living (see Section 1.3 for more details of population projections). The EU-27 population stood at an estimated 501.1 million persons on the 1 January 2010; of these some 87.1 million were aged 65 or over (see Table 1.2). As well as being two of the largest Member States in terms of absolute population numbers, Germany and Italy are also characterised as having relatively old populations.

        "19 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 1 Demographics Women tend to live longer than men. As a result, the ratio of women compared with men increased from 1.1 for those aged 50 to 64, to 1.2 among those aged 65 to 79, before reaching 1.9 for the very old (those aged 80 or more). There were 12 countries where the number of very old women was at least twice as high as the number of very old men, this ratio rising to around three times as many very old women as very old men in the Baltic Member States. There was a considerable increase in the proportion of persons aged 65 or over during the 20 year period from 1990 to 2010 (see Figure 1.1). Within the EU-27, the share of persons aged 65 or over in the total population rose by 3.7 percentage points during the period under consideration to reach 17.4 %. There was particularly rapid growth in Slovenia, Germany, Italy, the Baltic Member States and Greece, as the share of those aged 65 or over in the total population increased by at least five percentage points. At the other end of the range, the share of this group of the population rose by less than one percentage point in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and Sweden, while Ireland was the only Member State to report a falling share of persons aged 65 or over in the total population (albeit by just 0.1 percentage points). Although there were far more elderly women than men, Figure 1.2 shows that the number of elderly men was growing at a faster pace during the period from 1990 to 2010 \u2013 and as such some of the gender difference was redressed. The parent support ratio (defined as the number of persons aged 85 or over per 100 persons aged 50 to 64 years old) may be used to assess the demands on families to provide support for their eldest members. Indeed, it will become increasingly common for people in their fifties and sixties to have surviving parents. This ratio stood at 11.0 for the EU-27 on 1 January 2010, peaking in Sweden, Italy and France (all at least 13.0).

The world\u2019s population grew, on average, by 1.3 % per annum during the period from 1990 to 2010. The highest growth was recorded in Africa (2.4 % per annum), while the slowest rate of population growth was registered in Europe (0.1 % per annum). Demographic ageing is not confined to Europe as each of the continents reported some increase in longevity. The on-going ageing process is most pronounced in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania; in contrast, the relative importance of older generations in the total population remains relatively unchanged in North America and in Africa. According to the United Nations, the share of those aged 65 or more in the total population increased by 1.4 percentage points between 1990 and 2010. Among the countries presented in Figure 1.3, Japan was the most rapidly ageing. While both the EU-27 (13.7 %) and the United States (13.7 %) had recorded a higher proportion of persons aged 65 or over in their respective populations in 1990 than was the case in Japan (11.9 %), the share of this sub-group of the population almost doubled in Japan over the next two decades, such that persons aged 65 or over accounted for 22.7 % of the Japanese population by 2010 \u2013 considerably higher than the latest figures for the EU-27 (17.4 %) or the United States (13.1 %). Demographic ageing was a fairly slow process in the United States, in part due to a total fertility rate that was much higher than in most other developed economies. ",

The latest information available for 2010 shows that there were relatively few very old persons (aged 80 or over) living in the emerging economies \u2013 indeed, the 23.3 million very old persons living in the EU-27 could be contrasted with the corresponding populations in China (18.2 million), India (8.2 million), or Brazil (2.9 million). The regions with the highest proportion of persons aged 65 or over as of 1 January 2009 tended to be either metropolitan regions in Germany (usually cities in the north east of the country, formerly characterised by traditional, heavy industries within the former East Germany) or rural regions predominantly in southern Europe (for example, parts of Italy, Greece, Portugal or Spain), where patterns of economic migration have often witnessed large numbers of the younger generations migrating in search of work. Liguria, Toscana, Friuli-Venezia and Umbria (Italy), Chemnitz, Dresden, Sachsen-Anhalt and Leipzig (Germany), as well as Alentejo (Portugal) and the Peloponnisos (Greece) recorded the highest proportions of persons aged 65 or over in their respective populations at the start of 2009. At the other end of the range, the regions with the lowest proportion of persons aged 65 or over tended to be either urban areas or islands \u2013 for example, the urban regions of the \u00cele de France (France), Flevoland and Utrecht (the Netherlands), Inner and Outer London, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester (the United Kingdom), or the islands of Guyane and R\u00e9union (France), A\u00e7ores and Madeira (Portugal) and Ceuta or Melilla (Spain).

Indeed, the only exceptions were in Sweden (three regions, including Stockholm), as well as the capital cities of Wien (Austria) and the R\u00e9gion de Bruxelles-Capitale/ Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest (Belgium). At the other end of the range, the pace at which the population of persons aged 65 or over was growing was most pronounced across Italian regions \u2013 including Sardegna, Basilicata, Puglia, Liguria, Lazio, Piemonte, and Lombardia. The urban audit survey provides information on the population structure for more than 500 European cities in 2008.

In the 1960s the overwhelming share of EU-27 population growth could be attributed to natural change, as the number of births considerably outweighed the number of deaths. However, the relatively high fertility rates that were experienced in the post-war decades slowly came to an end, while life expectancy increased \u2013 such that by the end of the 1990s there was almost no net effect from natural change, as the number of births and deaths were almost balanced. From the mid-2000s onwards there was some evidence to suggest that fertility rates were starting to climb again in several of the EU Member States, and that as a result natural change in the EU-27 had also started to increase somewhat. Immigration policy has the potential to play an important role in filling labour market shortages, although the integration of immigrants may pose a challenge to social cohesion. Net migration figures generally fluctuate more from one year to the next than natural changes. During the period from 1960 to the mid-1980s, the overall effect of net migration on total population change was limited. From this date onwards there was an increase in net migration, peaking in the period from 2003 to 2007 when migration contributed an average of almost two million persons per annum to the EU-27\u2019s total population change. The last couple of years have seen net migration figures fall somewhat, such that migrants contributed an additional 875 500 persons to the EU-27\u2019s population in 2009. ",

S ource : Eu rostat ( on l ine data code: demo _ gind) Figure 1.5 provides further information on fertility indicators for the period from 1961 to 2010. There were 7.5 million new born children in the EU-27 in 1961, which was 2.2 million higher than the corresponding figure at the end of the period under consideration. The number of live births in the EU-27 fell briefly below 5 million in 2002, before recovering slightly to 5.4 million by 2010. As such, demographic changes take time to become apparent, as witnessed by the relatively large cohorts of baby-boomers progressively moving up the EU\u2019s population pyramid towards older age, leading to a top-heavy population pyramid (see Figure 1.7 later in this section). The crude birth rate is closely linked to the number of live births. However, it also reflects other population changes through its denominator, as this indicator presents the number of live births per 1 000 inhabitants. The EU-27 crude birth rate fell at a rapid pace from its highs at the start of the 1960s, with its most significant reductions being recorded in the 1960s and 1970s. While the birth rate continued to fall during the 1980s and 1990s, the reductions were of a lower magnitude. The crude birth rate reached its lowest level in 2003 (10.3 births per 1 000 inhabitants), after which there was a slight recovery (10.7 births per 1 000 inhabitants in 2010). Ireland, followed by the United Kingdom and France reported the highest crude birth rates among the EU Member States in 2010. Among the Member States, France and the United Kingdom recorded the highest number of live births in 2010, each accounting for slightly more than 15 % of the total number of births in the EU-27, as both countries passed 800 000 new births in the year. In contrast, Germany recorded some 678 000 live births in 2010, equivalent to 12.7 % of the EU-27 total: this figure may be compared with the German share of total EU-27 population which was 16.3 % in 2010. While the overall number of live births in any given country is, at least in part, linked to the number of women of childbearing age, it is also affected by issues linked to the ability or willingness of the population to raise children. The total fertility rate measures the mean number of live births that would be born to a woman during her lifetime if she were to pass ",

The fertility rate for the EU-27 stood at 1.6 in 2008 \u2013 among the lowest in the world. It is widely agreed that a replacement rate of around 2.1 is required \u2013 disregarding the potential effects of migration \u2013 to maintain the size of a population in developed world countries. One of the underlying reasons for the EU\u2019s relatively low fertility rates is that childbirth is increasingly delayed until later in life; the mean age of women at childbirth in the EU-27 was 29.7 years in 2008. This may be attributed to a range of demographic, socio-economic and institutional reasons \u2013 for example, the falling number of marriages, a higher number of divorces, increasing female labour force participation, uncertainty over the economic situation and job security ( 8 ), or young people deciding to remain in their parent\u2019s home until it is financially viable to move out and establish their own household. The relative weight of older persons in the total population has intensified as the number of births has fallen in unison with increased longevity. Indeed, the EU\u2019s population is generally living longer than ever before, as EU-27 life expectancy (at birth) rose to 79.4 years by 2008. The highest life expectancies across the Member States were recorded in Italy (81.9 years in 2008) and Spain (81.8 years in 2009). At the opposite end of the range, the lowest levels were registered for Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia and Lithuania (all between 72 and 73 years in 2009). Among those Member States with a complete time-series from 1960 to 2009, life expectancy (at birth) increased by as much as 15.6 years in Portugal, 11.1 years in unified Germany, and 10.4 years in Belgium. Life expectancy figures are also collated for persons having reached the age of 65. On average females aged 65 in the EU-27 could expect to live a further 20.7 years in 2008, some 3.5 years more than the average for men.

Indeed, those older members of society who remain active have the potential to make a significant contribution to society, for example, by extending their stay in the labour market or participating in family and community life. Policy developments within this area may be focused on encouraging older persons to remain healthy and autonomous for as long as possible. An indicator of healthy life years provides a pertinent measure in this respect; it is based on the concept of disability-free life expectancy. In 2008, females aged 65 within the EU-27 could on average expect to live a further 8.4 years free from any disability, equivalent to 40.5 % of their remaining lifespan.

Those countries where a higher proportion of older persons remain free from any form of disability are likely to be characterised by more active, healthy and participative elderly populations, with less recourse to medical and care facilities. Sweden stands out from the other Member States in this respect, as Swedish males aged 65 could on average expect to live an additional 13.6 years free from any form of disability in 2009, while the corresponding figure for women was one year higher at 14.6 years. This equated to almost three quarters (74.8 %) of the expected remaining lifespan of Swedish men and 69.1 % of the remaining lifespan for Swedish women; these shares were by far the highest recorded across the EU Member States, while other relatively high ratios were recorded in the remaining Nordic countries.

However, it is widely accepted that the EU\u2019s ageing demographic profile cannot be undone through the introduction of migrants alone in order to rectify the expected future imbalance between those of working age and older persons. Indeed, migrants will also eventually become old and dependent too. It seems unlikely that population ageing will be reversed unless fertility rates rise so that these return above the natural replacement level of 2.1. Foreign citizens made up 6.5 % of the population in the 27 EU Member States in 2010. Foreigners accounted for a relatively low share (less than 1 %) of the total population in Poland (2010), Bulgaria and Romania (both 2009), their relative weight rising to as high as 43.0 % in Luxembourg (2010). It is interesting to note that the highest proportion of foreigners is generally found within the working age population and that many foreigners appear to return to their country of origin at the end of their working lives; this pattern was particularly pronounced in Luxembourg, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Austria, Ireland and Italy. As such, the median age of foreigners tends to be lower than the median age of nationals in most of the Member States. ",

Population projections are \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios that aim to provide information about the likely future size and structure of the population. The Europop2010 convergence scenario is one of several possible population change scenarios based on the population as of 1 January 2010 and a set of assumptions developed in a conceptual framework whereby socio-economic and cultural differences between Member States would fade away in the long-run. It is important to note that the figures presented are made on the basis of \u2018no policy change\u2019, and they can therefore be used to analyse the likely effects of demographic change if no policy actions were to be taken. Eurostat\u2019s population projections suggest that there will be less than two people of working age (15 to 64 years) for every older person aged 65 or more in the EU-27 by 2060, compared with a ratio of almost four to one today; it is important to note that demographic dependency ratios such as these may be further influenced by underemployment or unemployment (which have the potential to reduce further the number of persons actually in work and supporting the remainder of society). The most rapid changes in the size of the working age population are expected to take place during the period from 2015 to 2035, when a large part of the baby- boom cohorts are projected to retire. Population projections foresee little overall change in the total number of inhabitants in the EU-27 between 2010 and 2060. However, the structure of the population is expected to become much older, with a marked change in its age profile, as the older sections of the population account for an increasing share of the total number of inhabitants. Indeed, the changes that are foreseen are unprecedented, as there are no historical examples of age distributions being shaped like inversed pyramids, with the oldest age classes bigger than the youngest ones.

        "37 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Ol der peop l e and the l abour market Governments are likely to face a significant challenge in trying to encourage the baby-boom generation to stay in the labour market rather than retire early, as previous generations have tended to do. A shrinking working age population risks acting as a drag on economic growth through labour and skills shortages. In response, the EU has sought to promote increased labour force participation and participation over the whole life cycle (although it is the Member States themselves that define the most appropriate strategies to achieve these goals). Active ageing recognises that if people are to work for a longer period of time, then they will need to be in good physical and mental health, with access to more flexible working arrangements, healthy workplaces, lifelong learning and retirement schemes. In the face of historically low fertility rates, it has been argued that demographic renewal requires actions to promote family- life and encourage a better work-life balance. Incentives such as parental leave, the provision of childcare and reducing taxes on second earners have the potential to increase labour market participation \u2013 particularly amongst women. While there has been considerable progress to increase participation rates in the labour market \u2013 especially among older workers and women \u2013 the prospect of longer average careers and the fast pace of the modern, information-based society, mean that retraining is expected to become an important tool to avoid obsolete skills, and indirectly prevent premature retirement. The EU supports various initiatives in this domain such as promoting lifelong learning strategies. In a Communication titled \u2018New skills for new jobs \u2013 anticipating and matching labour market and skills needs\u2019 ( 9 ), the European Commission seeks to present an assessment of the skills requirements in Europe up to 2020, taking account of the impacts of technological change and ageing populations.

        "40 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 2 Older people and the labour market Figure 2.1 provides evidence of a marked increase in the amount of older members of the EU-27 workforce (aged 50 to 64) who were in employment during the period from 2000 to 2010. This increase corresponds mainly to the changes in the demographic structure of the population as the relatively large baby-boom cohorts move towards pensionable age. The development of the employment rates (Figure 2.2) suggests that there might be other factors like a reversal in the trend for early retirement \u2013 particularly among women. Nevertheless, over half (50.6 %) of all women aged 50 to 64 in the EU-27 were not in employment in 2010. The financial and economic crisis resulted in the total number of employed persons (aged 15 to 64) falling by 2.5 % in the EU-27 from the third quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2011. Over the same period, the number of employed persons aged 50 to 64 years increased by 5.8 %, while the number of employed persons aged 65 or over rose by 4.1 %; the rate of growth for the elderly female workforce was higher than that for elderly men. In absolute terms, the largest numbers of persons aged 50 to 64 were working in the activities of manufacturing, construction, distributive trades, public administration, education, health and social work \u2013 in line with the general pattern observed across the whole of the EU-27 workforce aged 15 to 64 (see Table 2.2). Higher than average proportions of persons aged 50 or over were working within the activities of: agriculture, public administration, education, health and social work.

The 2012 Ageing report \u2013 underlying assumptions and projection methodologies ( 10 ) suggests that there will be a considerable increase in employment rates for older persons across the EU-27 during the next half a century. Figure 2.3 shows that the largest increases in employment rates among older persons between 2010 and 2060 are expected to occur in southern Europe \u2013 Spain, Malta, Slovenia, Greece and Italy \u2013 as well as in Hungary, the Czech Republic and France. These same countries are the most susceptible to potential labour shortages that are expected to arise from relatively low numbers of young persons entering the jobs market, as they display the widest gaps between projected employment rates for older persons and projected employment rates for the whole of the working age population (15 to 64 years). Given that roughly half of all women and just over one third of all men aged 55 to 64 were not in employment in 2010, there appears to be considerable untapped potential for increasing employment among the older generations. Projections in the Ageing report point towards an increasing role for older women within the EU-27\u2019s labour market, as the employment rate for women aged 55 to 64 is expected to rise by 20.9 percentage points between 2010 and 2060, while that for men is projected to increase by 11.5 points.

Table 2.3 presents the main reasons for people being employed on a part-time basis: the most frequent among those aged 50 to 64 was \u2018other reasons\u2019 \u2013 suggesting that lifestyle choices were prevalent in reducing the number of hours worked as older persons approached retirement (this category accounted for 63.6 % of those in part-time employment aged 65 and above). Some 7.9 % of those aged 50 to 64 who were working on a part-time basis did so because of illness or disability, which was almost double the average for the working age population (between 15 and 64 years old). It is also interesting to note the low proportion of persons aged 50 to 64 who worked on a part-time basis so as to be in education or training (0.4 %), well below the average for the whole of the working age population (10.3 %); this is despite the fact that the qualifications of older workers are more likely to be out of date but may well reflect the view that for persons nearer the end of their working life the small number of working years ahead of them mean that the costs (time and financial) of further study or training may outweigh the expected benefits. Figure 2.4 shows that self-employment is one particular area where older workers have the potential to make a considerable contribution to economic growth. Across the EU-27, just over half (50.4 %) of the workforce aged 65 or more were self-employed in 2010; note the definition of self-employed includes people who work alone (the largest share), as well as entrepreneurs who own a business that has employees. These figures on the self-employed may reflect a range of issues \u2013 such as the desire of older workers to have greater autonomy over their work, or a change in contractual Tab l e 2 .3 : Main reason for part - time emp l oyment , EU- 27 , 20 1 0 (% share of those in part - time emp l oyment) Aged 15-64 Aged 50-64 Aged 65+ Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female Could not find a full-time job 26.7 36.0 24.0 22.8 25.4 22.0 3.8 3.4 4.3 Own illness or disability 4.0 7.1 3.1 7.9 13.9 6.2 7.2 7.1 7.3 Other family or personal responsibilities 14.4 7.2 16.4 23.6 15.9 25.8 24.4 23.4 25.5 Looking after children / incapacitated adults 22.8 4.1 28.1 7.4 3.1 8.7 : : : In education or training 10.3 20.4 7.4 0.4 : 0.4 : : : Other reasons 21.8 25.1 20.9 37.9 41.5 36.9 63.6 65.6 61.2 S ource : Eu rostat ( on l ine data code: l fsa _ epgar) ",

There are considerable differences as regards average earnings (see Table 2.5) \u2013 with around half of the EU Member States reporting an increase in average earnings through to the statutory retirement age; this was particularly the case in Slovenia, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Spain, Greece, Malta and Poland, where average earnings for those aged 60 or above were considerably higher than the earnings enjoyed by the remainder of the working population. In contrast, the workforce aged 50 or above in the Baltic Member States reported average earnings that were consistently below the average for the whole of the population. In other Member States, average earnings fell away for those aged 60 or over; this was the case in Ireland, the ",

        "46 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 2 Older people and the labour market There remains a relatively wide gap between the average earnings of men and women across most of the EU Member States. Figure 2.5 shows this was particularly the case in Cyprus, Austria, Germany, France and Finland; note the different reference periods. The disparity in earnings by gender was generally even wider among those aged 65 or more. While pecuniary rewards (earnings) are an important element of job satisfaction for many, other people place emphasis on non-pecuniary aspects; for example, health and safety in the workplace. Older workers tended to report considerably more work-related health problems. Across the EU (excluding France), one in six (16.8 %) persons aged 45 to 54 years reported at least one work-related health problem in 2007, a share that fell to 15.8 % among those aged 55 to 64. These figures suggest that policymakers might consider health promotion campaigns in the workplace in order to improve the general health of older persons, reduce absenteeism associated with such problems, and prolong potential working lives. The likelihood of having an accident at work is closely linked to the activities in which people work \u2013 for example, accidents are far more likely in the mining and quarrying, construction or transport sectors. Across the EU, just over one fifth (21.1 %) of all accidents at work that resulted in four or more days absence involved persons aged 45 to 54 years, while a further 9.3 % involved persons aged 55 to 64 and 1.6 % involved those over 65. Figure 2.7 shows that compared with accidents that result in at least four days absence, fatal accidents are relatively prevalent among older members of the workforce. The highest proportion (30.1 %) of fatal accidents at work in the EU in 2008 took place among those aged 45 to 54 years; a further 15.8 % of fatal accidents involved those aged 55 to 64 and 4.9 % involved those aged 65 or over. Note that all of these shares depend upon the number of persons in employment within a particular age group, and that there were far fewer persons aged 55 or above still in employment due to early retirement and other reasons for leaving the workforce.

Demographic ageing has led some Member States to raise their statutory retirement age, while other countries have reformed early retirement and benefit schemes (disability, unemployment, sickness) to tighten these against abuse or to encourage people to stay longer in the labour market; all of these changes aim to promote higher employment rates while reducing benefit dependency. The unemployment rate measures the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force (those in work and those who are actively seeking and available to work). EU-27 unemployment rates in 2010 stood at 1.7 % for those aged 65 to 74 and 6.9 % for persons aged 50 to 64; both of these rates were considerably lower than the overall unemployment rate of 9.6 % for persons aged 15 to 74. EU-27 unemployment rates for older women tended to be higher than those for men during most of the last decade. However, the gender gap narrowed, such that the unemployment rate for women aged 50 to 64 fell below that for men in 2009; a situation that was repeated in 2010. Some of the change in the EU-27 may be a result of the impact of the financial and economic crisis being felt more strongly in certain areas of the economy that are characterised by male- dominated workforces (for example, construction). Within the individual Member States it was relatively common to find unemployment rates for men and women aged 50 to 64 move in the same general direction between 2000 and 2010 (see Figure 2.9). ",

In contrast, while no groups were spared relatively high rates of long-term unemployment in the aftermath of the crisis, older workers faced disproportionately high long-term unemployment rates. More than half of the unemployed older men (51.0 %) and women (53.4 %) in the EU-27 in 2010 were without a job for at least 12 months (see Figure 2.10). It would appear that some younger persons avoid unemployment by leaving the labour force to seek additional education or training, whereas older workers appear more prone to lengthy spells of joblessness \u2013 even though they are less likely to be unemployed.

There were particularly high long-term unemployment rates among those aged 50 to 64 in Belgium, Portugal and Slovakia in 2010, where more than seven out of ten unemployed persons spent at least the previous 12 months without work. Early, progressive or phased retirement are more common within a range of service sectors according to a Eurofound study conducted in 2006 ( 11 ). This showed that a high proportion of employers within education, financial intermediation and health and social work activities offered early retirement to their staff. Among the population aged 50 to 64 years, (early) retirement was the most often cited reason for inactivity within the EU-27 in 2010, followed by illness or disability, and family or personal responsibilities. Table 2.6 presents some of the main reasons why persons aged 50 to 64 did not seek employment in 2010. Just over half (50.8 %) of those not seeking employment in the EU-27 had already retired; among the remainder, the main reasons included illness or disability (19.8 %) and other family or personal responsibilities (8.1 %) \u2013 the latter was relatively more important among women (12.3 %) than men (1.5 %).

As may be expected, the EU-27 population aged 25 to 39 years (covering most of the childbearing and early childrearing years) reported the most difficulty in combining work and family life in September 2008. In contrast, 43 % of those aged 40 or above thought it was very or fairly easy to combine these different roles. There were nevertheless considerably differences between Member States, which can often be linked to the relatively important role of the (extended) family in southern European countries. A survey conducted in March 2009 asked respondents in the EU-27 if they agreed that as older people worked longer there would be fewer jobs available for younger people. There would appear to be some degree of solidarity between the generations in this respect, as 46.6 % of those aged 15 to 24 disagreed with the proposition, compared with 38.5 % of those aged 65 or more (see Figure 2.13). There was also a marked difference between Member States, as Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Ireland were the only countries where a majority of respondents disagreed with the proposition, while more than seven out of ten persons agreed in Greece, Cyprus, Hungary, Portugal and Slovenia. When asked in September 2008 if they thought it was important to force employers to offer easier access to working part-time for older employees, the vast majority of the EU-27 population agreed (34.9 % thought it fairly important and 42.6 % considered it very important) \u2013 see Figure 2.14; there was very little difference in the answers between the age groups.

        "55 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Transition from work to retirement Each Member State has responsibility for its own retirement systems, and these are underpinned across the EU by a framework of activities spanning from policy coordination to regulation \u2013 for example: (cid:116)(cid:1) the stability and growth pact (SGP) which provides for the monitoring and sustainability of public finances \u2013 including pension systems; (cid:116)(cid:1) the open method of coordination on social protection and inclusion; (cid:116)(cid:1) the consistency of any pension reform with the Europe 2020 strategy; (cid:116)(cid:1) the functioning of the internal market \u2013 especially with respect to financial services. These different policy areas can be mutually beneficial to each other: for example, the Europe 2020 strategy emphasises higher employment rates, which would increase social security contributions and help generate adequate and sustainable retirement incomes. Conversely, addressing gaps in pension adequacy could result in an overall reduction in poverty \u2013 a Europe 2020 target. In general, one of the main policy concerns in relation to pensions relates to the ability of systems to provide adequate and sustainable retirement. This implies the provision of pensions that find a balance between the living standards of pensioners and the issue of who is going to pay for the retirement of future generations. These concerns are manifest at several different levels, including: (cid:116)(cid:1) governments \u2013 who need to balance budgets, while ensuring an adequate pension provision; (cid:116)(cid:1) generations \u2013 where there is potential for conflict as younger working-age populations are likely to face different conditions compared with existing pensioners; (cid:116)(cid:1) individuals \u2013 who may be concerned about their own security during retirement. In order to address these challenges, the European Commission has launched a discussion on the future of pension provisions in the EU by releasing a green paper titled \u2018Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems\u2019 ( 12 ).

        "56 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 3 Transition from work to retirement There are a variety of different pension schemes across the EU. While most countries have some form of statutory pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, whereby tax, social security and pension contributions are deducted at source, there has in recent years been a movement away from single, public pension schemes towards multi-tiered approaches, as pensions policies have sought to lower the share of public PAYE pensions in total provisions through giving an enhanced role to supplementary, private schemes. As such, pension systems within the EU are varied \u2013 reflecting differences in welfare systems, retirement ages, minimum pension provisions, survivor\u2019s benefits, and rules for annuities. 3. 1 F rom the indi v id u a l\u2019 s perspecti v e As older persons move towards the end of their working lives, a relatively high proportion seem involved in atypical, flexible working arrangements \u2013 this may be to simply reduce the strain of work, or to devote time to other activities such as caring for a relative, travelling, or following a pastime/interest. Governments are increasingly looking to address these issues in order promote conditions which may encourage a higher proportion of older persons to remain in the labour force for longer, while reconciling work with personal interests.

S ource : Eu rostat ( on l ine data code: l fsi _ exi _ a) In 2009, the average exit age from the EU-27 labour force was 61 years and five months; six Member States reported average exit ages below 60 (see Figure 3.4). In seeking to increase the proportion of older people who remain in employment, many European governments have raised (or announced their intention to raise) statutory retirement ages. These changes may slowly impact upon public opinion, as younger generations gradually accept they will need to work longer than those persons already in retirement. Nevertheless, an ad-hoc module of the labour force survey conducted in 2006 (see Table 3.2) showed that in ten of the Member States fewer than one in four of the population aged 50 to 69 that were employed planned to continue work after the age of 65. As such, there may well be some resistance to the concept of longer working lives The decision on when to retire depends on personal circumstances: some people are fortunate enough to be able to retire early, safe in the knowledge that they face a comfortable lifestyle. In contrast, others continue to work beyond the statutory retirement age and yet may be faced with poor health or poverty once they start to draw a pension. Table 3.2 shows that 61.3 % ",

Almost one in six people had retired as a result of losing their job or facing problems at work. Health also appeares to be a key driver for retirement; this issue is covered in more detail in the next chapter. A Eurobarometer survey (Special Eurobarometer No. 378) conducted in September and October 2011 found that one third (33 %) of the EU-27 population aged 15 or above said they would like to continue working after they reached the age they were entitled to a pension.

The earnings profile of the population tends to tail-off as people reach their sixties, reflecting changes in the type of work performed, work contracts, or the time spent at work, while pension systems may make it financially unattractive to work later into life. Mean equivalised net income in the EU-27 for households where the reference person was employed and aged 18 to 64 stood at EUR 19 303 in 2009 (see Table 3.3); this was EUR 3 687 higher than the mean income of households where the reference person was retired and aged 65 or more (many of these people worked within the agricultural sector, where earnings are relatively low). Note that these figures relate to equivalised net income and that total household income reflects differences in household size and composition. For example, the income of households where the reference person is aged 65 or more will also reflect income received by other members of the household, given the reference person does not live alone.

S ource : Eu rostat ( on l ine data code: i l c _ pnp3) The aggregate replacement ratio provides an alternative way to assess the impact of the decision to continue in work or to move into retirement. The ratio is calculated as the average income from pensions among those persons aged 65 to 74 compared with the average income from work among those persons aged 50 to 59. In the EU-27 the ratio stood at 0.51 in 2009, ranging from 0.34 in Bulgaria and 0.35 in Cyprus and Latvia, to 0.6 or above in Sweden, Luxembourg, Hungary, Austria and France (see Table 3.4). The aggregate replacement ratio was generally higher for men than it was for women; this was the case in 19 of the EU Member States in 2009. These gender differences may well reflect lower pensions among women, which could be linked to a variety of factors \u2013 in particular, to lower levels of contributions \u2013 as a result of a shorter working life (due to interruptions or curtailment of a career to raise a family), and lower average earnings (in part, reflecting the higher propensity of women to be engaged in part-time work or sectors characterised by relatively low incomes).

Population projections suggest that the EU-27\u2019s working age population (15 to 64 years old) will begin to fall as of 2011. Despite this reduction, the total number of people in employment may \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 continue to grow, as a result of rising employment rates (especially among the older generations). This development is expected to result from changes in employment and pension policies that are designed to encourage a higher proportion of older workers to remain in employment \u2013 for example, tightening eligibility requirements for receiving a pension, raising the retirement age, changing the calculation of pension payments, or restricting access to early retirement. There were 119.3 million pensioners in the EU-27 in 2010 according to the 2009 Ageing report. This figure was projected to rise at a relatively fast pace through to 2040, after which the pace of growth was predicted to slow. The projections foresee the number of pensioners in the EU-27 growing by 47.4 million between 2010 and 2060 to reach 166.7 million. In parallel, there will be a marked increase in dependency, as the number of pensioners per 100 persons of working age is projected to rise from 35.6 in 2010 to 58.8 by 2060 (see Figure 3.5). ",

At the same time, the number of very old persons (aged over 80) will continue to rise. These two complementary are expected to result in a considerable reduction in the proportion of pensioners who are aged less than 65 over the next half a century (see Table 3.5). The rate and size of this reduction will vary considerably across the Member States. For example, pensioners aged less than 65 are projected to account for less than 10 % of all pensioners in Germany, Malta or Sweden by 2060, while they are expected to account for more than 20 % of the pensioners in Estonia, Luxembourg, Hungary, Romania or Slovakia. The most significant reductions in the importance of pensioners aged less than 65 are projected for Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Malta, Bulgaria, Hungary and Latvia. ",
        "64 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 3 Transition from work to retirement 3.2 F rom the macro - economic perspecti v e Alongside reforming public pension systems, many EU Member States have introduced (or are planning to introduce) private, occupational pension schemes. Indeed, in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden or the United Kingdom such schemes are already widespread. Governments may seek to shift some of the burden for pensions onto individuals through a variety of mechanisms. These include increasing contributions, moving benefits away from being based on the last (highest) salary towards being based on average earnings throughout a career, penalising early retirement, restricting early exit pathways, and encouraging private pension schemes. At the same time, public pension reforms have been targeted to protect vulnerable groups within society, for example, through guarantees for a minimum level of pensions, by looking at the coverage of atypical workers, or addressing issues such as involuntary employment breaks (when people take time out from work to care for children or another dependent person). Pension reforms that promote private pension schemes generally provide more choice. However, they also tend to result in individuals having to take greater responsibility for their own pension\u2019s outcome, often through assuming more risk. The regulation of private pension schemes has sought to protect savings, however, in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis the risks were particularly evident, as older workers who are/were close to retiring and whose pensions had a relatively high level of equity exposure, generally saw the value of their assets fall along with stock markets and fund values.

The old age pension is by far the most common type of pension in the EU-27, accounting for almost three quarters (73.5 %) of total pensions expenditure in 2008, or EUR 1 071 554 million. The average expenditure on old age pensions per inhabitant (all inhabitants, not just recipients of pensions) rose by 8.9 % between 2005 and 2008 in the EU-27 to reach PPS 2 149. The highest levels of expenditure per inhabitant on old age pensions (taking account of price differences between countries) were recorded in Italy, Austria and France. ",

Government expenditure on this group of pensioners amounted to EUR 9 333 million, which marked a 13.3 % reduction in current price terms compared with 2005. The impact of efforts to restrict early retirement schemes and to encourage older members of the workforce to remain in work may be reflected in the per capita data presented in Table 3.6 \u2013 for example, average expenditure on each person encouraged into early retirement fell from PPS 4 813 to PPS 1 647 in Luxembourg between 2005 and 2009. The highest per capita expenditure on early retirement (covering the unemployed, those at risk of involuntary job loss, and those who were inactive but wanted to enter the labour market) was recorded in Belgium (PPS 3 914 in 2009) and Denmark (PPS 2 172).

There was a considerable difference between Member States as regards the proportion of earnings given over to pensions, ranging from a low of 16.0 % of gross earnings in Luxembourg to a high of 33.5 % in Hungary; this reflects difference in the level of pension contributions and also differences in gross earnings. There are a number of Member States that have already taken considerable steps to introduce supplementary, private pension schemes \u2013 these are, in part, detailed in Table 3.7. Additional information from the OECD suggests that benefits paid by private pension schemes accounted for at least 2 % of GDP in 2007 in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden.

As the number of older persons grows, the relative importance of public pensions in relation to GDP is predicted to increase from 10.2 % in 2010 to 12.5 % by 2060; the rather modest pattern of growth that is foreseen reflects the view that pension benefits in real terms are likely to fall in the next half a century. At the level of individual Member States there are considerable differences in the projections made. Public pensions were projected to account for 24.1 % of GDP in Greece and 23.9 % of GDP in Luxembourg by 2060 \u2013 compared with 11.6 % and 8.6 % respectively in 2010. In contrast, another group of Member States are expected to see their public pension schemes account for less than 10 % of GDP through to 2060; these include Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. As noted above, many of these differences reflect the different pension schemes that are in place across the EU Member States. When modelling the projections a range of different scenarios were considered, running a series of sensitivity tests for alternative scenarios. Figure 3.9 shows how some of these might affect the public pensions to GDP ratio for the EU-27. Generally the differences compared with the baseline projections (that are used in the remainder of this publication when discussing the results of the 2009 Ageing Report) were quite small. This was particularly true for the effects of a higher employment rate (an increase of one percentage point) and higher life expectancy (an increase of one year). The largest difference was observed for the zero migration scenario, where the effect of no additional immigrants was projected to lead to a two percentage points increase in the EU-27 public pensions to GDP ratio by 2060.

As life expectancy increases, the working population will live longer and may experience a lengthier retirement than those currently in retirement. Issues concerning inter-generational solidarity are covered at the start of Chapter 6. There would appear to be some awareness regarding the pensions\u2019 dilemma in the EU. A Eurobarometer survey (Special Eurobarometer No. 316) conducted in May and June 2006 found that 43 % of the EU-27 population aged 15 and above agreed that many of their fellow citizens retired too early.

        "70 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 3 Transition from work to retirement Figure 3.11 shows that 18.7 % of retired persons in the EU-27 who were questioned in September 2008 had already sought, or were intending to seek a job for extra income. This proportion reached a high of 40.4 % in Latvia, while more than 25 % of respondents in eight other Member States that joined the EU in 2004 or 2007 had also sought or were planning to seek a job. At the other end of the range, retired persons in Luxembourg were the least likely to seek a job for extra income (8.7 %), this share remaining below 15 % in eight other Member States (including Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom). Figure 3.12 provides information relating to why the EU-27 population believes people might stop working from the age of 55 onwards. It shows that around 70 % of those surveyed in the EU-27 in September and October 2011 (Special Eurobarometer No. 378) thought that a lack of flexibility with respect to reducing working hours, an exclusion from training schemes and the attitude of employers were all very or fairly important to explain why people stopped work; these views were shared to almost the same extent by all age groups. A survey in May and June 2009 shows that around half (49 %) of the EU-27 population thought that the current situation concerning the provision of pensions was not good (see Figure 3.13). There was a wide variation in responses across the Member States, as upwards of 80 % of respondents in Greece and Portugal (two countries seriously affected by the sovereign debt crisis) thought that the situation was bad, a share that fell to below 20 % of respondents in Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Meanwhile, in September and October 2011 some 60 % of the EU-27 population aged 15 or above disagreed with the premise that the official retirement age would need to increase by 2030, with only one third (33 %) of the population agreeing that this would need to be the case.

        "73 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 W e ll- being , hea l th and hea l thcare The WHO defines health by referring to the \u2018physical, mental and social well-being\u2019 of individuals. A comprehensive understanding of health implies that all systems and structures which govern physical, social and economic conditions should permit individuals to lead a productive life, irrespective of their bodily or functional limitations (for example, by enhancing the participation of disabled persons). Active ageing policies, together with health-related technological advances and improving living conditions have led to increased life expectancy for the EU\u2019s elderly population. There is no doubt that poor health is perceived as a key driver of early retirement. As such, maintaining the autonomy and independence of the elderly generations has become a goal for some policymakers, as better health has the potential to: (cid:116)(cid:1) improve the well-being of individuals; (cid:116)(cid:1) extend their working lives \u2013 providing a stimulus for economic growth; (cid:116)(cid:1) reduce the overall strain on health and social care systems. The EU supports healthy ageing as part of its health strategy \u2018Together for health: a strategic approach for the EU, 2008-13\u2019 and through the open method of coordination on social protection and social inclusion. Healthy ageing is based on a two-fold approach: (cid:116)(cid:1) the promotion of health over the whole of an individual\u2019s life, aiming to prevent health problems and disabilities from an early age (promoting a healthy lifestyle through actions that seek to increase levels of physical activity, encourage the adoption of a healthy diet, or reduce individual\u2019s dependence on the use of tobacco, alcohol or illicit substances); (cid:116)(cid:1) a commitment to tackle health inequalities that are linked to social, economic and environmental factors. An ageing population is expected to result in additional demands for a range of health and health- related products and services. For example, as people live longer, a larger number will become very old (aged 80 or over) and therefore it is likely that many will become frail and require more social care services in the form of support at home or in long-term residential centres. This development is likely to be intensified in the future, with a higher proportion of very old persons projected to live alone, reflecting the break-up of family units and a reduction in the willingness/possibility for family members to provide care to their older relatives. With no change in the overall health status of the EU population and without any future reform of social security systems and labour markets to promote healthy and active ageing, demographic developments will likely result in increased pressure on public budgets for health and long-term care.

There was a similar pattern with respect to the levels of happiness experienced by the EU-27 population, as levels of happiness generally declined with age. Older persons face a range of different pressures that can result in mental illness problems, for example, isolation, decreasing functional capacity, financial or personal insecurity. The most common forms of mental illness include depression and anxiety disorders, although older persons are also susceptible to psychiatric conditions such as dementia. One indicator that may be used as a measure of well-being, as shown in Figure 4.1, relates to the safety felt by persons when walking alone after dark. On average, almost two thirds (63.5 %) of those aged 65 or more who were surveyed in the EU said they felt safe walking alone in 2008. This ratio fell to less than half of those aged 65 or over in Bulgaria, Greece and Latvia, in contrast to the situation in Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Slovenia, where three quarters or more of this sub-population felt safe. The prevalence of physical health problems is higher among older people. Many of the illnesses that cause poor health (and in some cases death) are preventable, for example, cardiovascular disease or type II diabetes. The body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing a person\u2019s body weight (in kilograms) by their height (in metres) squared: it is a measure that correlates fairly well with body fat. A person is considered as overweight if he/she has a BMI from 25 to less than 30, while they may be considered as obese if they have a BMI of 30 or more. In most of the Member States for which data are available (see Table 4.2), the BMI of the population tended to increase with age through to the age of 74. From the age of 75 onwards, and in particular from 85 onwards, a far lower proportion of the EU population was overweight or obese (this, in part, reflects a reduction in food intake among the very old and could also reflect a higher proportion of overweight and obese persons dying earlier).

The Council of the European Union adopted a recommendation at the end of 2009 for vaccinating more people, setting out a target of 75 % of groups at risk by 2015 ( 13 ). Other prevention strategies include screening (for example, breast examinations, cervical smears, or screens for colorectal cancer). The uptake of such screening varies considerably across the EU, with more than half of all the women in France aged 50 to 69 having received a breast examination within the previous 12 months, while more than half of the female population aged 50 to 69 in Bulgaria or Romania had never had an examination. Across the whole of the EU-27, more than two thirds (68.1 %) of the population aged 16 or more thought that they (self-declaration) were in very good or good health (see Figure 4.2).

As may be expected, the proportion of persons declaring such illnesses rose with age, such that more than half of the EU-27 population aged 65 to 74 declared a long-standing illness or health problem. Figure 4.4 is also based on self-assessment: it shows that 25.0 % of persons aged 75 to 84 in the EU-27 and 37.6 % of persons aged 85 or over were severely hampered due to health problems in their daily activities in 2009. A survey conducted in February and March 2010 shows that a slightly higher than average proportion of older persons in the EU-27 sought help from a professional because of a psychological or emotional problem; Figure 4.5 shows that among people aged 55 or above, this share reached 16 % of the population. The same survey reported that among those persons in the EU-27 aged 55 or above who had taken antidepressants in the previous 12 months, some 49 % did so for depression, while 47 % took them to treat anxiety; the former share was lower than for the whole of the population aged 15 or more, while the latter was above the average. Although life expectancy is increasing and most Europeans may realistically hope to live longer than previous generations, it is perhaps more important from an active ageing perspective and from the perspective of most individuals to consider the years of retirement that can be experienced in good health; these issues were already covered in the first chapter through an analysis of healthy life years.

This distribution reflects a number of factors, as male death rates tend to be higher than female deaths from motor vehicle accidents, or as a result of alcohol, tobacco and drugs consumption. Furthermore, the population of men aged 80 or over in the EU is relatively small as a result of the high number of male deaths during the Second World War. In contrast, more than six out of ten female deaths (60.5 %) occurred within the population aged 80 or more (compared with a 36.2 % share for men). Information on the causes of death are presented as standardised death rates, whereby the number of deaths is presented per 100 000 inhabitants.

As mentioned, the consumption of various medical goods and services is expected to rise as the EU\u2019s population ages in the coming decades. Whether this is financed privately or from the public purse, the expanding number of older persons in the population may have significant consequences on the number of healthcare professionals that are required to care for the elderly \u2013 and this during a period when the overall size of the EU\u2019s workforce is expected to contract. One measure of the supply of healthcare services is the number of practising physicians or doctors per 100 000 inhabitants (see Figure 4.8), which generally ranged from 270 to 380 in the majority of the Member States; see footnote 1 for details of those countries that use a different measure.

S ource : Eu rostat ( on l ine data code: h l th _ co _ disch2) The number of hospital discharges per 100 000 inhabitants is a commonly used measure for the utilisation of hospital services, reflecting the demand for in-patient care and services. Discharge statistics do not provide a measure of the success of an intervention or cure, as discharges may result from treatment being finalised, but also when a patient signs out against medical advice, if a patient is transferred to another institution, or if a patient dies. Furthermore, there is a great deal of variation in the way that healthcare services are provided and funded across the Member States. As such, while it may be commonplace to treat a particular illness as an in-patient in a general hospital in one country, such a procedure might be provided through a specialised out-patient facility in another. Table 4.7 shows that the number of in-patient hospital discharges generally rises as a function of age in most countries, to such a degree that by the age of 95 there are some countries where on average each person visits hospital more than once a year.

The role of private household out-of-pocket expenditure averaged close to 25 % of expenditure across those Member States for which data are available, ranging from 6.2 % in the Netherlands and 7.5 % in France to 42.6 % in Bulgaria and 50.2 % in Cyprus. Care for the frail and old is often provided on an informal basis \u2013 by spouses, relatives or friends. However, changes in family structures, higher labour force participation (especially among women), and increased geographical mobility, may reduce the provision of informal care in the coming years. As such, the ageing population may require additional formal care provisions and providers of these services. Increasing care facilities for the old within the community and making greater use of information technologies (see Chapter 6 for more details) may encourage older people to remain within their established community. Healthcare expenditure can also be analysed according to purpose \u2013 for example, health promotion activities, curing illnesses, or long-term care. Table 4.8 presents information relating to ",

The breakdown of current health expenditure provides more detail relating to the specific types of medical care provided. Long-term care accounted for more than 20 % of current healthcare expenditure in Denmark, Luxembourg (2008), the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden in 2009. Long-term care expenditure per inhabitant rose to highs of EUR 1 240 in Luxembourg and EUR 1 216 in Sweden. The relatively low level of spending in some Member States (less than EUR 100 per inhabitant in 11 of the Member States) may be linked to the burden of care residing with family members; eight Member States reported that less than 5 % of their current healthcare expenditure was devoted to long-term care. ",
        "88 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 4 Well-being, health and healthcare According to the 2009 Ageing report, healthcare and long-term care expenditure is projected to increase by about 2.4 percentage points of GDP between 2010 and 2060 in the EU-27. Along with pensions, spending on healthcare and long-term care is expected to place an increasing degree of pressure on public expenditure during the next 50 years. More information on these EU-27 projections is provided in Figure 4.12. The overall increase in expenditure on healthcare is projected to be higher (1.6 percentage points) than that for long- term care (1.1 points). However, the pace at which spending on long-term care is projected to grow will be faster, rising 84.6 % over the period under consideration compared with an expansion of 23.5 % for spending on healthcare. These rates of change reflect, at least to some degree, the rapid growth in the number of very old persons (aged 80 or over) that is expected to occur across the EU during the next half a century. Figure 4.12 confirms that the number of dependents will grow at a much faster pace than healthcare expenditure. The projections made in the 2009 Ageing report suggest that the number of dependents in the EU-27 receiving formal care would more than double (up 128.1 % overall) during the next 50 years from 9.2 million persons in 2010 to 21.0 million by 2060.

The same survey indicates that just over one third (34.3 %) of the EU-27 population aged 15 or more agreed that there were sufficient social services to support frail older people so that they could stay in their own home (see Table 4.11); it is interesting to note that the age group that had the highest proportion agreeing that there were sufficient social services for this purpose was those aged 65 or more. A far higher percentage (84.5 %) agreed that frail, elderly people could not live autonomously because their homes were not adapted to their needs. ",

        "93 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 L iving conditions and consumption e x penditure Quality of life has already been touched upon to some degree through the well-being indicators that were presented in Chapter 4. Aside from physical health, an individual\u2019s perception of their life is also linked to psychological factors. These may be shaped through social relationships, personal beliefs, feelings of isolation/loneliness, or concerns over security/safety and finance. Many of the challenges that older people face in their day-to-day lives are linked to the autonomy and independence of their living conditions \u2013 in other words, whether or not they are able to cope with and make personal decisions on a daily basis, while living independently with little or no help from others. An individual\u2019s quality of life is also affected by monetary issues and material deprivation; both of these issues are covered within this chapter. Among the five headline targets introduced within the Europe 2020 strategy one aims to ensure that at least 20 million fewer people within the EU are in or at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion by 2020. The opening chapters of this publication have focused largely on the costs that may be associated with demographic ageing \u2013 for example, increasing pension or healthcare budgets. An alternative vision is to consider the changes that will be necessary in the future in order to facilitate the lives of the growing numbers of older persons, encouraging them to remain active within the community. Within this scenario, active ageing policies might be able to provide a stimulus for economic growth, transforming various aspects of society and promoting the development of new goods and services that are tailored to the specific needs of older generations. New products could be developed in order to help adapt homes so these become safer and more comfortable for older persons (current examples include the installation of panic buttons in the event that a person falls, or chairlifts that provide access to upstairs rooms for those who face mobility issues). More inclusive local services may improve the lives of older persons outside of their homes, for example, through easier access to public buildings (for wheelchairs or the visually impaired), the provision of appropriate leisure and community facilities, or public transport systems that are more accessible for older persons.

        "94 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 5 Living conditions and consumption expenditure 5. 1 L i v ing arrangements Societal change is an on-going phenomenon with the last couple of decades characterised by a higher proportion of single households, divorces, couples without children, or families living apart from each other. These changes have an impact upon the amount of informal care provision that may be required by older members of society. Within some of the EU Member States there are a range of policies designed to encourage older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, so they may keep their independence; older persons may also like this idea \u2013 perhaps for sentimental, rather than practical reasons. The effectiveness of such an approach depends, at least to some degree, upon the housing stock and whether this can be renovated and modernised in order to match the needs of older generations.

Around nine out of ten persons aged 65 or above lived in an independent manner in Germany, France, Finland and the United Kingdom in 2009, a share that rose to 95.1 % in the Netherlands. The lowest shares of elderly persons living alone were recorded in Cyprus, Spain, Estonia and Portugal. These countries were characterised by having a higher proportion of composed households, where the families of elderly persons are able to provide direct care/assistance to their parent(s). Across the EU-27, some 4.6 % of those aged 65 or above lived in households where children were also living \u2013 this share rising to over 10 % in Romania, Poland and the Baltic Member States. Among some of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 or 2007, the pattern of household composition also reflected lower levels of life expectancy among men and the impact of migration, for example, with a lower proportion of households occupied by couples, a higher proportion of older persons living in households with children, and a higher share of women living alone in single adult households; the latter also reflects an average difference of two to four years between the age of men and women living in couples (see Table 5.2).

The housing stock can be analysed according to the tenure status (home-owners, those who rent, or people who lived in a dwelling with reduced rent or free of charge), size, quality or affordability of housing. National housing strategies exist in most of the EU Member States \u2013 although the degree to which policymakers are concerned with active ageing issues and promoting the specific accommodation needs of older persons varies considerably across countries. One of the main decisions facing people as they move towards and take retirement is whether or not to stay in the same accommodation, which may well be a family home. There are a range of alternatives open \u2013 for example, to stay in the same location, downsize, move into some form of sheltered housing, or move to a new location, possibly abroad. Financial considerations generally play an important role in the decision. Another criterion for deciding the preferred retirement location is to contrast the benefits of rural and urban life. While the former may often be perceived as a safer environment and may often be cheaper, the latter tends to provide a wider range of services and amenities at far greater proximity. Indeed, as people age, their access to public transport, entertainment facilities, day- centres, doctors, hospitals, care and home support services becomes increasingly important. Figure 5.1 shows that the realities of an approaching retirement appear to make people over 55 more likely to downsize their accommodation. It is also interesting to note the wide discrepancy between the proportion of persons aged 15 to 24 and those aged 55 or more who say they would consider moving closer to family members.

        "100 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 5 Living conditions and consumption expenditure 5.3 Cons u mption within the si lv er economy Aside from their higher than average demand for health-related and long-term care services, the older generations have other specific consumption patterns that diverge from that recorded across the remainder of the population. Some of these differences reflect the uncertainty that older persons face regarding their remaining lifetime \u2013 making it difficult for them to plan their future expenditure. In addition, major changes in lifestyle \u2013 such as stopping work, or no longer running a car \u2013 also impact upon the consumption patterns of older persons. Finally, as seen in the previous section, older people are less likely to have the burden of having to pay rent or a mortgage for their dwelling by the time they reach retirement age. More specifically in relation to the process of demographic ageing that is currently underway within the EU, the younger members of the baby-boom generation have now entered their high saving and high income years prior to retirement. It may be expected that as they move into retirement they will start to run down their savings and sell assets such as property; their consumption patterns are also likely to change as they become older, following retirement they may initially have a higher level of expenditure (as a result of more free time), however, as people become very old they are likely to consume less food, take fewer holidays and spend a higher proportion of their income on long-term care and related services. The wider implications of the financial and economic crisis and the public\u2019s growing understanding of the challenges associated with demographic ageing may not yet have been fully grasped. However, a cultural shift may take place, and some countries will see a move in the balance between consumption and saving, with a higher proportion of people choosing to save more \u2013 and from an earlier age \u2013 to fund their retirement. Figure 5.6 shows mean consumption expenditure within the EU-27 in 2005. There is a clear pattern of rising expenditure through to the mid-life years, after which expenditure tails off. This is particularly marked in relation to expenditure per household, possibly reflecting the departure of children from the family home.

The highest level of consumption expenditure among the Member States was recorded in Luxembourg, where those households with a reference person aged 60 or more spent on average PPS 32 614 in 2005 \u2013 this was 2.3 times as high as the EU-27 average. At the other end of the range, there were four Member States where the mean consumption expenditure of households with a reference person aged 60 or more was below PPS 5 000 \u2013 they were Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania (where the lowest level of expenditure was recorded, PPS 2 145). In the coming years there may be a considerable expansion in the market for goods and services that are specifically designed for older members of society or are following a \u2018design for all\u2019 approach. Indeed, ageing populations can be seen as an opportunity for economic growth, through the development and marketing of innovative products; the markets for goods and services purchased by older persons are often referred to as the \u2018silver economy\u2019. Figure 5.7 presents information from a survey conducted in March 2009. It shows that up to the age of 64 an increasing proportion of the EU-27\u2019s population were of the opinion that developing products and services responding to the needs of older people will become a key driver of the economy. Two thirds (66 %) of the population aged 40 to 64 were of this opinion, compared with 63.0 % of the population aged 65 or more. Across the Member States there was a considerable level of divergence: upwards of seven out of ten persons (70 % or more) aged 15 or more in Belgium, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom were of the opinion that developing products and services responding to the needs of older people will become a key driver of the economy, however this share fell to below 40 % in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Hungary and Slovakia.

Statistics on economic inequality are of particular use for estimating relative poverty, as the distribution of economic resources has a direct bearing on the extent and depth of poverty. The relative median income ratio of elderly people aged 65 or over is defined as the median equivalised disposable income ( 14 ) for persons aged 65 and above compared with the same measure for persons aged less than 65. Figure 5.8 shows that the median income of persons aged 65 or more tended, as one may expect given the vast majority of people of this age do not work, to be below the average for the population aged less than 65 \u2013 the EU-27 ratio was 0.86 in both 2005 and 2009. Hungary, Luxembourg and France were exceptions to the rule, each reporting ratios around 1 in 2009 reflecting no significant difference between the respective relative median incomes of persons aged 65 or over and those aged less than 65. Older people do not necessarily have lower standards of living just because their incomes are lower. Rather, they may have accrued significant savings during their working lives and may also own a property (without an outstanding mortgage). The stability in the ratio for the EU-27 hides a diverging situation as regards developments in the Member States. Half of the Member States reported an increase and the same number a reduction in their relative median income ratios for persons aged 65 or over between 2005 and 2009; a comparison is not available for Romania.

These differences may have an impact upon the income of women in retirement: this situation is compounded by the fact that relatively few women have private pension provisions (some are dependent on joint life annuities purchased by their husband/partner). Through the framework provided by the open method of coordination for social protection and social inclusion, the EU seeks to promote equality in the workplace between men and women. The median equivalised net income of women aged 65 and above was EUR 12 964 in the EU-27 in 2009, while that for men was EUR 1 418 higher. The median equivalised net income of women aged 65 and above was consistently lower than the corresponding figure for men across each of the Member States, with the lowest differences recorded in Spain, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Malta, where the median equivalised income of women was less than 5 % below that for men. Figure 5.9 provides an alternative measure of income inequality for persons aged 65 or over: it suggests that for people living alone, the differences in income between men and women were wider than the corresponding discrepancies in income between men and women aged less than 65. These gender differences in the income of persons aged 65 or over became slightly wider across the EU-27 between 2005 and 2009; note that part of the imbalance may result from a structural effect relating to a higher proportion of very old women than very old men.

Material deprivation refers to a household\u2019s ability to afford certain items; a distinction is made between individuals who cannot afford a certain good or service, and those who do not have it for another reason, for example, because they do not want it or do not need it. The material deprivation rate is defined as the proportion of the population with an enforced lack of at least three out of nine items (severe material deprivation is defined as at least four items) in the economic strain and durables dimension. The nine items considered are: 1) arrears on mortgage or rent payments, utility bills, hire purchase instalments or other loan payments; 2) capacity to afford paying for one week\u2019s annual holiday away from home; 3) capacity to afford a meal with meat, chicken, fish (or vegetarian equivalent) every second day; 4) capacity to face unexpected financial expenses (set amount corresponding to the monthly national at-risk-of- poverty threshold of the previous year); 5) household cannot afford a telephone (including mobile phone); 6) household cannot afford a colour TV; 7) household cannot afford a washing machine; 8) household cannot afford a car and 9) ability of the household to pay for keeping its home adequately warm. Material and severe material deprivation rates for persons aged 65 or over were lower across the EU-27 in 2009 than for the other age groups presented in Figure 5.12. Some 14.3 % of those aged 65 or over in the EU-27 could not afford at least three of the nine deprivation items, while F igure 5. 12: Materia l depri v ation rates ( economic strain and d u rab l es dimension) , EU- 27 ( 1 ) (% ) 05 10 15 20 25 2005 2009 2005 2009 2005 2009 Aged <18 Aged 18-64 Aged 65+ Material deprivation Severe material deprivation ( 1 ) 2009, estimates.

Gender differences in material deprivation rates for those aged 65 or above were larger than for the population as a whole. While 7.6 % of women aged 65 or above in the EU-27 faced severe material deprivation, the corresponding share for men was 2.1 percentage points lower. In contrast, some 8.3 % of all women in the EU-27 faced severe material deprivation, a figure that was 0.5 percentage points higher than for men. The highest material deprivation rates among persons aged 65 or over were usually recorded among those Member States that joined the EU in 2004 or 2007; this was particularly true for Bulgaria and Romania \u2013 for example, in Bulgaria the majority of the population aged 65 or over was classified as being severely materially deprived in 2009. At the other end of the range, there were 12 Member States where fewer than 3 % of the population aged 65 or over faced severe material deprivation \u2013 among these, the lowest incidences of severe material deprivation were registered in Luxembourg (0.2 %), the Netherlands (0.4 %), Sweden (0.5 %) and Denmark (0.9 %). The EU-27\u2019s severe material deprivation rate for the whole of the population stood at 8.1 % in 2009, which was 1.4 percentage points higher than the corresponding rate for persons aged 65 or over. This pattern was not repeated in all of the Member States, as there were ten countries that reported a higher severe material deprivation rate for persons aged 65 or over than for the population as a whole \u2013 eight of these were Member States that joined the EU in 2004 or 2007 and the other two were Greece and Portugal.

These statistics reflect, to some degree, the composition of households \u2013 as there are economies of scale linked to sharing a dwelling. This may in part explain why a higher proportion of the people aged 65 or over living alone (rather than with another adult) face difficulties regarding their living standards. A relatively low proportion of the EU-27\u2019s population living in a household composed of one adult aged 65 or more faced difficulties in purchasing a colour television (1.1 %), telephone (2.1 %) or a washing machine (3.0 %) in 2009. The level of economic strain was somewhat higher concerning the purchase of a computer (6.8 % could not afford one), rising higher still for the purchase of a car (8.0 %). Comparing these rates for persons aged 65 or over living alone with the corresponding percentages for the population living in a household with two adults (at least one of which was aged 65 or more), the enforced lack of specified durables was always more significant among the former group. The differences were lowest for so-called \u2018big ticket\u2019 items such as the purchase of a car or a computer, whereas a much higher proportion of persons living in a household composed of one adult aged 65 or more faced the enforced lack of a telephone or colour television. Single adult households composed of a person aged 65 and above also faced greater difficulty (compared with the population living in a household with two adults \u2013 one of which was at least 65) in keeping their home warm, or being able to afford to pay for a holiday, a meal rich in protein, or unexpected financial expenses.

        "111 Active ageing and solidarity between generations \u2014 a statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 Participation in society The number of older persons in the EU is expected to grow considerably over the coming decades, leading to interest in the current and potential contribution that could be made by older persons to society. From a societal perspective, increased involvement of the elderly could bring additional economic and social value. Active participation of older persons may be promoted through a range of initiatives, such as: encouraging the retired to take on part- time work, engaging older persons in community initiatives and voluntary work, or adapting fiscal systems to recognise informal care that is provided by older persons (for example, child- minding). A Eurobarometer survey in September and October 2011 found that 23 % of the EU-27 population aged 15 or over were not at all concerned that the number of elderly people aged 65 and over would increase, while a further 32 % were not very concerned. Social capital is a concept that highlights relationships within society through the promotion of cooperation; it is often seen as a collectively generated public good derived from the activities of communities and social networks. Being a member of an organisation, having trust in others and voting in elections can be regarded as promoting social capital. The same Eurobarometer survey found that 70 % of the EU-27 population aged 15 or over thought that people aged 55 and over played a major role in being active in the local community. Almost the same proportion, some 71 % of the EU-27 population, agreed that people aged 55 and over played a major role in politics (participating or voting). On a more personal level, social contact and relations with other people are thought to have a considerable positive influence on an individual\u2019s well-being and health. Indeed, the continued participation of older persons in society may maintain their feeling of self-worth, thereby avoiding risks associated with isolation, a loss of confidence or reduced self-esteem.

However, there appear to be few opportunities for old and young people to meet and exchange ideas in modern societies. Almost two thirds (63.8 %) of the EU-27 population (aged 15 and above) questioned in March 2009 agreed that there were not enough opportunities for older and younger people to meet and work together in associations and local community initiatives (see Figure 6.1). This lack of contact and interaction may increase the risk of conflict between generations: younger people might feel they are facing the burden of paying for the pensions and long- term care of increasing numbers of older people, while older people might feel vulnerable or marginalised by changes in society (for example, through the rapid pace of technological change). However, a survey conducted in March 2009 found that 13.3 % of the EU-27 population (aged 15 or more) were in agreement with the premise that older people were a burden for society, while 61.6 % strongly disagreed (see Figure 6.3).

Intergenerational solidarity may be promoted through various channels, for example through civil society, the media and academia. National studies (for example, in Ireland or the Netherlands), show that care and assistance tends to flow upwards from children to elderly parents and that finance flows downwards from the elderly to their children; note, the same results may not hold in all Member States, notably among some that joined the EU in 2004 or 2007. In March 2009 more than nine out of ten (91.6 %) people aged 15 and above in the EU-27 agreed that local authorities should support associations and initiatives that foster stronger relations between younger people and older people (see Figure 6.4).

These social networks are a key facilitator of participation in society, providing an opportunity for older persons to continue learning and to share their knowledge and experience, while also offering the opportunity to engage with friends, family, neighbours and other generations. Figure 6.10 provides an overview (based on data from September and October 2011) of a range of voluntary activities that were carried out by the population aged 15 and above and by the population aged 55 or over. In the EU-27, the participation of persons aged 55 or over in these activities was broadly in line with averages recorded for the whole of the adult population. For both age groups working in a sports or recreational organisation was the most popular form of activity, although those aged 55 or over tended to participate somewhat less than the average in this activity, whereas those aged 55 and over were more likely to participate in religious or church organisations, charity and social aid organisations, or in leisure associations for the elderly.

A survey conducted in 2007 found that almost one in ten (9.6 %) persons aged 65 and over in the EU-27 felt left out of society (see Figure 6.11). This share was slightly higher than the rates recorded for other age groups, although the differences were small, as the lowest proportion of people feeling left out of society was recorded among those aged 18 to 34 (8.0 %).

Nevertheless, it would appear that physical activity can play an important role in improving the quality of life among older persons, as regular physical activity has the potential to improve physiological and psychological conditions. Figure 6.12 shows that age was a major factor in determining the proportion of the population who regularly participated in a sports or leisure activity. More than a half (56.8 %) of those surveyed in the EU-27 that were aged 18 to 64 reported regularly carrying out a sport, or visiting a cinema or concert in 2009; this share was much lower for persons aged 65 and over (35.3 %). According to a Eurobarometer survey conducted in October 2009, some 40 % of the EU-27 population aged 15 and above exercised or played sport with at least some regularity. Figure 6.13 shows that this share was lower among persons aged 70 and above (21 % for women and 23 % for men). A similar question from the same survey concentrated upon physical activities other than sport. Almost two thirds (65 %) of the EU-27 population aged 15 and above stated that they engaged in physical exercise (outside of playing sport). The proportion of persons aged 70 and above engaged in non-sporting physical exercise with at least some regularity was again lower than average (54 % for women and 63 % for men). A survey conducted in October 2009 provides information on the share of the population who were members of a sports or health and fitness club (see Figure 6.14). The general pattern across the EU-27 was for membership levels to fall as a function of age, while men were more likely than women to be a member of a sports club. ",

The same survey provides evidence that persons aged 70 or above who were not members of a club tended to undertake their physical activity in a park, or within the vicinity of their home (for example, walking or cycling between home and the shops). Walking, climbing the stairs, or taking care of the house and garden are examples of physical activities that may be conducted by older persons on a daily basis. Table 6.2 shows that across the EU-27 in October 2009 just over two thirds of men and women aged 70 or more who engaged in sport or a physical activity did so in order to improve their health.

This development may also be linked, among others, to higher life expectancy, an increase in private car ownership rates, and the falling relative cost of long-distance travel.

There are wide ranging differences in the take-up of volunteering across the EU: for example, in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom volunteering has a long tradition, whereas many of the countries that have joined the EU in 2004 or 2007 have relatively less developed voluntary sectors. There is evidence to suggest that voluntary work increases mental well-being among older persons. Volunteer work also has the potential to provide an exchange of experiences between the generations; for example, older people reading stories to the young at a nursery centre. A survey conducted in March 2009 found that 78 % of the EU-27 population aged 15 and above were of the opinion that older people made a major contribution as volunteers in charitable and community organisations (see Figure 6.17).

This has lead to the idea that economic prosperity will only be maintained if there is considerable productivity growth: one means of achieving this goal is to invest in human capital. The European Commission adopted a Communication on adult learning in October 2006 ( 16 ), which was followed by an action plan endorsed by the education ministers of each Member State in May 2008. Several of the issues identified were relevant to older persons and broader concerns surrounding demographic ageing. The action plan called for: (cid:116)(cid:1) skills to be upgraded so that potential labour shortages due to demographic changes could be met; (cid:116)(cid:1) action to reduce poverty and social exclusion through the promotion of adult learning to improve skills and personal autonomy; (cid:116)(cid:1) increased participation in lifelong learning, particularly among older workers, as the average working age is likely to rise across Europe in the coming decades. There were an estimated 1.67 million students aged 40 and above studying in the EU-27 in 2009, accounting for 1.8 % of the total student population (see Figure 6.18, which excludes primary and lower secondary levels of education). The share of students aged 40 and above in the total number of students varied considerably, rising to above 5 % in Belgium, Finland, Portugal and Sweden, while falling below 0.5 % in Cyprus, Germany, Ireland, Italy or Luxembourg (see Figure 6.19).

There has been an increase in educational participation in recent decades within most EU Member States and this has resulted in younger age groups generally having a higher level of upper secondary and tertiary education attainment than preceding generations (see Figure 6.20). This pattern was particularly apparent in relation to the relatively low levels of educational attainment among the female population aged 55 to 64. ",

S ource : Eu rostat ( on l ine data code: trng _l fs _ 0 1 ) The European Commission\u2019s lifelong learning programme (LLP) aims to enable people at all stages of their lives to take part in education and training. One of its main aims is to prevent the erosion of skills among those of working age \u2013 for example, providing older members of the workforce with the skills that are necessary in order for them to be retained within the labour force. A strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training was re-launched in 2008 ( 17 ), setting long-term policy goals. These included a set of benchmark indicators: one of the targets relates to increasing the participation of adults aged 25 to 64 in lifelong learning to at least 15 % by 2020. An increasing number of older people take-up opportunities to learn about a new subject or to refresh their knowledge in a particular study area by attending courses at universities and other educational institutions. However, adult learning extends beyond employment-related activities to include personal, civic and social skills in formal education and training systems or other settings. It may be the case that, the older that people get, the more likely it is that their participation in education and training activities will be for personal fulfilment (for example classes to develop computing or foreign language skills) or social contact. Across the EU-27 some 9.2 % of the population aged 25 to 64 participated (in the four weeks preceding the labour force survey) in education and training in 2009; the share for persons aged 55 to 64 was half the average level, at 4.6 %. Almost one in four (24.4 %) persons aged 55 to 64 participated in education and training in Denmark in 2009. This was a much higher share than in any of the other Member States, with Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom the only other countries to record percentage shares that were in double figures (see Figure 6.21).

One of its initiatives \u2013 under the heading of service quality and reliability \u2013 is to improve the quality of transport and accessibility of infrastructure for older persons and passengers with reduced mobility. Older people tend to travel less than younger people; this partly relates to them not needing to travel to school or to work on a daily basis. Although they may travel on a less regular basis and for shorter average distances, mobility plays a key role in active ageing \u2013 reaffirming the independence of older persons. The older that people become the higher the risk that they will suffer from health problems that may inhibit their mobility \u2013 in more serious cases this may result in them becoming dependent on others. The role of the car in providing mobility for older persons is of particular importance in rural areas, as towns and cities tend to have more developed public transport networks. The problems of moving around are compounded for older persons by: concerns over accessibility issues; the comfort of transport terminals; a range of safety issues (such as the perceived and actual threat of violence on public transport, poor road illumination, speeding vehicles, or poorly parked vehicles). Furthermore, when moving around older persons also need to be aware of the possibility that their own sensory skills, reaction times and physical abilities may decline with age.

S ource : Eu rostat ( on l ine data code: h l th _ cd _ anr) Figure 6.24 provides information relating to the main mode of transport used by people in the EU for their daily activities; the data is from October 2010. It shows that the car was the most commonly used mode of transport in the EU-27 among adults aged 24 and above. The relative importance of the car rose through to middle age, with almost two thirds (63.5 %) of people aged 40 to 54 stating that it was their main mode of transport. Older persons \u2013 aged 55 and above \u2013 had a different pattern of reliance on a broader range of transport modes. Across the EU-27 slightly less than half (47.0 %) of older persons cited the car as their main mode of transport. In contrast, a higher than average proportion used public transport (21.5 %) or walking (17.2 %) as their main mode of transport; note that 4.0 % of older respondents replied that they had no regular mobility. Figure 6.25 presents information on the number of deaths that resulted from transport accidents in the EU-27 in 2009. A comparison with similar data from 1999 reveals that there was a considerable reduction in the number of deaths; this pattern was reproduced for both genders across all age groups. There were 5 813 deaths resulting from transport accidents involving men aged 65 and above in the EU-27 in 2009; this was lower than the number of deaths as a result of transport accidents among men aged 15 to 24. The picture was somewhat different among women: generally far fewer women (than men) died as a result of transport accidents in the EU-27 in 2009 \u2013 this pattern was true for all age groups. Nevertheless, the number of deaths among women resulting from transport accidents peaked among those aged between 75 and 84. ",

One area where there may be considerable growth is with respect to so-called \u2018smart homes\u2019. These are dwellings which incorporate a communications network that connects key electrical appliances and services, allowing the homes of older persons to be remotely controlled or monitored from afar \u2013 thereby providing the security that may be necessary to allow older persons to remain at home living in an independent fashion. Generally the use of ICT falls as a function of age, decreasing in each of the EU Member States; this pattern is particularly prevalent among older women, many of whom live alone in single households. The Digital Agenda for Europe ( 20 ), one of the flagship initiatives under the Europe 2020 strategy, aims to promote independent and safe living for the elderly and to encourage involvement in society. The Digital Agenda has set a target for having 60 % regular Internet use (at least once per week) among disadvantaged people by 2015 (the sub-population of socially disadvantaged people includes persons aged 55 to 74). Table 6.10 shows that in 2010 around 17 % of the EU-27\u2019s population aged 65 to 74 made daily use of the Internet; this share was 36 percentage points below the average for all age groups. The most common activities carried out by persons aged 65 to 74 who had used the Internet (during the three months prior to the survey) included: sending and receiving e-mails; finding out information about goods and services; seeking health information; and reading online newspapers or news websites. The majority of persons aged 55 to 74 who already gained experience using the Internet reported a low level of Internet skills in 2010 (see Table 6.11). The take-up of mobile devices for Internet access was also relatively low among those aged 65 to 74 in the EU-27 (see Figure 6.26).

This contributes to ensuring that the voice of older persons is heard and that the needs of older persons are considered when policy matters are debated in local, national and EU contexts, while also helping to broaden the participation of elderly people in society. The active participation of older persons in political life may be measured through their participation rates in elections or through the number of older persons who are representatives directly elected to municipal, regional, national or EU legislative bodies. The median age of a member of the European Parliament (MEP) in 2011 was 54 years. Figure 6.27 shows while almost half (49.6 %) of the members were aged 55 or more; the share of MEPs aged 65 or more was 13.6 %, falling to 1.5 % for those aged 75 and above.

The inclination of older persons to vote may be driven, at least in part, by their interest in politics. Table 6.13 shows that, compared to younger generations, a higher proportion of persons aged 55 or over frequently discussed local, national or European political matters. ",

        "Active ageing and solidarity between generations A statistical portrait of the European Union 2012 The European Union\u2019s population structure is changing and becoming progressively older \u2013 at the beginning of 2010, there were 87 million people aged 65 and over in the EU, more than 17 % of the total population. In response to demographic challenges being faced within Europe, the European Union designated 2012 as the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations. The overall objective of the European Year is to facilitate the creation of an active ageing culture in Europe based on a society for all ages. As Europeans live longer and healthier lives, governments are looking for ways to involve older persons more in society and to keep them active. Eurostat is marking the European Year by publishing this book which contains statistics on topics such as demography, healthcare, pensions, volunteering and adult learning. Eurostat online data codes are included under each table and figure as part of the source \u2013 these can be used to obtain direct access to the most recent data on the Eurostat website: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat K S - E P - 11 - 0 01 - E N - C ISBN 978-92-79-21507-0 9 7 8 9 2 7 9 2 1 5 0 7 0 "
