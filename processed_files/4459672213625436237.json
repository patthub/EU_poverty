        "This publication is the Executive Summary of the Science for Policy Report International Migration Drivers. A quantitative assessment of the structural factors shaping migration Abstract The International Migration Drivers report quantifies the relative weight of the drivers of migration at international level in a comprehensive way by income levels of countries of origin. Different channels of migration (voluntary migration flows between 1980 and 2017, asylum seekers, residence permits) are analysed separately. The drivers consider both structural characteristics of countries and individual characteristics of persons planning and preparing to migrate. The study of the drivers of past migrations is used to formulate better informed migration scenarios for the future with a medium to long term perspective. In addition, findings of the report are key to understanding the root causes of migration addressed by the European Agenda on Migration and the upcoming Global Compact for Migration.

        "1 The question of why people migrate has been central to migration research for many decades. It has been approached through different disciplinary lenses and analytical approaches, raising an awareness of the drivers of international migration flows between countries (the macro-level) and of migration decision-making by individuals (the micro-level) as well as of the complexity of the phenomenon. Understanding patterns and drivers of migration has also become a central concern in politics and policymaking. In recent years, both the European Union and the United Nations have striven to address the international governance of human mobility. Specifically, the EU Agenda on Migration and the UN Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration have explicitly stated the need to address what are variably named as the root causes or drivers of migration. Human mobility has a long history and is likely to continue into the future. Global migration has remained proportional to the growth of the world population, with the migration rate fluctuating around 3% since the 1960s (Figure 1). Evidence also suggests that although many people express a wish to migrate, only a few undertake the necessary steps to prepare to do so, with even fewer actually migrating at all. Nevertheless, the total number of people around the world who migrate to another country is increasing. Changes in the scale and direction of migration flows have led to the emergence of new destination hubs such as Europe, the Arab Gulf and parts of Asia. Crises have been declared as new migration and displacement patterns arise. In light of its significance to current and future policymaking, this report provides quantitative evidence to better understand and anticipate what drives international migration. In doing so, it contributes to formulating better- informed migration scenarios for the future. The report considers both the structural characteristics of countries of origin and destination of migrants and the individual characteristics of people considering or preparing to migrate. The findings reveal that although immediate challenges need to be addressed quickly and effectively when they arise, short-term responses to migration policymaking rarely consider the underlying structural factors which drive global migration patterns. As a result, a comprehensive and long-term approach is indispensable for migration policymaking. This report represents a step towards better understanding what shapes international migration and translating that knowledge into a resource to support policymaking. However, our understanding of international migration as part of a continuum between different possible forms of human mobility is still limited. We can expect that development will increase human mobility at large and not necessarily in the form of permanent international migration as experienced in the past. Better evidence will be important if we are to be able to anticipate upcoming trends and prepare effectively for living in a future in which international migration will continue to be a global issue.

        "INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION DRIVERS / A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE STRUCTURAL FACTORS SHAPING MIGRATION 2 A guide to the International Migration Drivers The International Migration Drivers (IMD) report is built around the quantitative analysis of the variables that explain international migration. These variables include the characteristics of a country of origin which may affect levels of emigration, bilateral relations between countries such as trade relations which may affect the direction of migration, and the features of destination countries which either attract or discourage immigration to them. Through statistical analysis of the best available data, the IMD report indicates the importance of different variables for explaining types of migration. It shows which variables have a greater or lower relative importance in determining international migration flows. It also shows whether those variables are associated with higher or lower levels of migration. If a variable has a negative sign it means that an increase in this factor is associated with a decrease in migration, whereas a positive sign implies that an increase in this factor is associated with higher levels of migration. Finally, it also identifies the individual characteristics of people who are more likely to express an intention to move to another country. Four sets of analyses are presented in the report, which refer to the following different dimensions of migration. First, the analysis examines general migration movements at the global level and differentiated by income levels of the countries of origin. Second, it examines the scale of migration through different legal channels to enter and stay in the EU, concentrating specifically on family, work and education residence permits. Third, it focuses on the factors influencing forced migration around the world through an examination of asylum applications. Finally, the intentions to migrate of individuals are examined at the global level and differentiated by income levels of countries of origin. ",

DRIVERS FOR GENERAL EMIGRATION BY INCOME LEVEL OF THE COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN. In its different parts, the IMD study sheds light on a number of important policy relevant questions. Which drivers are most significant for international migration? \u2022 In general, the study confirms that the key drivers of international migration are mainly structural: economic development in countries of origin, migrants\u2019 social networks and demographic change (Figure 2). \u2022 These variables are often interconnected, and reflect general stages of socio-economic development. For instance, low GDP and high fertility levels all describe an early stage of socio-economic development. \u2022 Other variables such as geographic and cultural distance between countries, changes in GDP levels in destination countries and the level of education of the population in the country of origin offer weaker explanations of why people migrate. How does economic development affect migration? \u2022 The report highlights a complex, non-linear relationship between economic development and migration. In general, migration first increases and then decreases with a country\u2019s economic development. This is consistent with the mobility transition and migration hump theories which describe an inverse U-shaped relation between migration and development. \u2022 This non-linear relationship is shown by the fact that in middle income countries, rising GDP per capita is associated with higher migration levels whereas in high income countries, higher GDP per capita is associated with lower migration levels. The lack of a significant relation in the case of low income countries shows that in early stages of development also small changes in GDP play only a minor role in affecting individual decisions to migrate. However, unlike the overall relationship between economic development and migration, lower GDP per capita is associated with higher levels of people seeking asylum. As a result, poverty is not simply a constraint hindering migration. How does demography affect migration? \u2022 The report indicates that in low and middle countries high fertility rates do not result in higher likelihood for migration. This could be attributed to the positive association between high fertility rates and poor economic conditions which represent hindering factors for migration (see point above). \u2022 However, younger people are more likely to express an intention to migrate and to act on that intention by preparing to move to another country. Current high fertility rates will produce a \u2018youth bulge\u2019 which is more likely to migrate internationally than current generations. Key findings and policy implications ",
        "INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION DRIVERS / A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE STRUCTURAL FACTORS SHAPING MIGRATION 4 What drivers affect migration to the EU? \u2022 The presence of communities of people with a migration background in destination countries is the strongest driver of migration to the EU through all legal channels (Figure 3). \u2022 Family reunification is by definition, dependent on the presence of family members already in the EU. As a result, the importance of networks was to be expected and has been confirmed in the analysis. \u2022 The presence of previous migrants from the same origin country is also the most significant driver of labour migration to the EU, even though its relevance is lower than in the case of family migration. Favourable labour market conditions in destination countries in the EU28 are also associated with a higher proportion of new residence permits for work-related reasons. \u2022 Migration to the EU for education purposes is also associated with the presence of previous migrant communities in destination countries, but this is not the only driver. Higher unemployment in destination countries and larger geographical distances from the EU also have an influence and tend to be associated with lower levels of migration for education. What are the main factors driving people move and to apply for asylum? \u2022 It is to be expected that conflicts, state fragility and exposure to armed conflicts with high intensity (either in terms of geographic spread or of casualties) result in higher numbers of asylum seekers in the countries included in the analysis. This is indeed the case, but other drivers are also shown to be significant as well (Figure 4). \u2022 Poverty in countries of origin is also an important driver of people seeking asylum. Higher levels of poverty are associated with higher levels of asylum applications. This is not wholly unexpected, as cases of conflict and state fragility can arise, cause and exacerbate situations of poverty. \u2022 The presence in the destination country of previous migrant communities is among the most relevant pull factors for where people file for asylum. This is because members of the same community who are already established in the host country can reduce the risks and the cost of flight and incorporation after arrival, providing a shortcut for decision- making in situations of stress. \u2022 Other factors, such as favourable economic conditions at destination, geographic vicinity and network effects are less significant drivers.

        "5 Why is there a gap between people\u2019s desire to migrate and their ability to do so? \u2022 There is a consistent gap between those wishing to move abroad and those actually preparing to make an international journey. While more than 20% of the population expresses a desire for international migration, less than 1% actually prepares to migrate (Figure 5). As a result, a wish to migrate is not a reliable enough indicator to inform policymakers about future migration or the characteristics of future migrants. \u2022 The socio-economic characteristics of those preparing to migrate in middle and high income countries confirm the non-linear relation between income and ability to migrate described at macro level (Figure 6). In middle income countries higher individual income fosters preparation for migration while in rich countries the relation is inverse and in low income countries not statistically significant. \u2022 The findings also suggest that, at individual level, the youngest, male, foreign-born, more connected abroad and more educated are more likely to prepare to move. Regardless of income level, the older the individuals, the lower their likelihood to express the wish to migrate. \u2022 However, varied patterns are noticeable across different countries. In low-income countries, people aged 25 to 29 are most likely to be preparing to migrate. In middle income countries, people aged 20 to 40 are approximately 50 per cent more likely to prepare to migrate compared to the younger group (aged 15 to 19). In high income countries, people aged 20 to 24 are more likely to prepare to migrate.

        "INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION DRIVERS / A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE STRUCTURAL FACTORS SHAPING MIGRATION 6 To what extent are policies effective at shaping migration? \u2022 Despite the recent developments and improvements of data and indexes to measure policies, daunting challenges remain ahead to provide quantitative global answers regarding the effectiveness of policies. \u2022 The existing studies considered in this report tend to conclude that policies, albeit important, have a less prominent role affecting the overall scale of migration when compared to other migration determinants, such as economic drivers, social networks, cultural and geographical proximity. \u2022 Findings collected by comprehensive indexes point out that policies act primarily as a device for shaping migration flows by selecting who can enter and reside in a country. In general and based on a long- term perspective, entry and integration policies have become less restrictive, particularly for high and low skilled workers, students and refugees. Nevertheless, border controls, exit policies and measures against irregular migration have become more restrictive and this has influenced how and where people move. What is the relationship between climate change and international migration? \u2022 Worldwide, exposure to adverse climatic events is expected to increase in the future. However, it is difficult to find a solid, direct causal correlation between climate change and international migration. \u2022 According to the study findings, the regions in which the combination of population and extreme events is expected to substantially increase in the coming decades are: Northern, Eastern, and Western Africa, while Central Africa is expected to be more subject to heatwaves than droughts; Southern and Eastern Asia are expected to be particularly affected by drought events, while the South-Eastern and Western Asian regions are more exposed to heatwaves; Central and South America and Southern Europe are also projected to experience an increasing exposure of population to climate extremes. \u2022 Slow-onset events linked with increasing temperature, reduced precipitation, drought events, and land degradation were found to be relevant in determining migration flows out of rural areas, especially in the least developed countries. Fast- onset climate related events such as floods are found to affect communities by forcing them to relocate temporarily in the surrounding regions. \u2022 The response of the population exposed to adverse climatic events will depend on people\u2019s adaptability to new conditions, the quality of institutions and the implementation of strategies aimed at pursuing sustainable development. \u2022 These findings suggest that regional and national institutions should multiply their efforts to implement strategies to minimize the vulnerability to environmental risks, boost resilience and coping capacity. The key findings of this study have several implications for how we understand international migration. They help us to anticipate how migration potential could translate into actual migration. Based on what is observed in the past, we can expect that improving economic conditions, demographic changes and network effects will continue to increase the potential for international migration. Higher levels of international migration should be expected in the future, especially from developing countries. When looking at specific countries, most international migration is likely to derive from middle income countries and be directed towards high income countries. When looking at the level of individuals, the report suggests that young, educated, highly connected individuals who are searching for job opportunities are those who are more likely to prepare to move. If policies are to address the structural factors driving international migration, such as poverty, unemployment and demographic trends, then a long-term approach is vital. In the short-term policymakers could, however, seek to shape migration by providing legal channels which facilitate selectivity and optimise the overall benefits it brings. Increasing development in low income countries will bring to a reduction of fertility rates and therefore to a decrease of the absolute numbers of migrants in the long term, but in the medium term there will be more people likely to migrate due to an increase in individual income. While demographic and development trajectories indicate that the migration potential will increase, other inherent frictions such as geography and regulations which have kept global migration relatively stable over recent decades, may continue to apply. In addition, the recent path of globalisation increasingly characterised by the transfer of knowledge and capital more than of labour indicates that globalisation by itself is not necessarily incompatible with a scenario of moderate migration.
