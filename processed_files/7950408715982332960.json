        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 4 Executive Summary The aim of this exploratory review is to examine the continuing high levels of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in the working population and to examine the evidence in relation to prevention. The review has been prepared as part of a larger project, \u2018Review of research, policy and practice on prevention of work-related MSDs\u2019. The project\u2019s objectives are: \uf0a7 to improve knowledge of new and emerging risks and trends in relation to factors that contribute to work-related MSDs and to identify the related challenges; \uf0a7 to identify gaps in current strategies for tackling work-related MSDs at both policy and workplace levels; \uf0a7 to investigate the effectiveness and quality of workplace interventions and risk assessment approaches; and \uf0a7 to identify new approaches for more effective prevention of MSDs. The reported rates of MSDs across the Member States of the EU (EU-28) 1 increased from 54.2 % in 2007 to 60.1 % in 2013 (according to the results of the EU Labour Force Survey carried out in those years). Data from the European Working Conditions Survey do not show a significant reduction in the incidence of musculoskeletal pain in the lower limbs or upper limbs or of back pain between 2010 and 2015. It appears that, although there are legislative requirements to ensure that workplace hazards that might cause MSDs are controlled, there is limited evidence that this is happening. Methods To examine the topic of prevention of MSDs, an exploratory literature review was undertaken. This involved initial searching to identify hypotheses before conducting focused searching of the literature to explore research findings to test these hypotheses. The research questions to be addressed in this exploratory review were as follows: \uf0a7 Why is there a continuing high prevalence of work-related MSDs? \uf0a7 What are the changes in the world of work that potentially contribute to the high prevalence? \uf0a7 What is the impact of demographic change? \uf0a7 What is the impact of individual risk factors? \uf0a7 What are the gaps in current prevention and risk assessment approaches? \uf0a7 Do they also consider psychosocial risks, gender differences and/or age? Scoping searches were carried out and followed by focused searches for each of the hypotheses identified. Research papers were procured and data extracted from each of them. Results \uf0a7 Hypotheses generated Twelve hypotheses were identified within the body of research including: \uf0a7 The impact of digitalisation and information and communications technology (ICT)-enabled technologies may expose individuals to increased MSD risks. \uf0a7 New forms of employment, including the gig and platform economies, have the potential to reduce workers\u2019 level of occupational safety and health (OSH) protection. 1 At the time of the publication of this literature review, the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State of the European Union. Nevertheless it was still part of the European Union when the research was carried out in 2019, henceforth in this report the United Kingdom is referred to as a EU Member State. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 5 \uf0a7 Previously high prevalence in one sector may move to a different sector. For example, shorter stays in hospital increase home recovery time, and patient handling then moves from the healthcare to the home care setting, thus shifting the exposure. \uf0a7 The effect of changing workplace policies such as no-lift policies shifts the exposure site from the back to the shoulders, or just-in-time manufacturing increases the speed of working and level of repetition without ergonomic assessment, leading to an increase in reported MSDs. \uf0a7 Unhealthy lifestyles, physical inactivity and rising obesity rates may result in increased musculoskeletal problems. \uf0a7 The impact of changing workforce demographics mean an older workforce with an increased likelihood of musculoskeletal problems (whether arising from work or age) as well as a younger workforce coming to work with pre-existing musculoskeletal problems. \uf0a7 The importance of psychosocial risks is increasing. \uf0a7 A growing proportion of sedentary jobs results in increased occupational sedentary exposure and musculoskeletal complaints. \uf0a7 Failure to reduce physical workplace hazards, including heavy physical work, excessive repetition, awkward postures and heavy lifting, results in continued exposure. \uf0a7 Different socio-economic contexts, classifications of industrial diseases, support structures and insurance arrangements in each EU Member State have an impact on MSD reporting. \uf0a7 A lack of adequate work organisation and/or work design results in increased exposures to MSD risks. \uf0a7 There are gaps in risk assessment and prevention practices. \uf0a7 Work There are known associations between work factors, including poor and awkward postures, high levels of repetition and the need for high levels of force, with the prevalence of MSDs. However, there appears to have been little change in exposure to MSD hazards since 2005. The continuing high prevalence cannot be explained by physical work factors alone and other issues need to be considered. \uf0a7 Sectoral change In the last two decades, the EU has undergone a shift in its economy in which workers have moved from manufacturing industries to service and construction industries. This has resulted in a change in the nature of the MSD hazards to which workers are exposed, including patient handling in health and social care, poor posture, high levels of repetition in service work, and sedentary work in office environments. Postural risk scores are high in many remaining sectors. \uf0a7 Changing ways of working Work is changing in both how and where we carry it out. Digitalisation has resulted in the use of new technologies potentially allowing access to work at all times. Simultaneously, online platform working has increased whereby the relationship between employer and worker is changing and more people are either self-employed or on casual contracts in which the necessary OSH regulations might not be in followed. This increase in digitalisation has also changed consumer behaviour and e-retail is consistently increasing. Consequently, more people are employed in this sector in picking warehouses and as delivery drivers. Although automation is being used by some organisations, there is still a need for humans for quality assurance, more complex picking tasks and at times more menial tasks. These workers can be subject to both high physical and mental demands when working under time pressure. There is little evidence at the moment that OSH hazards are being addressed. New ways of working also include changes in work processes such as lean manufacturing processes in the manufacturing sector. Although the research is ambivalent about the impacts of lean processes on MSD hazards, it is clear that implementing change using job design and ergonomics can reduce exposure. Within healthcare using sliding rather than lifting and recuperation at home has changed the nature of the exposure. Although the home environment is good for the patient, it is less controlled and less likely to have lifting aids for the carer. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 6 While fixed robots have been in the workplace for a few decades, the extent of automation and autonomous robots is predicted to increase in the coming years. What is clear is that, while automation can reduce exposure to MSD hazards, this is not always properly evaluated and workers may end up working in machine-paced roles. More positively, autonomous robots may reduce workers\u2019 exposure to dirty and highly repetitive work. There has been limited applied research examining how humans and robots will work side by side and the OSH issues that might be encountered. Finally, more of us are spending our working lives sitting down. This has recognised adverse health effects, but sedentary work is also associated with MSDs, again with a number of identifiable risk factors. Job design needs to be considered to ensure that people can get up and move at work (and are encouraged to do so). In addition, ensuring that changing facilities and showers are available for people who want to take exercise during breaks can also be beneficial. Guidance for protecting sedentary workers\u2019 safety and health has been provided. \uf0a7 Health behaviours Although this exploratory review is focused on work-relevant factors in relation to the prevalence of MSDs, there are recognised associations between health behaviours and MSDs, in particular obesity, physical inactivity and tobacco smoking. Workplace health promotion could have a beneficial impact by reducing these behaviours and thus reducing the prevalence of MSDs. \uf0a7 Age and gender In relation to age, the prevalence of MSDs increases in older workers. Whether this is due to extended duration of exposure and/or reduced capacity with increasing age is still being debated. On examining exposure to MSD risks in older workers (usually defined as workers over 50 years) compared with those under 35 years old, it was found that exposure to repetitive arm movements and moving and handling loads was reduced, whereas exposure to painful and tiring positions was increased. These data suggest that older workers are still being exposed to considerable risks at work. As a corollary, there is also evidence to indicate that, when injuries occur, recovery time is longer. The data also highlighted that younger workers were also reporting high levels of MSDs. Further research is required to establish whether this is due to starting work with problems or quickly developing MSDs after starting work. It is essential that prevention measures are made available throughout people\u2019s working lives. Generally, men report more MSDs than women. However, the nature of their MSDs differs, with men more likely to report back problems and women neck, shoulder, hand or arm problems. When exposures to MSD hazards are examined, for specific hazards including repetitive movements and sitting for long periods, women and men report being exposed to the same extent. For lifting people, 6 % of women report carrying this out all the time (versus 2 % of men) and 9 % of women reporting lifting people for a quarter to three quarters of the time (vs 4 % of men). This implies that horizontal segregation has an impact, with more women in health and social care work. However, vertical segregation also plays a part, with more women in part-time roles that may expose them to MSD hazards. However, the impact of the dual role of women as workers with domestic responsibilities should not be ignored, as such work can both cause and prevent MSD risks. When examining age and gender, although women over 50 years old report more symptoms than men, this is the age group that has seen the largest increase in employment in the last decade. \uf0a7 Health beliefs and somatisation Health beliefs influence how we think about ill health, and somatisation is the manifestation of physical symptoms arising from psychological distress. Self-perceived poor health has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of MSDs. Individuals can bring positive or negative health beliefs to work, but negative beliefs can be associated with symptoms. In the work reported, negative beliefs on work- related health issues, prognosis and having heard of RSIs (repetitive strain injuries) was associated with symptoms. There appears to be a lack of knowledge of the symptoms of, prognosis for and likely recovery from MSDs, and increasing the amount and accurate of our knowledge may help in both prevention and recovery.

        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 7 \uf0a7 Psychosocial factors There is growing acknowledgement that psychosocial factors also have an impact on the prevalence of MSDs. Various pathways have been hypothesised, including high mental workload increasing muscle tension, exposure to stress not allowing recovery and stress causing changes in the immune or inflammatory system. The review identified that reducing exposure to burnout may have the potential to reduce musculoskeletal pain. Fatigue might also be a factor, and individuals with MSDs reporting getting less sleep. Psychosocial factors including poor social support, low levels of job control and work-life conflict have all been found to be associated with MSDs. Managing psychosocial risks may reduce musculoskeletal problems. There is a concern that this is not happening widely, partly because many employers are unaware of this connection and partly because psychosocial risks are not categorised as a specific risk (being bundled into the Framework Directive with no differentiation between them and other workplace hazards). Where psychosocial risks are assessed, this is often done \u2018in a silo\u2019, i.e. focusing purely on the consequences of \u2018stress\u2019 for mental health, an approach that makes no linkage between psychosocial and other workplace risks. \uf0a7 Socio-economic differences Socio-economic differences between Member States and national differences in methods of reporting MSDs do have an impact on their prevalence. At present, this is perceived as being affected by changes in the reporting of industrial diseases and by awareness campaigns about such changes increasing reporting. However, the review also showed that the reporting of back pain has increased in countries where there are higher levels of social protection and social inclusion. It was suggested that this was due to income protection and support mechanisms being more readily available. \uf0a7 Gaps in risk assessment and prevention practices Although provisions for the prevention of MSDs are laid down in the Manual Handling and Display Screen Equipment Directives, these do not cover all MSD risks. There are a large number of tools available for risk assessment, but few have been thoroughly evaluated. Why do we still have a large number of people reporting MSDs? Our focus on aetiology rather than epidemiology may be holding the research back, as we need to develop and report intervention studies. We do not know how many organisations are implementing workplace changes or how effective these are. Thus, planning, designing and implementing intervention research over a reasonable timescale has to be the way forward. The review also identified barriers and facilitators to implementing strategies for MSD prevention. Recently, evaluating the impact of OSH legislation and enforcement revealed that there is a large gap in both musculoskeletal and psychological research. There is a clear need to evaluate both musculoskeletal and psychosocial risks in a joined-up way, and research from Australia shows how this could be achieved. A number of guidance documents are available in which prevention of MSDs must be seen as a long- term commitment as part of general OSH management and must involve the participation of the workforce. Lack of knowledge can be a barrier to prevention, so training and awareness raising is also essential. The need to think about psychosocial risks as part of prevention has also been emphasised. We need a broader framework involving the regulator, organisations (employers and workers) and researchers. In relation to our new ways of working, further guidance has been provided on sedentary work to increase opportunities for moving while at work. There remains a large area of research on automation and robotics that we need to consider in relation to the interface between the human and the machine. Discussion and conclusions This exploratory review has examined various hypotheses on why there is still a high prevalence of MSDs. The review investigated changes in the sectors where people are employed and changes in the way people work as a result of technological and process changes. What is clear is that exposure to MSD hazards is not reducing. Although there is the potential to reduce exposure, there is little evidence that this happening in workplaces and exposure may actually be reduced by the casualisation of work. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 8 There is certainly a requirement for a better understanding of the interface between the human, the workplace and work equipment in new technologies. There is still a need for workplace health promotion to improve the level of health we bring to work. Our understanding of health beliefs might give us an opportunity to share accurate knowledge about MSDs and their occurrence, prognosis and prevention to help us understand the issues. Demographic change and an increasingly older workforce creates a group of workers more at risk; surprisingly, younger workers also appear to be starting work with MSDs. The recognition of psychosocial factors and their influence on the prevalence of MSDs has not been linked into the risk assessment process in any real way. Research from Australia does make recommendations on how this can be done, but this has not been yet evaluated. There is a clear need to take new approaches to preventing MSDs, including designing workplace intervention studies that take a more holistic approach covering both physical and psychosocial risks. Furthermore, educating the public about MSDs is essential to increase awareness and knowledge of their impact and help bring about change. This exploratory review has identified a clear need to do the following: \uf0a7 Understand differences between countries and, where countries have reduced the prevalence of MSDs, find out what works and why. \uf0a7 Adapt risk assessment tools and risk reduction measures to be able to assess both MSDs and psychosocial risks in one assessment. \uf0a7 Increase awareness and understanding of the work relevance of MSDs and their identification, prognosis and prevention in the workforce. \uf0a7 Carry out intervention studies to help identify what is effective and just as importantly what does not work. \uf0a7 Ensure that workplace health promotion activities focus on MSD prevention as well as health behaviours that affect MSDs. \uf0a7 Identify current practices to improve the prevention of the impact on MSD caused by the digital integration of an individual\u2019s work-life commitments and platform working. \uf0a7 Update legislation to cover new technologies, including examining the implementation of the existing legislation to determine: o Does the legislation cover the correct risks? o Are employers adequately assessing these risks? o Are employers implementing appropriate controls?

        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 10 1 Introduction This exploratory review is the starting point of the project \u2018Review of research, policy and practice on prevention of work-related MSDs\u2019, which aims to do the following: \uf0a7 to improve knowledge of new and emerging risks and trends in relation to factors that contribute to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and to identify the related challenges; \uf0a7 to identify gaps in current strategies for tackling work-related MSDs at both policy and workplace levels; \uf0a7 to investigate the effectiveness and quality of workplace interventions and risk assessment approaches; and \uf0a7 to identify new approaches for more effective prevention of MSDs. The project consisted of desk research, comprising the current literature review and an overview of policies, strategies and programmes, followed by qualitative research encompassing interviews and focus groups involving experts, intermediaries and other relevant stakeholders in six selected countries (Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, Sweden, United Kingdom). More specifically, \uf0a7 The research literature was reviewed with a focus on the factors that potentially contribute to the persistently high prevalence of work-related MSDs. \uf0a7 Policies, strategies, programmes, actions and initiatives aimed at tackling MSDs in selected European countries were identified, described and analysed, including success factors and barriers to implementation. \uf0a7 Qualitative research was carried out to investigate risk assessment practices and prevention strategies in relation to MSDs and to understand the gaps between research and practice on the one hand and policies and practice on the other hand. The aim of this exploratory review, undertaken as task 1 of the project was to examine the literature with a focus on the factors that potentially contribute to the persistently high prevalence of work-related MSDs, including the evidence in relation to prevention, to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons for their high prevalence. The review also aimed to examine the evidence for what works (or not) in preventing MSDs and to explore new risk assessment and prevention approaches. 1.1 Musculoskeletal disorders, prevalence and trends MSDs is an umbrella term for pain and discomfort in the muscles of the body, in this case focused on the back and upper and lower limbs. For the purpose of this exploratory review, and based on the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work\u2019s (EU-OSHA\u2019s) 2007 Healthy Workplaces Campaign, the following definition of work-related MSDs was used: work-related MSDs were defined as impairments of bodily structures such as muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments, nerves, bones or a localised blood circulation system that are caused or aggravated primarily by the performance of work and by the effects of the immediate environment where the work is carried out (EU OSHA, 2008). Often MSDs are broken down by the site of pain and discomfort. For example: \uf0a7 back pain (which can be low back pain, upper back pain or neck pain) in which the source of problems is around the spine and supporting muscles and ligaments; \uf0a7 upper limb disorders, usually including the shoulders, upper arms, forearms, hand or wrist; and \uf0a7 lower limb pain, including the hips, legs, knees, ankles and feet. Upper limb disorders are often misleadingly called repetitive strain injuries. There are many suggested causes of upper limb disorders. Although repetition is one of these, it is by no means the only one and often not a causative factor at all. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 11 Confusingly, the site of pain or discomfort is not always the site of the disorder. Thus, back disorders can lead to sciatic (leg) pain, and neck problems frequently result in pain and other symptoms down one or both arms. According to the EU Labour Force Survey (LFS) ad hoc modules (2007 and 2013), reported rates of MSDs across the EU generally increased from 54.2 % to 60.1 % between 2007 and 2013. However, this increase is not consistent across all EU countries. Table 1 shows the data for the 28 Member States of the EU (EU-28). From this it can be seen that 14 countries have experienced an increase in MSDs (shown in bold/red) over this period and the rest a decrease.

Figure 1 presents data from the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) in 2010 and 2015.

        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 13 There is a lack of comparable data on MSDs at EU level. More specific and recent data is in some instances available at national level, providing an indication of trends in the prevalence of MSDs by type and sector. For instance, the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE, 2017) examined the prevalence of self-reported ill health across various sectors using data from the UK Labour Force Survey data for periods of one year, three years and five years The sectors that reported the highest prevalence of MSDs were skilled trades occupations, caring, leisure and other service occupations and process plant and machine operatives. The MSD data were split into different categories including MSDs mainly affecting the upper limbs and neck and MSDs mainly affecting the back. MSDs affecting the upper limbs and neck were most frequently seen in skilled trades occupations. When examined across all sectors, there had been no reduction in MSDs affecting the upper limbs and neck during the preceding three or five years. When investigating trends, upper limb and neck symptoms were lower for the one-year period than for the preceding three- and five-year data points in human health and social work activities. Sectors with the highest prevalence of MSDs mainly affecting the back included skilled trades occupations, caring, leisure and other services and process plant and machine operatives. Looking at different sectors within these data, the following sectors reported a higher than average prevalence of MSDs: agriculture forestry and fishing; construction; transport and storage; public administration and defence; compulsory social security; and human health and social work activities. What was evident from the longitudinal data was a reduction across all sectors but especially caring, leisure and other occupations. Further analysis of back symptoms in those working in human health and social work activities found that they were higher than the overall industry average. For all other sectors, back symptoms were less common overall for the preceding three and five years. Thus, we can see symptoms increasing in some sectors and, in the case of health and social work activities, a sector increasing in size. The UK LFS data have also been analysed to look how self-reported MSDs are attributed to or made worse by work. In these data, estimated rates of MSDs were highest for manual handling (lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling), awkward or tiring postures, keyboard work or repetitive actions (repeating a series of movements), a workplace accident or work-related stress. However, there are no data for trends in relation to changes in attribution over time. Within the EU, workplace hazards should already be adequately controlled by the extensive OSH legislation transposed into national law. However, the possibility that some workplace hazards are not adequately controlled was raised as part of the ex-post evaluation of the 24 OSH directives including the Manual Handling Directive (Directive 90/269/EEC) (European Commission, 2015a). Although the changing demography of the workforce and the changing nature of work are important in understanding why prevalence remains high, workplace factors still need to be considered. In a similar vein, the equivalent report on the Display Screen Equipment (DSE) Directive (Directive 90/270/EC), as well as pointing out the failure of the directive to reflect modern computing technologies, cited evidence to suggest that actual compliance with the regulatory requirements was less than might be suggested by awareness surveys (European Commission, 2015b). In summary, while there have been a number of strategies and policies at both EU and national levels, there appears to have been little impact in some countries of trying to reduce the incidence and prevalence of MSDs. The following review will address some of the hypotheses proposed with a view to better understanding what drives the continuing high prevalence of MSDs. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 14 2 Methods The approach taken to the review was to identify research papers that examine causes of the high prevalence of MSDs and from this propose working hypotheses to be further explored. The exploratory review started with the question \u2018Why does there continue to be a high prevalence of work-related MSDs?\u2019. From this question, a number of hypotheses were identified and examined through focused searching. Thus, this is not a systematic review but the scoping searches and focused searching were carried out systematically and recorded. The research questions addressed in this exploratory review were as follows: \uf0a7 Why is there a continuing high prevalence of work-related MSDs? o What are the changes in the world of work that potentially contribute to high prevalence? o What is the impact of demographic change? o What is the impact of individual risk factors? o What are the gaps in current prevention and risk assessment approaches? 2.1 Searches Although these are very broad questions, the process followed to identify relevant research was to carry out initial focused searches on studies that examined the prevalence of MSDs. These were based on the search strategy presented in Appendix A. From the papers initially identified, we developed hypotheses on the potential reasons for the continuing high prevalence of MSDs. The hypotheses (Table 2) were then used to direct further focused searches on each topic. 2.2 Data extraction Although this is an exploratory review, there was still a need for a simple yet systematic approach to collating and summarising the information and knowledge identified. A data extraction table was developed and is presented in Appendix B. This table was created as an Excel spreadsheet, which was trialled with three papers. Data were then extracted from the papers included into the spreadsheet. Summary information from each of the papers included is presented in an annotated bibliography in Appendix C. All papers were stored in a RefWorks database to allow ease of access by the research team. ",

Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 15 3 Results 3.1 Hypotheses for the continuing high prevalence of MSDs To inform more focused searches, scoping searches were carried out to identify publications that examined the prevalence or continued high prevalence of MSDs. The author-generated hypotheses for the continued high prevalence of MSDs, derived from these preliminary papers, are presented in Table 2. Table 2 Hypotheses for the continuing high prevalence of MSDs Hypothesis The impact of digitalisation on the nature and organisation of work may expose individuals to new or increased MSD hazards. The increasing use of information technology, including mobile devices, both at work and in leisure time has an impact on MSD hazards. Changes in contractual arrangements including the gig economy have the potential to reduce the level of protection of the workforce, leading to increased musculoskeletal problems. Previously high prevalence in one sector may move to a different sector, for example from manufacturing to the service sector, or patient handling moving from healthcare to home care, thus shifting the exposure. The effect of changing workplace policies such as no-lift policies shifts the exposure site from the back to the shoulders, or just-in-time manufacturing increases the speed of working and levels of repetition without ergonomic assessment, leading to an increase in reported MSDs. An increase in poor lifestyle choices lead to increased obesity and reduced physical activity, resulting in increased musculoskeletal problems. The impact of changing workforce demographics mean an older workforce with an increased likelihood of musculoskeletal problems (whether arising from work or age) as well as a younger workforce coming to work with pre-existing musculoskeletal problems. The influence of psychosocial risk factors is increasing because of work intensification, new production methods or dysfunctional work organisation, resulting in increased MSD risks. An increasing proportion of workers is involved in sedentary occupations and insufficient physical activity results in increased musculoskeletal symptoms. Continuing exposure to physical workplace hazards, including heavy physical work, excessive repetition, awkward postures and heavy lifting, keeps the prevalence of MSDs high. Different socio-economic contexts, classifications of occupational diseases, support structures and insurance arrangements in each EU Member State have an impact on MSD reporting. A lack of adequate work organisation and/or work design results in increased exposures to MSD risks. There are gaps in risk assessment and prevention practices. ",

Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 16 3.2 Work The aim of this section is to examine the impact of work on MSDs and to understand how the changing world of work, including new contractual arrangements, new technology, automation and new work processes might have an effect on the prevalence of MSDs. 3.2.1 Risk factors and exposures It is recognised that workplace causes of MSDs include high physical demands, highly repetitive work, work that needs high levels of force or poor posture and psychosocial factors. Table 3 shows that, although there is reasonable evidence for an association between some work, lifestyle and individual factors, the range of associations is varied. It should also be recognised that many of these factors have disorder-specific relationships. Thus, for example, there is strong evidence for a positive relationship between female gender and the incidence of one upper limb disorder (carpal tunnel syndrome) but no such evidence for another (epicondylitis) (Graveling, 2018).

In more recent work, Coggon et al. (2013) reported on an international study examining disabling low back pain and disabling hand and wrist pain in 18 countries over 47 different occupational groups. Despite the large number of different groups, the majority of participants were nurses and office workers and few EU countries were included. Thus, the research includes other socio-economic influences from countries and regions including Japan, the Middle East and South America. Using a standardised interview or survey, the results from 12,426 participants identified positive associations between lifting weights of more than 25 kg and disabling low back pain (proportional reporting ratio, PRR = 1.16, 95 % confidence interval, CI, 1.06-1.26) and between working for more than four hours per day at a computer or other repetitive task and disabling wrist/hand pain (PRR = 1.63, 95 % CI 1.40-1.90). However, it should be noted that this was a cross-sectional survey, and it cannot be assumed that the relationships were causal for any underlying injury (although they might well reflect provocation of pain). Work-related risk factors for MSDs with reasonable evidence for a causal relationship include heavy physical work, excessive repetition, awkward postures and high psychosocial work demands (da Costa & Viera, 2010). In a study in Portugal, in which participants were split into blue-collar and white-collar workers, Silva et al. (2016) identified that back pain was associated with exposure to vibration, high work demands, feeling exploited and a perceived loss of dignity at work. The analysis identified that, for white-collar workers, back pain was associated with awkward postures, sedentary work, exposure to physical aggression and having to be awake before 05.00. The authors suggest that this may be related to timetabling and shift work organisation in manufacturing and service industries. The papers above summarise knowledge at the time of the review with work-related physical risk factors for MSDs. Although there is more research available, in general this highlights the same associations between work-related factors and the prevalence of MSDs. As regards trends in exposure to MSD risk factors, data from the EWCSs suggest that that exposure to physical risk factors, although reduced, has not been removed from the workplace (Eurofound, 2017). The data from EWCSs show (Table 4) that there is still a high proportion of workers exposed to those risk factors. Although exposure to tiring or painful positions, carrying or moving heavy loads, and repetitive hand or arm movements show decreasing trends, exposure to lifting or moving people is increasing. Table 4 Proportion (%) of workers across the EU-28 exposed to risk factors for at least a quarter of their working time Factor 2005 2010 2015 Tiring or painful positions 46 46 43 Lifting or moving people 8 9 10 Carrying or moving heavy loads 35 34 32 Repetitive hand or arm movements 62 63 61 Source: European Working Conditions Survey, Eurofound ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 18 In summary, there are known associations between work factors, individual factors and the prevalence of MSDs. Although physical factors are recognised as contributing to MSDs, there has been little change in exposure to physical MSD hazards since 2005. The impact of physical factors has been highly researched, but there is a growing acknowledgement that psychosocial factors also contribute to the development of MSDs. This section examines those factors for which research has identified an association between psychosocial risks and the prevalence of MSDs in the context of changing ways of working over the last 10 years. The literature shows that highly demanding jobs are associated with an increased risk of MSDs, especially when combined with limited latitude in decision-making and poor social support, as illustrated by the demand-control model of occupational stress (Karasek, 1979) and the effort-reward imbalance model (Siegriest, 1996). The following sectors all report above-average levels of work intensity in the EU: health sector, construction, industry, financial services, and commerce and hospitality, with the health sector presenting the greatest intensity (Eurofound, 2017). Data from the EWCS (Eurofound, 2017) suggest that high work intensity is quite prevalent in Europe, with 36 % of workers in the EU reporting working to tight deadlines and 33 % reporting working at high speed \u2018around three quarters of the time\u2019, with 1 in 10 (10 %) (men and women) reporting \u2018never\u2019 or \u2018rarely\u2019 having time to do their jobs. Workers in the health sector are exposed to the highest levels of work intensity. Considering work intensity over time, the EWCS work intensity index ( 2 ) shows there has been a slight intensification of work since 2010 \u2014 reflected in a one-point increase in the index \u2014 but a small decrease overall since 2005 (Eurofound, 2017). In a cross-sectional study of hospital workers, Magnavita et al. (2011) found a strong interaction between the physical and psychosocial factors affecting MSDs. Their results build on the findings of previous studies, as they show that the risk from exposure to both sets of factors is greater than the risk from high exposure to only one of the factors (either factor). In particular, Magnavita et al. (2011) found that problems in the upper limbs (as opposed to low back pain) were more strongly influenced by the combined effects of physical and psychosocial risk factors. There are various suggested mediating mechanisms linking psychosocial issues and musculoskeletal pain, as identified in the reviews cited by Armon et al. (2010), Bongers et al. (2002) and Elfering et al. (2008): \uf0a7 high mental loads and job demands increasing muscle tension and decreasing micropauses in muscle activity; \uf0a7 work-related exposure to stresses affecting an individual\u2019s ability to unwind and reduce physical activity during breaks at work and non-working hours; \uf0a7 stress-induced adverse changes in the immune/inflammatory system; and \uf0a7 activation of the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system in response to stress, leading to secretion of noradrenaline, which increases muscle activity. These are summarised Figure 2. ( 2 ) This index measures the level of work demands in the job: for instance, working at high speed and under time pressure and experiencing emotional demands, such as dealing with angry clients. The trend version of the work intensity index includes a smaller set of indicators because not all questions were measured in previous rounds of the EWCS. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 19 Figure 2 Explanatory model of the impact of psychosocial factors on MSDs Source: Hauke et al., 2011Burnout Burnout has been identified as different from depression and anxiety. Burnout is context specific, as it refers to \u2018the depletion of individuals\u2019 energetic resources at work\u2019 (Armon et al., 2010). From a prospective cohort study of 1,704 healthy participants in Tel Aviv, Armon et al. (2010) concluded that burnout could be a risk factor in the development of musculoskeletal pain. Furthermore, such a risk remained even after controlling for anxiety and depression, reinforcing the significance of burnout as a risk factor for the onset of musculoskeletal pain (and the distinction between this and anxiety and depression). Furthermore, the findings of the study did not support the potential for reverse causation, i.e. of musculoskeletal pain predicting elevated levels of burnout (Armon et al., 2010). From the implications identified, the authors suggested that, given the stability of burnout over time, it seems that measures taken to either prevent or alleviate burnout may reduce the risk of debilitating, costly and prevalent musculoskeletal pain (Armon et al., 2010). Long working hours have been associated with negative health and well-being outcomes such as musculoskeletal disorders (Trinkoff et al., 2006 cited in Eurofound, 2017). According to the sixth EWCS, 16 % of workers in the EU-28 usually work long hours (48 hours or more per week): 21 % of men and 9 % of women (Eurofound, 2017). The trend is decreasing: in 2005 the proportion was 19 %, in 2010 it was 17%, and in 2015 16 % (Eurofound, 2017). \uf0a7 Poor social support Research has shown an association between poor social support and MSDs. This includes muscle- related pain at all sites as well as specifically pain and problems in the lower back, neck and shoulders. In an epidemiological cohort study, Clays et al. (2007) studied a sample of 2,556 middle-aged men and women. For men, the prevalence of low back pain was significantly related to poor social support. This association was also found in a systematic review (24 articles) and meta-analysis (17 of the 24 articles) of hospital nurses and nursing assistants by Bernal et al. (2015), in which poor social support was associated with MSDs at all pain sites. In addition, Hauke et al. (2011) in a systematic review of 54 ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 20 articles identified significant associations between poor social support and musculoskeletal problems in the following sites: neck/shoulder problems, upper extremities and low back. These findings are reflected in the cross-sectional study of Swedish commercial pilots by Runeson-Broberg, Lindgren & Norback (2014), in which it was found that poor social support and also poor supervisor support was associated with neck, shoulder and low back problems. \uf0a7 Low level of job control In the literature, there are findings that support an association between low levels of job control and pain in the back, neck, shoulders, wrists, elbows, hips/thighs and knees. In the systematic review and meta-analysis of nurses and nursing assistants, Bernal et al. (2015) found an association between high psychosocial demands and low levels of job control with pain in the back, neck, shoulder and knee. These findings support those of Runeson-Broberg, Lindgren & Norback (2014), who found associations between high work demands and neck, shoulder, elbow and low back pain symptoms in pilots. Significant associations between high job demands and upper extremity and low back pain and between low levels of job control and neck/shoulder and low back pain were also identified in the systematic review by Hauke et al. (2011). This is further supported by Collins & O\u2019Sullivan (2010), who found that for men high job demands were associated with MSD problems in the shoulders, elbows, wrists/hands, upper back, lower back and hips/thighs, with a greater number of associations in younger men. Collins & O\u2019Sullivan (2010) also found that in women there was a greater number of significant associations between psychosocial factors and MSDs. These factors include job demands, work environment and job content. Hauke et al. (2011) also found an association between: \uf0a7 lack of decision-making authority and MSDs in the neck/shoulder and upper extremities; \uf0a7 lack of discretion to use skills and low back pain; \uf0a7 poor job satisfaction and upper extremities and low back pain; \uf0a7 high levels of job strain and neck/shoulder and low back pain; and \uf0a7 psychological distress and pain in upper extremities. Along with the association between lack of decision-making authority suggested by Hauke et al. (2011), the study by Clays et al. (2007) identified that for men the prevalence of low back pain was significantly related to baseline limited latitude in decision-making. The authors also found that for men low back pain was not significantly related to high le vels of job strain, low wages and lack of job satisfaction, feeling stressed at work and feeling depressed. However, for women, they found that high levels of job insecurity, feeling stressed at work and feeling depressed did not significantly increase the relative risks for low back pain. \uf0a7 Work-life conflict Working in non-working time impacts the work-life balance and in some cases can result in work-life conflict. According to the sixth EWCS, one in five workers (22 %) is working in their free time several times a month, and 2 % of all workers reported working daily in their free time to meet work demands; this is most common in managers (7 %), agricultural workers (7 %) and professionals (5 %) (Eurofound, 2017). There is literature that shows an association between work life conflict and MSDs. In a survey of 6,091 service sector employees in Switzerland, H\u00e4mmig et al. (2011) found that work-life conflict is significantly and quite strongly associated with MSDs even when various control variables (gender, age, education, physical activity) and other covariates (physical strain at work, time pressure at work, workload, job autonomy, general stress) are adjusted for. This is also supported by the findings of Clays et al. (2007), who found that both work and non-work-related psychosocial factors constitute non-negligible risks for developing low back pain. As suggested by Kim et al. (2013), there are several explanations for pathways linking work-family conflict and MSDs. One of the factors could be that, when experiencing this conflict, workers may be distracted by non-work duties while working, which has an impact on job demands and could influence musculoskeletal pain. Another possible factor is stress as this could be caused by work-life conflict, which may result in increased muscle tension, which may then lead to musculoskeletal pain. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 21 \uf0a7 Adverse social behaviours Most research on the impact of psychosocial factors on MSDs has focused on job demands and job control. Other psychosocial factors, related to the quality of relationships at work, have not been studied in detail. The results of a study by Vignoli et al. (2015) confirm that exposure to bullying is linked to MSDs (in the low back, upper back and neck regions). The authors suggest that there is a direct effect of bullying and an indirect effect mediated by psychological stress. The authors argue that as bullying is associated with strong feelings of anxiety and anxiety is one of the strong mediators between psychosocial factors and MSDs, there is a reason to assume that psychological stress generated by bullying has an even more important role in the occurrence of MSDs than demonstrated in the study. They suggest that more research is needed in this area. 3.3 Changes in sectoral employment Structural changes in the economy, consisting of a fall in agriculture and manufacturing and a large increase in services, result in shifts in sectoral employment and consequently changing patterns of exposure to workplace hazards. According to Eurostat Labour Force Survey data, in total there were 34.6 million people employed in manufacturing in 2007 across the EU . This had fallen to 32.6 million in 2017. Within public administration, defence, education, human health and social work the size of the workforce increased from 51.4 million in 2007 to 55.5 million in 2017. Finally, in wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food services the numbers employed increased from 56.5 million in 2007 to 58.4 million in 2017. Eurostat data also show that the number of people employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing was 10.3 million in 2008 and had fallen to 8.6 million in 2017 . In construction, the numbers fell from 18.4 million in 2008 to 15 million workers in 2017. Over the same period, the number of workers in human health and social work activities increased from 20.9 million to 24.2 million, and the numbers in the accommodation and food sector increased from 9.2 million in 2008 to 10.7 million in 2017. In 2016, nearly half of all employment in the EU was concentrated in two economic activities: wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food services (24.7 %) and public administration, defence, education, human health and social work activities (23.7 %) ( 3 ). These shifts in employment towards the service sector result in an increasing number of workers being exposed to emotional demands at work, a psychosocial risk factor. In fact, according to data from the EWCS, the indicator \u2018handling angry clients, customers, patients, pupils\u2019 (one of the indicators for emotional demands), has been increasing since 2010, and the proportion of workers handling angry clients all or almost of all the time nearly doubled between 2010 and 2015. The greatest increases are seen in education, followed by the health sector and commerce and hospitality, the sectors where workers have to deal more often with third parties. According to EWCS data (Eurofound, 2017), those sectors are also the most exposed to adverse social behaviours. Service and sales workers report more often than average being subjected to unwanted sexual attention (4 %) and sexual harassment (2 %), and they are also considerably more often victims of verbal abuse (16 %), humiliating behaviour (8 %) and threats (7 %). As much as 5 % of workers from this group report having been subjected to physical violence at work in the previous 12 months and around 6 % to bullying/harassment. The health sector reported the highest percentage of workers subjected to all of the adverse social behaviours, with the exception of workplace threats, which was found most common in public administration (11 %). There have also been increases in the numbers of workers involved in sedentary and office based work, again with recognised associations with MSDs. Although the work tasks have changed and the exposure patterns change, the MSD risk factors are not necessarily removed. Eurofound (2017) constructed three indices to examine risks in different occupational groups. This included posture-related risk, based on exposure to vibrations, tiring positions, lifting people, carrying heavy loads and repetitive movements. Additional indices include exposure to biological and chemical ( 3 ) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20171024-1 ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 22 risks (including inhaling smoke, toxic vapours and handling chemical products and infectious materials) and ambient risks including vibration, noise and temperature extremes. Using these risk indices, in Eurofound (2017) the rates in different occupational groups were examined. These data are presented in Table 5. Table 5 Posture-related risks by occupation in the EU-28 Occupational group Posture-related risk score Ambient risks Managers 16 11 Professionals 16 10 Technicians 18 11 Clerks 16 8 Service and sales workers 24 14 Agricultural workers 31 30 Craft workers 37 31 Plant and machinery operators 34 27 Elementary occupations 30 20 EU-28 average 24 16 Source: European Working Conditions Survey, Eurofound Taking the United Kingdom as an example, the UK LFS data for 2017/18 show that the highest work- related MSD levels were reported in the sectors agriculture, forestry and fisheries; construction; transportation and storage; public administration and defence; and human health and social work activities (HSE, 2017). Agricultural workers had an estimated prevalence of self-reported MSDs of 2,450 per 100,000 workers and construction workers had a prevalence of 2,310 per 100,000 workers compared with public administration and defence and transportation and storage with an estimated prevalence of 1,570 per 100,000 workers. Health and social care activities had an estimated rate of 1,460 MSDs per 100,000 workers\u2019 These figures are illustrated in Figure 3. ",

Rate per 100,000 workers * Rate based on fewer than 30 sample Source: HSE, 2017 Changes in the proportion of people in the employment sectors would reduce the number of people being exposed to physical MSDs hazards. However, the shifting of the workforce into health and social work activities and accommodation and food is not likely to have lessened the risks, as both of these sectors incur exposure not only to physical MSDs but also to psychosocial hazards. Furthermore, when examining the percentage of workers reporting exposure to risk factors that can adversely affect work- related health and mental well-being, the results in Table 6 show that these remain high across all sectors. Table 6 Percentage of workers reporting health problems and exposure to psychosocial risks, 2013 NACE Code/sector Percentage of workers reporting a work-related health problem Percentage of workers reporting exposure to risk factors that can adversely affect mental well-being A/Agriculture, fisheries farming 7.3 18.4 B-E 7.3 25.1 F/Construction 8.5 24.7 G-J 7.0 26.9 K-U 8.0 31.5 NACE, a European industry standard classification system for economic activities.

        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 24 In summary, while the EU has undergone a shift in the sectors that people are employed in, this does not necessarily mean a reduction in exposure to either physical or psychosocial risks. For example, the number of people working in health and social care has increased, and in this sector there are exposures to both physical (patient handling) and psychosocial (emotional demands) risks. Although the main focus of prevention remains on physical work tasks, the pathways for the impact of psychosocial risks on the development of MSDs suggested by Hauke et al. (2011) may indicate a secondary route for prevention. In addition, there is evidence of a strong interaction between work-related environmental and psychosocial factors affecting MSDs and the risk of exposure to both sets of factors is greater than the risk of high exposure to only one of the factors (see above, Magnavita et al. (2011)). Therefore, it is unlikely that the shift from sectors traditionally considered high risk, such as agriculture and construction, to service and health care sectors would reduce the prevalence of MSDs. 3.4 Changing exposures/changing ways of working This section examines changes in the workplace and work processes as a result of the increased use of technology including digitalisation in the workplace, changing work processes, automation and robotics. It is clear that, while technology has the potential to improve work or remove the need for human exposure to hazardous work, this is not always reflected in its implementation. \uf0a7 Digitalisation of work Technology changes are often seen as a means of increasing productivity. As a result, more tasks have been digitalised. This has been seen across all sectors, not just in high-technology working environments. The extent of the digitalisation of work was examined in Germany by Ahlers (2016). Figure 4 shows the extent of this change across all industries, not limited to the obvious sector of information and communications technology (ICT). While such innovations give the workforce the opportunity to work more flexibly in relation to where and when they work, Popma (2013) suggests that there can be a blurring of boundaries between work and home life (leading to a potential increase in psychosocial risks).

        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 25 Valenduc & Vendremin (2016) highlighted a number of changes in the world of work due to digital technologies such as cloud computing, big data, automation and robotics. These include changes in employment patterns, an increase in the casualisation of work and an increase to 7 % in the numbers of workers who are remote and/or mobile workers across the EU. Figure 5 presents this change and shows a shift from being employed to being self-employed and from casual to collaborative work. The consequences of this change is that more people may become self-employed or work casually; this may be without the necessary OSH protection in place. Eurofound and the International Labour Organisation (2017) estimated that 17 % of employees in the EU are working in telework or mobile work using ICT. It is difficult to estimate the number of people involved in more casual working arrangements. However, we can look at how business is adjusting to using technology ( 4 ). For businesses, 95 % have access to the internet (through both fixed and mobile broadband). In 2016, half of all EU businesses provided internet access for staff. In this 2017 report, 69 % of businesses reported providing mobile devices for their staff. There is an increasing provision of access and equipment at work, as well as increased use of technology at home. The number of businesses becoming involved in e-commerce through websites has also increased, giving them new access to information on products, advertising jobs, accepting online applications, and ordering and making reservations and bookings online; overall 80 % of businesses have a website but not all involve e-commerce. Eltayeb et al., (2007) found that 54 % of Dutch computer workers reported at least one MSD symptom in the arm, neck or shoulder. The annual prevalence of shoulder symptoms was 31 % and of neck symptoms 33%. Griffiths, Mackey & Adamson (2007) in their review of the impact of computerised work on MSDs found that professionals were encouraged to carry out work with high mental demands for long hours with inadequate breaks. It was suggested that this impacted on work pace resulting in increased muscle tension. While we have seen changes in technology including increased ICT use, there have also been changes in the types of equipment used. Griffiths et al. (2007) highlighted the risk factors associated with computer use, and this is discussed further in the section on changes in work processes. New types of technology, including smartphone use, was examined by Etivipart, Viriyarojanakul & Redhead (2017). This systematic review examining 11 papers found that, due to neck flexion when using smartphones, muscle activity in the muscle groups supporting the neck (erector spinae, upper trapezius and neck extensor muscles) was increased. There also appeared to be increased neck flexion when users were sitting down. The authors conclude that smartphone use may contribute to MSDs. Gustafsson et al. (2012) examined the impact of texting on MSDs in a cohort of young people aged 20- 25 years over a five-year period. The study identified positive associations between texting and neck and shoulder pain. Examining those who had been symptom free at the start of the study, significant associations were found between texting and new cases of hand and finger symptoms. For those with symptoms at baseline, neck and upper back symptoms continued to occur. This study highlights the speed at which MSDs can occur within a younger population during exposure to new technology. Although new technology offers opportunities for more flexible working, there is a need to evaluate its use in relation to possible MSD risks arising from poor posture. \uf0a7 New forms of contract The changes in technology do give individuals more flexibility in where and when they work. Valenduc & Vendramin (2016) describe these new ways in Figure 5. ( 4 ) Digital economy & society in the EU, 2018: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/ict/bloc-1a.html ",

Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 26 Figure 5 New forms of employment Source: Eurofound, 2015 reported in Valenduc & Vendramin, 2016 EU-OSHA (2017) highlights that the concern about online platform working is not only the employer/employee relationship, and the fact that individuals are often seen as self-employed, but also what this means in relation to OSH regulation. There are different applications of the law depending on the nature of the employment. The perception is that, like agency and temporary workers, who we know have higher injury rates, online platform workers may also be at increased risk. Although this type of work does give the worker additional flexibility, there are still many concerns with regard to the lack of OSH protection. Because such workers often work in isolation, social dialogue and other supporting mechanisms are not commonly available either.

        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 27 We are also seeing a change in the relationship between the employer and the worker and between the customer and the worker. The use of apps to contract out work does increase workers\u2019 autonomy. However, there is concern that the lack of a common workplace or of a standard employment relationship puts these workers at risk. Apart from any psychosocial risks, such changes in employment, including the push to casualisation of work and self-employment, has the potential to expose individuals to increased hazards through a lack of OSH protection. For example, is the individual working on their computer at home subjected to the same level of scrutiny as their office-based colleagues in respect of the national regulations derived from the DSE Directive? As a further complication, Valenduc & Vendramin (2016) point out that there may also be risks from working under high pressure or there not being enough work for those on zero-hours contracts (perhaps making them more reluctant to complain or more likely to tolerate poor working conditions). \uf0a7 E-retail Digitalisation has also impacted the retail sector, and EU OSHA (2018) has summarised some of the OSH issues around e-retail and internet retail. Online sales in the EU reached EUR 232.60 billion in 2016, an increase of 15.6 % on the preceding year. This change in consumer behaviour has led to an increasing demand for cheaper products and faster delivery; this may not result in the best job designs in environments where costs are tightly controlled. There has been an increase in employment in fulfilment distribution centres where orders are picked from storage, packed then delivered. While there has been some media coverage of the impact of different picking systems and the speeds required and demands made of the workforce, the job itself already has known musculoskeletal risks including (EU OSHA, 2018; Webster et al., 2014): \uf0a7 frequent repetitious picking; \uf0a7 rates of work imposed by a process; \uf0a7 awkward and static postures (handling from high or low shelving, lifting objects out of or putting them into cramped spaces, bending or twisting the torso while lifting or holding heavy items); \uf0a7 prolonged pushing and pulling of trolleys or roll cages; and \uf0a7 heavy lifting: o heavy lifting done with one hand or without the assistance of mechanical devices; o heavy lifting while bending over, reaching above shoulder height or twisting. Although in larger scale operations there has been an increase in mechanisation, this is not likely to be the case in smaller retail outlets where loads will still have to be manually handled, the level of automation is often dependent on the size of the parent company and there is a trade-off between the costs of automation versus the cost of human workers (Webster et al., 2014), in some cases employing agency staff and so bypassing some of the employer\u2019s responsibilities. The EU OSHA (2018) report also highlights the impact of monitoring, including countdown systems, increasing both physical and psychosocial demands. Although automation decreases the load on the human, workers may be exposed to increased repetitive work, including quality assurance and packing of products. The increase in e-retail also needs an increase in the number of delivery drivers, often individuals using private vehicles working as part of the gig economy. Driving is known to increase reported MSDs, and EU-OSHA identified the following as additional risk factors: \uf0a7 provision of less manual handling equipment; \uf0a7 compromised employer terms and conditions for \u2018gig economy\u2019 drivers, such as reduced pay and employer support, for example no paid holidays and no paid sickness absence; \uf0a7 long working hours, often linked to performance-related pay (\u2018pay per drop\u2019), possibly resulting in driver fatigue and thereby contributing to an increase in road traffic incidents; \uf0a7 increased performance demands (linked to fast delivery and specific delivery times); and \uf0a7 increased performance monitoring of drivers, resulting in potential risk of stress for some. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 28 Although larger retail companies have invested in ergonomic design of delivery vehicles to reduce manual handling and musculoskeletal risks, this is not evident for other delivery drivers. \uf0a7 Changes in work processes Manufacturing is one sector in which production has changed to lean production environments using systems such as just-in-time, Six Sigma or agile manufacturing processes. Westgaard & Winkel (2011) carried out a systematic review evaluating the impact of lean practices as part of workplace rationalisation. From the 34 studies identified, approximately half reported negative impacts on safety and health, including increases in both work volume and intensification. These resulted in increased stress and a mismatch between demands and resources. More positively, there was an increase in the scope of the job, quality and work enrichment. However, without proper evaluation of the impacts on humans, the authors perceive that workers with the most routine jobs will be put more at risk. Br\u00e4nnmark & H\u00e5kansson (2012), in their review of lean manufacturing and MSD risk, evaluated 23 papers. Their findings emphasised a lack of consistency and quality within the published literature. However, it was suggested that not using ergonomists in the work design process tended to result in the risks of MSDs being increased. In a cross-sectional comparative analysis, Womack, Armstrong & Liker (2009) compared 56 similar jobs in two plants, one that had implemented lean manufacturing and one that was still using traditional methods, by assessing repetition, force and posture. Productivity was increased and waiting times reduced but exposure to repetitive work was increased within the lean manufacturing plant. In comparison, threshold values for risks from repetition and force were lower in the lean production plant. Koukoulaki (2014) examined the impact of lean production techniques on MSDs and psychosocial risks over a 20-year period. This study identified that, in the early days of lean production, the level of MSD reporting increased within the automotive industries. This was thought to be because of rigid implementation processes, an increased speed of production and a lack of recovery time. However, although the risks of developing MSDs were present, this did not always result in an increase in the prevalence of symptoms. The authors suggest that, perhaps due to peer pressure within the working environment, symptoms were not always reported. This study also examined psychosocial risks and found that these were also more evident in lean production environments and that their impact was likely to be greater where there was no social support from co-workers or line managers. There are mixed messages about the impact of lean production environments on exposure to MSD hazards including force, repetition and poor posture However, the literature reviewed here does stress the importance of considering ergonomic risks, psychosocial risks and participation from the workforce in redesigning work processes. Looking at the healthcare environment, Davis & Kotowski (2015) highlight the impact of MSDs in nurses and nursing assistants in their review, which included 132 studies. The review highlights low back pain in nurses as one of the main injuries reported, but the authors do question whether the focus on low back pain has caused researchers to miss other areas, including shoulder and neck pain. With the change in workplace policies towards \u2018no-lifting\u2019 of patients strategy, but using other means including sliding patients or using lifting aids, the risks and consequent pain and discomfort may have moved to other areas of the body including the shoulders and neck. The situation is exacerbated by increasing numbers of obese patients. Furthermore, changes in treatment and convalescence patterns mean that more people are convalescing at home, resulting in the burden of handling patients being moved to other carers. For those involved in domestic care work, this means going into people\u2019s homes, where there is little control over the work environment and usually less access to lifting aids. Managing the risks from computer work, including the pace of work and work demands, is important. \uf0a7 Automation and robotics While the automation of work tasks has been a continuing evolution in many work environments, the impact of this has been concern about increasing levels of unemployment. In addition to this, automation in the workplace may result in increased machine pacing of humans, increasing both physical and psychosocial risks to workers. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 29 Alongside this is the debate about the increased use of robots and autonomous robots in all sectors. At the current time, this debate is in its infancy but groups including EU-OSHA and the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have started discussions around this. In an EU-OSHA (2015) discussion paper, the use of robots is seen as both an opportunity and a challenge. Robots could reduce exposure to repetitive work and high-hazard environments. However, many workers have never experienced working with robots and their increased use in autonomous systems within workplaces needs to be further examined. In its discussion paper on e-retail, EU-OSHA (2018) discussed the most likely next development in this sector, which includes the use of collaborative robots for picking tasks. However, humans will still be part of this working system for tasks that require dexterity, quality assurance and potentially repetitive tasks including repackaging or waste removal. Although some risks can be removed by automation, it is not clear that it will eliminate all musculoskeletal risks. \uf0a7 Sedentary work The impact of sedentary work and lack of physical activity in the workplace is now seen as a major health risk, including for MSDs. Data from the EWCS suggest that 25 % of men and 31 % of women are sitting all or most of the time (Eurofound, 2017). A further one third (29 % of women and 31 % of men) were sitting between 25 % and 75 % of the time. The German Federal Institute for Safety and Health estimates that an office worker can spend up to 80,000 hours of their working life seated. Straker & Mathiassen (2009) highlight that, from an ergonomics perspective, less physical workload has historically been seen as better. Thresholds were set in the 1960s for maximal physical activity (50 % of maximal oxygen uptake for an 8-hour shift). This was at a time when jobs were physically demanding. However, the rise of the information economy resulted in an exponential increase in jobs and tasks involving prolonged sitting at a computer. Straker & Mathiassen (2009) suggest that there needs to be a paradigm shift in ergonomics to encourage more physical activity and design work not only to avoid ill health but to improve health and physical capacity. Within its Total Worker Health programme NIOSH (2017) focuses on the health impacts of sedentary work including non-communicable diseases as well as MSDs. There is a clear need to focus on how work can be designed to increase movement by improving control over work, ensuring that facilities such as lockers or changing rooms are available for people who want to exercise during the working day and thinking about how work is designed to enable appropriate movement. 3.5 Health behaviours Although the focus of this review is on work-related risk factors for MSDs, poor health behaviours have also been associated with the occurrence of MSDs. This section aims to briefly look at those factors, as they can be influenced by workplace health promotion. However, health behaviours are influenced by numerous factors, and a number of studies show associations between workplace stress and shift work and unhealthy behaviours including smoking and poor eating habits. 3.5.1 Body mass index One of the factors increasing the risk of MSDs is obesity. The worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly doubled between 1980 and 2008 ( 5 ). Across the EU, 51.5 % of the population was considered overweight in 2014. Within this group, 35.7 % were pre-obese (body mass index, or BMI, of between 25 and 30) and 15.9 % were obese (BMI greater than 30) ( 6 ). This was an increase compared with 2008 when 50 % were obese. Higher BMI has been found to be associated with MSDs in several studies (da Costa & Vieira, 2010; Faghri & Momeni, 2014; Sethi, Sandhu & Imbanathan, 2011; Viester et al., 2013). The study by Viester et al. (2013) based on the Netherlands Working Conditions Survey found, using normal weight as a reference point, that musculoskeletal symptoms, including back problems and neck ( 5 ) http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases/obesity/data-and-statistics ( 6 ) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7700898/3-20102016-BP-EN.pdf/c26b037b-d5f3-4c05-89c1- 00bf0b98d646 ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 30 and shoulder problems, were associated with being obese and that upper and lower extremity problems were significantly associated with being both overweight and obese. Problems in the lower extremities may not be a surprise because of the additional biomechanical stress put on the lower limbs by being overweight. The study by Viester et al. (2013) also examined the impact of high workloads. Overall reporting of MSDs was higher for those with higher BMI (including those who were obese) and higher workloads. Recovery from injury was also assessed in this study: those with a higher BMI took longer to recover. It is likely, however, that the influence of obesity varies for the different MSDs. For example, Graveling (2018) reported an association between obesity and increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome but not of epicondylitis (both leading to upper limb pain and other symptoms). 3.5.2 Physical inactivity It is recommended that adults take 150 minutes of physical activity (outside work) each week (WHO, 2018). In 2014, it was estimated that 48.8 % of adults were taking no exercise ( 7 ). The effect of physical inactivity on MSDs was investigated by Nilsen, Holtermann & Mork (2007), who examined BMI and physical activity in the general adult population. The authors concluded that high levels of inactivity and higher BMI both lead to increased risk of chronic pain in the low back and neck/shoulders. Andorsen et al. (2014) also found that lower rates of physical activity were associated with increased reporting of musculoskeletal symptoms. Kristensen et al. (2014) examined aerobic fitness in men at conscription age in Norway (18/19 years) and followed them up for musculoskeletal symptoms 5-15 years later. This study identified a moderate association between higher levels of aerobic fitness and reduced risk of MSDs in later life. The authors state that confounding was an issue in this study, as both intellectual capacity and parental education levels had more of an effect on the occurrence of MSDs than aerobic fitness. 3.5.3 Smoking According to the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2018) ( 8 ), current rates of tobacco smoking in the EU are 28 %, although there are many international and national policies aimed at smoking reduction. Smoking has also been found to be associated with MSDs by other authors (e.g. Andorsen et al., 2014; da Costa & Vieira, 2010). Andorsen et al. (2014) found that current smoking was significantly associated with musculoskeletal symptoms among both men and women but showed a stronger effect in women (men odds ratio, OR = 1.25, 95 % CI 1.02-1.52; women OR = 1.60, 95 % CI 1.30-1.96). As a result, the authors suggest that smoking cessation may benefit women more than men. In summary, with regard to the health that people bring to work, there is still a need for health promotion and improved health behaviours, including losing weight, increasing physical activity and stopping smoking. Fahgri & Momeni (2014) highlight the importance that workplace-based weight management programmes can have and identified reduced reporting of MSDs as one of the outcomes in their study. 3.6 Demographic change 3.6.1 Age The rates of MSDs vary with age, and increasing rates are reported across the population but specifically in the older and youngest populations (see Figure 7). There has been much discussion about the reasons for this increase and whether it is down to duration of exposure (older workers may have been exposed to workplace risk factors for longer) or whether they are more at risk because of the ( 7 ) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/-/hlth_ehis_pe2e ( 8 ) http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/tobacco/data-and-statistics ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 31 physiological changes associated with age (such as reductions in muscle strength or joint flexibility). Coggon et al. (2013), in their study of disabling low back pain and disabling wrist or hand pain, identified an increasing risk with age associated with both disabling low back pain and disabling hand or wrist pain. Whatever the source of this increase in prevalence of MSDs with age, we are currently promoting the extension of working lives. Palmer & Goodson (2015), in their review of ageing, musculoskeletal health and work, corroborated the fact that musculoskeletal problems are more common in older workers. However, this does raise the question of whether individuals should continue working and possibly exacerbate their symptoms or leave the workplace. Their review highlights the trade-off that exists between work being positive for maintained muscle strength, mobility and good psychological health, on the one hand, and older workers perhaps struggling with the demands of work, on the other. They also identified a number of evidence gaps in their research including the lack of follow-up for patients returning to work with health problems. Palmer & Goodson (2014) draw the following conclusions in relation to older workers musculoskeletal problems, and work: \uf0a7 MSDs are very common; their prevalence generally rises in older people. \uf0a7 At older ages MSDs have a considerable impact on people\u2019s employment prospects. \uf0a7 Factors that influence job retention in older people include the type of MSD, its severity and treatment, the presence of comorbidity, people\u2019s attitudes to work and retirement, and the work environment\u2019s demands. \uf0a7 Interventions to optimise symptom control and provide a more flexible and adaptive work environment can substantially improve older people\u2019s prospects of remaining in work. \uf0a7 Based on the present evidence, far more needs to be done in these areas if individuals with MSDs are to realise the possibility of extending their working lives. The results of the 2015 EWCS showed that exposure to painful and tiring positions and repetitive hand or arm movements for at least a quarter of the time was reported by 43 % and 61 % of respondents, respectively. When this was examined by age, comparing those under 35 years old with those over 50 years old, exposure to both repetitive arm movements (63 % vs 58 %) and moving and lifting heavy loads (35 % vs 29 %) was reduced. However, for exposure to painful and tiring positions, slightly more over-50s reported being exposed (43 %, compared with 42 % in the under 35-year-old group). For patient handling slightly fewer over-50s again reported being exposed (9 %, compared with 10 % in the under 35-year-old group). Despite these generally minor changes (which could be within the error sampling of the survey), these data indicate that workers are still reporting being exposed to considerable postural risks over the age of 50. However, returning to Figure 7, we can see that MSD reporting is also high in the youngest age group, which suggests that young people are either starting their working lives with problems or quickly developing musculoskeletal problems. A literature review by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) pointed out that musculoskeletal discomfort associated with children\u2019s computer use has been noted in a number of studies as well as the postural risks associated with using devices such as computers and tablets. The review also refers to recent findings suggesting an increase in neck symptoms related to television, phone and tablet use and in visual symptoms related to increased use of phones and tablets in particular. Because of demographic change and the push to extend working lives, the increase in the number of older workers is likely to be contributing to the continued high prevalence of MSDs. Although there does appear to be a duration of exposure effect for MSDs, this is often confounded, as those with longer duration of exposure are part of an older workforce. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 32 Figure 7 Prevalence (%) of MSDs by age group Source: Eurostat Labour Force Survey ad-hoc module 2013 One of the main issues around age and the prevalence of MSDs is that there is not a clear cause-effect relationship between age and MSD occurrence. The review by Okunribido & Wynn (2010) identified that there are age-related physiological/physical changes, including a reduction in joint mobility, a reduction in muscle strength and a slowing of movement. These are also influenced by other factors including level of habitual physical activity and the physical demands of the individual\u2019s work (which clearly affect their habitual levels of activity). Older workers may need to work closer to the limits of their capabilities, which does increase the risk of sustaining an MSD (Okunribido & Wynn, 2010). Davis et al. (2014) found that the frequency and costs of MSDs increases with age but that is also influenced by job-specific risk factors. These authors also make the point that the impact of age alone on MSDs cannot be calculated, because of the confounding factors of lifestyle, health behaviours and other risks. Andorsen et al. (2014) examined the prevalence of MSDs in Norwegian women and suggested that positive associations between age and the prevalence of MSDs may be explained by both longer duration of exposure and changes in lifestyle variables over time. While we are attempting to extend working lives, there is evidence to show that the prevalence of MSDs increases with age. Areas for recommended future research have been identified, but large evidence gaps remain at the moment, including the answer to the question of whether it is better to continue working with symptoms. 3.6.2 Gender The Eurostat data, broken down into gender differences for MSD reporting, shows a variety of patterns across the EU-28 (see Table 7). Generally, men report more MSD symptoms than women, although there are differences depending on MSD. Thus, men are more likely to report back problems but more women report neck, shoulder, arm or hand problems (EU OSHA, 2016b). In their study across 18 countries, Coggon et al. (2013) identified female gender as being significantly associated with disabling low back pain (PRR = 1.31, 95 % CI 1.16-1.47) and disabling wrist or hand pain (PRR = 1.56, 95 % CI 1.37-1.78). 0.0 10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0 60.0 70.0 80.0 E u r o p e a n U n i o n ( c u r r e n t \u2026 E u r o p e a n U n i o n ( b e f o r e \u2026 E u r o p e a n U n i o n ( b e f o r e \u2026 B e l g i u m B u l g a r i a C z e c h R e p u b l i c D e n m a r k G e r m a n y ( u n t i l 1 9 9 0 \u2026 E s t o n i a I r e l a n d G r e e c e S p a i n F r a n c e C r o a t i a I t a l y C y p r u s L a t v i a L i t h u a n i a L u x e m b o u r g H u n g a r y M a l t a N e t h e r l a n d s A u s t r i a P o l a n d P o r t u g a l R o m a n i a S l o v e n i a S l o v a k i a F i n l a n d S w e d e n U n i t e d K i n g d o m I c e l a n d N o r w a y S w i t z e r l a n d T u r k e y P e r c e n t a g e 15-34 years 35 to 54 years 55 to 64 years ",

(2014) found that being female increased the risk of having a chronic MSD by 66 %. Collins & O\u2019Sullivan (2010) in a cross-sectional study found that women reported more MSDs than men. The authors suggested that this was due to exposure to both physical and psychosocial risks. Gender differences in MSD reporting reflect horizontal and vertical segregation in the labour market and within the workplace resulting in different exposure to risks. As an example of horizontal segregation, more women are employed in health and social care and thus have a greater exposure to risks such as lifting and handling people. As a result of vertical segregation, there is evidence that, because of women\u2019s reduced workplace mobility, they are more likely to remain in tasks that result in greater exposure to repetitive movements (EU OSHA, 2016b). Sadeghian et al. (2014) examined MSDs in laboratory workers in a cross-sectional study. The authors found that being female was a significant risk factor for back pain (OR = 2.537, 95 % CI 1.006-6.399), shoulder pain (OR = 5.353, 95 % CI 1.690- 6.955) and hand/wrist pain (OR = 4.282, 95 % CI 10.760-17.036). This study also examined heavy workloads at home as an additional risk factor and this was considered significant for hand/wrist pain. This dual role of female workers may therefore increase their overall risks of developing at least some types of MSDs. When considering age and gender, women over 55 years old report more musculoskeletal symptoms than men (64.3 % vs 60.3 %) ( 9 ). Disorders including carpal tunnel syndrome and tenosynovitis are reported more frequently by women, as are self-reported neck, shoulder, arm or hand problems. This is thought to be because of the influence of both horizontal and vertical segregation in the workforce. As the number of women workers has increased across the EU and with the extension of working lives, without appropriate intervention, this is likely to be a major source of the increasing prevalence of MSDs and, with current trends in employment, is likely to increase in future years. When we look at data on shifts in demographics in the workplace, the largest increase in numbers has been observed in women over 50 years old.

        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 35 3.7 Health beliefs/somatisation The impact of health beliefs on ill health occurrence has been researched for many decades. Research in this context has focused on somatisation (the manifestation of physical symptoms from psychological distress) as well as beliefs about what makes us ill. Although it is difficult to quantify is how many individuals are affected by this, the pathways from beliefs to symptoms have been well researched, including the belief that work will make you ill. When examining health beliefs and somatisation Andorsen et al. (2014) found that self-perceived poor health was related to an increased likelihood of reporting MSDs. However, the authors also point out that a high burden of MSDs leads to a poor self-perceived health status but not vice versa. In their study across 18 different countries, Coggon et al. (2013) used the Brief Symptom Inventory to evaluate somatisation. This study identified that, as the number of distressing somatic symptoms increased in the previous week from zero to one, then two or more, there was a significantly increased risk of disabling low back pain and disabling wrist or hand pain. Although such an association is not necessarily indicative of causation, it does highlight an interplay between physical and somatic symptoms. Farioli et al. (2014) also found this association between somatising symptoms and back pain and (separately) neck and upper limb pain across the EU. People also bring health beliefs to work and these can influence health in both positive and negative ways. When examining health beliefs around MSDs, Coggon et al., (2013) found that, for disabling low back pain and disabling wrist or hand pain, having adverse beliefs around how they might relate to work, prognosis and (for disabling wrist or hand pain) having \u2018heard of [repetitive strain injuries] or equivalent\u2019 were each found to be significantly associated with symptom occurrence. However, a cross-sectional study can neither determine that these are causal relationships nor the directions of the associations. Nevertheless, the authors consider that the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that awareness of musculoskeletal pain and adverse beliefs about it increase its reporting in the workplace. This may be only a small effect overall. Hoe et al. (2012b) examined nurses in Australia in relation to MSDs, somatisation and health beliefs. Using the Fear Avoidance Beliefs questionnaire, the study found that, where two symptoms out of seven were reported as distressing (somatisation tendency), this was associated with neck pain, shoulder pain and neck and shoulder pain. Work causation beliefs were found to be associated with both neck and shoulder pain but not with neck or shoulder pain. There appears to be a lack of information available on symptoms and recovery in relation to low back pain and wrist and hand pain. The impact of health beliefs should be examined further, as beliefs around recovery time and causation may be incorrect and having accurate information may influence occurrence and recovery. 3.8 Socio-economic differences Farioli et al. (2014) analysed data across the EU from the fifth EWCS. In total, they included 35,550 participants in their analysis. They identified wide variations in MSDs reported by country, including a prevalence of reported back pain of 63.8 % in Portugal versus 25.7 % in Ireland and of upper limb pain of 67.7 % in Finland versus 26.6 % in Ireland. Further analyses were carried out to examine socio- economic differences between countries, and back pain was associated with higher levels of expenditure on social protection. Conversely, the prevalence of pain was found to be lower in countries with higher rates of social exclusion and more people at risk of poverty. The authors are cautious in their interpretation of these results because of the nature of the step-wise analysis carried out. However, they suggest that the increase in back pain in countries with increased social protection may be psychological and attributable to easier access to income support and protection from poverty. Eurogip (2016), reviewed MSD reporting and the recognition of MSDs as occupational diseases in 10 European countries. Examining data on trends collected between 2007 and 2014, Sweden, Switzerland and Finland report continuing decreases in the number of reported and recognised MSDs. Denmark and Spain showed a gradual decline over the same period, and Italy, Belgium and France showed an ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 36 increasing trend, although it decreased in France after 2012. When looking at these data in more depth, there are also a number of other changes that occurred simultaneously. In Italy, in 2008 MSDs were added to the list of occupational diseases; in Belgium, the increased rates in 2013 relate to the addition of tendinopathies to the list of occupational diseases in 2012; and, in France, rates started to reduce in 2012 after the criteria for the recognition of shoulder and elbow MSDs were changed. This report also highlights that, until 2011, information campaigns were carried out in both Italy and France, which may have led to increased reporting of MSDs. This study also serves to highlight that comparisons between countries are difficult because of differences between countries in what MSDs are recognised as occupational diseases. Socio-economic differences and changes in reporting are shown to have an impact on MSD reporting. At the current time, this is perceived as being affected by changes in reporting requirements and the availability of social and other support. The study by Eurogip emphasises the impact that changes in reporting systems have on recorded rates of MSDs, specifically those that are added to the list of industrial diseases. 4 What are the gaps in risk assessment and prevention practices? The aim of this section is to examine the gaps in risk assessment and prevention practices. This includes coverage of risk assessment requirements as well as the barriers to and facilitators of intervening to prevent MSDs. 4.1 Why are musculoskeletal disorders still a problem? Provisions for the prevention of MSDs are included in the Manual Handling Directive and the DSE Directive. However these two directives do not cover all MSD risks and, in particular, those risks associated with many repetitive or forceful industrial tasks are not covered by either directive. These are only covered by the non-specific provisions of the Framework Directive, although the Work Equipment Directive does require consideration of ergonomic factors. In the last four decades, a large number of tools and sources of guidance on risk assessment and implementing risk reduction have been developed and made available. However, in the light of this, Wells (2009) posed the question: Why have we not solved the MSD problem? This was with the intention of trying to identify which aspects of management and prevention were ineffective. Wells does this by asking the following questions: 1. How well do we understand MSDs and their burdens? 2. How good are our risk factors at predicting MSDs? 3. How effective and informative are our current workplace approaches to MSD assessment? 4. How effective are the recommended interventions in actually reducing MSDs in the workplace? 5. How thoroughly and widely implemented are workplace interventions to prevent MSDs? 6. How well are we improving disability outcomes for MSDs? Discussing each of these questions, Wells (2009) attempts to summarise the current state of knowledge, highlight the gaps and emphasise the need for \u2018MSD prevention strategies that are feasible, socially acceptable, affordable, scalable and sustainable, have good coverage for substantial parts of the working population\u2019, and, ideally, also \u2018result in measurable MSD improvements within a reasonable time-frame\u2019. Reflections on each of the questions above are summarised below: 1. Although our understanding of the aetiology of MSDs has greatly improved, understanding the mechanisms of injury gives us more insight. However, we now need to move on to intervention studies and the epidemiology of MSDs. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 37 2. There appears to be a disconnect in our current knowledge in that interventions to prevent specific risk factors does not reduce the prevalence of MSDs. Poorly characterised risk factors will not improve prevention and, at the current time, these are focused on physical hazards. 3. Although there is a large variety of tools available for MSD prevention, little work has been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of these tools ( 10 ). 4. Although there is good practice in intervention research, this does not always feed through into workplace prevention if the impact on health is not actually measured. In choosing an intervention, it is important to know that the intervention addresses the risk factors, it is implemented widely, the type of intervention is known to work, and the impact must apply to a large number of individuals exposed to MSD hazards to see a reduction in exposure. 5. There is little information available about how many organisations are implementing workplace interventions to prevent MSDs. 6. Individuals who have had an MSD are more likely to have another incident. Thus, the question is how well support for receiving medical help, rehabilitation and return to work is organised. This includes social support from colleagues and managers as well as having workplace policies and procedures in place. Wells (2009) points out that, while there is a large amount of aetiologically based research, the lack of good-quality intervention studies does not help in implementing change. Bearing this in mind, there is a real need to carry out intervention studies over longer periods to evaluate the impact of different strategies. Although different sectors have taken particular approaches, these are often seen as not transferable to other sectors. 4.2 Barriers to and facilitators of preventing musculoskeletal disorders Yazdani & Wells (2018) examined barriers to and facilitators of preventing MSDs. In their scoping review, in which a thematic analysis was carried out, various barriers to and facilitators of MSD prevention were identified; these are listed in Table 8. Table 8 Barriers to and facilitators of MSD prevention Barriers Facilitators Lack of time Training, knowledge and ergonomist support Lack of resources Communication, participation and support Lack of communication Effective implementation process Lack of management support, commitment and participation Lack of knowledge and training Resistance to change Changing work environment Scope of activities (e.g. one workstation or a whole plant) Lack of trust, fear of job loss or loss of authority Process deficiencies Source: Yazdani & Wells, 2018 ( 10 ) The possible exception to this is the provision of manual handling training for which there has been evidence of its ineffectiveness for many years (e.g. Graveling, 1986), especially the generic training frequently provided. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 38 According to Yazdani & Wells (2018), barriers include lack of time made available to staff for training or for addressing relevant factors. This is strongly linked to lack of resources (money, equipment or staff), and the authors highlight that this can be due to shortage of money to intervene, poor resource management, lack of interest and/or having a short-term mind set. Lack of communication among all the relevant stakeholders is also seen as a barrier. The authors point out that a lack of continued communication between the workers and management can cause a prevention intervention to fail. They also highlight that commitment, support and participation were all required for a successful intervention. Lack of knowledge on MSDs and their potential work-relatedness may be a barrier. Resistance to change may also be a barrier if individuals are reluctant to change the way they work. There are reports of new ergonomic tools not being used because they are difficult to use or there has not been enough time to learn how to use them efficiently. The workplace culture will affect the adoption of new ways of working. Without consideration of the work culture, interventions are likely to fail. Changes in the work environment have also been identified as a potential barrier; these can be changes in management, whereby MSD prevention is stopped, or changes in employment, whereby more temporary workers are employed. Access to prevention measures may be different for temporary workers and their relative lack of training has been widely identified as a concern. The scope of activity was also seen as a barrier by Yazdani & Wells (2018). What they mean by this is whether this is one workplace change, a whole plant changing or an international corporate change. The outcome will be influenced by culture as well as the fact that interventions may not work in different sections of a business or on different continents. Awareness of cultural differences may improve this. Lack of trust, fear of job loss or loss of authority and the general climate within an organisation can also influence the success of an intervention. Process deficiencies are also seen as having a negative impact on MSD prevention. Yazdani & Wells (2018) identified a number of factors that can be barriers, including the prevention programme not fitting with the current norms and practices within the business or the intervention not being sustained over time. The final barrier identified by Yazdani & Wells (2018) was that of the difficulty of implementing controls. Their paper reports examples such as alternative equipment being difficult to use, the solution not being designed for all workers or the focus being on changing behaviour rather than engineering controls. Yazdani & Wells (2018) identified facilitators for successful interventions for MSD prevention, although these were less numerous than the barriers. Training, knowledge and ergonomist support were all seen as having a positive effect as well as communication and a participatory approach. Finally, their paper highlights the importance of an effective implementation process. Andersen et al. (2018), carried out a systematic review of the effect of OSH interventions in the workplace. Their review included 61 papers that examined the impact of legislation, inspection/enforcement activity, training and campaigns and the introduction of technical devices. They found that the introduction of legislation and associated enforcement activity had a positive impact by reducing injuries and fatalities. However, there is still a knowledge gap in relation to MSDs due to the lack of good-quality intervention research. In relation to what levels of intervention are effective there have been two Cochrane reviews examining interventions to prevent MSDs. Verbeek et al. (2011) carried out a Cochrane review of nine randomised controlled studies and nine cohort studies on the prevention of back pain. The results showed that those employees who received training for manual handling reported similar levels of back pain to those that had not. While the review found that there was an increase in knowledge in relation to manual handling risks, this did not translate into a change in behaviour to adopt better manual handling processes. The authors conclude that there is a moderate amount of evidence that training on manual handling is ineffective. As a result of such evidence, the UK HSE ( 11 ) is currently campaigning to reduce risks from manual handling by redesigning jobs rather than by training alone, emphasising that changing the way the work is carried out is a better way to manage risks than training.

        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 39 Hoe et al. (2012a) examined ergonomic interventions and equipment used to reduce upper limb and neck pain. In their review of 13 randomised controlled trials, they found moderate evidence for reducing neck/shoulder disorders by using an alternative mouse and an arm support; however, this did not reduce right hand MSDs more generally in right-handed people. The authors found that there was very low- quality evidence that ergonomics did not reduce upper limb disorders. However, the research used in this review was very varied in quality and outcomes. This would suggest a need for better controlled studies to be carried out to clarify this issue. Van Eerd et al. (2015) updated a review examining the use of interventions to reduce MSDs. The review included the 35 original papers plus a further 26 added as part of the update. The study identified strong evidence for resistance training and moderate evidence for the benefits of stretching, vibration feedback and forearm supports in reducing MSDs (see Table 9). The authors again highlight that, while none of the studies showed an increase in MSD symptoms, the study quality for some interventions that were included was not good enough to support any recommendations.

(2017) examined job rotation as a means of reducing MSDs in the textile industry. In this randomised controlled trial of 266 workers in the intervention group and 225 in the control group, a job rotation group was set up to review the work process and redesign the work. All participants were given some ergonomic training before job rotation was implemented. Participants were followed up at four time intervals: 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. The analysis found that job rotation did not have a positive impact on any of the measures including time lost through sickness absence, musculoskeletal symptoms or improved perception of pain. The study may highlight one of the major issues with job rotation in modern manufacturing, in that there is unlikely to be a change in the muscle groups used, as there is little variety in the jobs available; thus, redesigning the workplace rather than rotating employees within it may have more of an impact. 4.3 Little consideration given to psychosocial risk factors Many of the research papers examining the interaction between psychosocial risks and MSDs highlight the importance of assessing physical, biomechanical and psychosocial risks in the workplace. Considering the prevalence of MSDs, Macdonald & Oakman (2015) suggest that workplace risk management procedures do not reflect current evidence concerning MSDs\u2019 work-related causes and that inadequate attention is given to assessing and controlling risks from psychosocial hazards, with the conventional risk management paradigm focusing too narrowly on risks from individual hazards. Instead there should be promotion of a more holistic approach to managing the combined effects of all relevant hazards. This is supported by Hauke et al. (2011), as they suggest that organisations need to be aware that efforts to prevent MSDs should not only be limited to the physical work environment, such as technical equipment and training in lifting techniques, but should also involve improvements in the psychosocial work environment. Often the means to do this is not available as a \u2018joined-up\u2019 risk assessment process, and MSD and psychosocial risks are assessed separately. The study by Oakman et al. (2016) showed that risk management of MSDs generally only covered physical risk factors but, taking a more holistic approach, risk assessment should be aimed at both MSDs and mental health risk factors. As part of the research aiming to develop an MSD risk management toolkit, interviews and policy analysis were carried out to find out about attitudes to and beliefs about MSD occurrence and current prevention practices and to gain stakeholders\u2019 feedback on the new toolkit. The results showed that there is a need for a broader risk management framework that encompasses both MSD and psychosocial risk factors. ",

Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 41 5 Recommendations for new approaches to preventing musculoskeletal disorders Alongside examining barriers to MSD prevention, Yazdani & Wells (2018) also provide some recommendations for a successful implementation of interventions to prevent MSDs. Box 1 Recommendations for prevention Source: Yazdani & Wells, 2018 This absence of firm evidence for what works does not mean that we should do nothing to try to prevent MSDs, but much of the research that exists is not well controlled and has been carried out in complex environments where randomised controlled trials are difficult to implement. We also see from the push by the UK HSE that we need to go further than training \u2013 designing work and workplaces to reduce risks at the design stage. This includes reducing physical risks and considering how we can build movement into the working lives of those in sedentary occupations. 5.1 Psychosocial risk management as part of a holistic approach In a \u2018sounding board paper\u2019, Wells (2009) reports that the relationship between mechanical factors (e.g. repetition), work organisational factors and individual factors have been demonstrated in many types of work. Wells also suggested that the interaction of multiple factors means that there is an argument for the use of a bio-psychosocial rather than a biomedical model. In support of the multiple factors approach, Oakman & Kinsman (2016) argue that, while there is a strong body of evidence demonstrating that work- related psychosocial hazards and the psychosocial environment have an impact on MSD risks and workers health and well-being, there is anecdotal evidence that the management of psychosocial hazards is rarely a consideration in MSD risk management. Macdonald & Oakman (2015) state that it is evident that to focus workplace risk management strategies only on workstation design and physical actions while performing tasks is not the optimal way to reduce MSD risks. Oakman & Kinsman (2016) suggest that more holistic approaches are required to address all relevant types of hazards. Macdonald & Oakman (2015) suggest that, to achieve a change in the paradigm towards a more holistic approach, new MSD risk management tools and better integration of the roles of OSH personnel with those of line managers are needed. Alongside this Oakman & Kinsman (2016) suggest that line managers and supervisors need to be educated about their roles in managing these risks, as they often play a key role in generating both physical and psychosocial hazards. It seems clear that the need to think about psychosocial risks as part of prevention is essential. At the current time, the work by MacDonald & Oakman (2015) on developing a toolkit is one of very few \uf0a7 MSD prevention and implementation processes should be approached as part of a long-term commitment to workers\u2019 safety and the company\u2019s success. \uf0a7 MSD prevention should be incorporated into other management and OSH processes. \uf0a7 Management\u2019s commitment should be demonstrated by allocating adequate time and resources to MSD prevention activities. \uf0a7 Participation of workers, communicating their opinions and suggestions for improvements in ergonomic programmes, must be included. \uf0a7 Lack of information as a barrier can be overcome by comprehensive training coupled, ideally, with implementing ergonomic interventions. \uf0a7 For individual implementations to be accepted and utilised, they must be culturally relevant and easy to integrate into workers' current work practices and the organisation\u2019s procedures.

        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 43 6 Discussion Although MSD reporting rates vary between countries, and some countries seem to have reduced them, the prevalence of work-related MSDs remains high across Europe. The aim of this exploratory review was to understand better the reasons behind the continuing high prevalence of reported MSDs in the working population. As an exploratory review, research papers were limited to those that examined the causes of the high prevalence and focused searches based on the hypotheses identified; thus, it does not completely cover the published research. As part of the review, a number of hypotheses were identified from the research, as presented in Table 2. 6.1 Limitations of the report This was an exploratory review to examine the hypotheses on why there is a continuing high prevalence of MSDs across the EU. Therefore, it focused on papers in which hypotheses had been generated, and from this a question-mapping approach was taken for each of the hypotheses. Although the authors made their searches as wide as possible, it was not a systematic review. The hypotheses cover a broad range of potential causes of the continuing high prevalence of MSDs. These include sectoral change, new ways of working, lifestyle behaviours, demographic change, health beliefs and somatisation, psychosocial factors and socio-economic differences, as well as the gaps in risk management and prevention practices not reflecting the complexity of the causal factors for MSDs, including the lack of consideration of psychosocial risk factors. Each of these is discussed below. 6.1.1 Sectoral change Structural changes in the economy result in shifts in sectoral employment and consequently changing patterns of exposure to workplace hazards. Although this change is happening, there is little evidence of a reduction in exposure to physical MSD hazards when the prevalence of MSDs and postural exposure are examined. In fact, with more people working in health and social care, their exposure to handling patients has increased. While sectoral change may bring different types of work, there is little evidence of reduced exposure to MSD hazards. 6.1.2 The impact of digitalisation on the world of work Work itself and where and how people work is constantly changing. Technology change should allow us to work better and remove the need for exposure to highly demanding or highly repetitive work. The research findings reviewed highlight that digitalisation in some form is part of most jobs nowadays, be that the provision of a smartphone or the use of workplace apps for time recording. Alongside this, digitalisation of the online platform, temporary contracts and fixed term contracts have increased the casualisation of work, with more workers having different types of contractual arrangements, including being self-employed or employed on a temporary basis. Although we know that temporary and agency staff are more at risk of accidents, there is concern that the casualisation process may be leading to a reduction in those workers\u2019 OSH protection. Platform working may give the individual flexibility in approaching their working day, but there is concern that this flexibility may be exploited with no redress for the worker. The impact of working in non-traditional workplaces, such as at home or driving one\u2019s own vehicle, also leaves room for a lack of scrutiny in relation to OSH, MSDs and psychosocial risks. With such changes in working boundaries, the potential for burnout, isolation and the psychosocial impact of work as a result of the \u2018always on\u2019 mentality suggests enhanced risks for MSDs that require increased focus. As online retail (or e-retail) spreads, increasing numbers of people are employed in distribution centres as pickers or as delivery drivers, where again individuals may be working as agency workers rather than as full-time employees. This work is often highly pressured and pick rates are set by the employing company. There is little evidence that the ergonomic needs of this workforce have been addressed, and ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 44 often when manual and automated work collide the human is left with monotonous and repetitive work. This lack of protection for the e-retail workforce has been highlighted in the press. At the current time, it can be concluded that the lack of thought with regard to ergonomics and psychosocial risks in this working environment is contributing to higher levels of MSDs. Changing work processes were also identified in the review, including the impact of lean manufacturing. MSD reporting may be increased because of the unintended consequences of changes in processes or tasks. Although productivity may increase with lean manufacturing, this may be to the detriment of musculoskeletal health if ergonomics and psychosocial risks are not considered in the redesign of work; several papers included in the review point this out. In the health care sector lifting aids were introduced many years ago in hospital environments; however, more patients are now cared for at home where lifting aids are not available and there is little control over the working environment. Robotics and automation are also increasing in industry. Fixed robots have been used for several decades in manufacturing, but new autonomous robots may be bringing new risks to the workplace. Autonomous robots may be useful in reducing exposure to MSD hazards, such as work that is repetitive or needs high levels of force or dirty environments, but there has been little work done to examine the interface between the human and the robot and the unpredictable nature of humans. Increased use of automation is also evolving in many workplaces. This can potentially result in an increased number of machine-paced roles or in carrying out highly repetitive work that cannot be automated. Work in some areas is also becoming less active, bringing with it new risks to the workforce through inactivity. Sedentary work has been associated with musculoskeletal problems and other non- communicable diseases. There needs to be thought given to how to change work to make it more active and how to encourage movement in the workplace. Although the DSE Directive does have requirements for breaks, this is difficult to implement in some working environments. Considering job design and work tasks may help increase opportunities for movement throughout the working day. As Straker & Mathiassen (2009) point out, this is a paradigm shift for ergonomics: traditionally its role has been to reduce exposure to physical demands, but we now need to think about how to increase physical activity to reduce MSD and other health risks. 6.1.3 Lifestyle behaviours Although this review has focused on work-relevant factors in MSDs, the impact of the individual factors on the development of MSDs cannot be ignored. The three areas examined were that of higher body mass index, physical inactivity and tobacco smoking, all of which are associated with increased prevalence of MSDs. While body mass indexes have increased, smoking has reduced but physical inactivity is still a problem for 48 % of the EU population. Improving workers\u2019 health behaviours is likely to have a positive impact on the prevalence of MSDs. The workplace can be used as an arena for raising awareness and carrying out workplace health promotion to improve health in general. This perhaps needs to be part of general raising awareness of the impact of health behaviours on MSDs and how to maintain health when working lives are being extended. 6.1.4 Demographic change When the data were examined in relation to age and reported MSD, it was clear that older workers report more MSDs; however, there were high rates of reporting in the younger age group too. Previous work by EU-OSHA (2016a) has highlighted the issue of increasing reporting of MSDs with increasing age, although there is still much debate over whether this is due to age-related change, duration of exposure or both. The relatively high rates of MSD reporting in younger workers is also concerning, especially in the context of the general trend towards extending working lives. It is not clear whether young people are starting their working lives with existing MSDs or the problems occur soon after starting work. Women generally report more MSD symptoms, although the findings varied in some studies in which men reported more back pain and women more neck, shoulder, hand or arm symptoms. When we ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 45 examine exposure based on gender, women report more lifting and handling of people and similar rates of exposure to tiring and painful positions, repetitive movements and sitting. We need to understand better why it is that, with similar levels of exposure, women report more symptoms. Collins & O\u2019Sullivan (2010) suggest that this is due to responses to both physical and psychosocial hazards. Does this mean that women respond differently to the same types of exposure? If this is the case, risk assessment may need to take that into consideration. However, when we examine where women are working and the age at which they return to the workforce after time away, we see an intersection between age and gender, as more women over 50 years old have joined the workforce. The changing structure of the workforce is likely to be impacting the prevalence of MSDs: more older women are working and they are more at risk of MSDs. 6.1.5 Health beliefs and somatisation What we believe affects our health, including how MSDs are related to our work and the time taken to recover. There is a need to share accurate and realistic knowledge and information about MSD risks, injuries and recovery times among the workforce through education. The campaign in Scotland \u2018Don\u2019t take back pain lying down\u2019 (Waddell et al., 2007) is an example of an attempt to modify people\u2019s behaviour during an episode of back pain. The health and health behaviours that people bring to work is also a factor in the occurrence of MSDs, so taking a workplace health promotion route to education may have the potential to influence health behaviours and persuade people to improve their own health. This also presents the opportunity to improve understanding of the impact and duration of symptoms. 6.1.6 Psychosocial factors Psychosocial factors have long been implicated in developing MSDs. The pathways for this have also been discussed, for example, in the work of Hauke et al. (2011). The interaction between physical health and psychosocial factors has been extensively researched, and positive associations between burnout, poor social support, low levels of job control, work-life conflict and MSDs have been identified. However, little has been done at the current time to take a holistic approach to prevention, rather than just addressing physical hazards. Taking a \u2018silo approach\u2019 means that risk assessments are carried out separately for musculoskeletal problems and for psychosocial risks. Macdonald & Oakman\u2019s (2015) work in Australia provides guidance on how to develop combined risk assessments for both MSDs and psychosocial risks. 6.1.7 Socio-economic differences The analysis of socio-economic differences showed that they contribute to the wide variation in reported levels of MSDs across the EU-28. Some studies suggest that, where there is social support and no poverty, people report more MSDs. It is not clear if this is down to the provision (or lack of provision) of particular support or insurance systems. However, examining trends, it is apparent that the list of MSDs recognised as occupational diseases, the criteria for their recognition and compensation practices in particular countries have an impact on the levels of reporting. For example, in Belgium, France and Italy, increased levels of reporting between 2007 and 2012 was down to the addition of specific tendinopathies to the list of general MSDs, as well as information campaigns to highlight this, both of which might have increased levels of reporting. Taking this as it stands with a number of caveats on methodology, this suggests that MSDs are reported more frequently where there are support systems in place with higher rates of social protection. Whether this is due to workers being comfortable reporting MSDs in those countries, or fearing losing their jobs in areas with lower levels of social protection, requires further analysis. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 46 6.2 Prevention Although there are many tools available MSD risk assessment, many of those have not been evaluated nor has their impact been measured. As highlighted in this review, much prevention is based on the evidence relating to physical hazards associated with the development of MSDs, rather than what works in preventing MSDs, for which the evidence is still lacking. Furthermore, while we know that psychosocial factors are linked to the development of MSDs, there has been little progress in translating that knowledge into the workplace to try to avoid the silo approach and bridge the gap between MSD and psychosocial risk assessment. The research identified in this review suggests ways of integrating the two. However, as there is a need to build the evidence base for MSD prevention, there is a push to take new approaches to prevention, including carrying out intervention studies in the workplace. It is clear that these require design, implementation over long periods and adequate evaluation to identify what works. The studies identified also recommend including raising awareness of and transferring knowledge about MSDs as part of an overall preventive strategy. This should cover their causes, their impact and how they are best prevented. Health beliefs are likely to affect how people perceive their disorder, so having accurate information about occurrence, causes, impact and prevention is essential, as is having ergonomist support. The latter was one of the facilitators identified by Yazdani & Wells (2018). As with many intervention studies, barriers to prevention are likely to include lack of time, resources, management support, resistance to change and the changing work environment. In developing prevention interventions it is important to identify the relevant stakeholders, ensure participation at all company levels, gain support from management and have a good communication plan. Training for line managers on integrating OSH into everyday practice is also perceived as positive. While we are still building a knowledge base of what works in prevention, taking a more holistic approach to prevention is advisable. This is especially true in a changing work environment where we are not always aware of the consequences of change such as the impact of automation and robots or how to reduce sedentary work. As both areas are currently being researched, organisations including EU- OSHA and NIOSH are already identifying good practice for the workplace. ",
        "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders: why are they still so prevalent? Evidence from a literature review European Agency for Safety and Health at Work \u2013 EU-OSHA 47 7 Conclusions This exploratory review examined research carried out since 2008 that can help to explain why the prevalence of MSDs remains high. The literature on the causes and prevalence of work-related MSDs refers to ageing of the workforce, effects of new forms of work, interaction of psychosocial and physical exposures, and shortcomings in risk assessment and prevention practices and in implementing interventions in companies. The review of the relevant literature seems to confirm the hypotheses derived from the preliminary research. There is a whole range of interactions that are likely to contribute to the continuing prevalence of MSDs including demographic change, changing work and workplaces, gender, age and the lack of inclusion of psychosocial risks as part of risk assessment. EU data also confirm that there is little reduction in exposure to physical risk factors for MSDs across the workforce. There is a growing body of research linking IT technology use/overuse, including mobile devices and during both professional and leisure time, to musculoskeletal complaints. In addition to rapid changes in the technologies used at work, the equally rapid developments in IT and entertainment technology drives changes in the nature of work, business structures, employment status, hierarchies and relationships; the combined impact of these changes could challenge existing mechanisms for managing and regulating OSH. Although there are many tools available to assess MSD risks, there has been little work on evaluating their impact. Demographic change leading to an increasingly older workforce results in a group of workers more at risk of MSDs. The relatively high proportion of younger workers also affected gives rise to concern. The recognition of psychosocial factors and their influence on prevalence of MSDs has not been linked into the risk assessment process in any real way. There is a clear need to take new approaches to preventing MSDs, including creating workplace intervention studies, which will need to take a more holistic approach covering both physical and psychosocial risks. Furthermore, raising awareness of MSDs and their prevention is essential to bring about change. The causes of the continuing high prevalence of MSDs are complex and include the impact of new forms of work, continuing high levels of exposure to physical risks, new types of exposure, the ageing of the workforce, and shortcomings in risk assessment and prevention practices, among others. To achieve a sustained reduction in the societal burden of MSDs all these issues need to be addressed, requiring an interplay between measures taken in all of these areas, including research, awareness raising and public education, legislation, OSH and public health policy.

A systematic review of OSH interventions in the workplace including the impact of legislation and follow-up inspections on injury, training, campaigns and new devices. In total 61 papers were included in the review. The review finds that legislation and regulatory policy reduce injuries and fatalities. However, for MSDs, the three included papers on the use of devices (lifting aids) showed that they did reduce injuries. However, the paper highlights a lack of research in approaches targeting MSDs or psychological processes.

This cohort study in Norway investigates the prevalence of MSDs in the general population. The findings suggest that women report more musculoskeletal problems than men (general prevalence 63.4 % vs men 52.9 %). Significant associations identified with smoking, high BMI, lower education level and moderate physical activity.

This prospective cohort study in Israel investigates the extent to which changes in the levels of burnout over time predict new cases of musculoskeletal pain in 1,704 healthy employees (men and women). The findings suggest that burnout might be a risk factor in the development of musculoskeletal pain in healthy individuals. Increased levels of burnout over a period of 18 months were associated with an increased risk (2.09- fold) of developing musculoskeletal pain during the subsequent 18 months of follow-up. There was no support for the possibility of reverse causation, i.e. that musculoskeletal pain predicts subsequent elevation of burnout levels.

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 studies of healthcare nurses and nursing aides aims to evaluate and quantify psychosocial risks and MSDs in the healthcare setting among nurses. The findings suggest that there is a significant association between demand/control and back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain and knee pain. Poor social support was associated with all pain sites as was effort-reward imbalance. The study concludes that there is an association between psychosocial risks and MSDs even when physical demands are adjusted for. ",

This Belstress study in Belgium investigated the impact of psychosocial factors, both work and non-work-related, on the prevalence of lower back pain after 6.6 years on average in 2,556 workers (1,729 men, 827 women). The findings suggest that, after adjustment for individual and physical risks, including occasional back pain at baseline, the prevalence of low back pain in men is significantly related to baseline low decision latitude and poor social support at work and non- significantly to high job strain, low wage and job satisfaction, feeling stressed at work and feeling depressed. High job insecurity, feeling stressed at work and feeling depressed did not significantly increase the relative risks for low back pain in women.

The findings suggest that low back pain was associated with being female, an ex-smoker and smoking, lifting weights of over 25 kg, working over 50 hours per week, job insecurity, two or more somatic symptoms in the preceding week, intermediate or poor mental health and beliefs including the work-relatedness of and prognosis for MSDs. Disabling wrist or arm pain was associated with being female, increasing age, being a current smoker, using a keyboard, time pressure at work, lack of support at work, lack of job control, one or more somatic symptoms in the past week, poor mental health and adverse beliefs including the work-relatedness of MSDs.

This cross-sectional study in Ireland investigates the prevalence of MSDs and trends with psychosocial risks, across age and gender in 332 workers (200 women, 132 men). The findings suggest that the most prevalent symptoms of MSDs were in the low back, shoulder and neck regions. Age and gender differences in prevalence were evident for these regions with a general trend towards increasing prevalence with age. ",

This review in the nursing sector investigates the prevalence of MSD pain and reported injuries for nurses and nursing aides. The findings suggest that the prevalence of MSD pain for nurses and nursing aides was highest in the low back, followed by the shoulders and neck. The review highlights that, as patients live longer with more chronic diseases, obese patients, early mobility requirements and those who want to live at home during sickness can result in MSDs shifting to different populations, e.g. home healthcare workers, long-term care workers and physical therapists. In addition, it was also suggested that because of this there is likely to be a shift to different body regions affected, such as shoulders and upper extremities.

This EU cross-sectional study using data from the fifth European Working Conditions Survey investigates the role of personal, occupational and social factors on the development of MSDs. The findings suggest that the one-year prevalence of back pain was 46 % and for neck/upper limb pain it was 44.6 %. The strongest personal predictor was somatisation. The highest prevalence was in agriculture and fisheries and among labourers, the smallest in teaching. Data were broken down by gender and by country. Different rates were identified by country, with Ireland being the lowest and Portugal the highest for back pain and with neck/upper limb pain lowest in Ireland and highest in Finland. The authors hypothesise that the different rates could be explained by socio-economics: countries that are richer and have more social support have a higher prevalence of MSDs.

This cross-sectional study in Australia investigates the relationship between sociodemographic, individual and workplace factors and neck pain alone, shoulder pain alone, and neck and shoulder pain among 1,111 nurses (91 % women) working across three public hospitals. The findings suggest that employment and work-related psychosocial factors were not associated with neck pain alone or shoulder pain alone or neck and shoulder pain combined. Work-related physical factors, mental and physical health and well-being, health beliefs and somatisation tendency were consistently associated with neck and shoulder pain. Neck pain alone was more consistently associated with sociodemographic factors and physical health and well-being, shoulder pain alone was associated with fear avoidance beliefs and physical health and well-being.

The findings show that in total 399 participants (86 % male) 85 % reported having some MSD. The most frequent complaint was low back pain with over 70 % reporting this. Fifty-one per cent reported knee pain and 37 % of the sample reported shoulder pain. Associations between job satisfaction and MSDs found that, the lower the levels of job satisfaction, the greater were MSD complaints. Improving job satisfaction may contribute to reducing MSDs. Macdonald, W. and Oakman, J., 2015. Requirements for more effective prevention of work- related musculoskeletal disorders. BMC musculoskeletal disorders, 16(1), p.293. This debate paper aims to identify some major barriers that are hindering both communication of the need for changes and workplace implementation of changes for MSDs. The paper suggests that workplace risk management procedures do not reflect current evidence concerning their work-related causes. Inadequate attention is given to assessing and controlling risk from psychosocial hazards, and the conventional risk management paradigm focuses too narrowly on risk from individual hazards rather than promoting the more holistic approach needed to manage the combined effects of all relevant hazards. Achievement of such changes requires new MSD risk management tools and better integration of the roles of OHS personnel with those of line managers.

The findings suggest that physical environmental factors in the workplace were related to MSDs. In addition, a there was a strong interaction between environmental and psychosocial risk factors affecting MSDs. Problems in the upper limbs seemed to be more strongly affected by environmental and psychosocial factors than low back pain. To prevent MSDs, a multi-level approach is needed, including environmental measures and interventions directed at both psychosocial and organisational factors. ",

This cohort study in Norway investigates the quantification of socio- economic differences in reporting low back pain, neck and shoulder pain and arm pain. The findings suggest that for men there was a steep gradient for low back pain and occupational grade and for those where handling and lifting were involved and high physical demands were reported. This was observed for arm pain too. For women, the slope was not as steep, but there was a significant association between low back pain and socio-economic group and for jobs involving lifting and handling.

This cross-sectional study in Sweden in the transport sector investigates the prevalence of MSDs among commercial pilots by examining flight length and psychosocial work conditions. The findings suggest that women reported more hand symptoms and pilots generally on long-haul flights had fewer elbow symptoms. High work demands were associated with neck, shoulder, elbow and low back pain symptoms. Poor social support was associated with neck, shoulder and low back pain. Finally, low supervisor support was associated with neck, shoulder and low back pain.

This cross-sectional study in Iran investigates the prevalence of MSDs in laboratory workers and the interaction with personal characteristics and psychosocial factors. The findings identify that of 156 employees (53 % women) 72.4 % reported at least one MSD in the previous 12 months. The significant risk factor for low back pain, shoulder pain, hand/wrist pain and leg pain was gender (being female). In further analysis using multiple logistic regression, after adjustment, both increasing age and being female were associated with MSDs.

This cross-sectional study in Portugal of blue and white collar workers investigates work-related physical and psychosocial factors in relation to back pain problems. The findings suggest that the occurrence of back pain was for blue collar workers associated with exposure to vibration, high work demands, feeling exploited and a loss of dignity. For white collar workers associations were with awkward postures, sedentary work, being awake before 05.00 and physical aggression. Trinkoff, A.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of extended work schedules in nurses to MSD. Nurses are at very high risk for work \u2010 related musculoskeletal injury/disorders (MSD) with low back pain/injury being the most frequently occurring MSD. Schedule characteristics increasing MSD risk included 13+ hour/days, off \u2010 shifts, weekend work, work during time off (while sick, on days off, without breaks), and overtime/on \u2010 call. These increases in risk were not explained by psychological demands, but were largely explained by physical demands.

This epidemiology cohort study in the Netherlands investigates the relation between body mass index and musculoskeletal symptoms in the working population. The findings suggest that being overweight was significantly associated with upper and lower extremity pain in adjusted data. Obesity was associated with neck/shoulder, upper extremity, back and lower extremity pain. For those with high physical workloads, obesity was significantly associated with lower extremity pain. For individuals with low physical workload, being both overweight and obese were associated with lower extremity pain. Webster, J., Dalby, M., Fox, D., Pinder A., 2014, Factors in the design of order picking systems that influence manual handling practices. HSE Books, Norwich, UK. This review (and stakeholder interviews) investigates how the design of picking systems impacts on manual handling. The findings highlight the interface between different picking systems and manual handling. While more systems have been automated, the complexity in different order types results in humans being used to pick products. There are often trade-offs between the costs of automation and the costs of human pickers. Levels of activity are often seasonal in warehouses so without additional pickers physical and mental work demands increase. Guidance on positioning of goods is also provided in this report. Control measures include better workplace design, knowing the weights of products and team lifting. However, poor manual handling practice can be seen in warehouses where the demands on the pickers are high. Wells, R., 2009, \u2018Why have we not solved the MSD problem?\u2019, Work, 34(1), pp. 117-121. This review attempts to address six questions on why we have not solved the MSD problem. The questions include: 7. How well do we understand MSDs and their burdens? 8. How good are our MSD risk factors? 9. How effective and informative are current workplace MSD assessment approaches? 10. How effective are the recommended interventions in actually reducing MSDs in the workplace? 11. How intensely and widely implemented are workplace interventions to prevent MSDs? 12. How well are we improving disability outcomes for MSDs? The review highlights where we have knowledge and the importance of future interventions that are scalable, affordable and sustainable. ",

This systematic review of 34 papers investigates the impact of lean manufacturing on musculoskeletal symptoms. The findings suggest that almost half of the papers reported a negative impact on health and risk factors. There was an increase in work volume and work intensification but also change introduced without considering the environment or worker involvement. Positive aspects of change were job enlargement, quality and enrichment. Negative impacts included increased stress and workload with a mismatch between resources and demands. The review highlights that workers with routine jobs are most at risk.

This cross-sectional study investigates the impact of lean manufacturing compared with traditional manufacturing on MSD risks. Repetition, force and posture were assessed in 56 jobs in both plants. The findings suggest that the differences identified included greater productivity, less waiting and less walking in the lean production site but greater exposure to repetition. The lean production site had fewer hand force requirements and, examining repetition and force together, threshold values for risk were lower in the lean production environment.
