        "EUROPEAN COMMISSION RESEARCH Commissioner : Janez Poto \u010d nik Directorate - general for Research Director General: Jos\u00e9 Manuel Silva Rodriguez The Directorate-General for Research is responsible for implementing EU level policies and activities in view of the development of the European Research Area. It initiates and implements the necessary Community actions, in particular the RTD Framework Programmes in terms of research and technological development. It also contributes to the implementation of the \u201cLisbon Strategy\u201d regarding employment, competitiveness at international level, economic reform and social cohesion within the European Union. The Directorate \"Science, economy and society\" , Directorate L, addresses key societal, economic and S&T challenges for Europe. It identifies and analyses major trends in relation to these challenges and examines them in the light of the principal EU strategic objectives and sectoral policies. The overall context for its work is the transition towards the knowledge based economy and society in Europe. Within this overall framework, the Directorate provides a policy relevant research based capability executed through the promotion and management of research activities in the areas of social sciences, humanities and foresight, the exploitation of their results and its own analyses. In this way, the Directorate offers knowledge for policies (including RTD policies) while supporting the formulation of policies for knowledge.

        "i Introduction Within the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (2002-2006), Priority 7 \u201cCitizens and Governance in a Knowledge-based Society\u201d aims to mobilise European research in economic, political, social sciences and humanities in order to develop an understanding of and to address issues related to the emergence of a knowledge - based society as well as to identify and address, on the one hand, new forms of relationships between its citizens and, on the other between its citizens and institutions. In order to attain these objectives, researchers were invited to address issues related to the following 7 research areas, grouped into two major themes: Knowledge based society and social cohesion 1. Improving generation, distribution and use of knowledge 2. Options and choices for the development of a knowledge-based society 3. Variety of paths towards a knowledge society Citizenship, democracy and new forms of governance 4. Implications of European integration and enlargement 5. New forms of governance 6. Resolution of conflicts and restoration of peace 7. New forms of citizenship and cultural identities And one additional research area of a horizontal nature: 8. Actions to promote the European Research Area in Social Sciences and Humanities and their contribution to the knowledge based society in Europe. The implementation of this Priority was undertaken through the launching of calls for proposals in 2003 and 2004 and researchers had the possibility of using various types of research instruments. These calls for proposals have generated high interest from the scientific community, as underlined by the number of proposals submitted: In total 1594 proposals have been submitted to all calls. Based upon the independent evaluation procedures, 169 contracts have been or are about to be signed: \u221e 34 Networks of Excellence (NoE) and Integrated Projects (IP) have been selected in 2003 and 2004. The total EU budget allocated to these instruments currently amounts to \u20ac 142 Million. \u221e As far as Specific Targeted Research Projects (STREP\u2019S) and Coordination Actions (CA) are concerned, 120 projects have been selected for funding since the launch of Priority 7, amounting to a total EU budget of \u20ac 118.5 Million. \u221e The last calls for proposals were also open for Specific Support Actions (SSA) and 15 have been selected for funding, corresponding to a total EU budget of \u20ac 5.5 Million. This publication contains the synopses of the projects which have started or are about to start under this Priority. They are grouped around the above mentioned eight research areas. In addition, within the Sixth Framework Programme Priority 8 \u201cPolicy support and anticipating scientific and technological needs\u201d (SSP) aims at financing projects whose main objectives are to support specific policies and related activities. SSP serves the decision-making process through targeted research which responds to the specific needs identified by policy-makers. ",
        "ii This priority is organised around three major research areas: 1. Sustainable management of Europe\u2019s natural resources 2. Providing health, security and opportunity to the people of Europe 3. Underpinning the economic potential and cohesion of a larger and more integrated European Union. As a result of the SSP calls for proposals published in 2004, 18 projects were approved in areas related to crime, migration and refugee flows, under research area 2, and in areas related to competition policies, sustainable development and trade policies, and improving the quality of European statistics, under research area 3. Synopses of these 18 projects are also included in this catalogue. Further details on the selected projects under Priority 7 are available at: http://www.cordis.lu/citizens/projects.htm. Further information on the overall activities of Priority 8 can be found at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/fp6/ssp/index_en.htm . Jean-Michel BAER Director ",

While the traditional 'hard' location factors that firms use will remain important for international competitiveness, new 'soft' location factors that are mainly related to attracting the required 'talent pool' would deserve increasing attention. The central research question we will address is: what are the conditions for creating or stimulating 'creative knowledge regions' in the context of the extended European Union? We will compare the recent socio-economic development trends and strategies in several metropolitan regions across Europe to get more insight in the extent to which creativity, innovation and knowledge are indeed the keys to a successful long-term economic development. The metropolitan regions in the ACRE project are: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Birmingham, Budapest, Dublin, Helsinki, Leipzig, Milan, Munich, Poznan, Riga, Sofia and Toulouse. With the results of this study the EU might seriously consider strengthening the profile of metropolitan regions within the EU area as regards creative knowledge branches and activities in the face of increasing competition with other growth regions in the world. The most important topic to consider is which metropolitan regions might develop as 'creative knowledge regions', and which regions might not. This will depend on current positions in global and European networks and on historic development paths. In this research leading European experts with complementary disciplinary backgrounds from places with clearly different pathways concerning the creative knowledge economy will be brought together. This will help to significantly improve our understanding of the conditions that shape the emergence of a creative knowledge economy and of its importance for enhanced competitiveness. ",

Brief description: There is need to enhance the opportunities for including more sociologists into cross-national fertilisation of their particular endeavours. It is our conviction that only if we could find a bridge between the day-to-day routines of sociologists, their everyday behaviour and the needs routed there on the one side and collaboration on an European level on the other side, we will succeed. The daily work of the vast majority of sociologists is concerned with three different tasks - Observing and describing a particular society as a whole and its sub-systems. - Working out explanations and theories about the forces underlying the development of societies. - Taking part in the process of opinion formation policy advising, influencing processes of decision making in societies. The project seeks to approach the problem of fragmentation by focusing on two specific areas within the context of the above mentioned three major tasks of sociology: Observing the process of choosing publications which represent the country and its research tradition from a sociological viewpoint, enables us to understand the selection and research processes within particular countries and their sociological communities. Subtopic two will analyse differences and similarities in the role performance of public intellectuals in different European countries and at different times in the 20th century. Comparing those processes between different countries in Europe will provide us with basic information about the reasons for the fragmentation of sociology. Based on these results we intend to develop means to overcome the fragmentation of sociology in Europe Expected results: Producing a Website named Virtual Library with sub-sites for three countries (Austria, Ireland and Turkey) with options for further enlargement. On each country-site users will find papers, chapters from books and other material informing users about three different topics: Sociological studies informing about particular societies and sociological analysis of these societies; examples illustrating the national style of doing sociology; and structured data on the history of sociology in these countries. Additional information will be provided on the website. Secondly we will publish a book with essays about the role of public intellectuals in Europe. ",

The essential DIME goal is to address contemporary challenges facing the European Union, its member states, its companies and its citizens in managing the transition to a knowledge-based economy and society in the context of its enlargement and of the globalization of the economy. The DIME field of operation thus includes a wide range of issues at various levels of aggregation, covering, for example, macro processes such as the enlargement of the European Union, meso issues such as emerging regional inequalities, and micro factors behind the competitiveness of European firms in the global knowledge economy. The DIME NoE seeks to address and analyze (1) the generation, accumulation, and exchange of knowledge; (2) governance, institutional frameworks and public policies; and (3) social and spatial proximity as influencing cohesion and the above. These three topics directly address the objectives of the Priority 7, research area 1.1.2 Brief description of the project The challenges of co-ordination and organisation involved in generating and exchanging knowledge test the limits of social science understanding and several disciplines have sought to address these issues. The economics of knowledge, the political analysis of multi-level governance, and the social and geographic understanding of proximity, for instance, must be further developed. But many pieces of the puzzle of how to better co-ordinate and organise knowledge generation and exchange remain detached and embedded in different scientific disciplines. The present challenge, and the impetus for the DIME network is the opportunity to develop means of integrating the conceptual, theoretical, and measurement tools employed by different social science communities in order to discover better means of integrating or mobilising existing knowledge as well as generating technological and organisational innovation. Integration among disciplines should favour both intra-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary developments addressing the following scientific challenges : - Knowledge is an Essential and Specific Input in our Economic Systems - The Central Role of Spatiality - Organizational Frames and Governance These scientific advances should help to address policy issues of urgent relevance for the EU : - Globalization, Enlargement of Europe, Emergence of Regions and the Role of the Nation State -Knowledge Divide and Inequality among Regions Expected results (expected scientific and policy outcomes) DIME expects - to develop means of integrating the conceptual, theoretical, and measurement tools employed by different social science communities, dealing with the above described project goals, in order to discover better means of mobilising existing knowledge as well as generating organisational and policy-innovation - to increase the participation of researchers and research institutes that have not previously been centrally active in the research areas represented by DIME and to enhance the participation of women in DIME related research. - to improve access to and the relevance of social science research findings for stakeholders including national and regional policymakers and others who might benefit. - To foster collaborative research and to strengthen research fundraising based upon the interactions within the network.

Regulating society from the morning of mankind (Dunbar, 1998), it becomes more crucial with the pace of development of ICT technologies, dramatically enlarging the range of interaction and generating new types of aggregation. Despite its critical role, reputation generation, transmission and use are unclear. The project aims to an interdisciplinary theory of reputation and to modelling the interplay between direct evaluations and meta-evaluations in three types of decisions, epistemic (whether to form a given evaluation), strategic (whether and how interact with target), and memetic (whether and which evaluation to transmit). Finally, current technological developments of reputation are dusting off traditional remedies like word of mouth and chatty talk. The theory in question will be shown to help design reputation technology. The proposed project will benefit from a synergy between experts in an innovative methodology, i.e. agent-based social simulation, and in computational modelling and software development, all good representatives of the European community in these fields of science. The work plan includes (1) theory-building, delivering a survey of online reputation systems, social cognitive and computational models of reputation decisions, and a provisional White Book for Reputation Technology; (2) tool development, delivering a virtual experimental laboratory for human and a multi agent platform for artificial experiments; (3) theory-testing, delivering cross-methodological data about impact of infrastructures on reputation decisions; (4) system design delivering a final White Book on Reputation Technology, and a DemoSystem, based on Grid platform, for demonstrating instructions it will contains; (5) detailed activity of dissemination and management.

Description of the project: Our network aims at analysing the conditions of possibility and realisation of an European space of research in the social sciences. The first objective is to describe the barriers which impede the emergence of such a trans-national, multidisciplinary space. Our team plans to achieve the task by a systematically comparative approach of the history of the social sciences within each of the represented national contexts. Intercultural divergences and convergences prevailing within the European space will be identified; obstacles and filters slowing down if not blocking the free circulation of ideas will be delineated. Our network wishes to improve the social conditions for a rational dialogue between participants. In such a perspective, its ambition consists of constructing the epistemological bases for an effective comparative science, which is seen as a pre-requisite to the formation of an European space of research in social sciences. Such an epistemological platform appears to be crucial since social sciences lag behind in relation to the rapid transformation of social realities by the constitution of an European supra-national space and the current process of globalisation. In order to contribute to the pre-figuration of an integrated European social science, our network will parallely conduct two scientific investigations: - a general study of the apparently most international topic: the production and circulation of literary and artistic works in Europe; - a study of the genesis of the field of social sciences in Europe of which autonomy is relatively weak with regard to economic and political factors in each of the countries concerned. This entails that the role of the State in these two domains will be scrutinized. This double approach is to be reinforced by a simultaneous analysis of the tools of social sciences being used in order to control what they owe to their social conditions. Expected results: Our project aims at producing a rationally organised network of searchers in order to enable them to overcome the barriers and boundaries laying across the nationals and disciplinary traditions. The project wishes to promote the knowledge, the development and the dissemination of the European scientific and cultural heritage. It also aims at having a due regard and at enhancing the awareness on the social conditions which have enabled for the constitution of such a capital and heritage, social conditions that must be preserved in order to enlarge and empower the scientific and cultural knowledges. To do so, the mechanisms which have limited or slowed down the circulation of European scientific and cultural knowledges and realizations should be identified, moreover because they may still threatened the promotion of this collective heritage.

Through its teaching and research, and other activities, the university provides the essential foundations of the knowledge-based society. In particular, EUEREK will study developments which might broadly be considered to be \"entrepreneurial\", that is, making the university more responsive to social and economic demands, thus supporting knowledge-based entrepreneurship in society generally. EUEREK will examine the role of such entrepreneurial universities in promoting economic development, social cohesion and cultural diversity. Description of the project: The EUEREK consortium comprises institutions from EU states with differing approaches to higher education organisation, and from Russia and Moldova. The involvement of this broad spectrum of university systems is important, as it is expected to add to the analytical power of the study; to contribute towards mutual understanding of the nature of institutional change; and to help guide developments in both the western and eastern states. EUEREK will proceed by building a theoretical framework, locating knowledge as an economic good and identifying the role of the university in its production and dissemination. Using evidence from case studies of a range of institutions and processes in each consortium country, EUEREK will identify the factors which have promoted effectiveness in these respects, the role of entrepreneurship in the university context, and how it can best be promoted. The project will probe deeply into university activities, aiming to understand more of the basis of organisational change within them. These findings are likely to have significant policy implications both at the level of institutions and of national higher education systems. In addition to case study and overall reports, EUEREK is planned to lead to an ongoing consultancy service offered by its members, as the most effective method of embedding its findings in universities generally in Europe. Expected results: It is expected that an improved theoretical understanding of how European universities contribute to the knowledge society will result. This may be expected to point towards changes in both university internal organisation and national planning and funding structures in order to improve the ways in which universities in practice support knowledge production and dissemination.

The popular perception is that the 'old economy' based on manufactured goods is giving way to one where less tangible products and services are key to economic success in advanced economies. Policy makers have thus sought to create conditions in which the economic and social returns of the 'knowledge based society' can be realised. The strategic goal established at the Lisbon Summit was - that Europe should become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world'. However, progress has been slow and, despite good intentions, neither macro nor micro level policies have to-date delivered innovation returns at the hoped for rate. In part this lack of success stems from a limited understanding of the nature and composition of the knowledge economy. This is most obviously apparent at regional level. EURODITE seeks to explore alternative paradigms of the knowledge economy based upon dynamic models. The intention is to probe beneath popular notions by investigating in detail the diversity of learning processes and knowledge dynamics and trajectories across Europe. It is also intended to examine the assumption that regions and other spatial arrangements (such as 'clusters' or 'milieu') represent appropriate units of explanation and policy intervention. The project's aim is to increase understanding of the nature and composition of the knowledge economy - especially at a regional level - and assist policy makers to realise the Lisbon goals of creating a dynamic knowledge- based with enhanced social cohesion. The specific objectives are to: - Carry out inter-disciplinary research to examine stocks and flows of knowledge in European regions and business sectors and identify key trends; - Consider the wider business and societal contexts of knowledge processes, for example in sectors, networks, markets, governance systems, education and science and different social groups; - Undertake both quantitative and qualitative inter-regional comparisons to identify different pathways to the knowledge economy; - Produce a model of the `micro-dynamics\u00bf of economic knowledge and the interaction over time of knowledge stocks and flows amongst networks of firms and other organisations through case studies of selected sectors and regions; - Identify the policy levers and coordination activities available to the EU, national and regional levels of governance to enhance knowledge dynamics and their contribution to regional development, competitiveness and economic and social cohesion; - Ensure the gender issues of the knowledge economy are mainstreamed and integrated into the research approach and outputs; - Provide opportunities for young researchers to travel and learn about the knowledge economy and policy framework in other Member States. The intended outputs are state of the art reviews and a practical analytical framework for policy-makers to measure the intensity of regional knowledge use and identify 'appropriate practices' for specific regions given their differing economic base and level of 'knowledge development'. Outputs will be realised though reports, seminars and conferences. Complementary training, dissemination and pilot activities - and the involvement of policy makers throughout - are designed to maintain relevance and ensure maximum dissemination and a high level of take up and validation of the project outputs.

Description of the project: The project will study the obstacles, which usually hinder the diffusion of \"technology spill-overs\" outside a specific local economy, and the policies and \"soft\" infrastructures and institutions which can remove those obstacles. Expected results: The project will first undertake an extensive and in depth empirical survey leading to the construction of indicators of innovation potential (WP1). This extensive empirical internationally harmonized analysis structured according to different regional characteristics and firm characteristics aims at improving the indicators considered in the \"European Innovation Scoreboard\" with a selected set of other key indicators focusing on interactive learning processes, as indicated by the modern methodologies of \"Knowledge Management\". The project will then elaborate an original theoretical study (WP2) on the feasibility of extending existing knowledge creation and innovation networks within regional production clusters to an international dimension. It will finally elaborate a quantitative framework (WP3) (\"Matrix INT - Instruments and Needs of Technology\"), for the evaluation of the gap between the demand/needs and the supply of innovation policies in various regions. lt will identify key policy issues, benchmarks and models to be transferred and policy proposals promoting knowledge and innovation spill-overs, both at the local level and the interregional/international level. The project will propose policy options to enhance the integration of EU research institutions in an \"European Research/Knowledge Area\", through stable and flexible networks, and to increase the ability of these latter to support the Europe-wide competitiveness.

How can we improve upon them?) 2. to explore the relationship between KBE and innovation (How much does KBE contribute to innovation? Which technologies do owe their existence/development to corporate or academic initiatives, or to start-ups?) 3. to define the role of networks of alliances, information, finance and social ties (How much does KBE rely on the different kinds of networks? To what extent do those networks overlap?) 4. to assess KBE in different sectoral and national systems of innovation (for example: What are the main differences between Accession Countries and current EU members?) 5. to produce policy recommendations (Is KBE key for European growth and competitiveness? How can KBE be effectively promoted? What steps Accession Countries could take to effectively promote KBE?). Description of the project: KEINS purports to examine the relevance and features of knowledge-based entrepreneurship (KBE) in Europe. KEINS will look at three types of KBE: start-up entrepreneurship, corporate entrepreneurship and academic entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs are seen as knowledge operators, dedicated to the integration of different knowledge assets and the creation of new ones. They may perform this function either by setting up new companies, or by activating social, financial, and expertise networks from within existing companies, universities or other organizations. KEINS will integrate different methodologies and approaches, ranging from appreciative and formal theorizing to case studies and quantitative empirical work. Special care will devoted to include different industries and countries, with an extensive coverage of Accession Countries. Expected results (expected scientific and policy outcomes) KEINS aims at delivering results in terms of scientific understanding of phenomena as well as policy implications. For what regards the former, KEINS will add value to existing knowledge at the European level through the following characteristics: - The development of an appropriate analytical methodology based on the critical review and effective integration of the literature relating to knowledge-based entrepreneurship, industrial dynamics, innovation networks and innovation systems. - KBE will be examined not only in terms of new firm formation, but also in terms of corporate entrepreneurship (knowledge creation/integration by established companies) and academic entrepreneurship. - The broad scope of comparative analysis, including six EU members (Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden and Portugal) and some accession countries (Poland and others). Importantly, KEINS partners are uniquely positioned to extend the comparative analysis to the United States. - The leverage of STI-NET , which is possibly the largest databank of longitudinal network indicators, currently under construction in the realm of another project funded by the Improving Human Potential Programme (see http://www.stinet.org/ ) For what regards the policy implications, KEINS' findings will have direct policy relevance in term of coping with the European Paradox and finding ways for scientific and basic technological research to have a higher and more effective innovative and competitive impact. In particular: - Networks of all kinds have been aggressively promoted through the science, technology and industrial policies of both the Commission and member states. Extensive networking relationships have also developed independently between industry and universities. Few studies, however, have explored the impact of such networks on KBE. The system perspective has also pervaded recent EU policies for innovation. KEINS will help understanding how the specific national innovation systems, sectoral systems or regional systems impact on KBE. In addition, it will provide analysis about ways to foster the emergence of the European Research Area and the progress towards the establishment of the knowledge-based economy (e-Europe). ",

At the same time, expectations of transparency and public accountability have increased. In turn, the legitimacy of political processes depends on the legitimacy of the knowledge on which they draw. Both social cohesion and effective government depend on integrating knowledge as well as interests. Responding to this new reality, the research is organized around three complementary orientations. Orientation 1 seeks to map the knowledge potentially available to decision makers, and trace the relationships between those who hold or produce such knowledge and those who take policy decisions. Orientation 2 analyses decision-making processes as such, paying special attention to the way information and understanding are deployed and learning takes place at different stages. Orientation 3 is focused on the growing use of regulatory instruments which entail the production and dissemination of information, studying their conception, reception and reappropriation by the decision-makers for whom they are intended. This integrated project addresses these issues directly in respect of two fields, education and health. The project is both multinational and multilevel, in that it looks at knowledge and governance problems across eight different countries and in local, national and international domains. We seek to develop an original line of research that synthesises several theoretical and conceptual universes. In drawing on cognitive approaches to public policy, we are determined to avoid both radical academicism and managerial positivism Our key objectives are those of scientific relevance and social and political relevance. The creation of an end user advisory board specifically and the ambitious dissemination plan reflect the intention to develop an integrated project not limited to scientific considerations. ",

The nature of the analysis will be 'bottom-up' i.e. moving from the micro-entities of economic actions and strategies at the enterprise level to sectoral, regional, national and European levels. The rationale for such an approach is that understanding the microeconomic foundations of innovation, competitiveness and growth at the firm level, as well as the firms\u00bf interactions with the labour market, is key to understanding the nature of these phenomena at a more aggregated (regional, sectoral or macro) level and of the resulting aggregate economic performance. From a policy- perspective, this implies that the impact of corporate, industrial and regional strategies and policies at national and European levels can be really understood only through the changes they induce in individual firm behaviour. Integrated and comparable cross-country firm-level evidence will shape the core of the research effort undertaken within the project. The analysis will use as far as possible comprehensive data-sets across all European regions and industries. Statistical models of individual behavior will be used which will be aggregated at sectoral, regional and national levels to recover the behavior of aggregate variables. At the moment, there are very few such models around as different researchers have concentrated on different levels of aggregation with little exploration of their interdependence.

RBSOs play a key role in transforming scientific knowledge into new knowledge that is embodied in new technologies, products, services and processes. Hence, they play an important role as an engine of innovation and growth for Europe. In this project we seek to understand the conditions under which RBSOs effectively contribute to the generation of new knowledge and its dissemination in the environment in which they are embedded.The project has three objectives. 1. We will analyze the determinants of the knowledge creation and transformation function of RBSOs as is mirrored in the innovative activity. These determinants include: the structure and resources of RBSOs; the institutional characteristics of the PROs and the local/national environment, and the nature of knowledge in different domains.2. We will examine the impact of the innovative activity of RBSOs on their competitiveness and growth, and the factors that moderate this relationship.3. We will study the impact of RBSOs on innovation and growth of their customers and partners which possibly are the main beneficiaries of the knowledge creation and transformation activity of RBSOs.The results of our analyses will allow us to reassess the rationale for public support to the creation and development of RBSOs.To achieve these objectives we will develop a conceptual model drawn on the resource- based view of the firm and institutional theories and will then validate it using empirical data. Our analysis will combine quantitative data analysis with case studies of firms in different European countries. The project benefits from the competencies developed by the Consortium members in economics, sociology, management, science policy. It also builds on and substantially extends the results of previous EU projects in related fields in which the members were involved. ",

These policies are facing major transformations. The first relates to the changing dynamics of knowledge production, with the new 'search regime' of the new leading (NBIC) sciences, and with the research intensification of many industries and services. The second is linked to the changing relationship between science and society, with the burgeoning of controversies and public debates about priorities and research practices (such as GM field trials). The third concerns the growing importance of both regional and European public authorities. This means that one can no longer simply equate public intervention with national policy and that we must fundamentally reassess our accumulated knowledge on R&I policies. To address these challenges, our analysis suggests that, although Europe possesses important capabilities, and although we have prior experience of collaborating in EC programmes, the field remains fragmented in terms of both its organisation and its production of knowledge (constrained, for example, by the limited extent to which truly comparable databases exist on policy-relevant issues). The objective of the Network of Excellence is to foster the emergence of a lasting structure to integrate the efforts of leading researchers in the field. Description of the project: The Network gathers 42 institutions, and within them 55 research groups and 230 researchers from four main disciplines (economics, sociology, political sciences and management). It is organised around 3 research foci (changing rationales for public intervention, the emergence of multi-actor spaces and the governance of S&T in Europe, the transformations of public sector research) and 3 \"structural\" activities aiming at fostering lasting infrastructures at the European level on ST&I indicators, training (both at Master, PhD and professional levels) and interaction with stakeholders. The operation associates shared priority setting (though working groups and various integration azctivities) with bottom-up defined projects selected through open calls, with the Scientific Committee of the network acting as a guarantor of quality and originality, and the Executive Committee making decisions on the basis of relevance. We intend the network to remain open and progressively, through its activities, associate new members (depending of course on the funds available) Expected results: We expert four complementary types of results. We aim first at being very active in shaping the research agenda of the \"specialty\" (science and innovation policy studies). We should establish over the five year period of the network, an articulated frame for training (at Master, at PhD and at professional levels including shared curricula and resources, circulation of teachers and students -especially at PhD level -, summer schools, PhD conferences). We expect to explore and test the conditions for a lasting infrastructure on SI&I indicators at the European level. Finally we focus research activities (and thus expect significant results) on issues related to our three main foci and that require long term investments and renewed approaches on the one hand, and issues that entail new approaches for inter-country comparisons. Scientific and policy outcomes Beyond the usual expectations of all projects about dissemination and interaction with stakeholders, we consider the role of NoEs to address the tension faced by our specialty with on the one hand an overall size that argues for the gathering in a limited number of centers, and on the other hand, the need in each country (and in someregions of larger countries) to maintain research teams reflecting on the specific issues they face. The network has developed a 'progress model' to foster the gradual integration of teams in 'virtual centres of excellence' which should maintain and even foster both competition and the diversity of approaches, key for the long term dynamics of the field.

New actors are entering these institutions in terms of partners or experts on quality assurance. As a consequence professional positions and demands on professional competencies in these institutions are in transition. At the same time European societies are changing in different ways, e.g. in terms of a 'knowledge society' as well as in demographic and cultural changes. Professionals such as teachers and nurses are meeting such changes in their work with students and clients. Thus, there is a need to study these transitions and changes. The project will look at this from a 'bottom-up' perspective by comparing experiences in different institutional and national contexts. It is based on international reviews and analyses of research in the current field. In focus for the studies are seven national contexts; Finland, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Brief description of the project: 1. To produce an improved knowledge base on professional knowledge \u00bfat work\u00bf among professional actors situated between the state on one side and citizens on the other side. This is based on life histories with three generations of teachers and nurses plus ethnographies in different European contexts. Studies of professional knowledge \u00ab at work \u00bb are complemented with and compared to analyses of the education and training of teachers and nurses on one side and analyses of restructuring measures in education and health in different national contexts. 2. To describe, analyse and compare current restructuring in education and health in different parts of Europe from the point of view of teachers and nurses and in relation to their interaction with clients. An important aspect will be a social analysis based on surveys of up to 11,000 nurses and teachers in five European countries (Finland, Greece, Spain, Sweden and the UK) 3. To contribute to the integration of a European Research Arena in terms of research cooperation, research communication and actions in relation to the enlargement of the European Union. It is our ambition to invite researchers from the new European Union member states to joint seminars and to comment on the PROFKNOW studies and eventually to conduct similar studies in their contexts 4. To inform the professions of nursing and teaching, policymakers as well as citizens about our studies on institutional restructuring and the meaning of this for professional work and life in a changing Europe. Expected results: The PROFKNOW project is expected to produce an increased insight in current restructuring measures of welfare state institutions. The \u00ab bottom-up \u00bb perspective will provide professionals as well as policy makers with a more differentiated view of current demands on European institutions and challenges for their professionals ",

Based upon approaches in science policy studies and science studies and analyzing the gains and losses of spin-off activities for public research institutions, PROKNOW examines the relevance of public and private forms of knowledge in innovative processes of knowledge production. Academic spin-offs often epitomize innovative forms of knowledge production and are thus an exemplary topic to study innovation processes in the interaction of science, industry and society. PROKNOW proposes a European-wide comparison of research institutions in seven countries, including the three biggest research systems, Germany, France and the UK, the highly innovative systems of the Netherlands, Switzerland and Finland, and the associated candidate country Bulgaria. Institutionally PROKNOW compares different forms of public sector research institutions, for example university and extra-university institutions. In terms of economic sectors, the project focuses on life sciences, information sciences and nanotechnology. Thus, PROKNOW allows for analysing the institutional and organisational conditions for a profitable interaction between public research institutions and academic spin-offs. ",

This project responds to this challenge in three ways by proposing: 1. a comparative analysis of the bases (epistemologica!, structural, etc) of this fragmentation; 2. a comparative analysis of interdisciplinary research and its impact; 3. the development of a prototype European integrated research methods training module as one step towards overcoming the barriers between the Social Sciences and the Humanities. It thus answers topic 1.2 of Priority 7 which asks that 'Research should analyse the forms of national, disciplinary and paradigmatic fragmentation of the social sciences and humanities in Europe and propose practicable means to overcome this fragmentation.' The module proposed constitutes one such practicable means of overcoming fragmentation. Other recommendations will be made based on the findings of 1 and 2 above. As European countries are implementing the Bologna Agreement and developing new postgraduate MA/MSc degrees, this project presents a unique opportunity to develop a module that can be implemented across all European countries as part of the education reforms currently undertaken, fostering through its integrative component the opportunities for the development of new knowledge, a broad knowledge base, and the ability to adapt to changing work and research environments through the acquisition by learners/future researchers of a barrier-breaking basis in integrated research methods training.

It aims at developing a comprehensive report on how societal, legal, and economic factors affect the patterns of regional economic growth and how Knowledge-Based Entrepreneurship (KBE) contributes to shifting patterns of regional comparative advantage and to regional growth and social cohesion. Our research will assess the links between societal, legal, and economic mechanisms and KBE at micro level, while studying the resulting regional dynamics and growth patterns at macro level. We will use a cross disciplinary approach to study KBE as a complex, multi-dimensional process. While theoretically grounded, our analysis will be mainly empirical and will provide a detailed blueprint for the implementation of the Green paper on Entrepreneurship. The project will have three main objectives: (1) Analyse the societal, legal, and economic factors that determine the forms and intensity of KBE. We will identify factors that affect risk-taking and entrepreneurship and create a conducive environment to the circulation of ideas within and across firms, fostering creative destruction. We will document how societal values, social capital, legal factors (e.g., intellectual property rights and corporate governance codes) and the provision of finance (especially through venture capital) affect KBE across European regions. (2) Analyse how KBE contributes to shifting patters of regional comparative advantage. We will assess the experiences of regions with different policies for the creation of human and social capital, for the elimination of barriers to entrepreneurship, for influencing the location decision of knowledge-based firms, and for technology transfers from established companies and universities to start-ups. We will look at the experience of one accession country and of India, Israel, and Brazil. (3) Discuss the policy implications of our analysis. We will deliver detailed policy suggestions. ",

These include changing institutional arrangements, organisational conditions, incentive systems, socio-cultural attitudes, cognitive flexibility, and specific types of knowledge. How do those factors shape new understandings of knowledge itself, and hinder or foster knowledge creation, use, and dissemination? The STREP focuses on the interrelatedness of the enterprise, public science/higher education, and government spheres as the main agents to put the 'knowledge triangle' of education, research and innovation to work. The U-Know approach has an economic flavour but includes scientists from a variety of different backgrounds. A rigorous methodological framework is applied. The U-Know project goes beyond the application of monodisciplinary theories from orthodox approaches by using the 'Network Alignment' theory. This can be seen as complementary to the 'Mode 2' and/or 'Triple Helix' approaches to knowledge production and interaction. Bringing all three together is a novelty applied as a tool to understand the role of knowledge in the European economy. Network alignment has been a key ingredient for economic growth in some East Asian countries. Building on this experience, the project undertakes comparative studies on a selection of European countries to identify network mis-alignment in sectoral, regional, and national innovation systems. This constitutes a key underpinning for extensive policy implications which contribute to the development of a broad-based third generation knowledge and innovation policy. This encompasses areas of learning and innovation in companies, institutions for higher education, research, and government itself. Policy advice supports the enhancement and alignment of knowledge communities in order to reinforce the competitiveness of European economies in accordance with the Lisbon agenda. ",

CARVALHO graca@iec.uminho.pt Unit L2 Scientific Officer : Veronica Beneitez Pinero veronica.beneitez-pinero@ec.europa.eu http://www.biohead-citizen.net/ Objectives: Biology, Health and Environmental Education may differ in different countries, even among European countries. Our project aims to analyse such possible differences (and associate them to controlled parameters, e.g. gender, social context, religion) and to understand better how Biology, Health and Environmental Education can promote a better citizenship, including their affective and social dimensions. It is expected that this understanding may clarify the relevant challenges that the European Education Systems have to face to maximise their efficiency in order to reinforce a knowledge based society. This study includes 18 countries (5 old EU member states, 6 new EU states, 1 candidate state and 6 INCO Countries) in order to carry out a large transnational comparative study, making possible several comparisons: North-South countries, East-West countries, European-non-European countries; different religions, different economical or political systems, different recent history, different lifestyles and quality of life. Brief description: Two main methodologies will be used: i) A comparative analysis of syllabi and school textbooks. For each selected topic, one grid of analysis will be used by the 18 countries (after appropriate translation and adaptation). Each Participant will work on precise topics, for all school levels (Primary and Secondary Schools, i.e. from 6 to 18 years old students). ii) A comparative analysis of the teachers\u00bf and teachers-to-be' conceptions (social representations) related to the selected topics. Here also, the same methodology will be used in the 18 countries, i.e. one questionnaire for each selected topic will be applied after appropriate translation and adaptation to the local language. Most of the questionnaire will be common to all countries but a few questions focusing specific local needs can be added. The precise samples to be used in all countries will be defined at the Kick off Meeting. Expected results: Besides the outcomes concerning fundamental aspects of our research (interactions between scientific knowledge, values, affective and social dimensions in Biology, Health and Environmental Education), other essential potential impacts are expected: i) Contribution to didactical changes: Concerning each selected topic (mainly on Environmental and Health Education, but also the teachings related to biological determinism, sexuality, evolution) we expect that our critical and comparative analyses will contribute to promote changes in the syllabi, the scholar textbooks, and the way of teaching these topics. We do not have the pretension of solving so important societal problems as sexism, racism, fatalism, or Health and Environmental questions. We rather intend to analyse how teaching can contribute to reduce these problems. The project outcomes will be worked out in order to be submitted as didactical proposals to local national and European policy-makers. ii) Contribution to the awareness of different social values: The comparison among European and INCO countries of our consortium, will make it possible to identify the relevant challenges that educational systems have to face. Being aware of these challenges, police-makers can maximise their efficiency in order to reinforce a knowledge based society.

This agenda creates a positive dynamic between social justice and economic efficiency, the vital foundations for a knowledge economy. The important priority is to allow every person, where ever she lives and works, to develop her own future with the resources that are available to her. What possibilities are open to her? What effective freedom of choice does she possess? What obstacles impede her plans? What forms of public action, subject to what types of public debate, are available to overcome these restrictions? How can public policy overcome inequalities of capabilities? What political procedures can Europe employ to push Member states in the direction of such change? CAPRIGHT integrates two approaches into one process: one addresses resource regimes, the other inequalities in capabilities, developed from the work of Amartya Sen. This involves disciplines of anthropology, economics, history, law, political science and philosophy, sociology. CAPRIGHT will create a critical mass of empirical research in three key areas: gender equality, professional development and work restructuring. It will contribute to the creation, on several levels, of public spaces within which processes of deliberative social democracy can address these issues. Each area is analysed from three entry points, offering empirical evidence 'from the bottom up' within a WP: the actual trajectories of people\u00bfs working live; situated public action; social dialogue and European policy development. To ensure a unified approach, from the hypotheses to the conclusions, the work is framed on the one hand by theoretical work and on the other by the elucidation of the political agenda.

It makes contribution to the European research through: the development of information networks, and the encouragement of the exchange and spread of good practice, and information exchange. Research activities will comprehensively review Life Long Learning strategies and explore Life Long Learning strategies as a means for achieving empowerment and social inclusion for selected groups of citizens with an emphasis on disability groups, including mental health service users. In addition, the project demonstrates innovation for achieving the empowerment of mental health users through a creative synthesis between high quality research, training and demonstration activities. Central to the research are two linked research designs, a multi-site organisational case study and a delayed entry randomised control trial. The project objectives will be achieved through the creation across Europe of local-level Learning Organisations involved in mental health care. The outcome will be major improvements in employment opportunities available for service users thereby significantly improving their social inclusion. This project will encourage mental health services to optimise comprehensive application of Life Long Learning strategies, and to maximise service user involvement through Life Long Learning strategies in research, audit, training and delivery of services, and by so doing open up new employment routes for service users in mental health services. The proposal throughout addresses gender issues of imbalance and inequality, both in the management of the project itself, and in the mental health services involved. It also uses innovative pedagogical strategies with a shift in emphasis from knowledge acquisition to competence, implying new roles for teachers and learners. ",

The central focus of the research will be on social cohesion and its dependence on social differentiation, assessing the relationships between the growing importance of knowledge in the economy, the different chances that individuals and social groups experience with respect to the quality of life, and social cohesion. Within this framework it will make a major contribution to advancing knowledge about how factors such as employment, income, education, housing and urban conditions, and life-styles inter-relate and effect personal well-being and psychological health. It will explore how far differential life chances reinforce differences between social categories - such as gender, class and ethnicity - and the role of inter-generational inheritance processes in sustaining such differences over time. It will assess the implications of such social inequalities and social differentiation for social cohesion at the micro, meso and macro levels, including the effects of institutional differences and the scope for policy intervention. The network will mobilise leading researchers across Europe in economics, political science, social policy and sociology. Drawing upon the organisational experience acquired in a pilot network (CHANGEQUAL), it brings together the expertise of several successful previous EU networks.

Currently, Ccomparative analysis of many aspects of the quality of life and of social cohesion , for example health, living conditions and economic situation of Europe's population, seeking to understand variation between member states, is hampered by the absence lack of a measure of social structure and social position.an agreed, harmonised and validated classification of socio-economic positions. The creation of a European Socio-economic Classification (ESEC) will fill this void in the European Statistical System and thus will stimulate comparative and interdisciplinary research across current and future European member states. Description of the project: This project proposal is designed to improve the state of the art in 'this area and to make demonstrable progress towards comparative research in a wide variety of areas relevant to the knowledge based society. These include the health, living conditions and labour market situation of men and women within Europe. By facilitating the analysis of key Europe-wide data resources, it will allow researchers to address the gap in our understanding between the prevalence and distribution of quality of life issues such as educational and health inequalities on the one hand and broader social and economic inequalities on the other. That is, an ESEC will provide a fundamental and essential tool which will facilitate our understanding of the knowledge based society, its consequences for social cohesion and in particular key issues relating to old and new social and economic inequalities. Thereby it will make a vital contribution both to the understanding of societal problems in Europe and therefore to the creation of a European Research Area in the social sciences by dramatically improving the quality and utility of pan-European official statistics. providing an essential comparative European research tool, this project will also greatly facilitate subsequent analyses of intergenerational social mobility and the intergenerational inheritance of inequalities. The proposed two year programme of research and dissemination is a major collaborative effort by key actors in this area, most of whom have worked together before. Via a detailed programme of work, designed to create a conceptually clear, validated and easily operationalised socio-economic classification for use in comparative European analyses, key policy and scientific issues relating to health and socio-economic inequalities will be addressed. Validation studies relating to the proposed European Socio-economic Classification will include (inter alia) comparative analyses of health inequalities and analyses of labour market insecurity. Expected results: Ultimately, the project will result in the production of a fully validated ESEC, that is a measure which both captures the underlying conceptual dimension of employment relations and proves useful in the comparative analysis of societal problems across Europe. It is intended that Oour work will also serve to improve the quality of public statistics in candidate countries and those EU member states that do not have national SECs. ",

The fundamental aim of the proposed project is to create and disseminate new knowledge that will facilitate the achievement of greater social equality, and therefore enhance the social cohesiveness, and democratic and market development of Central and East European (CEE) states and their integration with Western Europe. The project will investigate the multifaceted character of social inequality in CEE states, where the extent and character of social inequality has been dramatically impacted by the transition from controlled economies to (variously successful) forms of market and democratic systems. It will assess the economic and political causes of social inequality among both individuals and countries and its consequences for social cohesion, economic development, social conflict, social mobility, democratic consolidation, and international integration. The research will proceed comparatively by examining differences within Central and East European (CEE) states (including EU members, Associated States, and International Cooperation target states in the FSU) and by looking at changes over time in the character and consequences of social inequality within CEE. By analysing 'best practice' within CEE states and other parts of the world, the main impact of the project will be to guide policy measures and institutional arrangements at the national and EU level that will (a) underpin individual and household strategies that may reduce social inequality, (b) contribute to understanding of factors that may reduce social conflict, and (c) enhance economic development, democratic consolidation and European integration.

As to wage inequality, three key economic mechanisms will be studied, with a focus on EU countries and on a group of developing/neighbouring countries: technological change; global trade and FDI; finance. They will be integrated into a general economic modelling for EU countries that may allow to compare their relative importance and to simulate the impact of different policies. As to market income inequality in Europe account will be taken of non-wage income, of households composition and employment. Finally the redistributive role of Welfare states will allow to investigate the dynamics of disposable income. Considering social processes, the gender, inter-generational and ethnic/immigrant factors leading to social polarisation and inequality will be addressed in the case of EU countries; at the global level, the social dynamics reacting to inequalities will be investigated focusing on the activities of non state actors and on collective mobilisations challenging current policies. In terms of policy, a variety of economic (taxation, expenditure, welfare reform, etc.) and social (on gender, immigrant, social rights) policies that affect inequality within Europe will be analysed, showing how public decision making contributes or restrains the inequality mechanisms and their effects. A set of blueprints will be prepared with detailed recommendations on how national and EU policies could contribute to reduce inequalities, both within Europe and, for their part, at the global level.

This project aims to establish links between official documents, curriculum management and the teachers' experiences, interests and expectations with regard to Citizenship Education, with a special focus on the intercultural dimension. This project intends to map out, in each of the participant countries, the teacher development programmes and postgraduate courses that can offer relevant education for educators, as far as the intercultural dimension of citizenship is concerned, and to assess them in the light of the reviewed bibliography, of the official guidelines, at the European and national levels. The purpose of this project is to contribute to the effective implementation of official guidelines on this matter and to the expansion of good practices. Description of the project: This project deals with the social and political changes resulting from European integration, enlargement and globalisation and their impact upon four different member countries: Portugal, Spain, Denmark and England. It follows three main steps: (1) document analysis; (2) curriculum analysis; (3) an empirical study. This project started with the analysis of the intercultural element in official normative European documents dealing with citizenship education and moved into a comparative/contrastive analysis on the same issue between national documents. Some interviews to authors (both academic scholars and policy-makers) are to be carried out. The main corpus of this project consists of an empirical study (quantitative and qualitative) with teachers (at all levels previous to higher education) involved in citizenship education. This project is focusing on the perceptions, experiences and expectations that teachers have about the intercultural dimension of citizenship education, both as citizens and as educators. It is also looking at the relationships that teachers establish with NGOs and on the way they use the information they receive from the media. The project will analyse both inputs and outputs in teacher education i. e. their sources of knowledge, both content and experiential knowledge, and the possibilities they can create in order to become active participative educators within the scope of intercultural citizenship education. Expected results: Reports and publications. The final product(s) will contain clear guidelines and recommendations within citizenship and human rights education while focused upon active civic participation. This project is meant to impact upon the participants in the project and upon the potential users of its products, that is, policy-makers, academics, teacher educators and mentors, prospective and experienced teachers who have been or will be involved in citizenship education and, more specifically, in intercultural education both for mainstream and minority students. It is assumed that participants and targets will reflect critically upon the recommendations and their implications as stated in transnational and national official documents, upon their own experiences and practices and will refocus their mental frameworks by becoming more aware of the complexities of intercultural education when considered within the scope of citizenship education.

As a consequence, new patterns of contingency and constancy, movement and integration, work and family are emerging. An extended mobility of employees is both a requirement and a precondition of the knowledge-based society and essential for social and territorial cohesion in Europe. One of the key challenges Europe faces in this situation is to understand how to encourage the flow of people and ideas across Europe without creating impairments regarding family formation, social integration, and individual well being. To improve this understanding is the main objective of this comparative research, covering six comprehensively selected European countries: both old and new EU members, and an associated country, representing varying levels of economic development, demographic situation, social environments, and cultural traditions. The study is targeted at - mapping the demands and potentials of job mobility across selected regions, and identifying the barriers and triggers influencing the readiness to become mobile - identifying the consequences of job mobility for family formation (marriage, fertility, divorce), family relations (child care, coping, conflict management, division of labour), social integration, and individual well being - assessing the gender-specific issues in the field of mobility with a special focus on women, as our previous research suggests the costs of job mobility are higher for women - developing suggestions for adequate political measures to advance quality of life of mobile employees and their families in Europe, and balancing demands against readiness to move.

Like the state, the family provides care, education, financial support, and help in finding employment. It also influences (and occasionally controls) choices involving career and marriage. However the role of the family is not constant over time and space. We know, from statistical sources and from sociological and ethnographic studies, that it varies greatly between different parts of contemporary Europe. Changing patterns of marriage, cohabitation and divorce, declining fertility and aging populations, also have implications for the family's social security role. Though the role of kinship in social security has important implications for state and EU policy on social security, gender discrimination and social exclusion, it remains relatively little understood - despite challenging contributions in recent decades from anthropology, economics and evolutionary theory. One reason for this is that conventional data sources such as census and surveys do not collect the full range of data needed to evaluate these theoretical developments. The only sort of data that is capable of capturing enough factual detail about kinship networks, while also investigating the way these relationships are actually experienced, is ethnographic fieldwork. One of the central ideas of this proposal is to use ethnographic methods, followed by both interpretative and mathematical analyses of the resulting data to illuminate the questions above. The second central idea is that current trends need to be understood in their historical context. The fieldwork studies will be carried out in eight European countries and will be placed in context by reviews of existing knowledge of the current social security role of kinship ties, and of the historical background. The implications for policywill be examined. Explanatory models of mutual assistance between kin will be developed and related to explanations of family forming behaviour. In the final phase of the project, policy experts will be invited to discuss the implications of these models for policy. ",

The focus is on a unique type of response to growing exclusion, namely the creative and socially innovative strategies by which people react to conditions of exclusion, both at the individual and collective level. People in situations of need activate and (re)produce particular types of knowledge and combine resources in novel ways. The strategies they develop in response to exclusion often exhibit marked differences in the ways in which mainstream society\u00bfs knowledge and practices are mobilised and deployed, and frequently trigger processes of social innovation that open up fresh venues for policy design and implementation. KATARSIS\u00bf Coordination Activities include: (i) Surveying the literature in five existential fields (Labour Market and Social Economy; Education and Training; Housing and Neighbourhood; Health and Environment; Governance and Democracy); (ii) Three Integration Exercises meant to improve the integration among scientific and methodological perspectives in the analysis of socially innovative initiatives. These Exercises are organised around 3 themes: Bottom- up Creativity; Governance and Social Innovation; (iii) The development of a research methodology to study the organization and agency of socially innovative initiatives. This methodology will include theoretical integration, design of research methods as well as modes of integration and coordination of research programmes in this field; (iv) A multi-dimensional dissemination and user group strategy, involving practitioners and policy makers in the field of social inclusion, empowerment and participation. Customized publications (including on website) will support this strategy. ",

Brief description of the project Within the project empirical studies will be carried out with regard to macro, meso and micro levels in order to take into account macro-structural factors and national policies, as well as institutional factors and actors' motivation and actions, which are all considered to influence the role of educational systems in promoting lifelong learning. Analyses will be based on the following surveys and data: (a) individual learners (a survey of adult learners in schools and universities and data from Eurostat driven Adult Education Survey); (b) educational institutions (interviews with schools' management and officials from education ministries); (c) enterprises (interviews with SME management). The project is designed in a way to integrate into a coherent picture the different aspects - historical, political, institutional, economic, individual and methodological - related to participation in and access to lifelong learning. Expected results (expected scientific and policy outcomes) The project aims (a) to extend the present knowledge of the relation between lifelong learning, education system, social inclusion and the knowledge-based society by the multidisciplinary development of the conceptual framework; by the development of methodology of comparative research; by the development of a common strategy for analyses of standardized data of the Adult Education Survey: - European typology of basic patterns of participation in lifelong learning will be developed and causal factors of cross-country differences will be revealed; - differences between European countries in the expectations and attitudes towards LLL, obstacles to access and support received will be outlined. (b) to contribute to social innovation in terms of context-sensitive usage of the best inclusive practices on lifelong learning: - in all the countries the best practices of educational system\u00bfs contributions to promoting lifelong learning will be identified, with special attention for the participation in lifelong learning for groups at risk of being socially and economically excluded; - the links between these practices and their institutional context will be revealed and preconditions for implementation of best practices in different institutional and political contexts will be explored; - context-sensitive European models of best practices in lifelong learning will be offered.

This project defines the concept of political integration as the combination of the degree of socio-political participation and the level of trust and acceptance of the political values, institutions and elites of the host society. The questions that guide the whole research are the following: - To what extent is the immigrant population politically integrated into the local life of their cities? - Are there significant differences in the degree to which different ethnic, cultural or national groups are politically integrated into the local life? - If such differences exist, what factors help explain the variations in the degree of political integration from one immigrant group to another? The analytical approach of the research considers the potential influence of four types of factors: (1) immigrants' individual characteristics; (2) the structuring of immigrants' organizations along ethnic, national or geo-cultural cleavages; (3) the structure of institutional and discursive opportunities; and (4) the characteristics of the immigrant groups within the host society. The research will collect the necessary information at three different levels of analysis: (1) The contextual or macro level, through the use of secondary sources and interviews with political and administrative authorities; (2) The organizational or meso level, through (a) the study of immigrants\u00bf organisational structures and networks, through surveys to immigrants\u00bf associations; and (b) the analysis of 'organizational' life histories, through in-depth interviews with the leaders of some of the immigrants' associations. (3) The individual or micro level, through a survey to immigrant residents of different origins (with a control group of national-born citizens). ",

It focuses on changes due to renewal of cohorts. Consideration is taken of cohorts now old (broken into age groups, given the heterogeneity of conditions at older ages) and of those who will reach old age in the next 25 years (considering the situation of persons aged 40+ in 2005), for a prognosis of trends in gender differentials and an evaluation of actions likely to reduce these gaps. Quality of life is measured on health conditions, economic resources, family situation and social integration. On each, objective indicators of living conditions are confronted with perceptions by the persons of their own situation. It is argued that the main factors of gender gaps in well being are to be found in the life course of individuals - in particular in the way they conciliated their professional career with their family life - and in the way they have experienced some more recent key events like retirement, widowhood, health deterioration or institutionalisation. Statistical analysis of individual-level data, based on event-history methods, is to show the impact of these factors. It is also argued that gender gaps in quality of life are shaped by the socio cultural context (welfare regimes, economic circumstances, normative climate). National and EU policies play here a major role. Cross-national multilevel analysis is to evidence these mechanisms. Use is made of existing data, in particular comparative surveys recently conducted in Europe giving simultaneously indications on the well being of interviewees and their life course. Contextual information is collected for cross-country analysis. A consortium of 9 teams carries out the project, all presently active in FELICIE, a FP5 research project.

The range of issues is wide, but overall it has two main objectives. * to analyse the factors and processes - involving labour markets, financial markets and social provision - that have impacted upon individual households and have consequences for their housing positions * to establish: how households perceive the patterns of security and insecurity associated with different housing positions; how these mould their personal strategies with respect not only to housing, but also to matters such as jobs, family size, education and pensions; and how those positions have resulted in material security and insecurity. Description of the project: One dimension of citizenship consists of the packages of rights, enshrined in the social policies of the EC and its member states, through which citizens get access to specified goods and services that enable them to share in the standard of living of their society. Some benefits are additionally available to home owners, eg through its ability to redistribute resources over the life cycle, providing income in old age. With national home ownership sectors increasing in size, this potential available to home owners but not to tenants, may be opening up a divide, a two-track citizenship based on tenure. Though a source of advantage and security, home ownership is also a site of potential risk and insecurity: falling house prices, negative equity, loan default, foreclosure and homelessness. OSIS will research the security aspects of home ownership, as well as the insecurity risks that form elements of the strategies adopted by households as they make decisions about such matters as family formation, education, work, location and housing. Expected results: In order to provide a comprehensive factual picture and understanding, the scientific research carried out within OSIS draws on a number of disciplines and approaches. It will involve quantitative studies using secondary sources of data to provide evidence of statistical relationships between, on the one hand, the security and insecurity aspects of home ownership, and, on the other hand, attributes of individual countries and of individuals and households. These studies are both end-products in themselves as well as inputs to the second set of studies, largely using qualitative methodologies. They will involve both the collection of further information about the institutional arrangements in each country as well as household interviews undertaken in each of the countries directly represented in OSIS. Throughout, the identification of policy-relevant analysis and conclusions will be emphasised. The results will be disseminated through reports and other publications, conferences and a policy-focused seminar. ",

The project's specific objectives are: - Developing a greater understanding of the socio-economic-cultural context within which intergenerational inheritance of inequalities (IIofI) occurs and policy responses at the national level - Developing a greater understanding of policy responses at local level to overcome IIofI - Identifying the relative importance of policy among the factors affecting social mobility of individuals - Assessing the transportability of policy solutions promoting social mobility chances at local level Description of the project: The departure point of the project is the assumption that the transmission of inequalities, being a result of intersecting influences coming from the family of origin, community and society, constrains the achievement of EU strategic objectives. Social policy could - partially at least - diminish the influence of IIofI. The analysis seeks to identify institutions and other relevant bodies which can help to strengthen the improvement of social mobility mechanisms. A multidisciplinary comparative study in policies and practices (with special attention paid to education) will be conducted in eight countries with different socio-economic-cultural context to enable generalisation of project findings. The project focuses on interrelations between policies and practices exercised at the national (society) and the local (community) level targeted at spurring social mobility. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be implemented. Secondary analysis and new field work will be conducted to achieve projects objectives. Expected results: The following scientific and policy outcomes are expected: - Identified policy responses in different socio-economic-cultural contexts aimed at counteracting intergenerational inheritance of inequalities at the national level - Specified implications of different national contexts for policies and practices to counteract IIofI at the local level - Defined relative importance of local policy among the factors affecting social mobility of individuals - Identified possibilities and constrains to transferring good practice examples between communities from different Countries.

Aims of this project are: 1. to analyse, from an internationally-comparative perspective, the quality of life and work of European citizens, the way the quality of life and work are interrelated, and the impact public and organisational policies have on the well-being of European citizens; 2. to analyse how and under what conditions European workplaces could be transformed into healthy organisations, where work is organised in a socially as well as economically sustainable manner; 3. to explore future trends by consulting national high-level groups and by sketching/constructing scenarios with respect to trends concerning the quality of life and work of European citizens; 4. to analyse whether, to what extent and how gender matters in the relationship between well-being and public and organisational policies. The research will contribute to policy-making by furthering our understanding of criteria that indicate the level of well-being; by elaborating the concept of healthy organisations with a specific focus on the quality of work and the work-life balance; by mainstreaming the gender perspective and by disseminating the results to relevant stakeholders.

RECWOWE will integrate existing research activities on two levels. By adopting a common focus on the various tensions that characterize the relationships between work and welfare, it will firstly promote knowledge focused on both simultaneously. Secondly, by constructing a network of specialists from different research domains and disciplines, it will create a basis for joint activities. The ultimate aim is the constitution of a 'virtual institute' federating the research excellence necessary to identify and understand the multiple tensions between work and welfare, as well as strategies for managing or resolving them. RECWOWE will innovate in the field of labour market and social protection research in three related ways. The common focus on tensions will give rise to perspectives and questions for research that are currently lost in the 'void' between existing research domains and academic disciplines. The activity of the network will promote new institutional and individual collaborations, based on novel combinations of disciplinary and geographical expertise. Combining these new questions and collaborations, RECWOWE will ultimately be a source of innovative new research projects focused on the interface between work and welfare. RECWOWE will, finally, seek to effectively share the new knowledge that is built up through its activities. It will organize specific training actions for students and professionals. It will centralize and publicize existing and new sources of data on work and welfare, and disseminate analyses and findings through a dedicated structure. It will, finally, seek to generate a permanent two-way dialogue with political and social actors, so that its activities can most usefully inform the future choices of the European social model. ",

Two recent major trends affect the demands that higher education graduates face. One involves the increasing emphasis on education and training, seen by many as the most important factor affecting economic growth (see for example World Bank, 2002). Another trend relates to changes in labour market processes. Schmid (2000) introduced the concept of the transitional labour market to indicate how in modern society, the demarcation lines between work, leisure time, education and care have been blurred, leading to increased mobility and flexibility patterns, to de-standardisation of the life course and to an overall focus on employability. This has clear implications for the kinds of demands made of higher education graduates. There are good reasons to believe that higher education graduates are expected to be more or less competent in at least the following four areas: professional expertise, functional flexibility, innovation and knowledge management and mobilisation of human resources. Description of the project: In this project we will seek to answer the following questions: 1. What competencies are needed to fulfil the abovementioned demands? 2. How are these competencies related to characteristics of jobs and firms? 3. To what extent do higher education graduates possess these competencies? 4. To what extent has higher education provided (the basis for acquiring) these competencies? 5. Do particular firm characteristics make it easier or harder for graduates to meet the demands? 6. How do graduates and employers deal with discrepancies between acquired and required competencies? 7. How do characteristics of graduates, higher education institutions, employers and the broader institutional, structural and cultural context affect the transition of the graduates to the labour market and later occupational outcomes? To answer these questions, this project will develop a series of instruments: (1) a country study highlighting the main structural and institutional factors that shape the relation between higher education and work in nine European countries; (2) a qualitative study on graduate competences in the knowledge society; (3) a survey of higher education graduates in these countries. Expected results: Higher education policy has increasingly gained a European dimension with its own distinct influence over national education policies. It is clear that the Bologna declaration and the subsequent initiatives have put higher education in the centre of EU policy with the goal to create a \u00bfEurope of knowledge\u00bf (Lisbon European Council, March 2000). Universities play a vital role in this Europe of knowledge, as the recent communication of the Commission has made clear (European Commission, 2003). The results of the project, which will be disseminated in the form of several reports and memoranda, a working paper series, seminars and conferences among a broad public of scientists, policy makers and other stakeholders, are designed to provide a much-needed empirical basis for these discussions.

The most pervasive and obdurate sources of social distribution are enshrined and entrenched in S&T systems. This Project's objective is to understand processes that contribute to the increase in inequalities through the role of S&T, but also to understand processes that contribute to mitigate inequalities through S&T. The enhanced role of S&T in the global knowledge economy gives such understanding urgency. ResIST will - Analyze how global policy contexts for key S&T processes affect the distribution and redistribution of knowledge resources, and the scope for alternative framings (WP 1) - Identify the features of effective policies and programmes to build S&T human capital and institutional capacity in disadvantaged populations and places (WP 2) - Critically assess new initiatives to construct S&T priorities reflecting the needs of the disadvantaged, and review current constraints and future opportunities for their full realization (WP 3A) Map structures of accountability in the distribution of technological risks, and propose effective accountability channels to protect the poor from such risks (WP 3B) - Model the impact of new research-based technologies on the poor through dynamics such as employment, lowering costs, and impact on public services (WP 4) - In a horizontal activity, involve policymaker and practitioner stakeholders in three representative world regions - in Europe, in Southern Africa and in the Caribbean and Latin America - in the process of developing and implementing options identified in the Project. In particular use the insights developed in 1-5 to test with stakeholders the opportunity to develop tools to assess S&T policy options to achieve wider social inclusiveness for developed and developing countries and the possible distributional impacts of research programmes.

They are thus major objectives of the European welfare state, e.g. of the Lisbon agenda. Yet, health and employment vary tremendously across EU member states. The aim of this proposal is to shed light on the mechanisms through which welfare state interventions may be responsible for such differences and thus contribute to improved governance and policy design. We propose an innovative analysis of past and current welfare state interventions in Europe that has three powerful features: First, we will take a life history approach as we believe that the full effect of welfare state interventions can only be assessed over the entire life course and not by comparing concurrent policies and outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will collect life history micro data to identify intervention points at which welfare state policies - such as education, income support programs, work place regulations, health care systems, old-age and disability pension systems - affect women and men at various points in their lives. Some interventions offset, others amplify each other, and they may have cumulative effects over the life course. Also, the timing of interventions is key in identifying their causal effects. Second, we use a multidisciplinary approach that explicitly accounts for the interactions between health, work conditions and employment. Analysing health or employment in isolation ignores the interactions between health care and labour market policies. These interactions are long-term but we believe that they are crucial in creating different health and employment outcomes. Finally, we base our analyses on an innovative combination of life history, cross-sectional micro and institutional macro data that takes account of general policy differences as well as the large heterogeneity of life circumstances in EU member countries which make similar policies work differently in different life circumstances.

Recent researches raised the hypothesis that the younger generation have different attitudes, forms of participation, expectations and engagement in work than the older generations. The pessimistic view often concludes on an increased individualism. This rapid assumption is not founded on robust research. The project will provide a better understanding of the evolving relation that generations have with work. Such changes have important consequences on the intergenerational relations at the workplace, on solidarity between generations, but also on the relevance of specific work and employment policies as well as on other public policies. The relation to work is analysed through different angles: value given to work, expectations associated to work, vision of the future, relation to precariousness, relation to mobility, more generally the construction of an identity through work and the linking with other key issues. A link is also establipshed between the relation to work and other correlated issues: family formation and lifestyles, intergenerational relations in society, social inclusion or exclusion. The gender dimension and the position of migrants are constitutive and transverals aspects of all research tasks. The project also analyse age policies related to work and employment and identifies good practices. The research methodology combines qualitative, quantitative, comparative and participary approaches. The key objectives are to draw out social patterns of relation to work for different generations, including the gender dimension; to study articulations with other societal fields (family formation and lifestyles, intergenerational relations, social cohesion); to develop awareness of policy-makers on the generational dimensions in the relation to work and employment; to draw out guidelines for youth and ageing policies in this area.

They represent an important challenge for EU and its state members. Their social and cultural collocation and representation varies drammatically within different host European societies. In this perspective, the main aim of the proposed project is to evaluate and compare different structural, cultural, economic and socio- political factors that contribute to: - organize and orient socio-economic exclusion/inclusion phenomena among these groups in the public sphere - \u00b7 form/deform the perception and the construction of their belonging to their receiving societies and EU oriented values and principles. In first instance, the understanding of these processes is a potential mirror of how a society organize and set up its own rules, principles, values and socio-political instruments in an inclusion/exclusion perspective and secondly the comprehension of these differences implies the opportunity to make clear the historical processes and the socio-cultural economic and political dynamic that have managed an still govern local and national European contexts. The project aims to employ an ethnographic and \"emic\" approach in order to focus on social actors' perspectives. By this, we expect to reach two main goals: first to understand the shift between the institutional dimension on the one hand and teenagers' perceptions and expectation concerning their access to public material and non material resources and on the other. In second instance, it will be possible to compare and to assess different national contexts and to provide a better insight of the positive and negative factors that are at work in different national political systems. This will lead to outline useful patterns in order to implement the construction of an European society based on equal accessibility to material and non material resources. ",

These leading questions will be investigated in three thematic areas which represent crucial situations and status of young people in European societies: 1. Young parenthood as the question of gendered individualisation and the challenge of reproduction; 2. Transitions to work and the challenge of socio-economic and socio-cultural integration of ethnic minority youth; 3. Civic participation as the challenge of becoming an active citizen. The CA represents a high profile network which will work out the three thematic areas in workshops with other European experts on youth, researchers as well as policy makers and practitioners. It aims at integrating existing research, developing a new understanding of the youth question and at coming up with policy relevant recommendations. Each working group assembles researchers from different European countries, representing different youth transition regimes, including those of new EU member states and accession countries. The working groups specify the overall objectives and research questions in parallel as well as in integrated activities which look for interconnections between the topics.

The CA envisages: To organise and hold international workshops and conferences that aim to bring together a range of professionals from different specialist areas in this field. - To bring into focus, co-ordinate, channel and publicise the results of research into the diversity of family forms and their effects on children. - To define lines of research for greater knowledge and understanding of the consequences relating to these phenomena. - To exchange experiences as well as different proposals for legal and institutional reform in several countries. - To monitor European trends and to follow up the outcomes of institutional arrangements in EU member states and candidate countries. - To identify good practices for confronting the problems posed by the consequences of changing family forms and to work out benchmarks for the fight against child poverty. - To establish multi-directional paths of dissemination of knowledge. - To produce reports and recommendations for governments. - To explore the ways in which monitoring and reporting on the well-being of children can be ameliorated and to devise a common EU system of statistical indicators using the child as a unit of observation. Description of the project: The aim of this CA is to bring the experiences of several European countries together and confront them with the idea of devising new responses to such challenges and of disseminating research results to wider audiences concerned with such issues. Debates will hinge on the extend to which in contemporary Europe marital instability and other processes of family transformation affect the welfare of children and the quality of life of their families. Special attention will be paid to the way in which parent\u00bfs diverse individual life courses influence the living conditions of children, and the processes of social exclusion connected with child poverty that can often result from divorce and lone parenthood. Expected results: This Coordination Action will contribute to the objectives of the priority thematic area 7, particularly addressing some of the topics included in Research Area 2 such as the analysis of the close connections between the accumulation of socio-economic risks, current and past inequalities, quality of life and access to services and the understanding of the causes of the intergenerational inheritance of inequalities. It is expected that different kinds of synergies will follow: 1) Integration and exploitation of knowledge derived from previous research; 2) Exploration of new lines of research; 3) Avoidance of national fragmentation of research; 4) Statistical harmonisation; 5) Strengthening and integration of the European Research Area.

At the macro level we are concerned to measure the quality of society and at the micro level the quality of life and by articulating them assessing Social Quality in Europe. We would propose to go beyond the existing literature on individual attitudes and welfare regimes to integrate perspectives of gender and care into an analysis that encompasses Europe as a whole, including New Member States. In order to do so we would develop an analytical framework that takes into account the orientation, actions, capabilities and satisfaction of actors with the work and care systems in constructing a work-life balance. The combining of objective and subjective, macro and micro perspectives can best be synthesised under the model of 'Social Quality'. The project would look at the different actors involved in balancing work and care: the household, individuals and the state. The work would be based on the analysis of relevant indicators from existing sources but would be supplemented by qualitative interviews from five countries. The project would introduce methodological as well as theoretical innovations in the combination of policy analysis, qualitative and quantitative research to understand models of change and hence the development of different European Social Models. Finally, it would contribute to key European issues, providing a better understanding of the impact of social policies on work and care, the effects of the competing demands of work and care on fertility decisions and the consequences of flexibility and working times on the organisation of work, care and welfare.

We define a knowledge society as one which contains not just one but a plurality of knowledges, expert and lay. These range from the scientific, economic, administrative, and managerial to local, practical and ecological knowledge, traditional repertoires, trial and error or experientially- based discoveries. We further define sustainable development as a knowledge-based set of practices, within which the expert form of knowledge has been dominant, but to which non-expert forms may make a significant contribution. We seek to identify the dynamics of these different forms of knowledge, and their functioning in relation to economy and society, through case studies of rural development projects oriented towards increasing sustainability. Description of project: Rural development projects are studied in case study regions in 12 different European countries through seven thematic areas. These Work Packages cover projects addressing: land use management, demographics and civil society, nature protection and biodiversity, local food production, non-agricultural economy, innovatory economic development, and sustainable management of natural resources. The research will uncover the plurality of knowledges recognised, used or marginalised within such projects. Individual country reports in each case will be brought together as the basis for comparative analysis of the use and status of differentiated knowledge forms within a given thematic area, leading finally to a comparative analysis across themes as well as across national settings. Expected results: From an ecological point of view, rural areas are key areas for the transition to sustainable development. With the sustainability policy switch, rural areas have gained new economic significance in the post-industrial and post- agricultural development phase. This is visible in the manifold reactivations of the countryside as a diversifying, locally based economy encompassing new forms of agriculture (including organic and non-food production), small-scale food-processing, new forms of rural tourism, new forms of managing the complex natural resources which are found in or related to rural areas. The scientific outcome of the project will be an integrated understanding of these reactivations, their varying social and institutional forms, and their uses of different forms of knowledge, as a contribution to the comparative analysis of the emergence of European knowledge society. Anticipated policy outcomes are the provision and dissemination of a sound knowledge base for policies to manage this transition. ",

To this purpose, a new methodology will be designed and applied to case-studies in a variety of industrialised countries, regions and cities. The ultimate goal is to provide observatories of socio-economic development with a multi-dimensional annalytical tool. Brief description of the project: The methodology will be comparative, historical and multi-dimensional. This last property in particular means that the new approach will look at the various dimensions of socio-economic development (capital accumulation, state regulation, socio-cultural dynamics, relationships among state and civil society and state and market, strategies for growth, development and social cohesion) over inter-connected spatial scales (local, regional, national and international level). The development of the new methodology and its detailed application to case-studies of socio- economic development will be effectuated in 5 steps: 1) Reflection on the multi-dimensional character of socio-economic development and its analysis; 2) Survey of the theories of socio-economic development in all social science disciplines over the last 150 years; 3) Revalorising the results of the theoretical surveys by use of the 'institutionalism' debates in social science today: \"Socio-economic development as an institutional process\"; 4) Design of an empirical methodology to study socio-economic development as an ensemble of processes in which institutional dynamics play a decisive role; 5) Application of the methodology to case-studies in several countries, regions and cities in the Industrial Society, i.e. the development model preceding the Knowledge Society; and the development of a provisional typology of development models at articulated spatial scales. To disseminate the methodology and generate demonstration effects, a methodological conference for various user groups (researchers, observatories of socio-economic developments in the private and public sector) will be organised at the end of the project. Expected results: The new scientific approach will provide better tools for policy preparation at various spatial scales, to allow: - A better understanding of (mis)matches between policies in various domains of intervention, led by various institutions; - The development of integrated policy approaches and strategic policy agendas, combining different domains of action; - To develop a broader view of cohesion policy at various spatial levels, in terms of inter-spatial networking; - To achieve better insights into the necessary links among institutional frameworks and between policies established at various spatial levels; - To draw lessons about the risks and opportunities of cross-fertilization between socio- economic systems in EU countries and enlargement partners.

The overarching objective is to demonstrate that, with regard to the creation of a knowledge based society, the linguistic diversity prevalent in Europe is potentially an asset rather than an obstacle. To this end, the project will address the historical, political and cultural developments that have shaped the current linguistic situation in Europe, before assessing communicative situations involving speakers of different languages in a variety of relevant contexts. The project intends to show in what ways different modes of thinking and different forms of behaviour, carried by different languages can promote the creation, transfer and application of knowledge, provided citizens are enabled to understand and exploit these different ways of thinking and acting. One of the preconditions for this to occur is that citizens become multilingual and will provide support for the EU's language education policy, notably for the view that foreign languages constitute one of the most important \"new basic skills\" citizens need to acquire if they are to take an active part in the creation of a European knowledge based society.

This exercise requires \u00b7 to identify the challenges currently faced by European national models and the overall European social model \u00b7 to identify the ways these models are responding to and adapting to these challenges, as compared to each other and to North America and Japan \u00b7 to identify the interactions between policies on the EU and national levels as well as a-mongst EU member states regarding the pursuit of the EES \u00b7 to identify interactions between the macro and meso or micro levels in the process change of national employment models by the example of selected individual industries. Description of the project: It is well established that there are a wide variety of national socio-economic models within Europe that have significant consequences for the employment system. These models are under pressure from a range of different forces and have to develop new solutions to cope with these challenges. There is a need, therefore, to study national socio- economic models as dynamic models. DYNAMO will focus on the employment implications of the dynamic de- velopment of socio-economic models. A major issue is whether the pursuit of a distinctive European path depends upon the maintenance of distinctive national models within the wider EU or whether these models can converge without loss of ability to combine the achievement of economic and social objectives. The stages of analysis include (1) The analysis of national models in 10 EU countries and the main directions of change within the national models (2) Specific studies of how the different national models are responding to changes at the level of particular sectors (3) Conclusions with respect to the effectiveness of the European employment and Lisbon strategies. Expected results: Much of the debate about Europe\u00bfs economic performance revolves around the question of whether their `historical models\u00bf can be considered the member states major assets or their major liabilities. A related intense policy debate is whether there are trade-offs or complemen-tarities between the pursuit for competitiveness within socio-economic development models and the promotion of social cohesion. The expected outcome will be a contribution to a debate beyond these now rather sterile opposing perspectives and trajectories. The political outcome will be to contribute to the debate on institutional and strategic policy reforms both on the EU and national levels which are required if Europe is to simultaneously pursue competitiveness and social cohesion, both high employment rates and improved job quality.

Description of the project: The ESEMK project will first devise analytical matrices to analyse the macro-level (socio-economic model) and the micro/meso level (productive models). The originality of the project is that a socio-economic model is defined as a set of complementary institutions that rest on a socio-political equilibrium. Therefore, any transformation of the model or pressure for convergence towards another model must not be assessed in terms of comparative performance only, but more fundamentally in terms of the transformations of the socio-political equilibriums that underlie a given institutional structure. This applies at the macro as well as at the micro -level the latter being analysed through comparative intersectorial studies on the impact of financialisation, changes in the employment relationships, in product policies and productive organisation. Institutional change and social compromises take place at all levels, and transformation in productive models may lead to major transformations of a given socio-economic model. Expected results: The project therefore aim to propose a political economy theory of institutional change. We will analyse the transformations in Europe making use of the analytical tools developed during the project and see how the changes taking place at the macro/societal level and at the micro/company level interact. We will assess how the transformations in the employment relationship (including complementary social protection and education and training institutions), the financial relationship and the productive organisation lead to an alteration of the European model(s). We will study how these modifications may lead to the emergence of a specific European model exhibiting distinct characteristics (social protection, corporate governance...) or to convergence towards a market-based model. We will analyse the socio-political equilibriums upon which a specific European model may rest, what productive models may be associated to it, and whether this model is liable to make Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world in the near future.

Description of the project: The first and second rounds of this important time series were funded under FP5 and co-funded by the European Science Foundation and numerous national academic funding bodies throughout Europe. An academically-driven, uniquely rigorous survey, the ESS is documenting and helping to interpret hitherto inadequately-charted aspects of the European condition. The wide-ranging questionnaire covers people's value orientations, their cultural perspectives and the underlying social structure of their societies. A separate data collection exercise monitors major events during fieldwork as a backdrop to an understanding of attitude change. Core-funded from the start by the Commission, the project has received an overwhelming vote of confidence from some 25 national funding bodies which agreed at the start to jointly fund and actively participate in it. Always intended as a time series, the ESS has quickly established its own a remarkable momentum, a Europe-wide infrastructure and a world-wide reputation for both its content and its rigour. The project's first round is all but complete and its fieldwork for the second round well is under way. A forerunner of the European Research Area at work, the ESS has become a major scientific endeavour that requires continued core support for both its substantive and methodological contributions to European governance. This application is for Tthe third biennial round of the time series which will judiciously combine continuity with change. An independent application is being made within FP6 for infrastructure support designed to sustain and consolidate a formidable partnership and to ensure continued exploitation of rounds 1 and 2. Expected Results: Drawing on the best examples at national and international level, the ESS has already produced a rich, publicly available dataset. The format in which it is available makes it easily accessible not only to the social science and policy communities in Europe and beyond, but also to the mass media and other interested users via the World Wide Web. Round 1 of the ESS has provided benchmark measures which, when supplemented by data from future rounds, will provide evidence on the speed and direction of change in underlying public values over time. Even in an increasingly well-documented age, such data have hitherto been far from widely available. In addition, the ESS has attempted to pioneer and 'prove' a standard of methodology for cross-national attitude surveys that had not yet been considered achievable. ESS Round 3 will build upon the success of previous rounds and develop it further. The ESS continues to be innovative in its sampling standards, questionnaire design, measurement methods, translation protocols, event monitoring, response enhancement, fieldwork management, data deposit and dissemination. The project\u00bfs impact on governance within an expanding EU is thus likely to be considerable, allowing shifts in social attitudes, to play a more transparent role in European governance than has hitherto been possible. In an era of falling political participation and electoral turnout, such data help to mitigate the democratic deficit. ",

It is set to remain so for years to come, for reasons that lie both inside and outside Europe. This will have far-reaching consequences for the member states and for the EU as a whole - how to manage demand- and supply-driven migration, how to integrate the resident immigrants, how to adapt institutional arrangements to preserve social cohesion? To provide comprehensive theoretical and empirical knowledge that can form a reliable basis for policy, 19 established research institutes in 10 European countries are now proposing a Network of Excellence in the domain of International Migration, Integration and Social Cohesion (IMISCOE). Based on their wide-ranging skills and experience in international comparative research, the institutes will implement an integrated, multidisciplinary, rigorously comparative research programme, with Europe as its central focus. They will bring together some 300 selected, highly qualified researchers, whose ongoing research will be integrated into the programme. In addition, they will jointly launch two new strategic lines of research. Integration within the Network will produce a common body of knowledge, effective specialisation and an innovative division of tasks, based on the latest insights and broad multidisciplinary expertise. Special strategies will be devised to engage more researchers from Central and Eastern Europe and the southern part of the Mediterranean Basin in the research programme, eventually leading to full membership in the Consortium. IMISCOE will also develop programmes to spread excellence in Europe. Drawing on its significant expertise, it will design and implement training programmes to foster research of the highest standard both within the Network and extending to all parts of Europe. It will also pursue a communication and dissemination strategy to make research findings readily available to politicians, policymakers and stakeholders, as well as to the public at large. The 19 partners are committing 203 researchers and 95 PhD candidates to the Network annually for a five-year period, a budgeted annual input of more than 10 million euro. IMISCOE is applying for a 1 million euro grant for five consecutive years to build a stable and sustainable Network of Exellence.\" ",

In particular, LINEE aims to integrate and embed the research and structural capabilities of the partners, exchanging and consolidating good scientific and managerial practices by staff relocation/rotation, training and other activities. The research space would be re-defined through the development of new methodological and theoretical platforms, that can serve as benchmarks for a concept of 'New Multilingualism'. The 'vertical' Thematic Areas will be integrated by 'horizontal' levels of analysis that take into account the dynamics of European integration, while a Portal based on a knowledge-management system should relate in a semantic and cultural web the data and information gathered through research. Because of bridge-building between theory and practice, a focus on conflict neutralisation mechanisms and the dissemination of reliable knowledge to the scientific community and other actors dealing with policy issues, LINEE would also have a strategic impact - potentially contributing to the maintenance of peace and democracy in Europe. While specific importance is attached to participation from the new Member States, the Network is expected to raise the visibility and profile of linguistic diversity throughout Europe and beyond. LINEE is fully or contextually relevant to all the core and specific objectives of Topic 3.1.1 'Linguistic diversity in a European knowledge-based society', as well as to the Research Area general objective. It is also relevant to the dimensions of priority 7 'Citizens and Governance in a knowledge-based society'. ",

The project focuses on identifying the patterns of interactions between the levels of social capital and the capacity of civil society to choose effective and efficient development policy strategies and implementation processes to achieve the goal of sustainable development. Hence, the principal goal of the project is threefold: first, to identify the existing differences in the structure of civil society between the old and new Member States, by evaluating the level of social capital present in different territorial contexts; second, to assess how these differences in the strength of social capital and civil society may be related to the levels of effectiveness and efficiency of development policies in these countries; and third, to identify ways in which the Europeanization of public policy (in our case, cohesion policy) may be used to strengthen the level of social capital and civil society at large, thus indirectly affecting/improving the levels of effectiveness and efficiency of development policy.

It has been widely acknowledged that htis volatility and unpredictability calls for a new society in which actors should be better informed and should be able to respond in diverse and flexible ways. Two divergent soio-economic models compete currently for the highest possible benchmarks: Anglo-American neo-liberal states that have used market mechanisms to pressirize institutions and companies to change and to force citizens to react; and Nordic welfare states that have enabled and empowered citizens to act by allowing experimental use of their institutions. The overall objective of the Translearn project is to develop a road map for transnational learning for how citizens in different socio-economic systems can make experimental use of existing institutions, create new governance modes and collaborative partnerships across sectors, level and divisions of interests. The overall objective will be reached thorugh a step-wise inductive research process containing comparative cross-national analyses and multi-professional dialogues. THe project will take four Nordic countries as a point of departure, and use Slovenia as a test case for transnational learning in small new member states. These inductive lessons frm small European countries will allow for creation of new empirical and conceptual tools to compare the dynamics of change in other soio-economic models. A comparative assessment of the Nordic countries, EUcountries, adn the US will finally be used to point out to various possible roads to growth and job cration. The project is designed to feed simultaneously into policy processes at several national and Eu -levels. ",

In addition, WOLIWEB will contribute to cross-country comparative research, to European-wide data collection with regard to work life, and to the methodology of volunteer Internet surveys. Brief description of the project: WOLIWEB is a research project, including large-scale data collection, aiming to expand the Dutch web-based Wage Indicator Questionnaire to nine countries and to gather the responses of 350,000 citizens. The research will focus on four issues that are of major importance in a citizen's work life: - perceptions of pay discrimination by gender or ethnicity in relation to any factual pay gap; - preferences for more or fewer working hours in relation to working hours and household duties; - attitudes towards collective bargaining coverage in relation to actual coverage by agreements; - perceptions of job insecurity in relation to dismissals and reorganisations at the workplace. Expected results: The four major themes within WOLIWEB's work life research pay, working time, job security, bargaining coverage - are covered by two work packages (WP2, WP3). For these analyses, data will be collected by means of volunteer Internet- surveying (WP5). The cross-country comparative data collection requires a synchronized questionnaire. To ensure the national input in the questionnaire, as well as the country-specific analyses, a separate research work package for national input and output is assigned (WP4). The major effort in launching national websites and attracting a large public is assigned a separate work package (WP1). Because volunteer Internet surveying at a European scale is relatively new, and there may be methodological reservations, the methodology is extensively evaluated in a separate research work package (WP6). Finally, a separate work package is assigned to integration, coordination and dissemination activities (WP7). The seven work packages cover 27 deliverables, among others websites, papers, reports, a book, and a dataset. ",

It will also identify the types of cultural encounters in the European economy during and after the Enlargement, map the major cultural gaps and strategies to bridge them, explore the fields in which the new entrants can contribute to the rejuvenation of economic cultures in the Union, and enable the EU to draw lessons for the next rounds of accession. The project aims at bringing the cultural probl\u00e9matique back in the economic discourse of Enlargement. Brief description of the project: The project takes the acronym DIOSCURI after the mythological twins Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus, representing the \u00bfEast\u00bf and the \u00bfWest.\u00bf In complementing each other, the Dioscuri never strove in rivalry for leadership \u00bf this is the promising message of Greek mythology. Nevertheless, despite their exemplary relationship, they did not find eternal peace but have to spend alternate days on Olympus (as gods) and in Hades (as deceased mortals). The project\u00bfs optimistic assumption is that it is possible to spend more days on the hill than in the underworld. The field research will be carried out in four East-Central European countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia) and in four countries of Southeastern Europe (Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Serbia and Montenegro). It revolves around three research fields: entrepreneurship, governance and economic knowledge. The respective target groups for interviews are businesspeople, civil servants and economists, that is, important producers of economic culture. In addition to interviews, the project will use focus group discussions, literature/media analysis and case studies to reach its objectives. The project co-ordination will be provided by the Center for Policy Studies at the Central European University, in Budapest. The project will be supported by the Principal Researcher based at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, and assisted by an International Advisory Board. Expected results: The project will result in a set of field reports, case and country studies as well as comparative analyses. It will also provide policy recommendations for future rounds of EU enlargement on how to facilitate a mutually beneficial relationship between existing member states and new entrants. The Consortium expects to find a great variety of lasting cultural hybrids in economic and social behaviour, instead of a simplistic scheme, in which the \"strong Western\" culture devours the \"weak Eastern\" one. Thus, in an unprecedented way, Eastern Enlargement will be studied in conjunction with its neglected counterpart, Western Enlargement. East- West encounters will generate a complex dynamics that includes cultural gaps (tensions, frictions, conflicts), strategies to bridge the gaps, and compromises between cultures. In studying them, DIOSCURI will go beyond the world of the acquis to discover forms of cultural coexistence which are hard to regulate ex ante by introducing new organizational/legal. ",

It is also the biggest challenge facing the environmental community, requiring not only a new approach to policy making but also changes in policies and their implementation. However, the cross-cutting nature of EPI does not easily fit with traditional hierarchical governance based on (nation) state authority, sectoral differentiation, and 'command and control' type instruments. It is therefore not surprising that measures to promote EPI frequently also rely on new modes of governance, such as voluntary, procedural, information, learning and market based instruments. Efforts to achieve and improve EPI are currently being made at local/regional, national, European and global levels of governance, and within the private sector. Measures at different levels may affect each other, thereby improving or weakening EPI and SD. Indeed, the interlinkages between these different modes of governance and layers are emerging as a central challenge in the area of EPI. There is a rapidly growing body of literature analysing and discussing different EPI approaches and measures. The CA aims to structure these findings and to identify avenues for future research by focussing on two main themes: First, is it possible to identify modes of governance which are typically used to promote EPI at particular levels, eg. local/regional, national, EU, global? If so, which governance modes are typically used at which levels? And which are most effective or show most promise? Second, how do EPI measures at the different levels affect each other and how could governance be improved to increase synergies and minimise negative interaction effects across the levels? Assembling and discussing findings which are relevant for these themes should ultimately facilitate progress in improving the implementation of EPI in the EU multi-level governance system. ",

The common framework includes integrating activities (conferences, workshops, activities in plenum and teams), common research (EU-25 Watch, WEB-CONSENT), teaching activities (traditional courses, virtual study units on EU deepening and widening, PhD Centre of Excellence and internships for young researchers) and dissemination activities (public events and common publications). The results of the integrating activities flow into common databases such as the E-Library, a multilingual glossary on EU deepening and widening, bibliographies and core curricula, which are all be made available on the WEB-CONSENT (available from 11/2005 onwards). It also offers yardsticks for observing the progress made by the whole project. The open character of the network, which aims at being a \"network of networks\", together with a full integration of young researchers into the network, respect of gender equality and concern for sustainability, are the core principles of EU-CONSENT. Its management is based upon a consolidated structure, following a decentralised approach. As an academic and policy-oriented network EU-CONSENT is closely linked to political and administrative decision-makers on EU and national level as well as to civil society. The main objectives of EU CONSENT are, firstly, to develop a comprehensive, sustainable and open\u00bf network of networks' for research and teaching on the interrelationship of EU deepening and widening improving the understanding of key European processes and challenges by creating and developing the instruments as measurable and verifiable deliverables. Secondly, EU CONSENT aims at exploring contrasting sets of expectation. Therefore, EU- CONSENT proposes a common conceptual framework and will elaborate and adapt it during the project's lifetime especially by the 'theory group'. The EU-CONSENT network starts from a set of expectations, which will each take up similar factors but expects different outcomes. Each chain of argument will integrate elements and inputs from positivist, constructivist and normative approaches. ",

Furthermore, the EU sees this new quality of regional interaction and partnership as bringing \"enormous gains to all involved in terms of increased stability, security and well being\". EUDIMENSIONS seeks to understand the implications of these emerging geopolitical contexts for crossborder co-operation and political relationships at the local level. More specifically, we will scrutinise the development of a \"Wider European\" political community as manifested by co- operation initiatives and changing political discourses that relate communities and groups to each other across national and EU borders. EUDIMENSIONS will perform this task by analysing co-operation processes and the multilevel contexts within which they operate. Case studies will focus both on specific communities and crossborder co- operation networks that often transcend local, regional and national levels in order to advance their agendas. In addition, we will also focus on civil society and gender-specific issues, aspects that require greater attention in studies of cross-border co-operation. ",

It explores the effects of European integration on territorially concentrated ethnic minorities and their politics, as well as on their relations with national majorities and the state. We have selected nine cases of minority inhabited regions, five in EU `old\u00bf member states and four in the new member states and accession countries of Central-East and Southeast Europe (CESE). Brief description of the project: The project will examine how EU regional economic policies in EU member states and human rights and minority protection policies in CESE accession states affect patterns of political participation and economic activity of ethnic minorities, as well as their relations with national majorities, political parties and state administration. We shall examine how minorities and majorities in regional-local institutions and development projects view their identification with a national or ethnic community, their rights and obligations as citizens of a state, as well as how they conceptualise `Europe'. We will compare the ways in which EU integration affects the regional mobilisation and political representation of minorities and majorities, as well as national-ethnic identities and conceptions of `Europe' in member states and CESE accession countries. Last but not least we shall identify best practices enhancing the efficiency of regional development funding through co-operation between majority and minority groups, and develop policy suggestions for cultural measures and minority protection policies that could accompany regional development funding and facilitate minority- majority co-operation. Our findings will be disseminated among regional minority and majority actors through discussion groups organised in the regions studied, as well as at the EU level. Our methodologies include quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, ethnographic fieldwork, analysis of official documents and statistics and, of course, literature reviews in both English and national languages. Expected results: We expect to provide a better understanding of regional minority-majority politics, identity (trans)formation and the effect of EU and CoE policies on these. The project will promote best practices of regional cooperation and will produce policy relevant findings with a view to informing future regional development policies in an enlarged European Union.

The objective is to constitute a network of interdisciplinary academic research centres that can pool their competencies to produce and disseminate high quality scholarly research and act as a think-tank (virtual and actual) for the European policy community. Brief description of the project Institutional and political crises in the governance of the world order under conditions of globalisation are strong. They have been exacerbated by the renewed salience of the security agenda since Sept 11, 2001. Thus there is a need for European analysts and practitioners undertaking scholarly and policy oriented research into the theory and practice of global regulation across the economic and security domains to come together in a coordinated and systemic process of dialogue. By challenging fragmentation in European research in this area GARNET aims to fill this role. It will develop a multi-dimensional, multi disciplinary community of researchers and practitioners with expertise in the key areas of global and regional governance focussing on those elements of the regulatory framework-such as trade, finance, security-thai structure the modern world system. Four themes will guide GARNET'S activities: (1 ) the theory and practice of regionalism; (2) the key institutions of the regulatory framework necessary for collective action problem solving at global and regional levels; (3) key policy issues in global governance; notably those concerned with overcoming problems in the governance of trade, finance, security, environment, technology, development, disease and public health, social reproduction and gender inequality; (4) the role of the ED in the advancement of research and policy practice in themes (1)-(3). Unilke the scholarly community in the US for example, Europe speaks with a pluralist voice on issues of governance and regulation. GARNET aspires to harness and consolidate this pluralist vitality on a continent wide scale to build a stronger, more self-consciously European research community on global governance as a precursor to improving scholarly presentation and representation, with all the attendant downstream implications for policy making that such improvements in the communication and interaction of knowledge would. Expected results The network will foster researcher integration through a series of workshops and conferences on the main research themes, mobility packages for research fellows at the junior and senior levels and a biannual PhD School. In addition, the network will produce a series of scholarly outputs, including working papers, journal articles, edited collections and monographs on the issues of global governance and European regionalism, as well as a database on regional integration indicators. Garnet will also contribute to the relevant policy debates through a series of specifically targeted seminars for the policy community and the publication of policy briefs. It will also encourage interaction among policy makers, the private sector, advocacy groups and academics through annual capacity building workshops. ",

To achieve its objective, GEM-CON-BIO will investigate types and modes of governance that are related to biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, identify the critical characteristics and threshold factors that exist the environment of an ecosystem management authority (environmental, social and economic factors), as well as who controls them, and conduct research on a range of thematic and case studies, with particular emphasis on innovative and market-based approaches to govern the use of ecosystems and individual species. Lessons will be drawn from community and private sector experiences, from region-specific practices and conditions and from efforts to link ecosystems in order to achieve a broad management and governance level (regional, national and global). Co-management approaches, currently flourishing all over the world, will be an important focus of discussion. Research will draw conclusions on the strengths, weaknesses and impact the governance structures had in each case, and assess the transferability of best practices to wider contexts. A participatory process through a science-policy interface will lead to the development of a set of policy guidelines applicable at different levels of government and in a variety of biodiversity contexts. Results will be disseminated to those involved in the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies - at the European, national, regional and local level, involving public authorities, legislators and citizens and their organisations.

For this purpose, G-FORS will identify a range of different forms of knowledge and analyse how they may interact in the context of particular governance arrangements to produce \"reflexive knowledge\" and contribute to a more legitimate understanding of sustainability. The project will then empirically test this new model through case studies examining EU policies in the field of air pollution control and environment planning and their implementation at domestic level. These areas have been chosen because they involve different governance modes in a multi-level context that illustrate the positive interactions, and potential tensions between certain governance arrangements, different forms of knowledge and sustainable development. Benchmark indicators will be identified for appraising the effectiveness of current political, economic, administrative and organisational processes and institutional settings to develop economically, socially and environmentally sustainable policies. From the empirical research, the research team will assess how the engagement of a range of actors in new multi-level governance arrangements can be activated to tackle any future threats of democratic deficit, promote participation and sustainable development. In particular, G-FORS will demonstrate the key economic, social and political roles of sub-national actors. G-FORS will help shape the European Research Area by developing links with other projects on similar themes across Europe and developing a systematic dissemination strategy to end-users at all levels of government, whilst adding to our knowledge of the interactions between modes of governance, knowledge and broadened participation.

The EU's 2004 enlargement followed the successful 'export' of this philosophy - and the institutions that make it work - to former communist states in Central and Eastern Europe. The external relations challenge for the EU-25 is to continue spreading its zone of peace, security and prosperity throughout its neighbourhood. Encouraging neighbouring countries to adopt European-style political and economic governance structures will remain a central element in this strategy. The prospect of EU accession proved a powerful 'carrot' for Central and Eastern Europeans during the 1990s - recent events in Ukraine showed that citizens will resist authoritarian rule in the hope of sharing Europe's prosperity and openness. However, membership is not on offer for Mediterranean Partner Countries, and the EU will need to work closely with them to provide the region with concrete gains and convince citizens of the benefits of instituting EU governance norms and practices. The GO-EuroMed project's target is to improve political and economic understanding of institutional processes in the Euro-Mediterranean region, particularly in the key areas of trade, investment and labour. Although these institutions are ostensibly economic, their design and management cannot take place in a political vacuum - indeed, these institutions are deeply intertwined with domestic and international political processes. This project will apply a rational, political economy analysis to the interests and preferences of bargaining parties on both sides of the Mediterranean. It will assess the impact of new challenges on these interactions, and will recommend institutional strategies capable of furthering the Barcelona Process' objectives: promoting peace, security and prosperity in the Mediterranean neighbourhood.

To assess whether European enlargement will exacerbate inequality between, as well as, within regions dependent heavily upon labour-intensive industries To identify instances of successful adjustment of enterprises and regions to the changing global environment. To assess the appropriateness of existing policy initiatives and governance structures, at the European, national and regional level. Brief description of the project: It sets out to investigate the consequences of EU enlargement upon the growing integration of economic activity in a European-wide network of production and distribution in labour-intensive, price competitive industries. It places particular emphasis upon changes in the geography of production, and the expansion of production capabilities to the Eastern and Southeastern frontiers of the EU as a result of an incessant pursuit of cheap and adaptable labour. Europeanisation takes place within a broader context of global economic integration, and a process of industrial restructuring emanating from technological change. The research approach adopted aspires to explore the interconnectedness between the moving frontier of the EU and wider processes of structural transformation. The implications of EU enlargement, in the case of labour intensive industries, go beyond industrial economics issues. These industries invariably employ large numbers of employees, often from relatively disadvantaged and spatially concentrated backgrounds. As a result, the social consequences are often disproportionate to the conventional measures, such as employment or sales turnover. Expected results: Identification of the mosaic of forms and methods of integration in the European and subsequently global network of production and distribution. Exploration of the nature and characteristics of international inter-organisational linkages, and their implications upon enterprise strategy, employment and competitiveness. Enhancement of our understanding of industrial restructuring in labour-intensive industries. Industrial restructuring has often been accompanied with a significant move away from low-skill, low-pay, jobs, towards, high-skill, high-pay employment. We aspire to explore the ability of workers to tap into these new opportunities. Assessment of the static and dynamic effects of the delocalisation phenomenon on prospective EU members. Expected policy outcomes A review of existing policy as well as new policy recommendations at all levels of the governance structure (local, regional, national, EU) on industrial restructuring both at the level of the enterprise and the region. Inform discussion regarding the further expansion of the EU eastwards. The findings may facilitate the decision-making process regarding policy-intervention both for already existing members, new entrants, and those that may remain outside the EU. Contribute in the debate currently underway at all levels of policy-making (from the EU to local government) about the degree and nature of intervention to the process of economic growth. ",

This includes taking proper heed of the challenges to democracy at EU, national and regional/local levels. RECON spells out three different models for democratic reconstitution: (a) democracy can be reconstituted at the national level with a concomitant reframing of the EU as a functional regulatory regime; (b) democracy can be reconstituted through establishing the EU as a federal state based on a collective identity; and (c) democracy can be reconstituted through developing a post-national Union with an explicit cosmopolitan imprint. RECON assesses which approach to democratic reconstitution is most viable - in empirical and normative terms - through analyzing the EU's constitutionalisation process; the institutional complex at the EU, Member State, and regional/local levels; the role and status of gender within the enlarged Europe; the democratic quality and governing capacity of the Union within tax/fiscal and foreign/security policy; and the multilevel configuration of civil society/public sphere. It examines the effects of external transnationalisation on the EU and discerns democratic lessons from comparison with non-European complex multilevel entities. RECON enhances knowledge of the enlargement process: the transition and consolidation of democracy in the new Member States and of the overall challenges posed by globalization to established democracies. RECON identifies strategies through which democracy can be strengthened and participation of citizens increased, and provides a set of concrete policy recommendations in line with these. It suggests measures to rectify institutional and constitutional defects; to combat gendered and social inequality; and to rectify democratic deficits in different policy areas. It enhances the state of the art by developing and testing a theory of deliberative democratic supranationalism. ",

Our project aims to explore and compare models of 'translocal' neighbourhood,focusing on emerging discourses and good practices in three spheres of life in the new Europe: 'Physical \"borderlands\" of the new EU 'Mental border experiences in multicultural EU regions 'Mental and physical border experiences in transnational networks It rests on the assumption that it is impossible to understand the processes which create obstacles to and opportunities for good neighbourhood across state borders, if one does not understand and challenge obstacles created by mental/symbolic divisions wherever they occur. We will explore the dynamics of socio-cultural and physical borders in the newly enlarged European Union, as experienced by people of culturally diverse backgrounds, with a view to strengthen peoples' competence for cultural understanding and exchange.The following objectives form the core: 'To understand the interdependency of 'physical' (geopolitical) and 'mental' borders in the creation and obstruction of good neighbourhood; *To understand the ways in which 'neighbourhood' is experienced by diverse groups of people, to compare what prompts them in different contexts; *To compare visions of, and obstacles to good neighbourhood building by exploring people's self-perception, in- grouping and out grouping in the three contexts; \"To identify and evaluate through user response existing policies, and official/civil society activities for good neighbourhood-building; To compare user response to 'top-down' measures with the success of self- determined,'bottom-up' activities; \"To strenghten or put into practice innovative sustainable initiatives for good neighbourhoods through workshops and cultural events.

It will focus specifically on the range of civic sites now emerging on the web. These sites are created by many different organisations, interest groups and individuals; and they range from small-scale, local initiatives to national and international projects. Potentially, they constitute a powerful form of non formal learning, affecting the development of social capital, and political, social and economic participation. The research will focus on three key dimensions of this phenomenon: - the production of such sites, including the motivations, working practices and economic models of the producers - the nature and characteristics of the sites, in terms of their content and formal features (design, mode of address, structure), and the extent to which they invite active participation among their users - the uses and interpretations made of such sites by different social groups of young people, and the relationship between this online activity and their civic participation 'offline'. The project will seek to assess how these developments vary across the different political cultures of seven European member states; and their implications for intergenerational relations, both at a 'macro' level and at the 'micro' level of family relationships. The research will use quantitative and qualitative methods; and it will seek to identify instances of `good practice' that can inform practitioners and policy-makers in relevant fields. ",

It also aims to contribute to the public debate on the future of European governance. Its objectives are reflected in the following 3 tasks: Task 1: to provide information and easy access to accumulated knowledge (stock-taking) Task 2: to integrate research on the conditions and instruments of efficiency and democracy in a multilevel system Task 3: to disseminate state of the art knowledge and to communicate with the wider world of academia, policy makers and other possible users of this research. Brief description of the project: The Network of Excellence CONNEX is dedicated to the analysis of efficient and democratic multilevel governance in Europe and will have a duration of four years. Multilevel governance stands for the high interdependence of political responsibilities executed at regional, national and European level. Efficiency and democratic accountability is needed because it is the very foundation of legitimate governance. 43 partner institutions from 23 European countries and more than 170 scholars cooperate within the network. The consortium is coordinated by the MZES, a research centre at the University of Mannheim, Germany. Expected results: The network's rationale is to provide better opportunities for cooperation and integration of research and the dissemination of its results. CONNEX will reach out to nodes of excellence across Europe, mobilise and pool resources. This way it seeks to advance European leadership in academic research on efficient and democratic multilevel governance and provide solid answers to the crucial questions concerning the political future of Europe. By concentrating on open questions research results it will substantiate or refute many of the (often implicit) suppositions in the public debate on European governance, The concentration of research on the democratic dimension of multilevel governance will grind down the 'benign' neglect of the EU reform initiatives. The communication with users at an early stage of research, i.e. when framing research questions is deemed to make research more responsive to the special needs of users. ",

Delivery of a \"Common Frame of Reference\" The Network will deliver a proposal for the \"Common Frame of Reference\" for European contract law as described in the Commission's Action Plan (COM [2003] 68 final). The proposal will be presented in the form of principles (\"Common Principles of European Contract Law\" CoPECL), including definitions, general concepts and legal rules. They will be supplemented by comments, comparative notes and by evaluative analysis. The CoPECL will be published in as many languages as possible. At the same time, a database will facilitate the access to the relevant legal sources. The researchers will take into account, on the one hand, national laws, including case-law of national courts and established contractual practice. On the other hand, they will consider the existing EC acquis and relevant international instruments. During the whole process of research, practitioners will be involved in order to ensure that the results meet their needs. 2. Overcoming Research Fragmentation in the European Research Area The European research landscape is currently fragmented into different international groups which carry out their research independently. The Network will overcome this fragmentation by integrating these groups in order to pursue the common objective of developing the CoPECL as a proposal for a Common Frame of Reference. 3. Guidance to Legislators, Legal Practice and Academics The CoPECL will benefit legislators, legal practitioners and academics. They will especially smooth the planned revision of the acquis communautaire and will secure more coherency of future EC legislation. Furthermore the CoPECL may inspire further reflection on an optional new Community instrument. 4. Durable Research Integration and Dissemination of Knowledge The Network will not only lead to a functional co- operation of leading European research groups; it will furthermore create the framework for continuing and durable research. Brief description of the project: The Joint Network on European Private Law was founded as a 'Network of Excellence' under 6 FP in May 2005 and comprises more than 150 researchers operating in all EU Member States. The researchers form the following groups: - The Study Group on a European Civil Code (contact: Prof. Christian von Bar, cvbar@uos.de, www.sgecc.net) - The Research Group on the Existing EC Private Law, or 'Acquis Group' (contact: Prof. G.M.

However, IA may also have undesirable effects on the regulatory process, for example by enabling early lobbying activities, by delaying decisions, or by legitimising decisions that were not open to a public debate. One of the key challenges of IA is that it combines a number of different functions - analysis, transparency, participation, and integration - between which there may be tensions. Furthermore, IA encounters particular methodological challenges where new approaches to regulation are concerned. In this context, EVIA evaluates the use of IA procedures. It will be analysed if IA is an effective and efficient approach to committing regulatory units to generic objectives such as the improvement of competitiveness, the integration of environmental concerns or the consideration of social aspects. This includes the analysis of the question of the effect of IA procedures on actual policy decisions. The re-search will explore the institutional factors of successful IA, and which tools and methods have been proven to be useful. To determine the conditions for successful IA the project will 1) develop a framework to assess the quality of IAs; 2) study different approaches to IA in different countries regarding their institutional, procedural and substantial requirements and the use of tools and methods on different types of regula-tions; and 3) conduct a survey on a large number of IAs for an empirical validation of the case study results. As a result, good practices will be identified with regard to institutional procedures (e.g. help desks, manuals, mechanisms of quality control) and to the use of methods and tools for IA in different institu-tional settings. It will be assessed which approaches are best suited for different types of regulations. ",

The aim of this Integrated Project is to produce a deeper conceptual, empirical and normative understanding of all aspects of governance within and beyond Europe, giving special attention to the emergence, execution, evaluation and evolution of new and innovative modes of governance. By new modes of governance we mean the range of innovations and transformations that are occurring in the instruments, methods, and systems of governance in contemporary polities and economies, especially within the European Union (EU) and its member states. Brief description of the project: 2. The precise scientific objectives of NEWGOV will be pursued within four different clusters, each of which contains a set of inter-linked projects. The four clusters are dedicated, respectively, to emergence, evolution and evaluation, delegation, hierarchy and accountability, effectiveness, capacity and legitimacy, and learning, experimental governance, and reform. Within these clusters there is a total of 24 projects which cover topics such as capacity building and the OMC and arguing and persuasion in EU governance in cluster #1, regulatory agencies and network governance, governance and the EU securities sector and European public services regulation in cluster #2, new forms of governance and eastern enlargement, the domestic impact of European law and new modes of governance in relations with non-member states in cluster #3, and varieties of capitalism and economic governance in CE Europe, new corporate governance regimes and distributive politics, learning and reform in cluster #4. The clusters and the projects are accompanied by two transversal task forces, one on legal issues', the other on issues of legitimacy and democracy' which will make inputs across the Integrated Project. Joint activities across the consortium as a whole include workshops, conferences, the mutual exchange and cross-fertilisation of ideas, information, and data, and through research training conducted in two summer schools. Our pan-European research consortium engages political scientists, economists, lawyers, sociologists, and practitioners to collect data on and to map and analyze innovations and transformations in the instruments, modes, and systems of governance operating at the multiple levels and arenas of the still evolving and enlarging European polity and economy. Of particular interest are the ways in which these innovative mechanisms and practices relate to each other (both horizontally and vertically); how they relate to old methods' of governance; and what their implications are both for the effectiveness and efficiency of policy making, as well as the normative and democratic nature (accountability, participation and citizenship and thus legitimacy) of the EU. In terms of instruments and modes of governance, we investigate new forms of multi-level partnership, deliberation and networks, as well as innovations in systems of socio-economic governance, producing new knowledge on how they have developed in different policy sectors; how their implementation and use has differed across the older and more recent Member States; and how they are articulated at the local, regional, national, European, and global levels. Expected results: 3. The NEWGOV consortium contributes to the creation of a European Research Area in the social sciences and humanities by shaping a new European-level research agenda; by integrating previously dispersed researchers within a coherent, pan-European whole; and by creating novel training activities and networks between researchers and policy practitioners.

The proposal is based on the assumption that the impact of liberalisation and privatisation of public services depends, first, on the form of liberalisation and privatisation and the mode of market regulation and, second, on the strategies companies pursue in their reaction to the opportunities and challenges involved. Company strategies and processes of change, in turn, are shaped by the institutional context of the national employment model. While the various forms of liberalisation and privatisation have attracted great scientific attention, business strategies, restructuring, work organisation and human resource policies so far have remained outside the focus of the research on liberalisation and privatisation. Yet, the impact on productivity, employment and the quality of public services depends on the answers companies find for new opportunities and challenges as well as on organisational restructuring, use of technology, labour relations and work design. PIQUE will study the form of regulation of liberalisation and privatisation in six countries and four sectors. It will explore changes in work, employment and labour relations as well as the productivity and quality of service provision. Special attention will be paid to the company level and the question of how liberalisation and privatisation impact on company management and organisation and on the provision of high-quality services at affordable prices. PIQUE project phases include: describing national modes of liberalisation and privatisation; assessing the impact on employment, labour relations and productivity through secondary analysis; understanding restructuring processes and the management of change through company case studies; assessing quality and accessibility by way of a quantitative users\u00bf survey; integrating results, developing policy recommendations and disseminating research findings.

Sub-objectives of the CA are: - to contribute to the advancement of knowledge about the configuration of private and public services most conducive to sustainable development of the European societies, - to organise interdisciplinary communication between different scientific centres, social groups and political actors, and - to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the role of the public sector in the development of the ESM. These objectives will be pursued in three phases with 10 work packages. In phase 1 a state of the art stocktaking of the literature on the history and theory of liberalisation and privatisation and the European Social Model takes place. In phase 2 interdisciplinary analyses of the impact of liberalisation and privatisation on economic performance, social cohesion and political structures will be undertaken. In phase 3 conclusions from the results of the previous work will be drawn and policy proposals will be formulated. Participants of the CA come from different disciplines and from countries with different social and political traditions. They will throughout the duration of the CA organise discussions with external experts from the scientific community and from political actors and other stakeholder groups. ",

Project objectives are: Gaining theoretical and empirical insights into CSR by assessing the impacts of CSR instruments in different economic sectors and with regard to different sustainability-relevant policy fields. Thus, a structural component to the predominantly actor-oriented CSR research is added. Developing A framework for Impact Assessment and identifying success factors of CSR-action. Analysing CSR in A context of multi-level and multi-dimensional governance. Contributing to the creation of A European Research Area in the social sciences and humanities. Deducting policy recommendations from the insights gained, thus broadening the scientific basis for CSR related policy-making in the EU. Promoting sustainable development and competitiveness of the EU by supporting environmental policy integration, furthering a more entrepreneurial climate, sharpening governance capabilities and advancing the capacities for future CSR activities in Europe. Brief description of the project: Seven European research institutions analyse existing CSR activities of enterprises in four different economic sectors: the oil industry, the banking sector as well as the fisheries and fish processing industries. Different CSR instruments are included in the research design. By developing and then applying a \u00bfCSR Impact Assessment\u00bf tool, the team will seek to separate the rhetoric from the real impacts of CSR. The Impact Assessment takes into consideration both the micro- level of companies and the macro-level of economic and socio-political effects. On the socio-political level the team strives to evaluate the contribution of CSR to the achievement of the EU's policy goals in four areas of sustainable development - environmental protection (climate and chemicals policies), resource management, gender equality and the fight against bribery. Questionnaires form the basis of the three sector surveys that cover some 20 multinational companies each. In a further step, in-depth case studies in selected companies serve to filter out success factors that deliver particularly successful cases of CSR implementation. Through interviews, driving forces within the corporations and in their economic and political environment will be identified. With a complementary SME-study the project provides insights into the performance of European small and medium- sized companies (SME) in the field of environmental CSR, both in new and old EU Member States. Moreover, the project tackles political and public policy dimensions of CSR. Against the backdrop of EU enlargement, the scientist analyse the relevance of CSR activities to the integration of the new Member States into the EU. They also compare the contribution of CSR to sustainable development with the problem-solving capacity of public policy instruments. Expected results: The team will shed light on the impacts of CSR in Europe and especially on structural differences in CSR performance according to company size, sector, and issue area. Conclusions will be drawn with respect to the efficacy of CSR and the role it could play in public policies. Finally, policy recommendations for companies, national governments and the EU will be formulated, promoting elements of an European approach to CSR. Results shall among others be disseminated by means of a conference and a book publication. By gaining interdisciplinary insights and pushing method development among researchers from all over Europe, the project contributes to the European Research Area. ",

It seeks to identify these new mechanisms, to evaluate them and to make institutional proposals for an improved form of governance. The approach means to highlight two categories of insufficiency: insufficiency in the governance devices and insufficiency in the theoretical models currently available to address the former. It aims therefore to synthesize the achievements of the current interdisciplinary research and set up an interaction not only between the most advanced questions of Economics, Law, Political Science, but also between those questions and the Theory of Action related to the public interest governance. Beyond that, it will push forward the research on collective action and seek to build the theoretical tools required to address the remaining insufficiencies, upon the hypothesis that such improvements depend on the better construction of the preconditions of the collective learning process, which conditions the efficiency of any collective action. It proposes to ground its empirical work in five material fields: Services of General Interest, Global Public Services and Common Goods, Institutional Frames for Markets, Corporate Governance, and Fundamental Rights Governance. These laboratories of new forms of governance in the public interest have been chosen because a wide perspective must be adopted to define the preconditions of public interest, especially in the provision of public services. They constitute the five thematic sub-networks of the project. Indeed, this question can only be approached adequately by also investigating the institutional frames required for an efficient regulation of competitive activities, as the borders between the sectors of competitive activities and traditional public services become still more indistinct; any answer to this question must also take into account the international context in which the EU has to regulate economic activities and in particular the services of general economic interest; it must build on the evolutions of corporate governance as it is increasingly being recognized that, in relation to the enterprises which supply services of general interest, how companies are owned and controlled has a vital impact on the way they respond to regulatory interventions; and, finally, it must seek inspiration from the common values on which the Union is built - indeed, fundamental rights may have a decisive role in the future in contributing to social and territorial cohesion in the Union. A Cross-thematic Seminar will be set up to ensure an integrated and consistent reflection on common theoretical questions considered by each sub-network in their specific research. The 'Theory of the Norm' Unit included in the project will seek to link the current perspectives on governance theory to the more epistemological reflections originating in the Theory of Action and the Theory of the Norm. It will be closely connected to the Cross-thematic Seminar. The major outcomes of our research will be institutional proposals in each of the thematic fields studied in the project and on a more general level a 'Public Interest Assessment' protocol. Such a protocol would favour a better evaluation of the organisation of services of general interest. ",

There are four major objectives : 1. The first objective is to study two overarching questions. - What do companies understand as their responsibilities towards society, and how does that differ from the actual expectations from social actors - How can companies cope with both rising societal demands on their activities and with a consequently wider gap between what they are prepared to contribute and what society expects from them ? 2. Understand how the answers to these questions vary across cultural, legal, industry and organizational contexts. 3. Identify and quantify the factors that contribute to explain why certain companies understand their stakeholders' expectations better than others. 4. Test the effectiveness of different types of training approaches on the development of social consciousness in managers Brief description of the project: The research program proposed by the RESPONSE consortium aims to study the nature of societal demands on business organizations\u00bf decisions and actions from a business strategy perspective. The consortium is planning to tackle the research objectives from two distinct levels of analysis; the business organization and the individual manager. In the former perspective, the research will leverage on recent developments in organizational sociology, evolutionary economics and business strategy in order to focus on how the firm perceives and manages the different types of societal demands coming from a diverse group of actors (government and local authorities, social pressure groups, social rating agencies, employees and unions, supply chain partners, and so on). At the individual level of analysis, it will rely on recent advancements in cognitive and social psychology. The RESPONSE project will leverage on two distinct methodologies to realize its research objectives. The first three objectives will be researched through an in- depth matched case comparison design, including structured interviews and a web-based survey. Objective 4 consists of an experimental design. In addition to leveraging on cutting edge knowledge from diverse areas of social science, the research objectives and methodology of the consortium have been designed to pursue academic contributions not only to the debate on corporate social responsibility, but also to at least some of the disciplines the program is building on. This includes fields like: business strategy, evolutionary economics, organizational sociology (institutional theory in particular), business ethics and organizational behaviour. At the same time, the RESPONSE consortium is conscious of the significant impact that the expected results might have for managerial practice, and has designed a series of initiatives to diffuse the insights derived from the academic work to all the relevant audiences. Expected results: The RESPONSE project will provide added value for companies, academics and policy makers. For companies, it aims to provide conceptual clarity on the content of the CSR notion, to identify factors distinguishing companies that can achieve both social impact and financial performance, to contextualise company efforts in this sense and to illustrate how companies can go about enacting CSR in their own environments. For academics, by coordinating their research efforts, they will be given access to substantial input to their research in terms of the theoretical frameworks developed, the methodological strategies designed, and the insights obtained from the analysis of data. By channelling resources at the European level to focus on this research area, academic institutions will be able to benefit from each others\u00bf particular expertise, and create maximised opportunities for dissemination research findings. For policy makers, the added value will come from a solid foundation of research findings which will allow them to make informed decisions on important economic, sustainability and social policy issues as on the European as well as on the national level. One of the key outcomes of the project will be the feeding of important findings and resources from the 5th research area `Articulation of areas of responsibility and new forms of governance'. A particular focus of the RESPONSE consortium will be on the current developments at the ISO standard. The involvement of IISD (International Institute for Sustainable Development) will allow for a maximum of synergies between the findings in the RESPONSE project and the ISO process. ",

The privatisation record to date is impressive, both in developed and developing economies. Despite the relevance of the process and the extensive research recently carried out, several aspects of privatisation such as its determinants, methods, and economic and social implications warrant a systematic analysis and research efforts. Given the relevance of privatisation policy in the European context and in the markets for the services of general interest (SGI), it is imperative to analyse the record of privatisation and understand the causes behind failures in order to improve the process in the future. The project's main objectives are: - To study the political and institutional incentives and constraints affecting privatisation - To analyse the interactions between private and public ownership and control of firms - To evaluate the welfare effect of privatisation policies on consumers, taxpayers and shareholders - To identify the most appropriate policies to make privatisation deliver the most desirable outcomes. To address these objectives, the Project will use the tools of political economy and welfare analysis, starting from the premises that privatisation is a political decision taken by governments at national/sub-national level and it has important consequences on the welfare of several stakeholders in the economy (consumers, taxpayers, employees, and shareholders). The welfare effects of privatisation as perceived by different social groups are key element to establish the political sustainability of reform programmes, or the long-term reversal to public provision. The Project will adopt a multidisciplinary approach, mobilising researchers from economics, finance, political science, and judicial disciplines working in five universities, three research institutions, and one multi-lateral organisation of six European countries, including a new accession country.

Violence against women is recognized as a serious challenge to democracy and social cohesion; this needs to be extended to the victimisation of men, children, elders or socially vulnerable groups. The field of interpersonal violence typifies fragmentation in addressing human rights violations. Each type of violation has been seen as a distinct concern; theoretical and practical links between the different aspects of violence have been neglected. CAHRV aims to account for and overcome fragmentation in research, policy and practice, linking and building on networks for women, children and men. It will: - integrate parallel research discourses on violence - unify a theoretical and empirical basis for policy - survey a wide territory with a case study approach - structure co-operation through sub-networks - identify further sites of excellence. In a practical perspective, CAHRV aims to: - build a research foundation for recognizing good practice - make standards for services and interventions available on a European level - contribute to policy-related data collection: - improve dissemination and co-operation with NGO's, agencies and governments Brief description of the project: CAHRV will integrate research across gender and generational divisions, connecting these with aspects of citizenship and governance. There are four sub-networks: - identifying and profiling victimisation, - the roots of interpersonal violence: gendered practices, social exclusion and violation, - addressing gender-based human rights violations, - protective environmental factors securing human rights. Each sub-network has specific work packages that contribute to the action as a whole, using its specific topical focus as the example or demonstration case. CAHRV also examines when policies and interventions are effective and what context variables need to be considered for transfer. Cross-cutting activities such as annual conferences and high- level expert groups and an interactive web-based communication system ensure a continuing dialogue between the sub-networks. Expected results: CAHRV works to develop sustainable structures for cooperation and dialogue. Results will include - An overview of European research on prevalence, health and human rights impact, a design for comparative re- analysis of data, and indicators for monitoring; - A data base and a shared methodological framework for European level research on the roots of violent behaviour; - Research synopses on the justice system as an arena for the protection of human rights, and on evaluation of interventions and measures and their potential for transfer; - An interdisciplinary research map on the web of protective factors in work, families and social networks. Transnational partnerships, policy papers, conferences and publications will articulate a distinctively European voice in the global discussion of human rights in everyday life. ",

It will create an OBSERVATORY charged with the analysis and evaluation of the changing relationship between sustainable security, stability and liberty in an enlarging EU, which upholds the values of democracy. Description of the project: Contemporary discussions on the merging between internal and external security and the relationship between liberty and security in Europe are seriously constrained by the degree to which the concepts, historical practices and institutions of liberty and security have been examined independently. This analytical division of labour expresses the practical and institutional division of labour encouraged by the structures of the modern international system and its distinction between foreign and domestic policies. This project is informed by an appreciation of the historical circumstances under which this distinction became a crucial defining feature of political life in the modern world of sovereign states, and of its consequences for the forms of liberal democratic politics that have emerged in Europe over the past few centuries. More significantly, it is also informed by an analysis of a broad range of structural changes on a global scale that now pose many profound challenges to this defining feature of modern European politics. Conversely, and more crucially for this project, the familiar world of secured communities living within well-defined territories and sustaining all the celebrated liberties of civil society is now seriously in tension with a profound restructuring of political identities and practices of securitization. These challenges are felt most immediately as matters of urgent public policy, and there is scarcely any public institution in Europe that is not affected by them in some way. More disconcertingly, they also unsettle the most basic grounds on which we make judgments about urgent public policy. They especially lead to concerns that our responses to new forms of insecurity, to claims about global terror, new forms of warfare, and new forms of violence more generally, frequently provoke responses that only serve to undermine the liberal and democratic character of those societies that need to respond to these new terrors, wars and forms of violence. Now Europeanisation, globalization and US policy after 11 September create a move towards de-territorializaion and securitization beyond borders with a specific focus on some minorities. This difference, we believe, demands that future research is grounded in recognition of the extent to which prevailing concepts of liberty and security, and the intellectual and policy communities that have thrived on assumptions about their independence, are part of the problem that needs to be addressed. This project, consists of 17 Workpackages , bringing together 21 partner institutes and the work will be carried out in consecutive 5 phases. Expected results: This project, through the employment of the Observatory is expected to bring benefits in four areas. It will: - analyze developing patterns of exceptionalism at the boundary between practices of liberty and practices of security in European public life. This will produce a database from which more sustainable research can proceed into core public policy dilemmas based on intellectually rigorous scientific research of an applied nature - benefits at conceptual, substantial and policy-relevant levels - enable the development of an innovative interdisciplinary network of scholars who have been influential in placing questions about the changing relationship between liberty and security on both intellectual and policy agendas not only in Europe but also in North America and elsewhere. - generate a broad array of research resources (databases, website, expertise, observatory, reports, books, classified bibliography, workshops, etc) in the general areas of sociology, law, criminology, security, civil society, religion, citizenship and human rights. - will enhance an emerging cross-cultural and cross-national dialogue about fundamental questions concerning the way new relations between the norms of civil society and the exceptionalisms generated by a broad range of contemporary risks and dangers are rescripting the possibilities of a liberal democratic politics in many different settings.

The urgency of such a project is reflected in the fact that corruption holds the potential to retard seriously the process of the Community's enlargement and integration, even to the extent of threatening the very core of its concept of social order. The prevention policies that have been developed by the EU and imple-mented so far within individual member countries have in general been characterised by legislative, administrative and police force measures. These are based on a definition of corruption prevention developed in political and administrative institutions that, for its implementation, rely on a 'top-down' procedure. The project purports to conduct not an inquiry into the nature of corruption 'as such', but rather into the perceptions of corruption held by political and administrative decision-makers in specific regions and cultures, those held by actors representing various institutions and authorities, and above all by the citizens and the media in European societies. The project proceeds from the as-sumption that the considerably varying perceptions of corruption, determined as they are by 'cul-tural dispositions', have significant influence on a country's respective awareness of the problem and thereby on the success of any preventative measures. For this reason, the project investigates the 'fit' between 'institutionalised' prevention policies and how these are perceived in 'daily practice', as well as how EU candidate countries and EU member countries as a result handle the issue of corruption. In a final step, we intend to make specific recommendations for readjusting this 'fit' and to investigate which role the media play within this process in each individual country. ",

Most of these participants have a previous experience in European cooperation through their participation in 3 existing networks (GERN, IAHCCJ, EFUS) . On the whole, little is known about the variety of situations, policies and scholarly analyses within the European Union. Each State generally tends to confine itself to mostly single/national references, and the Commission itself seems to have some difficulty in acknowledging the variety of analyses across the European scene. Researchers themselves find it difficult to get an overview of the diversity of national scientific productions, in spite of efforts by the various scientific networks. However it is this diversity itself makes the European Union a natural laboratory for comparative work, which may be used to produce added value in scholarship. The project provides an opportunity for researchers, academics and decision-makers to go beyond previous cooperation and unite their resources to produce a European comparative assessment of the issues listed in the call : factors of deviant behaviors ; processes of criminalisation; perceptions of crime; links between illegal or socially deviant behaviour and organised crime; and public policies of prevention. A workpackage will be devoted specifically to assessing existing methods and tools for the measurement of crime and fear of crime and providing all stakeholders with good practice guidelines. An inaugural conference will aim at establishing the state of the art on a European scale, as a point of departure for the thematic workpackages. It will also identify and discuss methodological difficulties of comparative research. A concluding conference will present the European added-value accrued by the Coordination Action over its 3 years and discuss future projects. ",

In response to Court judgments national authorities may seek to evade or contain compliance, but they may also undertake broader reforms to pre-empt recurring infringements of human rights provisions.

We shall explore the hypothesis that patterns of state compliance and national implementation of Court judgments centrally depend on and are mediated by domestic processes of societal mobilization, public support and elite learning. We specifically focus on the Court\u00bfs growing jurisprudence pertaining to the civil rights of individuals and communities, and their participation in the public sphere in a democratic setting. Such case law has primarily grown out of specific categories of cases brought to the European Court of Human Rights, in which individuals claim a violation of their right to privacy and family life, religious freedom and conscience, freedom of expression, assembly and association, and discriminatory treatment. In the course of our research, we shall identify best practices concerning the establishment or improvement of national- and EU-level mechanisms for addressing human rights claims and resolving disputes between individual rights and State interests.

Only with the Stability Pact and the Stabilisation and Association Process did the EU develop a coherent strategy to provide for security, economic reconstruction, political stability and rule of law. Nevertheless, the EU is still faced with unresolved problems such as the 'final status' of Kosovo, the possible break-up of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and the question, how to deal with the problem of accomodating ethnic and territorial claims in order to prevent spill-over effects in forms of new conflicts and refugees in the region itself and into the EU. Moreover, a coherent EU-policy of the new neighbourhood (Caucasus, Ukraine, Russia) face the same problem how to accomodate ethnic and cultural diversity in order to prevent serious human rights violations in existing and possible future conflicts. The overall objective of the project is thus to analyse which status human and minority rights did and do have in all phases of ethnic conflicts, and, finally, in the phase of re-construction and reconciliation. As a parallel process the development of the EU foreign policy and its shift from re-active crisis management to regional stabilisation and association with the prospect of full EU-membership will be analysed. In this regard the role of human and minority rights for the external relations of the EU will be covered. Taking the Western Balkans as a case study, the aim is to develop a specific European concept of 'Unity in Diversity' by providing conceptual frameworks and legal instruments which are balancing individual human rights and minority related group rights for the underlying problem how to accomodate ethnic and cultural diversity in the necessary process of a re-construction of functioning states and civil and multi- ethnic societies.

Thematic goals: Our research agenda will develop along the lines of the following four specific objectives: - Socio-economic polarization: concepts and measures - Understanding conflict - Promoting agreements in the shadow of conflict - Channeling conflicts in a democracy Methodological goals: This project wishes to achieve significant advances in three fronts: - Establishing effective bridges between the approaches that have been independently developed in the different social sciences. - Providing an integral analytical framework that permits the understanding of the different phases of conflict: early warnings, occurrence of conflict, negotiation of an agreement, and post-conflict institution design. - Integrating theory and evidence, models and facts Strategic goals: We aim at - helping the political community to identify potential conflicts and to provide policymakers with up-to-date data and forecasts - promoting a scientific debate that will launch conflict as one of the central research concerns in the areas of the Social Sciences where it is still not. Brief Description of the project : The purpose of this multi-disciplinary research project is to promote and coordinate research on the conceptualization, modelling and measurement of polarization and conflict and the links between the two. We aim at contributing to identify the main forces leading to conflict, to provide tools and indicators for early warning, to understand the role of alternative forms of third party intervention such as mediation or arbitration in the reaching of an agreement, and to the design of post-conflict, viable agreements, including the system of political representation. In order to achieve this task, we will integrate the different approaches that have independently been developed in the different social sciences and will combine models with factual evidence. We expect the outcome be a multidisciplinary understanding of conflict in which the analytical models will be tested against facts. Expected results: - Scientific: 56 publications in top field journals; 2 edited journal issues; 1 collective book - Educational: 9 theses supervised; Integration of 6 post-docs into the research teams; 3 multidisciplinary summer schools - Dissemination: Webpage on polarization and conflict; 3 open congresses; 3 non-technical presentations - Policy relevance: strengthen the links with administrations and institutions involved in security and peace keeping; Have policy-makers to participate in the meetings and congresses; Produce non-technical summaries of our research; Facilitate the access and use of the wealth of factual information contained in the existing databases, providing a comprehensive inventory; Make the policy implications of our research operational ",

PEACE-COM will study fourteen community conflicts drawn from the range of possible types (Northern Ireland; The Basque Country; Cyprus; The Walloon - Flemish conflict in Belgium; The Central European Roma conflict in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic; The Slovene autochtonous minority in Austria; South Tyrol; The Russian Minority in Estonia; Corsica; Kosovo; Sandzak and Vojvodina in former Yugoslavia), and will assess the effects of Europeanisation on these conflicts. This project will also devise a set of empirical indicators to observe and monitor the development of these community conflicts. Brief description of the project: This project is divided in 8 work packages : WP1 will review the history of community conflicts in Europe and investigate the effects of European integration on existing conflicts. It will also set up a typology of community conflicts in Europe; WP2 will provide methods and tools for comparative analysis; WP3 will study the main actors of each conflict, and the institutions that are central to their development; WP4 will study the actions undertaken by the groups in conflict. This WP will distinguish general types of action and link these to the characteristics of each conflict; WP5 will focus on policies or initiatives set up to handle these conflicts. This WP will analyse the conditions of success or failure of these policies. It will also identify \"holes\" in accommodation policies, leaving room for additional measures; WP6 will elaborate measurable indicators for monitoring community conflicts, and test their transferability to other conflicts. The aim of this WP is therefore twofold: to offer a forecasting and policy function, and to transform the data gathered in the previous work packages into indicators; WP7 will ensure that the knowledge and expertise gained through the project is transferred to the political level as well as to the wider academic community for further exploitation; WP0 will deal with all aspects relating to the project's management, its objective being to ensure the timely completion of the project and the delivery of high quality research. Expected results: - To promote a better and more comprehensive understanding of conflicts and their historical dynamics in relation to the whole range of social processes with which they interact, by using a multi-disciplinary approach : political, economical, social, but also religious, cultural and symbolic; - To refine the typology of community conflicts, and drawing from it conclusions in terms both of social science and policy; - To assess the importance of factors such as the involvement and role of women and children, and of international and non-governmental organisations, in these conflicts; - To analyse the policies or initiatives set up to handle these conflicts, at the local, national and international levels, to assess their effectiveness and to point at holes or lacks which should be filled; - To explore the ways the European Union could help resolve these conflicts, and to study the effects of the current policies of the European Union on these conflicts.

Central to this proposed research is the recognition of non-governmental actors as key players in ethno-political conflicts, both as violator and as guarantor of human rights. In the recent ethno-political conflicts, characterised by high intensity in intra-border ethnic tensions and strong international appeal to human rights protection, civil society actors have in fact played an increasingly crucial role. In order to identify the different typologies of civil society action, four case studies will be analysed: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cyprus, Turkey\u00bfs Kurdish question, and Israel-Palestine. Through the comparative examination of these cases, policy guidelines will be formulated for the implementation in both governmental and non-governmental humanitarian intervention. By improving the understanding of the complex relationships underpinning the human rights, civil society and conflict nexus, this project thus aims to contribute toward the strengthening of civil society action (both independent and in co-ordination with EU actors) in the prevention of human rights violations.

First, we will analyze the nature and significance of the evolving threat of transnational terrorism to the European Union and its individual Member States. Based on this, we will examine the appropriateness and effectiveness of response options aimed at dealing with these threats and their impacts. Project Description: Considering the ongoing integration of Europe, a Union-level strategy towards transnational terrorism is imperative. In support of the formulation of such a strategy, this project will study the conceptual nature of the problems and the possible measures flowing from its findings. This project will conduct of a structured survey of the response options to transnational terrorism and their respective assumptions. Both policy-areas specifically dealing with terrorism as well as affected policy-fields are taken into account. The project is unique in that it integrates diverse aspects of the issue into one comprehensive and multidisciplinary project. The main added value of the project will lie in the benchmarking of approaches and policy-options in use in the various Member States. Combined with the project's conceptual underpinnings, it will yield insights into the suitability and effectiveness of various approaches and measures from national and European perspectives, the relevant ethical issues, and cost-benefit considerations. Expected results - an overview of the varying conceptual views on terrorism and its diverging role in the European security discourse, and to advice on how to deal with these divergences; - a better insight into the societal and economic costs of (counter-) terrorism; - an analysis and benchmark of the numerous policies set up across Europe; - the detection of gaps in the policy where counter-terrorism measures are inadequate; - a tool to track changes in policy and societal discourse on terrorism.

Four main goals can be stressed: 1. ) Research of journalistic working procedures and routines in the field of European journalism; 2. ) Analysis of national journalism cultures determining these mechanisms to re-think and re-define professional standards from a comparative European perspective; 3. ) Investigation of EU communication and information policies; 4. ) Development of alternative information and communication platforms as well as practical applications for European journalism. Description of the project: The main research question of the project is how the mass media produce EU coverage in the context of diverse journalistic cultures and professional standards in Europe and which role the information strategies of the EU institutions play in this respect. It therefore focuses on actors (media institutions on European, national, regional and local levels as well as journalists, correspondents and editors etc.; and the communication units and press services of the EU institutions, particularly DG Press) and mechanisms (EU news management as well as journalistic working procedures and routines). The project is based on two levels: First, it examines the practical conditions that determine if a European issue is set on the news agenda or not. Secondly, it deals with the normative approach that only the access to EU information and its plurality can provide a basis for democracy and European public sphere(s) as well as in a further step a breeding ground for active civic participation, European citizenship, identity and public governance. The project will define a set of indicators preventing and fostering the constitution of European public sphere(s). By means of two field studies (one within the national framework and one on the European level) it will collect comparative empirical data regarding EU journalism(s) and news management. It will closely work together with other research institutions in the field of European public sphere(s) as well as with professional organisations and practitioners. Expected results: 1.) Firsthand insight into the reality of daily news production and its management on a European and comparative scale; 2.) Insight into differences and coherences of different national professional cultures of news journalism within Europe; 3.) Analyses of the daily linkage between news media and questions of European identity on pertaining levels of politics; 4.) Empirical groundwork concerning questions of European public sphere(s) and its/their establishment through understanding processes of its constitution; 5.) Practical guidelines for journalists, training institutions and professional organisations regarding the field of EU journalism(s); 6,) Strategic insight into information policy aspects and consultancy for EU institutions and agencies; 7.) Mapping of centres of excellence in the field of European public sphere(s). ",

This requires new knowledge on the role of multiple identities, active citizenship and organized civil society. CINEFOGO is a consortium consisting of more than forty universities and research institutes, and a number of public service institutions in 15 European countries. In addition, Harvard University from USA participates. The Network includes about 100 individual researchers. Almost half of these are women. The CINEFOGO's mission is to generate and spread knowledge on the evolution of citizenship and multiple identities in Europe, and addressing civic apathy and social exclusion in Europe. CINEFOGO has organized the activities by giving focus on research, education and public debates within three thematic areas: \"Identities, Values, and Civic Cultures - Integration and Diversity\", \"Citizenship and Civic Participation in Relation to Social Protection\", \"Multi-level Governance and Organized Civil Society\". The mission and the themes reflect an approach in full compliance with the objectives in topic 7.1.1 in Priority 7 of FP6. In order to accomplish its mission, CINEFOGO has set up two equally important programmes: A programme for Integrating Research Activities and a programme for Spread of Excellence. The first is dedicated to the enhancement of integrating research activities and jointly executed research in the Network whereas the latter is inspired by the vision of an ongoing dialogue nourished by social scientists and affiliated partners from the public sphere and organized civil society. The Network takes advantage of shared goals of excellent scientific institutions and scholars, and selected partners outside academia dedicated to and experienced in spreading information and contributing to public debate. This interplay will ensure a broad coverage and an effective spreading of excellence. ",

Brief description of the project: The project will evaluate the state of the art of the study of referendums on European integration and will analyse all available survey and aggregate data sets dealing with EU referendum voting. It will collect and analyse aggregate data on participation and vote choice in European Parliament and other elections and related census-based data for all member states. The project team will cooperate with the European Parliament and the Eurobarometer Unit of the European Commission in the design and analysis of a rolling cross-section survey of European voters in the run-up to the EP2004 elections and in the design and analysis of a post-election survey. Using European Social Survey (ESS) data, it will examine the determinants of abstention in national elections in 23 countries and will identify the dimensions and determinants of non-electoral civic participation. The project will also analyse trends in awareness of and engagement with European issues and the impact on these of communication initiatives and media coverage of European affairs. The project will conduct a study of campaigning in the European Parliament election of 2004 and devise a set of indicators of campaign activity and of media coverage of EU affairs, including a dataset of daily media variables relating to key EU themes. The project will also deal with variations in institutional contexts relevant to civic participation, examining variations in the structures of governance at supranational, national, regional and local levels and variations in institutional mobilisation and institutional facilitation. This phase of the project will generate a dataset of indicators of mobilisation and facilitation across 25 countries. Finally the project will evaluate, from both a gender and a disability perspective, all the data collection and analyses undertaken and the interpretations, conclusions and recommendations produced.

The Network aims at achieving and disseminating a greater understanding of both the actual histories and the self- representations of the past which are current in Europe today, highlighting both diversities and connections and clarifying the context of their development. Brief description of the project: CLIOHRES.net addresses the novel historical challenges, needs and research opportunities emerging from the context of a growing Europe. In the view of the partners, this is a vital area of endeavour for strengthening the foundations of a peaceful, productive European community of citizens. Basic and unquestioned attitudes about ourselves and others are rooted in the ways that the scientific community in each country defines its research agenda. Historians create and cultivate selective views of the national or local past, which in turn underpin pervasive ideas about identities and stereotypes: national, religious, gender, political, etc. National historiographies are still largely shaped by problems and preoccupations reflecting previous political and cultural contexts. CLIOHRES.net aims to create and promote a new structure and agenda for the community of historical research, redirecting its critical efforts along more fruitful lines. The consortium is uniquely placed to accomplish its ambitious goal. It has developed as a partnership over the past fifteen years; it includes all member states, accession countries and as well as neighbouring and third countries; it possesses an unrivalled knowledge of national and local differences in the use and abuse of history. The Network includes six thematic groups organised to conduct research in six interlocking areas, promoting cooperation and synergy between historians, geographers, philologists, art historians and other human scientists of different national background. Expected results (expected scientific and policy outcomes) 1. Increase integration of the European historiographical communities on a new critical basis, 2. Involve related disciplinary fields; 3. Carry out 6 coordinated macro-research projects on aspects of the formation and self-representation of European peoples, new perspectives, methodologies and sources; 4. Carry out 6 coordinated transversal research projects (on 'citizenship', 'identity', 'gender', 'migration', 'discrimination', 'tolerance'); 5. Promote the use of categories based on connection and plurality as well as those based on division and uniqueness; 6. Bring the results of the Network of Excellence to bear directly on educational and research policy; 7. Disseminate the results both within the academic community and to a broad public; 8. Create the premises for on-going development of the NoE and its activities after the funding period. ",

In particular, the project analyses the issue of active democracy as it emerges in the theorization and practices of the movements that have recently mobilized on the issues of globalization, suggesting patterns of \"globalization from below\". Internally, the search for new models of democracy is expressed in such experiments as local social forums, self- organized assemblies on the part of the citizenship, and transnational movement networks. Moreover, these movements are becoming increasingly involved in policy decision-making, especially at local level. The ensuing debate on deliberative democracy is particularly relevant both for the development of a civic society, and for the legitimization of political institutions. Brief description of the project: The research focuses on six European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and the EU level. The political opportunities and environmental resources for 'global movement/s' will be systematically assessed on the basis of existing evidence. The movement's websites will be examined in order to develop understanding of alternative communicative strategies employed by movement actors. Extensive discourse analysis of the documentation produced by social movements and self-organized groups will allow investigation of emerging images of democracy. Interviews with social movement organizations will be designed to acquire knowledge about the practical implementations of principles of horizontal participation and consensual decision- making, as well as the extent and types of interactions with authorities. A targeted structured survey will address the participatory visions and practices of participants in European demonstrations and movement events. Participant observation aims to illuminate the activities of movement organizations, with particular attention to their experiences of participatory decision-making. Expected results: The project aims to make a significant and innovative contribution to scientific knowledge about experiments in deliberative democracy, both within social movements and involving social movements. Our research is driven by policy considerations. Deliberative processes are important means by which to empower citizenship participation, and social movements are a relevant form of active citizenship. Better understanding of the emerging visions of democratic processes and the practices they involve is essential to the promotion of the active participation of citizens. In particular, our research is intended to contribute to the design of ways to increase citizens\u00bf participation in institutional decision-making processes. At the end of the project, the implications of the research for policy reforms will be elaborated. ",

We propose a new, networked and fluid conceptualisation of public sphere. We will cast light upon the intellectual and popular European integration processes since the 'Enlightenment'. The development of 'Western' as well as 'Eastern' among other EPSs from the Rome Treaty to the 'War on Terror' will be analysed through the media. We identify five 'crisis periods' in which discourses of Europe will be examined and interrelated with emerging public spheres. We shall devote particular attention to questions of ethics and visuality as well as their mobilisation in connection to the overall discourse on 'European values' as well as their political use. Our focus will be on relevant media in each period, accounting for technological development from printed media (newspapers) to radio, film, television and Internet, as well as the power implications of this technological dynamic. Our original research confronts: a) the evolution of European narratives transcending language barriers in visual media and b) the actual and potential use of the Internet as a means to constitute the EPS and to increase citizen participation in them. EMEDIATE will refine the concept of the public spheres in European contexts from theoretical and empirical perspectives, it will question the role of the media in creating and transforming EPS. From a policy perspective, it will develop reccomendations for media professionals, suggest models of 'democratic dialogue websites' and produce innovative pedagogic materials. Brief description of the project: 1. To provide an overview of the literature on the European public sphere; 2. The assessment of and how existing literature has analysed the connection between the media, the public sphere and ethics; 3. To investigate the role of the media in creating and discussing 'European crises', in determining the moral parameters along which such crises 'should' be discussed, in constructing a moral responsibility discourse for Europe and/or the EC/EU and, thus, ultimately in shaping European public spheres (EPS); 4. To investigate the diverse national editorial cultures in Europe and assess their convergence in a single global (rather than distinctively European) news-making culture of the post-war period; 5. The investigation of common visual repertoires used to represent the morally 'right' and 'wrong' during periods of 'European crises'. Expected results: 1. To integrate research done at the national level and in less known languages, in member and accession states, into a common European research area; 2. To make a contribution towards developing a definition of European public spheres which departs from the existing literature based on the study of national public spheres putting into focus the peculiar transnational, issue-related and networked character of the European public sphere; 3. Drawing upon the findings of the above we will assess the roles of the media in constituting European public spheres (EPS) and also how the (trans)formation of EPS provides communicative space for the media to function at a transnational level; 4. To invent new formats for internet communication that can be used to engage citizens more actively in public dialogue and encourage their participation in public life. ",

The 9 partners are selected from 9 countries (GR, UK, PL, LV, HU, DK, FR, ESP, BE) so as to represent different experiences of migration and integration, including those still in transition with regard to migration. There are 5 main research phases. First, an outlining of migration in these countries. Second, a critical review of public debates on integration and multiculturalism. Thirdly, three empirical case studies in each country: (a) educational challenges posed by migration related diversity (b) legal challenges, with special reference to anti discrimination provisions, (c) political challenges wiht special reference to voting rights and/or civic participation. The case studies will be ethnographic but incorporating different types of qualitative and quantitative data, examination of previous studies, policy papers, media discourses, qualitative interviews and focus groups with key actors, fieldwork notes. Knowledge dissemination activities and interaction with users will be incorporated in the research process. The fourth phase is the integration of the national case studies critically reviewing the different types of challenges and how/if they are accommodated in each country. Each partner will consider to what extent their country offers a distinctive 'model' of immigrant incorporation and on what value discourses this model is based. The last phase compares the main value discourses and perceived value conflicts among the countries studied and shall identify the European dimensions of integrating diversity (value discourses, points of tensions, best practices) and elaborate an empirically grounded European theoretical model of multiculturalism appropriate to the European experience and current crisis as a a basis for a rational resolution of the current panic about multiculturalism ",

The EuroEthos project aims to explore the possible scope for a shared European ethos through the analysis of political and legal questions concerning issues of religious and secular ethics-based requests for exemption from the law, in the belief that the study of such issues provides precious indications on how societies try to handle a plurality of values. The project has four objectives: 1.to develop and organise knowledge on cases in which religious and ethical secular values lead to the definition of politically relevant claims; 2.to raise historical awareness of the relationship between plural values and political stances; 3.to analyse the influence of a diverse cultural heritage on the political views of citizens in the enlarging Europe; 4.to study the scope for a European ethos as a precondition for political integration. To achieve these objectives, the project will compile a database of cases of requests for exemption from the law, and run a comparative analysis focusing on two case studies. Building on this analysis, normative recommendations will be developed regarding the specific forms in which a pluralistic European ethos should be realised. The knowledge-based study on the possibility of fostering European political integration through the creation of a shared ethos will produce a better understanding of the impact of plural values and religions in societies across Europe, and of their role in relation to changes in society, as required by the objectives of the FP6 (activity 7.2.1). The project\u00bfs dissemination activities include conferences and a publication strategy aiming to communicate results to an academic and non-academic public. The researchers involved enjoy very good academic reputations. The combination of their different areas of expertise will provide a nuanced outlook on the issue. ",

It will focus on how integration and decentralization processes, at both the national and European level, are affecting three major dimensions of citizenship: identity, representation, and practice of good governance. In a moment in which the EU is facing an important number of challenges, and given that its legitimacy and democratic capacities are questioned, it is important to address the issue of if and how is EU citizenship emerging. From this primary question stem three further sets of questions that will be the building-blocks of this research: (1) How does a particular kind of political structuring shape citizenship? In a complex system, how do different identities coexist? (2) What sense of obligation is the EU citizenship developing? How do coexisting identities affect the relationship between elites and mass? (3) What are the citizens expecting from the EU as a level of government? To answer these questions, we will address the problems of citizenship under the threefold approach of identity, representation and evaluation of government performance, by looking at the dynamics between elites and public opinion, whose interactions traditionally nurture the dynamics of collective political identity, political legitimacy and representation, and standards of performanceThe project will develop: - Research goals such as the empirical testing of existing theories of integration and citizenship in its threefold dimensions, identity, representation and governance, and the development and improvement of those theories. - Educational goals rooted in the geographical and disciplinary integrating capacity of the project, with over 30 institutions from both Eastern and Western Europe, and with a joint effort of people coming from political science, sociology, law, economy, media studies, linguistics, psychology a clear step forward in the strengthening of the European Research Area in the social sciences and humanities. The European research capacities will be mobilised at both, the level of well-established scholars, and that of younger fellows through the implementation of training programs. - Policy-making goals related to the understanding of what is to be legitimized in the EU and how. Existing policy instruments for participatory governance will be applied such as deliberative polling, citizen juries in order to provide empirical evidence on the relationship existing between participatory governance, enhanced policy outcomes, and an overall improvement of the democratic functioning of the EU system. The dissemination activities will contribute to triggering the relationships between the EU citizens, and also between those citizens and the EU institutions. Ways in which the process of further mobilization of public opinion can be achieved will also be proposed. Potential Impact The project intends to contribute to: - Theory development. The research will offer a theoretical dynamic picture of the characteristics and dimensions of citizenship in a unique period of European history. - Empirical research. The project will map a detailed description of the main conceptions of identity and their multiple interconnections among set of actors crucial to the process of construction of an European identity, namely, elite, citizens and mass media. - Research methodology. The project stresses as much comparability with previous studies as innovation in both design and wording of the questions (such as experimental conditions in survey, innovative ways of asking questions, etc.). - Innovative standards of responsiveness of political institutions, making possible to spread practice of active involvement of citizens in local and Europe-wide political activities; ",

Specific objectives are: - The creation of a network to bring together European researchers and lecturers who are specialists in radio. - to give special encouragement to younger scholars. - to map and record radio-related research competencies and projects that are being, or have recently been, undertaken, identifying fields of collaboration across different disciplines, between universities and with broadcasters, and neglected areas in need of development, especially involving comparative research; to begin building a picture of the state-of-the-art in the academic field and as regards the European radio industry; to exchange, and make progress towards sharing, research methodologies, descriptors and indicators. - to identify what instances exist, and what potential there is for, radio's use in encouraging the involvement of citizens in public spheres, locally, nationally and at European level. - to create infrastructure that will continue after the end of the project and positively encourage involvement by researchers from Eastern and Southern European countries. - to begin a dialogue with broadcasting organisations, both national and European, with a view to making research projects and findings relevant and available to broadcasters and their publics. - to use meetings, conference papers, published studies, bulletin boards, websites etc, as well as mainstream media (especially radio) to disseminate research interests and findings within the research community and beyond. Brief description : IREN is a 30-month co-ordination action which began in March 2004. Its founding partners are 13 institutions from 10 countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom) universities and professional organisations, whose representatives are mainly university teachers and researchers, specialists in radio. In several countries, the radio research community has begun to create national networks and IREN is already making links with these. So far two conferences have been held (International Colloquium, Bordeaux, April 2004; the International Radio Summer School, Siena, July 2004), and IREN has been represented at a number of broadcasting and academic meetings. Expected results (scientific and policy outcomes) - A programme of collaborative, interdisciplinary and complementary research - The creation of an internet site with the publication online of a database and a Handbook of Radio Systems in Europe - The formal constitution of IREN as an association with European legal status - The recruitment of a wide membership of the association especially from Southern and Eastern Europe - Contacts with the European broadcasting organisations and industries.

(2) To illuminate how citizens' participation in key areas of European research and technology policy that are connected to the \"politics of life\" can be made more effective and appropriate, (3) to investigate the changing role of civic participation in the context of multi-level governance in the EU, and (4) to contribute to institutional re-design in a the emerging European \"politics of life\". Brief description of the project: PAGANINI focuses on key areas of FP6 and investigates how participation contributes to problem solving in a number of highly contentious fields of EU governance. It looks at dynamic cluster of policy areas concerned with what we call \"the politics of life\": medicine, health, food, energy, environment. \"Politics of life\" refers to dimensions of life that are only to a limited extent under human control - or where the public suspects that there are serious limitations to socio- political control and steering. In the policy areas of the 'politics of life' policy closure is, for a variety of reasons, not possible in the same way it seemed to be with earlier areas relating to social policy. The 'politics of life' invariably exhibits a significant reliance on science, a high degree of uncertainty coupled to possible high-consequence risks, a focus on value judgements, and the crossing of constitutional jurisdictions. In the face of this, conventional cost- benefit analysis is rendered vulnerable to social contestation and value conflicts, interest group-based bargaining is only of limited use and cross-national consensus is hard to construct. As a result, participation in the fields of 'politics of life' takes on a new meaning. Instead of 'merely' being about the enhanced legitimation of policy making, forms of participation could become an integral component-part of modes of multi-level governance. This shift is based on recognition of the lasting role of uncertainty, the rising importance of deep-going value conflicts in society with respect to key governance areas, the need for constant monitoring and adjustment, as well as the recognition of the limits to the knowledge capacity of state institutions. In participatory governance participation is considered to be a two way process enhancing the reflexivity of governing and strengthening the legitimation of governance in the complexities of a multi-level polity. Expected results: The project will address the possibilities for civic participation in the context of multi-level governance in the European Union and study how processes of institutional re-design could make 'participatory governance' a central component of European multi-level polity. Politics of life areas such as medical genetics, humn embryonic stem cell research, environmental protection, food production and nuclear safety transgress the borders of the nation states and can only be dealt with in European and global perspective.

This project starts from the assumption that immigrant populations have a high potential for active civic participation, because migrants experienced themselves the positive effects of reciprocal networks and the support by civic activists from the mainstream society. In addition, third country nationals may develop a more distinctive conception of European values and democracy than EU natives do, comparing to their state of origin. But legal and political conditions for migrants may discourage participation in the mainstream society. This project seeks to improve our understanding of different factors that promote or inhibit active civic participation of immigrants. Description of the project: A unique project construction is developed that enables broad coverage while securing common aims and standards. It includes a summer school as a means to collect a first database (application essays) and recruit and train foreign students as interviewers. The study is divided into three3 parts: - A comparative literature review on immigrant civic participation in 25 member and accession states, focussing on native language sources and describing the basic conditions and patterns of participation and identifying country differentials beyond the legal realm. - A comparative analysis of foreign students' perceptions of democracy in Europe, using up to 500 essays, and focus group discussions at a summer school, to explore how their ideas of democracy Europe are linked to active participation and influenced by their national background. - A comparative analysis of over 150 qualitative interviews with civic activists of immigrant origin in 25 states, differentiating between immigrant citizens, permanent residents and migrants with temporary status, to identify favourable biographical and national conditions for active participation. A European NGO will organise dissemination events in the 25 countries, embedding the presentation of research results in local agendas. Expected results: Expected results include an overview over active civic participation of immigrants in the EU, an exploration of Third country students ideas on Europe, an analysis of favourable and unfavourable national and biographical conditions for active civic participation of immigrants and a series of focussed dissemination events.The EC has stressed the detrimental impact of the fragmentation of the Social Sciences and Humanities on achieving a broad knowledge base, enhancement of employability and competitiveness in Europe vis-\u00e0-vis the USA and Japan (eg White Paper on Education and Training; Green Paper on Innovation). This project responds to this challenge in three ways by proposing: 1. a comparative analysis of the bases (epistemol\u00f3gica!, structural, fiscal etc) of this fragmentation; 2. a comparative analysis of interdisciplinary research and its impact; 3. the development of a prototype European integrated research methods training module as one step towards overcoming the barriers between the Social Sciences and the Humanities. It thus answers topic 1.2 of Priority 7 which asks that 'Research should analyse the forms of national, disciplinary and paradigmatic fragmentation of the social sciences and humanities in Europe and propose practicable means to overcome this fragmentation.' The module proposed constitutes one such practicable means of overcoming fragmentation. Other recommendations will be made based on the findings of 1 and 2 above. As European countries are implementing the Bologna Agreement and developing new postgraduate MA/MSc degrees, this project presents a unique opportunity to develop a module that can be implemented across all European countries as part of the education reforms currently undertaken, fostering through its integrative component the opportunities for the development of new knowledge, a broad knowledge base, and the ability to adapt to changing work and research environments through the acquisition by learners/future researchers of a barrier-breaking basis in integrated research methods training.

At the level of its Member States, uneven struggles often diverge from this and tend to exclude and polarize, whether the focus is on race, ethnicity, religion or sexuality. Gender issues are constitutive of current European polarizations in terms of ethnicity, sexuality and religion. Innovative perspectives to address these divergences and polarizations need avoid opposing minority rights and gender equality. Gender equality policies, as the most developed policies against inequality, provide the best entrance to developing inclusive gender+ equality policies. QUING will actively bring together and construct the knowledge needed for such inclusive gender+ equality policies, by conceptualizing how technocratic tendencies can be counteracted and how attention for intersectionality can be integrated. It will also assess the current content, quality and problems of gender+ equality policies and produce recommendations and standards for gender+ training so that policy making fits active gender equal citizenship in a multicultural Europe. QUING does this through 5 integrated activities. LARG and WHY will generate and bring together new concepts, knowledge and understanding on current practices across the whole of Europe on gender equality policies. FRAGEN will provide knowledge both on the origins of gender equality policies, and their current materialization. STRIQ will provide the necessary knowledge to address gender inequality in policy making without contributing to other inequalities. Finally, OPERA is an innovative contribution to provide standards, materials and training for gender+ equality. Together the 5 activities will contribute significantly to the quality of gender+ equality policies in the EU and its candidate countries. ",

In our project highly qualified researchers in the humanities and social sciences will cooperate in a thematic and methodological approach in order to gain better insight into how European citizens of different religious, cultural and political backgrounds can live together and enter into dialogue of mutual respect and understanding. These possibilities are to be examined in the context of educational institutions. In the context of historical development, we will concentrate on questions of religions and religious values. Differences will be studied in their impact on modern Europe and the lives of its citizens. We plan to research empirically how differences within European societies can be taken into account without creating conflict or exclusion. Empirical studies, targeting students in the 14-16-year age group, will look into their own perceptions of dialogue or conflict within the different national contexts. These will include a dual perspective of, on the one hand, the subjects' own perspectives and, on the other hand, analyses of observed teaching in both dialogue and conflict situations. Our subject selection will also allow for gender-specific results. It is particularly from those studies we expect to gain insight into whether and how religious and value-based identity development can coexist or clash with openness for other positions. We plan to conversely look into how, in the context of religious education in schools and universities, theoretical and practical approaches that further openness towards others and mutual respect across religious and cultural differences can be strengthened. Looking towards the future, we can not hope to solve this task at the national level alone. A European perspective needs to be established through comparative study. ",

The strategic objectives of this proposal are to a) assess the degree of subgroup differentiation in the post communist societies, b) to study how the differentiation process is proceeding, c) to investigate the degree to which the subgroup structures and processes vary in several post-communist societies, d) to compare both the subgroup structure and the processes in the post-communist societies to those seen in western Europe. How groups arise, function, and disappear is of interest both in theory and in practice. The scientific interest arises because the matter is topical in the social sciences (e.g. anthropology, sociology), and also because the dynamics of groups is clearly nonlinear and recent advances in computational tools make the study of such processes finally possible. These topics are of great practical concern and applicability because they impact such crucial issues as social cohesion, intergroup tensions, discord, and violence. Project will use advantages of interdisciplinary approach, based on the methodology of cultural/social/political anthropology. This will be implemented through fieldwork emphasising an in-depth integration of researchers into the groups under analysis with the purpose of revealing the meanings of the real life as well as understanding the meanings of values and religions, deriving from these groups and spread into the society-at-large. For evaluation of research results and recommendations novel approach of field- testing will be used when possibilities effectively exploit recommendations of the project in real field conditions with participation of the groups under investigation will be made.

This primary objective can be broken down into the following subsidiary objectives: - to provide a better understanding of cultural assets and how their diversity contributes to human welfare and knowledge creation; - to provide a better understanding of the dynamics of cultural diversity in Europe and the world in relation to the processes of globalisation, European integration and enlargement; - to explore cultural dialogue as a key mechanism through which cultural diversity can lead to knowledge creation and social capital; - to promote lasting co-operation and integration, bringing about a new way of carrying out research in Europe, - to serve the wider European research, policy and business community and the public at large, by promoting new excellence, preparing the next generation of researchers and creating enduring physical and virtual spaces of interactions among researchers and stakeholders. The Joint Programme of Activities balances research activities (organised in four Research Themes) and Structuring Actions (organised in three Structuring Action Lines). The Research Themes are: - Research Theme 1. Understanding diversity. Research Theme 1 aims at improving our understanding of cultural assets and of how the diversity of cultures may contribute to human welfare and development. It addresses the need of creating new instruments to value market and non-market benefits of diversity and integrate diversity consideration into policy-making. - Research Theme 2. Global vs. local: the dynamics of diversity in the globalisation era. Research Theme 2 aims at improving our understanding of the processes through which globalisation and enlargement affect cultural dynamics and of how cultural dynamics feed back into the processes of globalisation and enlargement. - Research Theme 3. Diversity, knowledge production and creativity. In the face of the transition towards the knowledge-based economy, Research Theme 3 aims at understanding whether, how and why diversity may contribute to knowledge production and creativity. - Research Theme 4. Cultural dialogue: unfolding diversity. Cultural dialogue provides the framework in which differences can be expressed and interact in a positive manner. Research Theme 4 aims at improving our understanding of the various forms of cultural dialogue and the types of initiatives that contribute to create arenas where cultural dialogue can take place and diversity unfold. The Structuring Actions complement the integration impact of the Research Actions along the following three lines: - Indicators and Data. It coordinates the data design and data collection activities undertaken in Research Themes and constructs a coherent framework of diversity indicators. - Coordinating and Integrating Training Activities. It pursues integration both at bottom-up (through exchanges of students and teachers) and top-down levels (studying the need and feasibility of a Graduate School, a Master of excellence at the European level and a Euro-PhD). - Interacting with Stakeholders. It maintains a structured dialogue and interaction with the outside research community and the stakeholders. ",

As a highly visible symbol of religious difference and conflicting values the Muslim headscarf has been the subject of heated debates across Europe and subjected to legal regulations in some European countries. One of our assumptions is that in debates about the headscarf fundamental values and norms of liberal democracies are not only re-negotiated but collective identities re-constructed within the European integration process. Moreover, the issue reveals the gendered nature of values and norms that widely prevail in liberal democracies in Europe. VEIL compares policy and media debates in eight European countries and the European Union. The aims of the project are: first, to map out and compare the fundamental values and political principles of the main actors in the headscarf debates and second, to explain the differences and similarities in the conflicting values as expressed in the policies on Muslim headscarves. The project suggests a gender-critical frame analysis of policy documents (e.g. court verdicts, laws, parliamentary debates, media articles) using a comparative perspective for encoding values and norms. The project will also incorporate a comparative analysis, which focuses on citizenship regimes and immigration policies, on gender regimes and the relationship between the state and religious communities or institutions. The innovative potential of this interdisciplinary study of religious and cultural value systems consists in its policy-oriented social science approach and its gender-sensitive analysis of identity-building processes. Finally, the project will draft recommendations for national and European policymakers for dealing with cultural and religious diversity. ",

Innovative in scope and methodology, this study captures a set of complex relations between religion, minorities and gender, because it is at the juncture of these three domains that some of the sharpest transitions in value systems are taking place in Europe. WAVE is predicated on the assumption that intangible concepts such as 'cultural identities' and 'values' are understood best through the ways in which they are expressed and developed in practice. It thus examines the interaction of diverse value systems through the prism of welfare. Who provides what to whom, and for what reasons, are critical markers of the values of a given community - as are who demands what and for what reasons. WAVE will entail in-depth qualitative research in medium-sized towns in twelve European countries. By examining social interaction in the domain of provision of basic needs, WAVE aims to: a. assess the impact of religion in societies across Europe as a bearer of values of solidarity and social cohesion, or as a source of tension and exclusion; b. to study the values expressed by minority groups and the extent to which minorities are perceived to challenge the values and cultural identities of the local majorities (and vice versa); and c. to examine whether there are particular elements of tension or cohesion embedded in values relating to gender and to the rights and needs associated with women and with men. WAVE will suggest best practices of tolerance and social cohesion through the systematic comparison of case studies covering a broad range of majority religions, minority situations, and gender regimes. The project will incorporate close interaction with stakeholders in a process of informing citizens about EU objectives related to the research as well as transmitting their views on local policies to the EU.

The CAENTI aims to promote comparative research to conceive and spread tools, methodologies and research protocols accessible to the researchers in the social sciences and to the actors of sustainable development of territories. It will constitute applicable data sets for multi-field research and for territorial development. The EU introduced several years ago the need for project management and evaluation. Since G\u00f6teborg, sustainable development rules have established the principles of good governance: participation, well-balanced approach and partnership. Scientific methods adapted to these principles are available to the experts, but the territorial actors rarely benefit from simple and cheap tools to elaborate, manage, observe, evaluate and transfer their projects. Such instruments mobilise fundamental research activities - provider of quality guarantee - as well as territorial actors to experiment and evaluate them. The CAENTI consortium will organise a rigorous management of its coordination activities. An annual international conference and an Internet gateway will also facilitate dissemination. Three comparative research activities will be implemented: I. The spreading of fundamental methods and research design in territorial information analysis within the social sciences and humanities II. Analysis of the application of the principles of governance of the sustainable development in the territorial research-action III. Design and dissemination of methods and tools of territorial intelligence accessible to the territorial actors and respectful of sustainable development ethics.

Often, however, such comparisons suffer from differences across countries and socio- economic groups in the way people answer survey questions, particularly self-evaluations of, e.g., health or quality of work. This proposal aims at solving this problem by developing widely applicable tools for comparative survey research among European citizens, called anchoring vignettes. Anchoring vignettes are short descriptions of, e.g., the health or job characteristics of hypothetical persons. Respondents are asked to evaluate the hypothetical persons on the same scale on which they assess their own health or job. Respondents are thus providing an anchor, which fixes their own health assessment to a predetermined health status or job characteristic. These anchors can then be used to make subjective assessments comparable across countries and socio-economic groups.The project will develop anchors that can be used in a broad range of domains (such as health; work disability; quality of life, employment and health care; satisfaction with political institutions) and that can be applied to typical EU sponsored cross-national surveys (such as the ECHP, ESS, SHARE and SILC). Specifically, anchors will be constructed for SHARE, the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, which currently covers some 22,000 respondents of age 50 and older in 11 EU countries. We use SHARE as a testing ground since it addresses crucial domains of European public policy, such as health care, socio-economic status, employment and retirement. The vignettes will be used to construct improved indicators of health, well-being, job satisfaction, etc., helping Europe to create opportunities for more accurate and richer analyses of the consequences of ageing and the effects of socio-economic and health care policies at the national and European level.

In an integrated and systemic approach the project explores the major ethical and societal questions raised by technological development in the field of converging technologies (CT) and the ways in which these can be addressed by the Social Sciences and Humanities. In the context of imminent transformations to a European knowledge-based society, these questions present key opportunities and challenges which the research community needs to be prepared to face. This activity will build on a continuous review and monitoring of technological developments in the CTs and relevant global RTD policy trends, at the same time analysing their possible implications for contributions by the SSH. The project will further analyse how and to what extent the SSH can contribute to the shaping of science and technology. The final aim is to raise awareness of Converging Technology issues throughout the SSH community and to develop options for a research agenda to be implemented in the SSH priority of 7th Framework Program. The emergence of the knowledge- based society will entail new forms of relationships between its citizens, on one hand, and between its citizens and institutions, on the other.

These objectives are implemented through organizing a conference and two targeted workshops, setting up an Expert Group, publishing a volume and other dissemination activities. Country studies of the current situation of LMs reviewing relevant research and data are prepared following the same set of guidelines (to be presented and discussed at the conference, and published in the volume). International specialists review the state of the art in LM related research (these reviews are presented at the conference, and are published in the volume). Research agendas will be formulated in a first stage for each of the participating countries (to be discussed at the first targeted workshop), and in a second step for the region (worked out by the expert group, and to be discussed at the second targeted workshop). The Expert Group will formulate policy and policy implementation suggestions at the national, regional and EU level. Throughout the project we actively involve policy-makers, and other stake-holders including representatives of minority self-governments and NGOs, professionals, activists and teachers. Our project strengthens the currently existing knowledge base about LMs and their multi-faceted relations with linguistic majority groups, and provides a frame for mutual transfer of knowledge. Reviewing the current state of LMs as well as national research on them, and developing the common regional research plan are crucially conducted using a comparative and multidisciplinary approach.

To chart and explain shifts over time in Europe's social, political and moral climate in relation to its changing population patterns and institutions 2. To improve methods of European social measurement in comparative studies, particularly attitudinal studies 3. To develop a series of European social indicators, including attitudinal indicators, that measure changes over time in the quality of life in different European nations Three biennial rounds of the ESS have already been funded within FP5 and FP6, all co-funded by the European Science Foundation and some 25 national academic funding bodies throughout Europe. It is an academically-driven, uniquely rigorous comparative time series, helping to document and interpret hitherto inadequately-charted aspects of the European condition. Its wide-ranging questionnaire covers people's value orientations, their political and cultural perspectives, and the underlying social structure of their societies. A separate data collection exercise monitors major events during fieldwork as a backdrop to an understanding of attitude change. The ESS has already established itself as a robust multi-national, multi-funded programme of large-scale substantive and methodological research - an exemplar of the European Research Area at work. It is also developing a world-wide reputation for both its rigour and utility. In the first 18 months of its first public data release, nearly 5,000 people across Europe and beyond had registered to use it. Seven books and countless articles based on its data are in preparation. A US clone has been funded by their American NSF. We have just made an independent application within Call 2 for 'infrastructure' support for the ESS - to sustain and improve its networks, accessibility, and methodology - but this application is solely for support of the 4th biennial Round of this influential and much-used European time series.

The specific objective of the project is to enlarge the SSH research agenda of the EU with research priorities of an enlarged and enlarging European research community, exploit experiences in transnational research for future research collaborations and design supportive research policies for future transnational research. The partner countries mirror the different possible status of involvements of its research communities: Turkey and Bulgaria with the status of Associate Candidate Countries, Switzerland an Associate Country and Malta a New Member State. The approach of this project to integrate new national research communities into transnational research and into the enlarging ERA could be considered as a model for integrating other research communities in the future. In order to create sustainable future research collaborations ESSHRA will complement networking activities by raising substantial data on future research priorities, on transnational research perspectives and on policy support actions towards the future of an enlarging ERA. ESSHRA will invite experts to enhance future transnational research in a bottom up approach towards joint actions in this project. SSH researchers from project partner countries, previous FP project coordinators, transnational researchers, policy makers and research policy experts from the EU and from partner countries will be involved in the different types of activities of the project. The objectives of this project will be implemented via conferences and meetings involving researchers and research policy experts. ESSHRA will finally result in stimulating research policy experts from partner countries and the EU to develop policy recommendations scaffolding future transnational research in an enlarging ERA and to help to carry out the forthcoming FP7.

The database can be used in self-administered questionnaires by means of search tools or for recoding text-based reporting of occupations by means of recoding programs. For all occupations the database includes ISCO- and NOC-occupation codes, occupational titles, education and stratification code, and for 150 benchmark occupations, it holds information about job content, required skill level, and competencies. The information will be gathered via existing databases and via experts from interest organisations and social science researchers. Occupation is a key variable in social research, particularly the labour market, transitions from school to work, social stratification, gender wage gap, occupational structures or skill requirements. Classifications of industries and education are EU-harmonized, but occupational classifications are not. Most comparative, large-scale socio-economic datasets provide only highly aggregated, 1-digit information about occupations. In addition, tools are absent to collect comparable, disaggregated and reliable data on occupations across countries, be it large-scale surveys or case-studies. The EUROCCUPATIONS database will be tested for its usability and its search facilities for self-administered surveys, and for text-based reporting of occupations recoding programs will be tested. In addition, the database will be tested for possible gender and skill bias. Finally, algorithms will be developed to derive stratification variables from the occupations in the database. The database will be promoted among the European research community and institutions in the European labour market by means of a website, offline versions of the database, conferences, web- based discussion platforms, and email newsletters.

Currently, multiple FP6-projects - regardless their Research Area or instrument - are dealing with the same issue or address common questions. Common cross-project infrastructures to share information, to jointly disseminate results or to ensure accessibility of results after project completion are rarely available due to the specific nature and to the diversity of the projects (regarding their priorities, the methodology used, their duration and also the participants). As a matter of fact, dissemination is very fragmented and access to research results is complicated. The objective of IConnectEU is to create a generic infrastructure for joint dissemination activities across thematically related projects, consisting of a software platform, a reference model for integrated dissemination, and guidelines on how to implement the infrastructure in different domains. Eight projects currently funded under Priority 7 and dealing with the broad topic of Governance in the EU will serve as a use case for creating a pilot portal (content and software) which integrates their currently unconnected dissemination activities. This portal will then be used in a feasibility study as a Best-Practice example for other Areas of FP6 and FP7. The study will help to create a reference model for cross-project dissemination, integrating relevant aspects like audiences, information needs, information services, cooperative structures and sustainability. A cost-effectiveness study will additionally analyse the benefits of integrated dissemination. Guidelines in the form of Blue Prints will support other projects in adapting IConnectEU results to their domains, leading to a new thematic layer consisting of compatible dissemination structures and adding additional value to the ERA.

We propose to look into the patterns of NBIC knowledge production as well as the actual and potential use of and social resistance to such knowledge. In terms of knowledge production, our attention will focus on charting the institutional settings in which the NBIC fields are pursued and promoted. Relevant questions include: Who are the key actors involved? How do they figure in the overall ecology of both academic knowledge and socially relevant technologies? What funding mechanisms are used to promote convergence or synergy among different technological fields? Given the different origins of these fields, when and why did they start to 'converge' and to what extent? With respect to the use of and resistance to this knowledge, we will be concerned in particular with the growing moral, political and economic pressure to regulate, to police or even forbid novel knowledge as well as technical devices emerging from NBIC technologies. Such pressures have already become apparent in Europe and elsewhere with regard to biotechnology as well as stem-cell research and similar concerns are beginning to be voiced with reference to nanotechnology. The new convergence technologies can be expected to raise similar if not more accentuated concerns in that they promise an integration of biological reproductive processes, mental mechanisms of learning and information management at the nanoscale. Our proposed activities are exploratory at this stage as very little is as of yet known about the 'converging' component of 'converging technologies', especially from the social scientific perspective. For this reason, our project will combine exploratory studies with networking activities in order to build up a community interested in this emerging S&T field of study. ",

Contribution of social and human sciences, FP5), MEDUSE aims at setting up a dialogue between social scientists and non-academic actors directly concerned with three issues: 1- The dynamics of patient organizations in the European area 2- The emergence of new technologies and responsibilities for health care at home across diverse European systems and cultures 3- Cross-national and European perspectives on health safety agencies These three topics appear as highly relevant issues for health policies: they put matters of governance and citizenship to the front, due to new framings of knowledge production and use in the domain of health and medicine. All three also relate to the increasing role played by non traditional actors (e.g. patient organizations, health agencies, networks for care at home). Three large conferences will be organized, gathering social scientists, professionals, patients' representatives, decision and policy makers, both at national and European levels. These conferences will be framed as to put academic and non- academic participants on an equal footing. For this to be achieved, two sets of preparatory activities will be undertaken: 1- setting up of bibliographical databases on the three issues, comprising academic and grey literatures and reports from experts, available on ITEMS website 2- preparatory exchanges with participants on issues of particular interest to them. The conferences will be arranged in order to disseminate social science findings and to permit cross- examination of the issues at stake. Exchanges will concern: questions likely to be put on the scientific and political agenda; desirable knowledge for addressing these questions; modalities of partnership between social scientists and non-academic actors which will suit the best for producing this knowledge.

Mediterranean architecture within the framework of a EU-Med partnership (France, Italy, Tunisia). It is based on the observation that a wealth of architectural and urban forms of European origin and/or inspiration exists in the southern and eastern shore of the Mediterranean, and has attracted, in the last decade, a growing interest from scholars, conservationists and authorities alike (from both sides of the Mediterranean), as new objects for research as well as potential candidates for protection, conservation and enhancement. Recording, studying, listing and restoring an architectural asset that tends to be perceived as a shared heritage is representing a developing field of activity for different disciplines (art history, archaeology, architecture, information management, cultural heritage studies and management, planning...), with significant potential of growth in the coming decades. Providing specialised knowledge in this field is thus essential to the development of research, as well as for decision- and policy-making. This domain of investigation suffers however from uneasy access to relevant documentary data. Primary sources, as well as secondary, material on given buildings or urban areas of interest are particularly difficult to retrieve. The objective of this proposed SSA is to produce, through joint research and the assistance of a multi-disciplinary group of experts (art historians, archaeologists, archivists, information officers, data base technology and system-building specialists, cultural heritage managers), the prototype of the electronic and virtual means that can help bridging the data dispersion and limited availability by offering full remote access to geographically-organized and visually- oriented resources open to cross-searching, and a scheme for the incrementation and expansion of the system.

This area was for centuries one of the cradles of civilisation. Today finds the countries of Central Asia (CA) in a period of rebirth. At the same time they have to withstand several threats such as ethnic diversity, border disputes and the processes of nation building as well as different religious beliefs and the rapid juvenescence of the population. All of these problems directly influence the rest of the world, and are directly connected to social sciences and humanities (SSH). Nowadays, new technologies are bringing everyone closer together than ever before in our history. In this situation it is easy to realise that our histories, cultures and even languages are linked and studies in SSH, without considering this, are therefore unthinkable. At the same time, it is extremely important that all parties should understand the same indications in the same way (e.g. academic recognition, accreditation, evaluation, quantitative indicators in SSH). The PHOENIX project constitutes an integrated set of networking and training measures for SSH community in CA using, besides the expertise of Member State (MS) partners, the expertise of existing EU funded projects (MORESS, HERA, INTAS ININ Continuing advice) and collaboration networks (COLLNET). The SSH community\u00bfs increase in competence and expanded area of action will be achieved through workshops, information seminars and video conferences and video links to identify and motivate potential collaboration, and to boost the acquisition of knowledge about new trends in SSH and the role of SSH in ERA.

Third, and most important, thematic studies will explore the possibilities for, and the possible limitations on conducting research in a number of different thematic areas based on an evaluation of the datasets included in the database. Through the thematic studies, the online portal will also serve as a platform for the discussion of fundamental methodological problems in this field as well as a tool for dissemination of project result.

Presently, there is a need to continue the process that has been started but could not be finished because of the large range of ideas and questions raised in the past, since the two subject areas are still of great importance for the development of tax law within the enlarged European Union. The ideal platform for achieving this goal is the organisation of a conference focusing on the dissemination of the scientific output of the past conferences. The event shall take place from 7 - 10 September 2006. Moreover, the project has a considerable networking dimension. At the conference, scientific experts from all over \"old\" and \"new\" Europe will come together and exchange their ideas. Also, potentials for future co-operations in Europe-wide research projects might be developed. Accordingly, the intended conference will make the research results of the preceding projects, which are of considerable value throughout Europe, accessible to as many people as possible. The planned event shall function as an international platform for the exchange of opinions and for providing tax experts with information that cannot easily be obtained, especially not on a Europe-wide level. Besides, the project is aimed at revealing future trends and developments in international tax law and tax treaty practice and at strengthening the integration of the European Union. The project will be coordinated by Prof. Josef Schuch, Chair of Public Law and Tax Law. Following the conference, the outcome of the project will be published in a book. Thus, an impact all over Europe, especially for those who were not able to participate themselves, will be ensured. ",

Type Stimulants (ATS) and a database with on-line access. This enables profiling of drug seizures without laborious transportation of samples between laboratories. Moreover, profiling can be carried out much more quickly than in a model based on a central laboratory. Development of minimum standards for identification of new ATS will as well be carried out, using the harmonised methods. The project will mainly focus on two different types of ATS, namely methamphetamine and MDMA. Additionally \"new ATS\" will be considered in the method development. Amphetamine is not included in this study since a harmonised profiling method is already available and routinely used. Profiling of ATS will be studied by using various techniques including external characteristics of the tablets, compositional analysis and impurity profiling. The compositional analysis includes both qualitative and quantitative determination of the active substance, diluents and adulterants. Some forensic laboratories already perform these analyses using \"in-house\" methods. The most promising of these will be chosen and further optimised and harmonised within this project. Studies on impurity profiling of ATS will be carried out using GC/MS and GC/IRMS. GC/MS offers the advantage of simultaneous identification and quantitation of all key components in a single analysis. GC/IRMS enables determination of isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and deuterium. The isotope ratios are linked to the production conditions. Thus the technique makes the discrimination between different batches of the drug feasible. In summary, different methods including ballistic, chemical characterisation and profiling methods will be separately evaluated and their significance investigated. The main outcome of the project is a set of recommended harmonised methods required for reliable profiling ATS. ",

The research will point out the existing problems in costs evaluation. It will not discuss computational methods of evaluating costs of different penal strategies. In order to do this, there should be an agreement about what shall be considered as a cost and what shall be considered benefit while proposing and adopting a specific policy. In our opinion, there?s actually no agreement on this point in the community of European experts. Moreover, such an agreement seems a chimera if we examine the strategies of different European penitentiary practitioners and administrators. Proponents believe that the first step is the definition of the different paradigms, with their implicit assumptions on penitentiary system?s tasks and costs. Secondly, it is necessary to define the different assumptions that move political discourse and influence public opinion. Finally, it is crucial to study in depth practitioners? perceptions about costs and benefits. This work of epistemological foundation is preliminary to any discussion about the costs of crime and crime repression. Research will: review existing literature and outline the legal and sociological framework of European penal and penitentiary policies (WP 1-2). In order to do this, the research will also produce an empirical-ethnographic research (WP 3-4), involving all the European countries where research units are based: old EU members such as Italy and Germany, new member States such as Lithuania and a candidate country where penal and penitentiary reforms are strongly needed, such as Turkey. Special attention will be dedicated to policies aimed at preventing recidivism and a specific ethnographic research on drug- related crime repression will be carried out (WP 4). ",

The changes of natural and man- made environment will probably be the most significant factors among the causes of forced migration. It is essential to get accurate information about the current and future triggers of forced migration in each country of origin and within Europe itself. The two year long project's general objectives are to support European policies, research and the civil society with'forced migration' scenarios, and cooperate with other migration and environment degradation related projects and institutions. The objectives will be achieved by five interlinked research sequences: 1) forecasting the natural and anthropogenic causes of forced migration; 2) analyzing direct (e.g. desertification) and indirect (e.g. conflicts) environmental effects on livelihoods; 3) predicting potential forced migration flows, with emphasis on environmental refugees; 4) contributing to the preparation of statistical indicators to measure environmental refugee flows; 5) dissemination. The study of the causes is a multidisciplinary and multisectoral process. The list of methodological tools contains all traditional elements of research from primary data collection via statistical analysis and environmental evaluation to modelling. The studied cases are selected from the following regions: Europe and Russia, NIS and Central Asia, Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Ghana, Middle East and Northern Africa, Latin America.

In order to build a sound knowledge-base on crime trends in Europe and to provide the tools for evidence-based policy research related to the basic security of European citizens, survey-based comparative measurement of large sample of the European public is needed. This consortium is combining leading research centres with a proven track record on the data collection side. Each consortium member has been working on previous projects of collecting, analyzing and evaluating policy options based on comparative surveys of crime. The project will critically revise the International Crime Victims Survey all members of consortium have participated in previously, and develop a revised instrument, the International Crime Survey, that address the need of the new European needs for comparative data for policy-makers. The project will also develop the new European Survey of Crime and Safety as a global standard instrument. One member of the consortium (UNODOC) brings to the project a real possibility that the project could be augmented from the first phase of the present member countries, to bring in extra resources to possibly cover not only the candidate countries, but also mobilizing third party resources to enrich the policy analysis potential of the European data by being able to compare it globally. The project in addition to solving basic measurement issues, and providing to the community of stake-holders the possibility of up-to-date information, promises to provide current data to the changing concerns of safety and security of the European public as well. The Steering Committee of the project will add greatly to the value of the data by mobilizing resources for the analysis of the data as well. The data will be available through various innovative web tools to the wider research community. ",

The comprehensive method of approach encapsulates findings from a small scale targeted survey of immigrant women, it capitalises on the already gathered but unexplored data among nationals of 5 new and 3 old member states regarding migration and integration of immigrants, and involves the key stakeholders in the policy deliberations in view to identify challenges to integration and expected needs for future immigration policies. The project addresses directly women third-country nationals residing in 8 EU countries. It will record their experiences, needs, attitudes and expectations concerning immigration and integration policies and practices and viewpoints regarding their own old age. The researchers's role is that of brokers between female immigrants, national population and the key policy actors - including social partners and NGOs working with immigrant women. The expected benefits are at the level of elaboration of facilitative measures for economic and social integration of immigrant women, mobilization of a broad population base in the host countries in view to foster better understanding of the long-term needs for migrants and their integration in ageing societies, consultations of stakeholders, and mobilization of the critical mass of institutions and researchers from 9 member states to gain new knowledge to improve integration processes and services in the framework of the Lisbon agenda and process.

The focus will be on social integration processes understood as participation, access and belonging. A central assumption is that integration policies should attend to the agency of the persons involved. The analysis of the integration processes will therefore focus not only on barriers for social integration and on their removal, but also on the migration strategies and life plans of the female migrants. The project employs a four stage analysis: first , analyzing policies affecting the integration of female migrants, second, analyzing the migration flows as well as the demand for the labour of female migrants, third, analyzing integration processes in relation to female migrants and fourth, analyzing processes relating to the implementation of social policies. The project will employ a combination of methods. Statistical quantitative methods will be used to outline the character and forms of migration, employment and stay. However, a biographically based and agency-sensitive evaluation will be at the core of the analysis. On the basis of this agency-sensitive biographical evaluation of policy, the project will formulate recommendations for better policies both on the national and EU level aimed at the integration of female migrants in a socially cohesive manner. The analysis will cover 11 national cases that comprise typical cases in relation to migration policy (higly regulated versus unregulated immigration), in relation to welfare systems (North versus South European countries) and in relation to member status in the EU (old versus new member states).

Its objectives were defined in Tampere by the European Council which stressed the need for more efficient management of migration flows at all their stages. The management should address various forms of migrations and be exercised by means of various instruments in the countries of destination and origin. Thus, the creation of European immigration policy becomes a complex process of co-ordination of national policies with the Community objectives. Amongst diverse migration trends in Europe, the emergence of new immigration countries seems particularly important. The transition of migratory status followed economic development induced by the participation in the common European market and political stability. The socio-economic conditions of the change as well as policy responses to the new situation varied considerably between the countries of North-western, Southern and Eastern Europe and led to various structures of immigration and impacts on labour markets. These differences provide interesting research basis which could shed light on the immigration mechanisms in Europe. In this 30-month project, the consortium of scientific institutions from 9 EU states, all with tremendous experience in migration research will analyse the causes, characteristics and impact of migratory flows in the new European immigration destinations - Southern and Eastern Europe, and with reference to the \"established\" European immigration countries. Comparing the migrations and relevant policies will facilitate identification of similar challenges and transfer of experiences. The analysis will address historical, political and economic background of migration processes and its final goal will consist in preparation of a model of future migratory trends in selected parts of the European Union. The strategic objective of the project is to provide support for the European and national immigration policies. ",

The intention of the IKOC Project is to piece the fragments together and to introduce value added by means of a methodology which improves current knowledge in the field. This will facilitate the analysis of problems and the definition of variables, and in so doing respond to the demand for knowledge expressed by the European institutions and Member States. The project's aim is to increase quantitative and qualitative knowledge about OC (various groups and networks operating in the EU, modi operandi, dynamics of illicit markets). Acquiring such knowledge will entail devising a methodology which specifies indicators of the phenomena. The project sets itself five objectives: 1. to develop knowledge and update existing information on OC in Europe; 2. to evaluate the usefulness of the current framework of data sources and information sharing systems; 3. to develop knowledge about the infiltration of legal markets by OC; 4. to identify indicators and devise a methodology for measuring the volume of OC and assessing its impact at national and European levels; 5.to run a pilot study intended to test the methodology on a specific crime area, i.e. international fraud. To achieve these objectives, the project will review the literature and analyse case-studies and information. The project's dissemination strategies will include three workshops addressed to the public and private sectors. Developing a knowledge-based methodology to test the feasibility of a common European approach to OC means furnishing instruments with which to anticipate, prevent and reduce crime, and also to achieve greater security for EU citizens, as required by the objectives of the FP6 (Area 8.1.b.2.6).

Project MARC wants to satisfy this demand, which comes from EU institutions, national governments and the market (consumers and producers). Its aim is to produce knowledge of the problem and mechanisms to help policymakers and businesspeople, at national and EU levels, to assess and reduce the risks of (organised) crime. Its objectives are: 1 ) to create a crime risk assessment mechanism (cram) to proof EU legislation against economic and organised crimes, thereby reducing the probability that such crimes occur due to opportunities arising from legislation; 2) to create a cram to proof electronic products against theft, thereby reducing the probability that a theft occurs due to the attractiveness of products. For both objectives a detailed plan of action will be put in place. To achieve obj. 1, the project will review extant literature on legislative opportunities for crime; analyse EU economic and organised crime case-studies (vulnerabilities studies); and carry out a pilot study on EU public procurement legislation (with detection of loopholes and proposals for remedial action). To achieve obj. 2, the cram will be tested on a sample of electronic products and a final mechanism will be drafted together with possible steps to make it operational in the electronics industry. A workshop with EU legislators and a conference on product crime proofing will be among the dissemination strategies. Establishing crime proofing mechanisms would mean providing instruments to anticipate and prevent crime, reducing its total amount and achieving more security and opportunities for EU citizens, as required by the objectives of the 6FP (Area 8.1 .B.2.6). The partners and the researchers involved are well known European crime scientists. They represent the majority of the small number of people working on crime proofing within the EU. ",

Agencies in a few member states make significant use of this methodology and incorporate the resulting estimates in the appraisal (ex ante) and the evaluation (ex post) of interventions, projects and pilots in the criminal justice policy field. But in many states the methodology is not employed, resulting in a lack of means for developing an evidence base documenting the benefits of criminal justice interventions. This proposal has three principal goals. The first is to audit the methodology used for estimating the costs of crime across member states, and the use that is currently made of the methodology and the resulting estimates. The second is to bring together criminal justice policy analysts from member states and academic researchers from related fields to share findings about methodology for estimating the costs of crime and about utilisating the findings. The third is to compile a series of resources including data, learning materials and interactive models for use by policymakers and others wishing to review the methodology for making estimates of the costs of crime, to explore examples of the application of the estimates in real-world criminal justice policy settings or to share their experience with others.

The project also examines statuses of denizenship and quasi-citizenship for third country nationals and/or descendants of former citizens that are granted in several Member States on the basis of long-term residence, or to nationals of certain countries or ethnic background and relatives of former citizens. The main goal of the project is to develop a systematic frame for comparing specific aspects in the regulation of nationality and citizenship across countries in order to define areas of long-term convergence or persistent divergence between Member States. Further to the systematic comparison the project provides country reports on the development of nationality policies in each country. Together with the systematic comparison these reports serve as the basis for a broad evaluation of Member States policies in this area and for policy recommendations addressed to both Member State governments and the EU. The main focus of the evaluative part is the contribution of policies concerning the access to citizenship and nationality (and multiple nationality) to the integration of immigrants. Special emphasis is laid on the interaction of nationality policies of the Member States and European Union Citizenship. Brief description of the project The core of the project systematically compares modes of acquisition and loss of nationality across Member States. Correspondents for each country have been asked to answer a detailed questionnaire on the legal framework and the practical implementation for acquisition and loss of nationality in their country and to write a report about the legal and political developments and public discourses with respect to nationality legislation since 1945, and 1985 in particular. The comparative analysis is based on these questionnaires and reports and also includes a chapter on major European trends of convergence and divergence in this policy field. Further chapters deals with current legal rules concerning the restriction of rights of certain groups of citizens, the specials statuses of 'denizenship' and 'quasi- citizenship' and a comparative analysis of statistics about acquisition and loss of nationality. To supplement the legal analysis with a view from practitioners, NGOs active in counselling immigrants have been asked to report on their experiences with naturalisation practices. The international dimension of nationality policies is reflected in a report about the relevance of public international law and European law for regulations of acquisition and loss of citizenship. The concluding chapter evaluates the Member States\u00bf nationality and citizenship policies with a view to their contribution to the integration of immigrants. Based on the results of the research, recommendations for policy development are made. Expected results (expected scientific and policy outcomes) The project is the first detailed comparative analysis of all modes of acquisition and loss of nationality in the old Member States. The comparative tools elaborated for the project allow a clear identification of convergences and divergences and can also be applied for further comparisons of nationality policies in other countries. Bridging the gap between legal and political analysis, the results of the project will help policy makers to base the development of nationality policies on objective scientific results. ",

Already in the '70, this weakness has been pointed out by international bodies like UNECE Geneva. Within EUROSTAT, this problem has been faced continuously starting in 1990 with the production of a first report on harmonisation of international migration statistics among the 12 EU member states. Intense co-operation has been thereafter developed between all concerned international bodies in order to improve the situation including the writing of updated UN recommendations for international migration statistics. Some improvements effectively occurred but the goal of producing a set of data with sufficient reliability and minimal harmonisation and comparability is not yet achieved and policymakers express more and more their strong needs for appropriate data. Concretely this project aims to develop additional efforts parallel to the forthcoming action plan for statistics on international migration. In order to reach this objective we intend to investigate with all 25 EU MS and Acceding Countries in several directions : 1\u00b0 to compare definitions and concepts related to international migration; 2\u00b0 to analyse available data in order to see what the data already reveals and where are the main problems in terms of reliability and comparability; 3\u00b0 to integrate data on asylum with data on flows and stocks in order to get the more reliable information on de facto international migration within each country; 4\u00b0 to describe and analyse all efforts done on bilateral and international levels in order to improve the situation and to identify impact of low reliability and lack of comparability on policy implementation; 5\u00b0 to propose practical recommendations on the way to improve the situation after discussion with all potential data providers and data users for migration policy develop.

The link between work and migration flows is at its heart: what knowledge such migrants have of their host labour markets, how they find work, what work they do, what transitions between different jobs and statuses take place and what impact their working arrangements and migration have more generally both in the host country and in their countries of origin. Recognising that gender, age and ethnicity are key factors in understanding migrant and refugee flows, UWT will analyse migration and work trajectories in a differentiated way to better understand the process. The ethical issues are considerable and the project will guarantee its interviewees complete anonymity while ensuring that researchers? personal safety is not compromised. Its purpose is to deepen understanding and awareness of contemporary migration flows and to present clear choices to policymakers, not to provide an assessment of the efficacy of policing. Our objectives are as follows: to give more reliable estimates of migration and refugee flows into the EU; to deepen understanding of the impact of migration flows on EU labour markets; to theorise the relationship between the presence of ?informal? or ?shadow? industry labour markets and migration flows; to map and model migrant and refugee pathways into and within the EU; to deepen knowledge of how legal status interacts with migrant labour market positions; to deepen understanding of the impact of migration flows on countries of origin; to test key theories concerning human capital and social capital in relation to migration; and to explore the particular consequences of migration for women workers, including trafficked workers.

Five to eight industrial sub- sectors will be selected on basis of data availability for comparative analysis, and the impact of tax reform designs in the six EU member states (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany and the UK) plus one accession state be considered. The world market conditions for the particular sectors will be studied carefully so as to identify different degrees of vulnerability. Short-run impacts will be examined via a conventional bottom-up modelling framework, while a more dynamic modelling framework based on the E3ME model of Cambridge Econometrics will be applied to examine both short and long run effects with particular emphasis on competitiveness. It captures inter-industry and other indirect effects, as well as those international competitiveness effects, which cannot be easily accounted for using the bottom-up approach. The goal is to compare short and long-term costs of environmental tax reform. The dynamics of employment, output, external trade and investment in capital and R&D will be tracked along various reform scenarios. A specific analysis of environmental decoupling and the possibility of carbon leakage is carried out. Finally mitigation practices are considered in light of both modelling results and the more qualitative insights provided by case studies on the specific tax reforms and on the world market conditions in specific sectors.

This work will provide an important input to policy evaluation, in particular for the assessment of the goals concerning competitiveness and economic growth potential as established by the Lisbon and Barcelona summit goals. The database should facilitate the sustainable production of high quality statistics using the methodologies of national accounts and input-output analysis. The input measures will include various categories of capital, labour, energy, material and service inputs. Productivity measures will be developed, in particular with growth accounting techniques. Several measures on knowledge creation will also be constructed. Substantial methodological and data research on these measures will be carried out to improve international comparability. There will be ample attention for the development of a flexible database structure, and for the progressive implementation of the database in official statistics over the course of the project. The database will be used for analytical and policy-related purposes, in particular by studying the relationship between skill formation, technological progress and innovation on the one hand, and productivity, on the other. To facilitate this type of analysis a link will also be sought with existing micro (firm level) databases. The balance in academic, statistical and policy input in this project is realised by the participation of 14 organisations from across the EU, representing a mix of academic institutions and national economic policy research institutes and with the support from various statistical offices and the OECD.

In particular, we will study the role played by the banking industry, the bond market, and the equity market for the transmission of shocks. A thor-ough assessment of the role played by Europe\u00bfs financial markets for the propagation of shocks requires that we study the links between financial market developments and real economic activity using a variety of tools. As regards the European banking industry, we will analyze both the extent to which the exposure of banking systems to risk changes in integrated markets and the extent to which international activities of banks transmit shocks across borders. This line of research may yield useful implications for national and supranational bank supervisors and regulators. In order to develop a deeper understanding of how the European bond markets work after the launching of the euro, we will utilize econometric frameworks that allow us to evaluate cross-country differences within EMU in absorbing and transmitting shocks when there is a the single centralized monetary policy. Hence, the results of the project may not only contain implications for the ECB as the Eurozone mone-tary authority, but also for national policy makers deciding on their respective fiscal policies. As regards Europe\u00bfs equity markets, our research project will shed light on the question of how strongly the increase in economic and financial market integration has affected the transmission of shocks across countries and how vulnerable European equity markets are to contagion effects. As evidenced by the recent turmoil in Asian financial markets, developing a better understanding of the causes and consequences of contagion effects is of utmost societal importance. As regards Europe\u00bfs bond markets, we will analyze the link between monetary policy, nominal and real interest rates, and the terms structure of interest rates. This analysis is part of our analysis of the links between financial market developments and real economy activity in the EU and will help assessing, for instance, how autonomous financial market shocks propagate through financial markets and how something that has begun as a purely fi-nancial shock eventually affects real economic activity. Because our research project covers the most important segments of European financial markets, our research will have a significant impact on a broad spectrum of policy issues. These include banking supervision and regu-lation, the promotion of bond market integration, and the establishment of equity market institutions that help providing firms and investors with a reliable and stable environment for their capital allocation decisions. We also address the appropriate design of monetary frameworks and responses to financial market shocks. In a nut-shell, our research project helps European policy makers to assess both the benefits that can be reaped when integrating Europe\u00bfs financial markets and the risks on which one should have a keen eye when taking the road to a unified Europe.

INTEREST aims to support Community policies by improving the interface between research and standardisation. Based on empirical analyses of the research-standardisation-relation, the project will develop best- practice guidelines for researchers, SDOs, and policy makers on how the knowledge transfer from research to standardisation should be supported, and accomplished, in different environments respective technologies. Brief description of the project Work will start with a literature survey on the interface between research and standardisation. Then, the rationales and incentives schemes that exist within the research communities and their contacts to standardisation bodies and industry will be collected through a survey-based study. This will also reveal problems and solutions regarding the interface between research and standardisation. Furthermore, following an indicator based approach, INTEREST will develop a matrix linking the technology base of companies (e.g. their patent portfolios) and their standardisation activities. Through case studies the project will analyse the internal organisational structure of the interface between research and the standards department within companies. Thus, solutions and organisational models can be identified suitable to support the transfer of research results into standards and to appropriate results from research institutions in order to transpose them into standards. In addition, the project will analyse the pros and cons of patent pools as a means to reduce complex IPR-related problems within standardisation processes. Based on these new insights, a taxonomy will be developed to characterise the typical relationships of the two dimensions. This taxonomy will be the basis to identify relevant combinations between R&D and standardisation and to develop specific policies. A final workshop with stakeholders will discuss and validate the results. Expected results (expected scientific and policy outcomes) INTEREST will generate a set of policy recommendations and guidelines how to improve the transfer of research results to standardisation processes in Europe. Furthermore, INTEREST will produce new scientific insights about the role of the institutional context for technology transfer activities via standardisation. Finally, first insights on combining research with standardisation indicators are expected, which may extend the traditional set of science and technology indicators used by the European Commission.

It has two main scientific and technological objectives. The first is to identify IPR-related policies which the European Commission, the EU and its member state governments, and candidate country governments might consider implementing in support of sustainable development in Europe and elsewhere. The second is to provide data and quantitative and qualitative analysis that are useful especially to EU candidate countries and also to developing countries seeking to take maximum advantage of the provisions of TRIPS in pursuit of their sustainable development objectives. To fulfil these objectives while taking best advantage of the advanced and varied expertise of the participants and their organisations, the research will be targeted at the following three areas: (i) promoting environmentally-sustainable development through the use of geographical indications; (ii) capacity building and technical assistance for policy coherence and sustainable development; and (iii) exploring the flexibilities of TRIPS Article 27.3(b) to maximise policy options in biotechnology and crop breeding by (a) stimulating innovation and technology transfer, and (b) facilitating the equitable sharing of benefits arising from the commercial use of biodiversity. The project will be coordinated by Queen Mary Intellectual Property Research Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, with the collaboration of Ecologic, Universidad de Alicante, IP Bulgaria, the Royal Institute of International Affairs and Warwick University. Effective coordination and implementation will be ensured by periodic meetings of consortium member representatives. Quality control will be guaranteed by establishing a review panel of experts and stakeholders. ",

The project will cover 30 European countries (the EU-15, the 10 acceding countries, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Romania, and Bulgaria) and six non-European countries (the US, Japan, India, China, Australia and Canada). The KEI project will review existing concepts and definitions of the knowledge-based economy and its key components. It will develop main thematic areas in relation to Lisbon and Barcelona objectives. KEI will then use these themes to classify existing indicators and thoroughly explore data and indicator quality issues. Gaps will be identified and the way forward will be mapped, identifying innovative approaches to improve our understanding and appraisal of the knowledge economy. Composite indicators will be analysed in detail using both statistical and participatory approaches, including the use of multi-criteria methods, aggregation and weighting techniques, decomposition methods, and an evaluation of analytical and presentational techniques. Simulation methods will be employed extensively to investigate the robustness of indicators and the conclusions based on them. The study will evaluate the quality and accuracy of indicators and the underlying data and assess the innovative use of additional information to improve indicator quality. The state of the art analysis, as provided by KEI for the knowledge- based economy, will benefit other policy objectives of the European Union and Commission Services. It will contribute to a methodological framework for building effective measurements of interdisciplinary issues such as sustainability, employment, social cohesion, and economic disparities. KEI will also make recommendations for the design and use of statistical reference systems. ",

To this end the research is concerned with: defining the policy `evaluation space\u00bf for sustainable regional development (SRD), and the validity, utility and application of evaluation tools designed to support SRD decision-making. The major outcome of the project will be the presentation of a 'nested' approach to evaluation, differentiating the policy choices and attendant requirement for normative analysis. The project builds on the recent EU thematic evaluation to develop methods for assessing the contribution of cohesion policies to SRD. This work developed the notion of regional development pathways, and applied the conceptual idea of sustainable development as non-declining capital stock (from which goods and services flow to meet development goals). Using this `capitals' model, trade-offs between different capitals (dimensions) were identified, using regional case studies, to understand the degree to which regions were pursuing a sustainable development path and the contribution of cohesion policies. The work will extend these cases to regions in the accession countries. At the same time the work will develop further the understanding of trade-offs, especially with social capital, and of critical thresholds. The work recognised but did not address the difficult task of weighting and aggregating different policy impacts defined in the context of measured trends and trade-offs. To address this weakness we propose to integrate recent progress in the use of deliberative tools, and particularly the 'deliberation matrix', to weight and aggregate different impacts, as presented in different scenarios of the future (thereby addressing uncertainty). These deliberative tools recognise the multi-stakeholder debate and seek to organise it in a structured and transparent way so as to articulate the necessary judgements. In developing an understanding of the requirements for decision-making for SRD, the work will also examine the influence of multi-level governance on the scope and nature of decision-making for SRD.

Task 4, to a better knowledge of the functioning and need for reform of the tax/benefit systems in the EU, and thereby contribute to the Lisbon process. The project tackles the current problems related to the faltering potential growth of the EU and the role of the tax/benefit systems in this process. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide policy options to improve the potential growth of the EU and attainment of a high level of employment, taking into account the challenges from enlargement and the environmental aspirations adopted in the EU. The extensive use of numerical general equilibrium models and econometric estimations will permit the evaluation of the impact of the existing different tax/benefits systems and will yield policy options that can be quantified and adapted to different political constraints. Brief description of the project The project aims to analyse and make contributions in five areas relevant to the tax/benefit systems: 1) The link between tax/benefit systems and employment in the EU 2) The EU tax systems under tax competition and enlargement 3) The growth potential of the EU and its relation to the tax/benefit systems 4) The macroeconomic role of tax systems in promoting reforms in tax systems in the EU under the single monetary policy 5) Attainment of sustainable growth in the EU with a high quality of the environment and the role of green taxes and emission trading in the energy sector. The project combines the contributions of seven leading European economic policy research institutes, most of which are already collaborating in an existing network (ENEPRI). Dissemination of the results to the public and policy makers is ensured by this existing network and a final high level conference in the heart of the EU. The project will deliver 16 working papers, a final report and organises 7 workshops. Expected results (expected scientific and policy outcomes) The project aims to contribute to the analysis of tax and benefit systems both in terms of scientific research and in terms of policy-orientated research, which should yield relevant results for policy making in the various EU member countries, and at the Union level as a whole. Thereby, the goal is to promote discussion on the Lisbon agenda in terms of growth, employment and sustainable development, and to identify the effects of the various policy measures in tax/benefit systems for these goals of the EU. The project also seeks to evaluate the trade-offs and constraints existing in the process to improve the economic performance of the EU. ",
