The Stabilisation and Association Process is the Union policy framework for the Western Balkans. It is based on progressive partnership, in which the Union offers trade concessions, economic and financial assistance and contractual relationships through stabilisation and association agree \u00ad ments. Pre-accession financial assistance helps pre-accession countries and bene \u00ad ficiaries prepare for the obligations and challenges of Union membership. Such assistance supports the reform process, including preparations for eventual membership. It focuses on institution-building, alignment with the acquis of the Union, preparation for Union policies and instruments and promotion of measures to achieve economic convergence. \u25bc B EIB activity in Neighbourhood countries takes place in the framework of the new European Neighbourhood Policy set out in the Joint Communication entitled \u2018A new response to a changing Neighbourhood\u2019, adopted by the High Representa \u00ad tive of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission on 25 May 2011, and the Council conclusions adopted on 20 June 2011, which calls notably for greater support to partners committed to building democratic societies and undertaking reforms, in line with the \u2018more for more\u2019 and \u2018mutual account \u00ad ability\u2019 principles, and provides the strategic policy framework for the Union relations with the neighbours. In the framework of this cooperation, EIB financing under this Decision will also be targeted at policies promoting inclusive growth and job creation contributing to social stability in line with an incentive-based approach supporting Union external policy objectives, including in relation to migration issues. In order to achieve these objectives the Union and its partners implement jointly agreed bilateral action plans defining a set of priorities including on political and security issues, trade and economic matters, environmental and social concerns and integration of transport and energy networks. The Union for the Mediterranean, the Eastern Partnership, the Black Sea Synergy, the Union Strategy for the Danube Region and the Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region are multilateral and regional initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation between the Union and the respective group of Neigh \u00ad bourhood partner countries facing common challenges and/or sharing a common geographical environment. The Union for the Mediterranean aims to relaunch the Euro-Mediterranean integration process by supporting mutual economic, social and environmental development on both sides of the Medi \u00ad terranean and supports improved socioeconomic development, solidarity, regional integration, sustainable development and knowledge building, under \u00ad lining the need to increase financial cooperation to support regional and trans- national projects. The Union for the Mediterranean supports, in particular, the creation of maritime and land highways, the de-pollution of the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean solar energy plan, the Mediterranean Business Development Initiative, civil protection initiatives and the Euro-Mediterranean university. The Eastern Partnership aims to create the necessary conditions to accelerate political association and further economic integration between the Union and Eastern partner countries. The Eastern Partnership will provide additional impetus to the economic and social and regional development of the partner countries. It will facilitate good governance, including in the financial sector, promote regional development and social cohesion and help to reduce partner countries' socioeconomic disparities. \u25bc B ",

The Union Strategy for the Danube Region supports, in particular, the development of transport, energy connections and security, sustainable environment and socioeconomic development in the Danube region. The Eastern Partnership aims to create the necessary conditions to accelerate political association and further economic integration between the Union and Eastern partner countries. Russia and the Union have a wide-ranging strategic partnership, distinct from the European Neighbourhood Policy and expressed through the Common Spaces and Roadmaps. These are complemented at multilateral level by the Northern Dimension which provides a framework for cooperation between the Union, Russia, Norway and Iceland (Belarus, Canada and the United States are observers to the Northern Dimension). EIB activity in Latin America takes place in the framework of the Union, Latin America and the Caribbean Strategic Partnership. As highlighted in the 30 September 2009 Commission Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council entitled \u2018The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership\u2019, the Union's priorities in the field of cooperation towards Latin America are the promotion of regional integration and the eradication of poverty and social inequality in order to promote sustainable economic and social development. These policy objectives will be fostered taking into account the different level of development of Latin American countries. Bilateral dialogue and cooperation will be pursued in areas of common interest for both regions, including environment, climate change, disaster risk reduction and energy, science, research, higher education, technology and innovation. In Asia, the Union is deepening its strategic partnerships with China and India and negotiations are progressing on new partnership and free trade agreements with South-East Asian countries. At the same time, development cooperation remains high on the Union's agenda with Asia; the Union development strategy for the Asian region aims at eradicating poverty by supporting broad- based sustainable economic growth, promoting a conducive environment and conditions for trade and integration within the region, enhancing governance, increasing political and social stability, and supporting the achievement of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. Policies are being put in place jointly to address common challenges, such as climate change, sustainable development, security and stability, governance and human rights, as well as the prevention of, and response to, natural and humanitarian disasters. The Union Strategy for a new partnership with Central Asia adopted by the European Council of 21-22 June 2007 has strengthened regional and bilateral dialogue and Union cooperation with Central Asian countries on major issues facing the region, such as poverty reduction, sustainable development and stability. The implementation of the strategy has brought about important advances in the fields of human rights, the rule of law, good governance and democracy, education, economic development, trade and investment, energy and transport and environmental policies. EIB activity in South Africa takes place in the framework of the Joint EU Country Strategy Paper for South Africa. The main focal areas identified in that Strategy Paper are employment creation and capacity development for service delivery and social cohesion. EIB activities in South Africa have taken place in high complementarity with the Union development cooperation programme, namely through the EIB focus on private sector support and investments in expansion of infrastructure and social services (housing, electric power, drinking water purification and municipal infrastructure).

For the period 2014-20, EIB activity is expected to support in a complementary fashion Union external co \u00ad operation policies, programmes and instruments by continuing to focus on key EU-South Africa priorities in order to promote equitable and sustainable economic growth, contribute to employment creation and capacity development, and support the sustainable provision and equitable access to basic infrastructure and services. \u25bc B "
