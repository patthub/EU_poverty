        "EUROPEAN COMMISSION Directorate-General for TRADE Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment June 2017 Annex A: Technical Annex for economic modelling In this annex we provide an overview of the modelling exercise summarized in the main body of the report. This involves two primary steps. The first is the development of a structural computational model of production and trade, where the parameterization of the model, including trade parameters and policy shocks, is based on econometric estimates. The second is the specification if the experiment itself. A.1. The quantitative model of production and trade We employ the general equilibrium model with multiple countries, multiple sectors, intermediate linkages and multiple factors of production, as developed in Bekkers et al (2013). Trade is modelled as in Eaton and Kortum (2002) with the remaining structure of the model largely following the GTAP model (Hertel, 2013). The main difference from GTAP is the incorporation of an Eaton and Kortum structure, where we follow Bekkers at al (2016) in terms of implementation. We also derive the gravity equation for structural estimation of the trade elasticities and changes in trade costs from this model. The model set-up and calibration combine features of the older computable general equilibrium (CGE) models (cf. Dixon and Jorgenson, 2013), with the micro- foundations of the more recent quantitative trade models (see Costinot and Rodr\u00edguez-Clare, 2013, for an overview). This means we model trade linkages with the improved micro-founded Eaton and Kortum (2002) structure, and that we have structurally estimated the trade parameters and relevant trade cost changes employing a gravity model derived from the theoretical model. In the computational model, the \u201cwhole\u201d economy, for the relevant aggregation of economic agents, is modelled simultaneously. This means that the entire economy is classified into production and consumption sectors. These sectors are then modelled collectively. Production sectors are explicitly linked together in value-added chains from primary goods, through higher stages of processing, to the final assembly of consumption goods for households and governments. These links span borders as well as industries. The link between sectors is both direct, such as the input of steel into the production of transport equipment, and also indirect, as with the link between chemicals and agriculture through the production of fertilizers and pesticides. Sectors are also linked through their competition for resources in primary factor markets (capital, labour, and land). The data structure of the model follows the GTAP database structure, and basic models of this class are implemented in either the GEMPACK or GAMS software package (Horridge et al 2013; Hertel 1997, 2013). At its core, the GTAP database is a multi-region input output (MRIO) database supplemented with data on taxes and emissions, and organized as a form of balanced social accounting matrix. We work here with a GEMPACK implementation of our model. To fit our global data to the theoretical model, following Egger and Nigai (2015) and Bekkers et al (2015), total trade costs and technology parameters are fit from actual import shares (calibration), imposing an exact. Changes in trade costs (the CGE experiments themselves) follow from gravity-based estimates of trade costs as discussed below, where the gravity specification is based on the Eaton-Kortum theoretical framework for trade and production.

        "Trade SIA in support of negotiations on a plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) 8 June 2017 Figure A.1 Production Structure Figure A.2 Consumption Structure The general conceptual structure of a regional economy in the model is detailed in Figures A-1 and A-2 above. On the production side, firms produce output, employing land, labour, capital, and natural resources and combine these with intermediate inputs, within each region/country. In technical firms, we model a combination of value added and intermediate inputs, where intermediates (both imported and domestic) are combined in fixed proportions along with value added (known as a Leontief function). Value added itself (labour, capital, etc.) involves what is known as a CES functional form. Firm output is then purchased by consumers, government, the investment sector, and by other firms, and detailed in Figure A-2. Firm output can be and is also sold for export. In the model, arable land is only employed in the agricultural sectors, while capital and labour (both skilled and unskilled) are mobile between all production sectors. While capital is assumed to be fully mobile within regions, land, labour and natural resources are not.

This is based on the GTAP9 database (Aguiar et al 2016). These data are projected from the year to 2011 to 2025 based on short-run projections by the IMF on changes in the trade balance and GDP, long run projections for GDP growth from the OECD, and population and labour supply projections from the UN. Details on projected values are reported in Table A-2. In Projecting GDP levels (on a PPP level) to 2025, we also implement within the model a number of recent signed agreements. This includes TPP, EU-Singapore, EU-Canada, and EU-Korea. Where these agreements include services bindings, they are modelled as explained below for our experiment design. The projection provides the baseline on which experiments are then run. The underlying macroeconomic projection data are summarized in Table A-2. In the experiments themselves, we follow the literature and employ recursive dynamics 1 to link changes in investment expenditure to changes in capital stocks. This involves a fixed savings rate, with changes in savings following from changes in income levels. This change is then transmitted into investment and hence into 1 Both recursive dynamics and forward looking dynamics are \u201cfull dynamics.\u201d Evidence from behavioural economics is that savings behviour tends to be sticky, and so recursive dynamics is preferred. Indeed, the dynamic specification employed here is likt that employed in projection-based climate modelling. ",

A.2. Services Trade Costs and the Experiments A.2.1 Background In the present application, we are interested in reductions in trade costs. In particular, we are interested in trade costs related to policy uncertainty due to binding overhang, or the gap between bound commitments and actual applied policy. Binding overhang is a well-documented challenge ",
        "EUROPEAN COMMISSION Directorate-General for TRADE Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment June 2017 to the WTO system for both goods (Blackhurst et al 1996, Francois and Martin 2003) and for services (Hoekman 1996; Borchert, Gootiiz and Mattoo 2011). Based on bindings for goods, we have evidence that binding overhang is itself a barrier to investment. This includes Handley (2014). In the case of services, there is a substantial gap between commitments made both in the GATS and in regional agreements compared to actual policy, as discussed below. Discussion on options on how to fix this gap between actual market access and bound commitments under the GATS began even before the Uruguay Round Agreements were signed (see Sauv\u00e9 1995; Hoekman 1996). Based on the economic literature on policy uncertainty as discussed below, we can state that there are valid reasons to expect that policy uncertainty may itself suppress general macroeconomic conditions, including the incentives for international trade. The basic logic is that investors are in reality averse to risk. As such, increased risk, including from policy uncertainty, reduces the willingness of investors to commit resources. The end result is that, like a tax on investment returns, uncertainty about market conditions can drive reallocation of resources to other sectors. Indeed, while for this study we focus on the relatively narrow question of uncertainty linked to guaranteed conditions for market access in services, the linkages between macroeconomic conditions and trade barriers are deeper, and include both tariff and non-tariff measures. For example, Rodrik (1992, 1993), Francois (1996) and Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2015) all emphasize macroeconomic effects (e.g. the impact on incentives for investment) from policy uncertainty, while Francois and Martin (1997, 2004) and Handley (2014) focus specifically on the benefits of tariff bindings. In the context of, policy commitments and investor protection, increased certainty of commitments can be seen as beneficial on several levels (again see Rodrik 1992). Examples include both the Eastern Enlargement of the EU, and Mexico\u2019s simultaneous joining of the GATT and NAFTA as signalling of commitments to more stable policy regimes (see the discussion in Baldwin et al 1997; Francois 1997). In the context of the WTO, developing countries were given negotiating credit in the Uruguay Round specifically for entering ceiling bindings on tariffs even when those were well above applied rates (Blackhurst 1996), again signalling that WTO Members value bindings. The same concept of credit for bindings, even when applied policies do not actually have to change, was also contemplated for the Doha Round (Francois and Martin 2003). In the context of services commitments in the GATS, gaps between bound and applied rates are the norm rather than the exception (Hoekman 1996; Borchert, Gootiiz and Mattoo 2011, 2014). \u201cGATS\u2019 structure allows Members not to bind the status quo in many sectors\u2026 The fundamental question is whether GATS will induce Members to go further in future negotiating rounds.\u201d (Hoekman 1996 p. 117). Based on the assessment of Borchert, Gootiiz and Mattoo 2011, tabled commitments under the Doha agenda did not represent any real substantive change in this situation. A.2.2. The Basic Approach The approach we follow here is to estimate a reduced form of trade cost following from the gap between bound policy commitments under the GATS and actual applied policy, using a gravity model. In essence, using our measure of the gap between bound market access and actual market access as a metric for sector-specific policy uncertainty linked to market access (i.e. how secure are current market access conditions) we estimate the iceberg trade cost necessary to yield the same identified impact on trade from this uncertainty. 2 The gravity equation itself follows from a range of standard models (including the EK framework). For bilateral trade in services, we have estimated a gravity equation using Poisson quasi-maximum likelihood (so allowing for zeroes in trade). This means we model bilateral trade in services as taking the following basic form: (1) E v i , j , t X \uf028 \uf029 \uf03d e \uf0a2 \uf071 X where 2 As discussed in the previous subsection, uncertainty can induce risk averse agents to reallocate resources to less risky alternatives. In this sense, policy uncertainty at sector level effectively like a dead-weight taxt hat induces a shift in resources. In the present context, as the policy uncertainty we are interested in is market access related, we use a gravity model to quantify the impact on trade flows. ",

The time varying importer and exporter fixed effects capture annual supply and demand related variables that are country specific. These variables are all discussed in more detail in the next subsection. A.2.3 Source Data and Regression Results Our data come from a number of sources. Trade data come from an updated version of the Trade in Services Database available from the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org/data- catalog/trade-in-services). Pairwise variables also come from a number of sources. Distance comes from the CEPII database, as do several other pairwise variables pertaining to colonial history, common border, etc. (Mayer and Zignago 2006). For services trade policy, we require a measure of both bindings and applied rates. The OECD has recently released its services trade restriction index for 40 countries (Geloso Grosso, M., et al. 2015), while the World Bank has conducted a similar exercise for 103 countries. Both STRIs provide valuable information linking regulation (inherently qualitative) to quantitative market access measures. In both cases, regulatory data are used to assign scores indicating relative degrees of impact on openness. This may include for example ownership share restrictions when establishing an affiliate operation, or limits on the right to provide professional services based on nationality. In the case of World Bank data, such scoring of regulatory measures is then classified based on GATS modes. These scopes are then combined to yield STRIs by mode, and then also overall. (See Borchert, Gootiiz and Mattoo 2011, 2014 for technical details. Further documentation and the underlying regulatory data are available online: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/services-trade-restrictions). The OECD indexes are not organized strictly by GATS mode. Rather, they are organised based on the nature of restrictions: FDI restrictions; mobility of persons restrictions; other discriminatory measures; barriers to competition; and regulatory transparency. While the emphasis of the World Bank database is on market access (i.e. discriminatory measures), the OECD data includes not only measures that discriminatory, but also measures that impact on performance of domestic and foreign firms alike. In this sense, they blend market access and overall regulatory efficiency concepts. (The OECD data and background documentation are also available on line: http://www.oecd.org/tad/services-trade/services-trade-restrictiveness-index.htm.). In addition to scoring the level of market access commitments in the GATS, the World Bank has also produced a separate breakdown of applied policies vs GATS commitments for the 103 countries in the database (Borchert, Gootiiz and Mattoo 2011). These data have been published for overall STRI levels at sector level, and not by mode. Just recently, the OECD has released a preliminary version of its own data from similar an exercise for the OECD countries (Miroudot and Pertel 2015). As part of the same project, the World Bank has also released recent estimates of trade costs (both as an extended World Bank working paper and as a refereed journal paper). These trade costs are expressed as tariff equivalents, for all 103 countries in the database (Jafari and Tarr 2014, 2015). They are trade costs for applied market access policy. In other words, they are estimates of the costs of restrictions on market access for services, as a percent of the cost of delivery of services. As Jafari and Tarr note, there are two approaches followed in the literature when estimating AVEs for services. The first is the gravity approach to AVE estimation, which has been employed for example by Francois (1999), Walsh (2006), Francois et al., (2007) and Kimura and Lee (2004). While this approach allows for estimation of overall levels of trade costs, it fails to link these to specific sets of policies and regulations. The second approach, pioneered by the Australian Productivity Commission, involves linking underlying regulatory measures to evidence on pricing and general market access. This second approach is the one followed for the World Bank estimates. Basically, the World Bank AVE estimates follow from the underlying regulatory data that form the basis for the World Bank indexes, which are processed using updates to the methodologies employed for the Productivity Commission based estimates. The end result is AVEs that reflect the underlying structure of regulation. It should be stressed that because the data used to estimate the AVEs only provide information on discriminatory barriers, the estimates of the AVEs themselves are also strictly for discriminatory barriers. They do not reflect costs faced by foreign firms because of regulatory inefficiency (i.e. regulatory costs that also affect domestic firms). This means that we are modelling specifically changes in bindings applied against discriminatory policies only. ",
        "EUROPEAN COMMISSION Directorate-General for TRADE Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment June 2017 In estimating equations (1) and (2), we employ a methodology as spelled out in Anderson et al (2008), where the gravity equation itself is derived from our structural model (Bekkers et al 2016). Note that importer fixed effects will capture average or MFN levels of market access. At the same time, as we are able to distinguish between intra-EU and extra-EU market access, we have a measure of the margin of preference afforded to EU Members States to other EU Member States. This is measured as the difference from the average or MFN rate of protection captured by importer fixed effects. As this difference has the same coefficient as the MFN rate, and is the price elasticity (with AVEs) or STRI elasticity, it can be used when estimating the value of the price coefficient. (This same approach is followed in CEPR 2009 and Egger et al 2015 for estimation of tariff elasticities). We include two measures of trade restrictions for this purpose. Both of these are based on differences between external (MFN) and internal (intra-EU) market access measures. On a technical level, if we start from World Bank STRI estimates for the EU Member States, the World Bank indexes are actually based an average of inter-EU and extra-EU market access. For example, in scoring policies for the STRI, if there are ownership restrictions for foreign accounting firms but not firms from EU Member States ones, this means a sub-index for intra-EU of 0 and extra-EU of 100 for ownership restrictions. The average (a blend of intra-EU and extra-EU policy) is then 50. The overall STRI indexes are then built up from these blended indexes in the original World Bank STRI data. To arrive at distinct intra-EU and extra-EU indexes for applied policy, we have gone through the underlying regulation database matched to individual regulation scores used to construct overall STRI values by sector for individual EU Member States. These have been rescored twice. Once for extra-EU market access, and the other to intra-EU market access (i.e. access by firms from other Member States). Once this is done for STRI sub indexes, we have then rebuilt from the bottom up, using the World Bank\u2019s weighing scheme, overall STRI indexes. We then have two sets of indexes. One applies to intra-EU actual market access, and the other to extra-EU actual market access. Since WTO commitments involve commitments on extra-EU market access, to examine the impact of overhang we focus on the difference between extra-EU actual market access, and the STRI values for GATS commitments, both measured in terms of STRI values. In Table A.3, we compare the original blended STRI values for the EU (an average across Member States) with the extra-EU values, based on the procedure outlined above. Once we have these indexes, we then have our basis for measuring market access in two ways. One is the difference between the STRI indexes for intra-EU and extra-EU market access as described above. The other is to use the relative difference to rescale the World Bank AVEs (based on the STRI data also as described above) to arrive at estimated intra-EU and extra-EU AVEs. For example, if the extra-EU STRI is twice the intra-EU STRI, this means the extra-EU AVE is then also scaled at twice the intra-EU AVE. In this second case, the coefficient applied to the AVE margin is theoretically identical to the price elasticity for services, just as it is when working with tariff data for goods. (Again, see for example Egger et al 2015; ECORYS 2009 for examples in the case of goods). As a robustness check, in addition to the regressions based on AVEs, we also carry out the same regression using the difference in the intra-EU vs. extra-EU value for the STRI itself (the index of trade restrictions). Critically, also based on the World Bank data, we include the difference between bound market access commitments and actual applied policy, again from the World Bank STRI data. Here we treat intra-EU market access as bound at applied rates (based on EU policy related to the single market), and extra-EU market access as bound based on GATS bindings. Again the average value is captured by importer fixed effects, while we obtain pairwise variation based on intra-EU and extra-EU levels of bindings relative to actual market access, based on the World Bank data as discussed above. 3 Table A.3 Original STRI values and extra-EU values for actual market access in EU Sector Original STRI External STRI Overall 17.97 25.25 Financial 4.36 8.71 Banking 1.82 3.75 Lending by banks 1.82 3.63 Acceptance of deposits by banks 1.82 3.63 Insurance 8.38 16.50 3 As a robustness check, we also included various pairwise dummies for other PTAs, but the EU is the only one for which we identify significant differences in market access linked to PTAs and customs unions for services. Therefore the specification reported here includes only the EU trade effects. ",

The first specification is based on the AVEs for trade costs in services from Jafari and Tarr (2015) while the second instead uses the STRI indexes themselves. Both specifications have the same overall fit, with the model explaining roughly 86 percent of the sample variation in bilateral services trade, based on the pseudo R-squared statistic. Both the AVE and STRI coefficients are statistically significant. Our interpretation is that the AVE estimates provide the same overall fit as the underlying STRI data. The AVE coefficient is -4.775, and can be interpreted as the trade price elasticity. While it has different interpretations depending on the underlying model for the gravity equation (Armington, EK, etc.), the estimated value of this coefficient is in line with trade elasticity estimates for goods. Finally, the overhang coefficient is a semi-elasticity, where each index point change in binding overhang based on the STRI values implies a -.006 percent change in the log value of trade. These can be interpreted as follows. Assume we have a 15 point difference between the bound and applied STRI values. We would like to know how the estimated trade volume effect from this gap compares to the impact of applied trade restrictions, as a trade cost equivalent. Basically, this means we want to know the log AVE equivalent such that the log volume effect from the overhang Gj should equal the log volume effect from the log AVE equivalent . This involves a two-step calculation. The overhang coefficient identifies the change in the log of trade (or the percent change in trade) when the overhang itself changes (measured in units of the STRI). This is a measure in volume terms. What we need to do is use this to identify the corresponding trade cost, given our price elasticity, consistent with this change in volumes. To do this, note that the price coefficient (from the AVE term) gives us the change in the log of trade (or the percent change in trade) when the AVE is increased by a certain amount. Taken together, these two coefficients let us determine the additional trade cost (as an AVE) needed to give us the same volume effect as we get from change in overhang. (3) ",
        "EUROPEAN COMMISSION Directorate-General for TRADE Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment June 2017 Rearranging equation 3, we can obtain the AVE itself for our example.

In other words, bringing the bindings in line with actual market access (binding at current market access) yields estimated trade volume effects in this case comparable to a 1.9% reduction in trade costs, measured as a share of the cost of exports.

A.2.4 Specifying the Experiments Figure A-3 below presents an overview of overall bound and applied STRI levels, based on the World Bank dataset. From the figure, it can be seen that we generally have a gap across all income ranges in GATS commitments vis-\u00e0-vis actual bindings. For the purpose of assessing the TiSA, we will therefore focus on defining experiments where the GATS commitments are replaced by commitments at current levels of market access. ",

We define our experiments as spelled out in the Table below. In the first experiment, we assume that core TiSA participants agree to enter bindings at the current level of market access. This is the modest scenario. In the ambitious scenario, we also assume that China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand also join TiSA. Table A.5 Experiments Baseline scenario In the baseline, we projected data up to 2025 We include all PTAs that have been concluded and those for which negotiations are finalised and for which texts are public. So this includes for example TPP and CETA, but excludes TTIP. The full list of PTAs is presented in the table below. For these PTAs we will assume that they will have achieved a binding of policies at current levels of market access for all sectors (except public services and air transport). Experiment A: Core TiSA countries commit to binding policies at current level of market access for all services sectors, where we assume that 90% of the trade costs related to binding will be achieved (to take into account exceptions). There are exceptions for two sectors: \uf0b7 For public services, we do not model any changes in binding overhang, as the negotiations do not address most of the services included in this sector; \uf0b7 For air transport, relevant activities which are likely to be affected are under other sectors in GTAP, while activities under GTAP\u2019s air transport will not be affected directly by negotiations hence we do not model any changes in binding overhang for this sector. The binding of policies at current level of market access will only apply to those country pairs that do not have a PTA in place. For country pairs with a PTA in place, we assume that TiSA will not bring further bindings, and no reductions in trade costs will be modelled. For an overview of country pairs with a PTA in place, see Annex A. Experiment B: Core TiSA countries commit to binding policies at current level of market access, with the same assumptions and exceptions as under experiment A. China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand also join TiSA. These countries commit to binding policies at current level of market access, with the same assumptions and exceptions as the core participants. ",

        "Trade SIA in support of negotiations on a plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) 18 June 2017 We have run and reported regressions in the previous section for total services trade. The reason is not lack of STRI data, but lack of sufficient coverage for bilateral services trade data at the very detailed sector level. The strategy we follow is to use the coefficient estimates for the price and binding overhang terms in Table A-3 above, and estimate AVEs for binding at actual policy at the sector level. In other words, we use the estimate of the general or overall coefficient estimates and apply them to the sector STRI data. From the World Bank, we actually have overall STRI values (all modes combined) for applied and bound estimates for the following sectors: Accounting; Legal services; Air transport; Maritime Transport; Rail Transport; Road Transport; Banking; Insurance; Fixed Line Communications; Mobile Line Communications; Trade (Retail); and Total services. We can map these data directly to most of our model sectors. However, for ICT, construction, and personal services, we do not have a direct analogue and so work with weight average values for commercial services (the sectors above) excluding transport related services (Air transport; Maritime Transport; Rail Transport; Road Transport). 4 In addition, some TiSA countries are missing from the STRI database, and in these cases we employ representative countries. 5 The EU values are an average of individual MS values. Tables A.7 and A.8 below summarizes, for total trade in services, the values of trade cost reductions linked to moving bindings to actual market access levels, on the basis of STRI values and coefficients in Table A-3. These are to be interpreted as eliminating a trade cost expressed as a % of the cost of exporting services, and not as an estimate of total underlying trade costs. (Again, these are averages for all services, while the experiments involve application of trade cost reductions for detailed sectors as specified in the model.) Table A-7 presents estimated trade costs reduction equivalents by sector, measured as percentage point trade costs as a percent share of the cost of producing services for sale in a destination market, for binding at current actual market access levels, based on World Bank index data on bindings and actual policy. In other words, these represent potential cost savings, scaled as a percent of the current value of services traded. Note that the other commercial services rate is applied to sectors in the CGE model not identified separately in the World Bank STRI data as noted earlier in the previous paragraph. Table A.7 Estimated trade cost savings (total services EBOPS 200) tariff equivalent from eliminating binding overhang, value expressed as a % of the cost of exporting services Bound STRI Applied STRI AVE: estimated cost savings (see text) Australia 0.46 0.22 2.99 Canada 0.53 0.26 3.51 Chile 0.73 0.25 6.15 Chinese Taiwan 0.62 0.33 3.70 Colombia 0.81 0.27 7.04 Costa Rica 0.95 0.49 5.93 European Union 0.55 0.25 3.76 Hong Kong 0.46 0.22 2.99 Israel 0.55 0.25 3.76 Japan 0.57 0.33 3.05 Korea 0.62 0.33 3.70 Mauritius 0.76 0.23 6.84 Mexico 0.70 0.40 3.89 4 We also explored using OECD STRI data for some of these other sectors, and have gone as far as matching countries to cover TiSA countries not in the OECD data. However, the OECD indexes mix market access and domestic regulation, as discusssed above. In addition, we do not have final(public) bindings STRIs from the OECD, nor a basis from the underlying regulatory data to identify intra-EU and extra-EU variations in market access. For this reason, we have used this the average of all commercial service sectors for which we have data. 5 Austria is used for Switzerland and Lichtenstein. Austria, Denmark, and Sweden are used for Iceland and Norway. Australia is used for Hong Kong. The EU average is used for Israel. ",

For each indicator, we present two liberalisation scenarios: \uf0b7 Scenario A assumes that TiSA will lead to binding currently applied policies, thus reducing binding overhang; \uf0b7 Scenario B assumes that in addition to scenario A a number of Asian countries will also join TiSA: China, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. The results presented here are the estimated changes compared to the baseline situation. In this baseline we have projected GDP levels (on a PPP level) to 2025, and also implemented within the model a number of recent signed agreements. For more details on the scenarios, see Annex A.

The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and must involve something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship. Health insurance is often an integral part of a country\u2019s health system, as part of social security provided or arranged for by the Government. In some countries (e.g. the UK), health care is universally provided by the Government, in other countries (e.g. the Netherlands) taking out private healthcare (above a certain income) is compulsory. Life insurance differs from other types of insurance (non- life) mainly in terms of risk (death is inevitable), tenure (long terms), insurable interest, payment of premium, and indemnity of loss. Non-life insurance services Re-insurance Reinsurance and retrocession Reinsurance, also known as insurance for insurers or stop- loss insurance, is the practice of insurers transferring portions of risk portfolios to other parties by some form of agreement to reduce the likelihood of having to pay a large obligation resulting from an insurance claim. The party that diversifies its insurance portfolio is known as the ceding party. The party that accepts a portion of the potential ",

Retrocession is the practice of one reinsurance company providing services to another by insuring the activities of another reinsurance company. This is done by accepting business that the other company had agreed to underwrite. Retrocession can refer to the process of differentiating or diversifying assets by consolidating and then subdividing them among a number of stakeholders. Auxiliary services Services auxiliary to insurance Services auxiliary to insurance include mainly broking and agency services. Banking and other financial services Investment funds Traditional investment managers The professional asset management of various securities (shares, bonds and other securities) and other assets (e.g., real estate) in order to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of the investors. Investors may be institutions (insurance companies, pension funds, corporations, charities, educational establishments etc.) or private investors (both directly via investment contracts and more commonly via collective investment schemes e.g. mutual funds or exchange-traded funds). Hedge funds An investment fund administered by a professional management firm, and often structured as a limited partnership, limited liability company, or similar vehicle. Hedge funds are generally distinct from mutual funds as their use of leverage is not capped by regulators and from private equity funds as the majority of hedge funds invest in relatively liquid assets. Private equity companies Consists of equity, securities and debt in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange. A private equity investment will generally be made by a private equity firm, a venture capital firm or an angel investor. While each of these type of investor will have its own set of goals, preferences and investment strategies, all provide working capital to a target company to nurture expansion, new-product development, or restructuring of the company\u2019s operations, management, or ownership. Real estate investors Involves the purchase, ownership, management, rental and/or sale of real estate for profit. Real estate has traditionally outperformed the Wall Street equity market. A street by street knowledge of the market make it perfect for small savvy investors. Large institutions lag behind trends. Improvement of realty property as part of a real estate investment strategy is generally considered to be a sub- specialty of real estate investing called real estate development. Real estate is an asset form with limited liquidity relative to other investments, it is also capital intensive (although capital may be gained through mortgage leverage) and is highly cash flow dependent. Monetary and financial Retail banks Execute transactions directly with consumers, rather than corporations or other banks. Services offered include savings and transactional accounts, mortgages, personal ",
        "Trade SIA in support of negotiations on a plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) 128 June 2017 Category Service providers Services institutions (MFI) loans, debit cards, and credit cards. The term is generally used to distinguish these banking services from investment banking, commercial banking or wholesale banking. It may also be used to refer to a division of a bank dealing with retail customers and can also be termed as Personal Banking services. Wholesale banks Provide services to organisations such as Mortgage Brokers, large corporate clients, mid-sized companies, real estate developers and investors, international trade finance businesses, institutional customers (such as pension funds and government entities/agencies), and services offered to other banks or other financial institutions. (Wholesale finance means financial services, which are conducted between financial services companies and institutions such as banks, insurers, fund managers, and stockbrokers.) Commercial banks Provide services such as accepting deposits, making business loans, and offering basic investment products. It can also refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses. Investment banks Assists individuals, corporations, and governments in raising capital by underwriting or acting as the client's agent in the issuance of securities (or both). An investment bank may also assist companies involved in mergers and acquisitions and provide ancillary services such as market making, trading of derivatives and equity securities, and FICC services (fixed income instruments, currencies, and commodities). Private banks & wealth managers Wealth management as an investment-advisory discipline incorporates financial planning, investment portfolio management and a number of aggregated financial services. High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), small- business owners and families who desire the assistance of a credentialed financial advisory specialist call upon wealth managers to coordinate retail banking, estate planning, legal resources, tax professionals and investment management. Private banking includes banking, investment and other financial services provided by banks to private individuals who enjoy high levels of income or invest sizable assets. Private banking forms a more exclusive subset of wealth management. Money market funds (MMFs)* A MMF is an investment whose objective is to earn interest for shareholders while offering a certain net asset value (NAV) per share. A money market fund\u2019s portfolio is comprised of short-term, or less than one year, securities representing high-quality, liquid debt and monetary instruments. Investors can purchase shares of money market funds through mutual funds, brokerage firms and banks. MMFs are an important source of short-term financing for companies and government entities. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of negotiations on a plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) June 2017 129 Category Service providers Services There are currently two kinds of MMFs: - those that offer a variable net asset value (VNAV) that mainly depends on market fluctuations; - those that offer a constant net asset value (CNAV) and aim to offer share purchases and redemptions for a fixed price. MMFs are mainly used to invest excess cash within short timeframes. They represent an important tool for investors because they offer the possibility to diversify their excess cash holdings, whilst maintaining a high level of liquidity. Securitisation Securitisation is the process of pooling together a large number of loans (such as mortgages, auto loans or SME loans) held on the balance sheet of a bank or other financial institution (the Originator) and selling them to a newly created and legally separate entity (the Issuer). This entity finances the purchase of the loans by issuing bonds to investors. The loans generate cash flows (for example, monthly mortgage payments from homeowners), which are used to repay the investors. In this way, loans which would otherwise be illiquid can be converted into more liquid and tradeable securities. 7 Financial vehicle corporations (FVC) An FVC is an entity whose principal activity meets both of the following criteria: - It carries out securitisation transactions and is insulated from the risk of bankruptcy or any other default of the originator; - It issues securities, securitisation fund units, other debt instruments and/or financial derivatives and/or legally or economically own assets underlying the issue of securities, securitisation fund units, other debt instruments and/or financial derivatives that are offered for sale to the public or sold on the basis of private placements. (ECB, 2012) Investment banks# See above Financial Market Infrastructure 8 An FMI is a multilateral system among participating institutions, including the operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling, or recording payments, securities, derivatives, or other financial transactions. FMIs typically establish a set of common rules and procedures for all participants, a technical infrastructure, and a specialised risk-management framework appropriate to the risks they incur. They include: - Recognised payment systems Payment systems enable the lending and repayment of money, allow businesses to receive payments for goods and services, and facilitate the payment of salaries and benefits to the general public. 7 AFME (2016) (http://www.afme.eu/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=14233). 8 Definitions taken mostly from BIS/OICU-IOSCO, Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (2012): \u201cPrinciples for financial market infrastructures\u201d (www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d101a.pdf) \u2013 unless specified otherwise.

CCPs have the potential to reduce significantly risks to participants through the multilateral netting of trades and by imposing more-effective risk controls on all participants. As a result of their potential to reduce risks to participants, CCPs also can reduce systemic risk in the markets they serve. - Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) A CSD provides securities accounts, central safekeeping services, and asset services, which may include the administration of corporate actions and redemptions, and plays an important role in helping to ensure the integrity of securities issues (that is, ensure that securities are not accidentally or fraudulently created or destroyed or their details changed). In many countries CSD also operate an SSS - Securities Settlement System (SSS) A SSS enables securities to be transferred and settled by book entry according to a set of predetermined multilateral rules. Such systems allow transfers of securities either free of payment or against payment. - Trade repository (TR) A TR is an entity that maintains a centralised electronic record (database) of transaction data. By centralising the collection, storage, and dissemination of data, a well- designed TR that operates with effective risk controls can serve an important role in enhancing the transparency of transaction information to relevant authorities and the public, promoting financial stability, and supporting the detection and prevention of market abuse. An important function of a TR is to provide information that supports risk reduction, operational efficiency and effectiveness, and cost savings for both individual entities and the market as a whole. Exchanges Exchanges bring together brokers and dealers who buy and sell financial products / instruments. Exchanges can be subdivided by type of instrument, e.g. Stock exchange or securities exchange, Commodities exchange, Foreign exchange market (rare nowadays in the form of a specialized institution); or by type of trade, e.g. Classical exchange (for spot trades) and Futures exchange or futures and options exchange (for derivatives). Exchanges typically have the benefit of a clearinghouse to cover defaults, as opposed to over-the-counter (OTC) trade, which provides less protection against counter-party risk from clearinghouses. @ Compulsory social security and pension funds are generally included under public services in trade agreements. # For presentation purposes services providers are grouped under one area / category of services but in reality many will provide several different types of services and there will thus be some overlap.

        "Trade SIA in support of negotiations on a plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) June 2017 131 Annex G: Stakeholder consultations G1. Approach for resuming stakeholder consultations, December 2015 Stakeholder consultations are an important part of Trade SIAs. It is not only a tool for requesting input and feedback from all interested stakeholders, but also a mean to update stakeholders on the progress of the study and to disseminate study results and related material. Due to a longer time period needed to specify and agree on the methodology for the study, stakeholder consultations have been temporarily put on hold (only responding to inputs from stakeholders). However, as the study is now moving forward again it is necessary to re-engage with stakeholders and to inform them on status and way forward of the study. Below we present the working plan for resuming the stakeholder consultations . G.1.1 Updating the consultation tools The existing consultation tools will be updated in order to update stakeholders on the status of the report and to make them aware of the ongoing work and way forward. Website To start with, the Trade SIA website will be updated. The new timeline will be presented on the website. In the news section, a news item will be posted with the latest update on the study and the way forward. In addition a news item will be posted concerning the survey, stakeholders will be reminded of the survey and requested to fill in the survey, which will remain open until 15 March. In case of any other outdated pages on the website, these will be updated to the current situation as well. Social media The different social media tools will also be updated, both in terms of appearance as well as in content. In order to increase the stakeholder database, a message will be posted that stakeholders can be included in the Trade SIA on TiSA mailing list by sending an email to tsiatisa@ecorys.com. Facebook On the TiSA Facebook page we will place a message with the new timeline and way forward for the study. In addition we will share the link towards the more extended news item on the Trade SIA website. Twitter Since the summer, Ecorys has set up a new twitter account named @EcorysTrade . The purpose of this account is to make it a more lively consultation tool by using it for all Trade SIAs, instead of having several different twitter accounts with less frequent updates. This will also give the advantage of reaching out to more (potential) stakeholders compared to using a twitter account only for the Trade SIA on TiSA, since also stakeholders interested in other Trade SIAs are now following us. Via the original twitter account we will inform stakeholders to follow from now on the EcorysTrade twitter account. On the latter we will share the link to the above described news item on the Trade SIA website. LinkedIn Also on the LinkedIn page, a message will be placed with an update on the study, the way forward and the link to the news item on the Trade SIA website. Newsletter A newsletter will be sent to all stakeholders in our Trade SIA TiSA mailing list (this list has gradually expanded in recent months). By means of the newsletter we will inform all stakeholders on the current status of the study as well as the way forward. The new timeline of the online publication of (draft) reports and the Civil Society meetings will be included. In addition, stakeholders will be reminded of the survey and requested to fill in (if they have not done so yet) and to share the link within their industry. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of negotiations on a plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) 132 June 2017 After distributing the newsletter via our TSIA TiSA mailing list, we will also upload the newsletter on the Trade SIA website and share the link via our social media. G.1.2 Continuing the consultations After updating the different consultation tools and informing all stakeholders, all consultation tools will be used as indicated in the inception report. We will shortly summarise them below. A specific moment where we will actively seek inputs and feedback from civil society, using several of the consultation tools below, will be around the publication of the interim report and the final report, where next to general feedback and inputs, we will invite civil society stakeholders to provide comments and feedback on the sector and case study selection and more generally on the content of both reports. Website During the inception phase a dedicated website has been developed. On the website one can find inter alia background information, news items, timeline of the study, reports, presentations of meetings, and contact information. In order to keep stakeholders informed on the progress of the TSIA we will more often publish updates as well as other relevant information to the study and the negotiations. Social media In addition to the website, updates on the study will be posted via Facebook, twitter and LinkedIn. Newsletter Since newsletters are a relative easy way to reach many stakeholders, we aim at sending out news letters more frequent. By means of the newsletter we will inform stakeholders about publications of the (draft) reports, requests for feedback and Civil Society Dialogues. Email address The existing email address (tsiatisa@ecorys.com) will continue to exist as a mean where stakeholders can send their questions or feedback to. The email address will also be used for distributing future newsletters. Survey The survey was launched in October 2014 and is open to all stakeholders. By means of the website, social media and the newsletter we will make stakeholders aware of the fact that the survey is still open and request them to fill in and share the survey within their industry. Civil Society Dialogue meetings in Brussels As indicated in the inception report, a Civil Society Dialogue will be held in Brussels after the submission of the draft final report. In additional Civil Society Dialogue will take place after submission of the interim report. Stakeholders will be informed about the date and time of these Civil Society Dialogues well in advance. In order to provide sufficient time for stakeholders to prepare for the meeting, (the links to) the report will be shared at least one week prior to the meeting. Ad hoc consultations Next to the above consultation activities, we will also organise or engage in some ad hoc consultation activities. Interviews will constitute a key part of these activities, notably for the case studies. In addition, these ad-hoc activities can also include the attendance of conferences or workshops organised by organisations other than DG Trade. The details of the ad hoc consultations will depend among others on the selection of sectors and case studies, and on the feedbacks and inputs received through the other consultation tools (e.g. if we receive little input on a certain topics and the literature is limited, then we will need to make more use of stakeholder consultations).

Call for a broad exclusion of public services from the scope of TiSA and other FTAs. We note that we focus on EU impact iwhen assessing social impact. We recognise that regulation is important for public services, but based on the EU position, identify no clear risk that the right to regulate will be reduced as a result of TiSA as compared to the current situation under GATS. We already refer to the EP\u2019s demand for exclusing public services (see 3.3.1). Request that new elements in TiSA compared to GATS (e.g. ratchet and standstill, negative listing but also new areas such as e-commerce) are assessed.
