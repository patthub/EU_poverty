INTRODUCTION 1. On 30 May 2018, the Commission adopted the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (doc. 9701/18 + ADD 1) ",
        "6842/19 MC/mk 2 LIFE.1.C EN 2. According to the proposal, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is to be renewed as a special instrument allowing the Union to react to unforeseen circumstances. As before, funding from the EGF would be used to improve the skills and employability of workers who lost their jobs. Member States could receive support from the EGF in case of unexpected major restructuring events. The proposal includes a new, lower threshold of 250 dismissed workers for a case to be eligible. The Commission has also proposed to extend the scope of this instrument by recognising additional reasons for restructuring as being eligible for support. It is also proposed that the EGF co-financing rate is to be aligned with the highest ESF+ co-financing rate for a given Member State, while not being lower than 60%. 3. The proposed Regulation is part of the package of proposals linked to the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021 -2027 (MFF) and therefore dependent on the outcome of the horizontal negotiations on the MFF. In this context, the Council will decide on the question of principle of whether to continue the EGF and its objectives in the format proposed. The partial General Approach, if approved, will be subject to that subsequent decision. 4. Furthermore, all provisions contained in this instrument that have budgetary implications or are of a horizontal nature have been set aside -- and thus excluded from the Partial General Approach aimed for -- pending further progress on the MFF. These provisions, which appear between square brackets in the text, concern : - sound financial management and the rule of law (Recital 35), - an overall target of 25% of EU budget expenditures supporting climate objectives, in line with the EU's commitments under the Paris Agreement and in the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Recital 37), - the protection of the Union's financial interests (Recital 33 and Recital 34), in line with the relevant MFF 2021 - 2027 document 5146/19 and the subsequent decision by the Committee of Permanent Representatives, ",

The European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) approved the Report on the proposal on 27 November 2018, and the European Parliament adopted its first reading negotiation mandate on 16 January 2019. 6. The Committee of the Regions adopted its opinion on 6 December 2018, and the European Economic and Social Committee adopted its opinion on 12 December 2018. II. STATE OF PLAY 7. The Working Party on Social Questions has examined the Commission's proposal at a number of meetings between July 2018 and February 2019. 8. Under the Austrian Presidency considerable progress in the discussion was achieved. The main elements of the compromise text that could be supported by the majority of delegations at that stage, are set out in document 12835/18. On 6 December 2018, the EPSCO Council took note of a Progress Report as set out in document 14246/18. 9. In the light of further discussions at Working Party level, the Romanian Presidency has made a number of additional amendments as set out in document 6596/19. On 27 February 2019 the Committee of Permanent Representatives approved this compromise package unchanged and agreed to submit it to the Council with a view to reaching a Partial General Approach. III. CONCLUSION Against this background, the Council is invited to reach a Partial General Approach on the text as set out in the Annex to this document at its meeting on 15 March 2019. _______________________ ",

Member States and the Commission should aim at eliminating inequalities and at promoting equality between men and women and integrating the gender perspective, as well as at combating discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The objectives of the Funds should be pursued in the framework of sustainable development and the Union's promotion of the aim of preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment as set out in Articles 11 and 191(1) TFEU, taking into account the polluter pays principle. (2) On 17 November 2017, the European Pillar of Social Rights 3 was jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission as a response to social challenges in Europe. Taking into account the changing realities of the world of work, the Union shall be made ready for the current and future challenges of globalisation and digitisation, making growth more inclusive and by improving employment and social policies. The twenty key principles of the Pillar are structured around three categories: equal opportunities and access to the labour market; fair working conditions; social protection and inclusion. The European Pillar of Social Rights shall act as an overarching guiding framework of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), allowing the Union to set the relevant principles into practice in the case of unexpected major restructuring events. 3 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary- union/european-pillar-social-rights_en.

The Council underlined the importance of achieving sustainable development across the three dimensions (economic, social and environmental), in a balanced and integrated way. It is vital that sustainable development is mainstreamed in the European policy framework, and that the Union is ambitious in the policies it uses to address global challenges. The Council welcomed the Commission Communication on \u2018Next steps for a sustainable European future\u2019 of 22 November 2016 as a first step in mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals and applying sustainable development as an essential guiding principle for all Union policies, including through its financing instruments. (4) In February 2018, the Commission adopted its Communication on \u2018A new, modern Multiannual Financial Framework for a European Union that delivers efficiently on its priorities post-2020 \u2019 6 . The Communication stresses that the Union budget shall support Europe\u2019s unique social market economy. Therefore, it will be of utmost importance to improve employment opportunities and to address the skills challenges, especially also those linked to digitisation. Budgetary flexibility shall be a key principle in the next Multiannual Financial Framework. Flexibility mechanisms shall remain in place to allow the Union to react to unforeseen events, and to ensure that budgetary resources are used where most urgently needed.

        "6842/19 MC/mk 7 LIFE.1.C EN (6) In its \u2018Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation\u2019 8 the Commission identifies the combination of trade related globalisation and technological change as the major drivers of an increased demand for skilled labour and a reduced number of jobs that require lower qualifications. Despite the overall tremendous advantages of more open trade and further integration of world economies, these negative side effects need to be tackled. As the current benefits of globalisation are already unequally distributed among people and regions, causing a significant impact on those adversely affected, there is a danger that the ever faster evolving technological advances will further fuel these effects. Therefore, in line with the principles of solidarity and sustainability, it will be necessary to ensure that the benefits of globalisation will be shared more fairly by reconciling economic opening and technological advance with social protection. (7) In its \u2018Reflection Paper on the Future of Union Finances\u2019 9 the Commission underlines the need to reduce economic and social divergences between and within Member States. Therefore, a key priority is to invest in equality, social inclusion, education and training as well as health. 8 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/reflection-paper-harnessing-globalisation_en. 9 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/reflection-paper-future-eu-finances_en. ",
        "6842/19 MC/mk 8 LIFE.1.C EN (8) Globalisation and technological change is likely to further increase the interconnectedness and interdependence of world economies. Labour reallocation is an integral and inevitable part of such economic change. If the benefits of change are to be distributed fairly, offering assistance to displaced workers and those threatened by displacement is of utmost importance. The \u2018EU Quality Framework for anticipation of change and restructuring\u2019 10 , is the Union policy instrument that sets the framework of best practice for anticipating and dealing with corporate restructuring. It offers a comprehensive framework on how the challenges of economic adjustment and restructuring and their employment and social impact should be addressed by adequate policy means. It also calls upon Member States to use EU and national funding in a way to ensure that the social impact of restructuring, especially the adverse effects on employment, can be cushioned more effectively. The main Union instruments to assist workers affected are the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), which is designed to offer assistance in an anticipatory way, and the EGF, which is designed to offer assistance in the case of unexpected major restructuring events in a reactive manner. (9) The EGF was established by Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council 11 for the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.The EGF has been set up to enable the Union to show solidarity towards workers who lost their jobs as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation. 10 COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS EU Quality Framework for anticipation of change and restructuring, (COM(2013)882 final, 13.12.2013). 11 Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (OJ L 406, 30.12.2006, p. 1). ",
        "6842/19 MC/mk 9 LIFE.1.C EN (10) The scope of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 was broadened in 2009 by Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council 12 as part of the European Economic Recovery Plan to include workers who lost their jobs as a direct consequence of the global financial and economic crisis. (11) For the duration of the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020, Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 13 extended the scope to cover not only job displacements resulting from a serious economic disruption caused by a continuation of the global financial and economic crisis addressed in Regulation (EC) No 546/2009, but also from any new global financial and economic crisis. Furthermore, Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 to introduce, inter alia, rules allowing EGF to exceptionally cover collective applications involving SMEs located in one region and operating in different economic sectors defined at NACE Revision 2 division level, where the applicant Member State demonstrates that SMEs are the main or the only type of business in that region. 12 Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (OJ L 167, 29.6.2009, p. 26). 13 Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (2014-2020) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006. ",
        "6842/19 MC/mk 10 LIFE.1.C EN (12) The Commission carried out a mid-term evaluation of the EGF to assess how and to what extent the EGF achieves its objectives. The EGF proved to be effective, attaining a higher reintegration rate of displaced workers than in the previous programming period. The evaluation also found that the EGF generated European added value. This is particularly true in terms of its volume effects, meaning that EGF assistance not only increases the number and variety of services offered, but also their level of intensity. Moreover, EGF interventions have high visibility and demonstrate the EU added value of the intervention directly to the general public. However, several challenges were identified. On the one hand, the mobilisation procedure was considered to be too long. Furthermore, many Member States reported problems putting together the extensive background analysis of the event that triggered the redundancies. The main reason that keeps Member States that would have had a potential EGF case from applying are financial and institutional capacity problems. On the one hand, it could simply be a lack of manpower \u2013 Member States currently can ask for technical assistance only if they implement an EGF case. Since redundancies can happen unexpectedly, it would be important that Member States are ready to react immediately and can submit an application without any delays. Furthermore, in certain Member States, more profound institutional capacity building efforts seem necessary in order to ensure an efficient and effective implementation of EGF cases. The threshold of 500 displaced jobs was criticized as being too high, especially in lesser populated regions 14 . 14 COM (2018) 297 final and accompanying SWD (2018) 192 final. ",
        "6842/19 MC/mk 11 LIFE.1.C EN (13) The Commission underlines the continuing importance of the role of the EGF as a flexible fund to support workers who lose their jobs in large-scale restructuring events and to help them to find another job as rapidly as possible. The Union should continue to provide specific, one-off support to facilitate the re-integration into employment of displaced workers in areas, sectors, territories or labour markets suffering a shock of serious economic disruption. Considering the interplay and mutual effects of open trade, economic and financial developments such as asymmetric economic shocks, technological change, geopolitical developments, or other factors like the transition to a low carbon economy, and therefore considering that it is increasingly difficult to single out a specific factor that causes job displacements, the mobilisation of the EGF shall in the future only be based on the significant impact of a restructuring event. Given its purpose, which is to provide support in situations of urgency and unexpected circumstances, complementing the more anticipatory assistance offered by the ESF+, the EGF shall remain a flexible and special instrument outside the budgetary ceilings of the Multiannual Financial Framework, as set out in the Commission's communication.' A Modern Budget for a Union that Protects, Empowers and Defends - The Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021 \u2013 2027'and its annex 15 . (14) As stated, in order to maintain the European nature of the EGF, an application for support should be triggered when an unexpected major restructuring event causes a significant impact on the local or regional economy. Such an impact should be defined by a minimum number of job displacements within a specific reference period. Taking into account the findings of the mid-term evaluation, the threshold shall be set at 250 jobs displacement within a reference period of four months (or 6 months in sectoral cases). Taking into account that waves of dismissals in different sectors but the same region have an equally significant impact on the local labour market, regional applications shall be possible as well. In small labour markets, such as small Member States or remote regions, including the outermost regions as referred in Article 349 of the TFEU, or in exceptional circumstances, applications could be submitted in case of a lower number of job displacements. 15 Commission SWD (2018) 171 final and its annex COM (2018) 321 final. ",
        "6842/19 MC/mk 12 LIFE.1.C EN (14a)(new) The EGF, as a fund designed for unexpected major restructuring events, may not be mobilised in cases of dismissals in the public sector, which are the consequence of budgetary cuts. However, the EGF should be able to support displaced workers from enterprises active on a competitive market, providing services or delivering goods to publicly financed entities affected by budgetary cuts. It can also support self-employed persons whose activity has ceased as a result of budgetary cuts. (15) In order to express Union solidarity towards unemployed persons, the co-financing rate of the EGF as a reactive fund should be aligned with the highest co-financing rate of the ESF+ as a proactive fund, in the respective Member State concerned, while in any case not being lower than 60%. (16) Part of the budget of the Union allocated to the EGF should be implemented by the Commission under shared management with Member States within the meaning of Regulation (EU, Euratom) [ number of the new Financial Regulation ] of the European Parliament and of the Council 16 (the 'Financial Regulation'). Therefore, when implementing the EGF under shared management, the Commission and the Member States should respect the principles referred to in the Financial Regulation, such as sound financial management, transparency and non-discrimination. (17) The European Monitoring Centre on Change, based in the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) in Dublin, assists the Commission and the Member States with qualitative and quantitative analyses in order to help in the assessment of trends of globalisation, restructuring and the use of the EGF. (18) Displaced workers and self-employed persons whose activity has ceased should have equal access to the EGF independently of their type of employment contract or employment relationship. Therefore, displaced workers as well as self-employed persons whose activity has ceased should be regarded as possible EGF beneficiaries for the purposes of this Regulation. 16 OJ L [\u2026], [\u2026], p. [\u2026]. ",
        "6842/19 MC/mk 13 LIFE.1.C EN (19) Financial contributions from the EGF should be primarily directed at active labour market measures aimed at reintegrating beneficiaries rapidly into sustainable employment, either within or outside their initial sector of activity. Measures should reflect the prospected needs of the local or regional labour market. However, whenever relevant, the mobility of displaced workers should also be supported in order to help find new employment elsewhere. A particular focus shall be laid on the dissemination of skills required in the digital age. The inclusion of pecuniary allowances in a coordinated package of personalised services should be restricted. Companies could be encouraged to participate in the national co-funding for the EGF-supported measures. (20) When drawing up the coordinated package of active labour market policy measures, Member States should favour measures that will significantly contribute to the employability of the beneficiaries. Member States should strive towards the reintegration into sustainable employment of the largest possible number of beneficiaries participating in these measures as soon as possible within six months after the end of the implementation period. (21) Member States should pay particular attention to disadvantaged beneficiaries, including young and older unemployed persons and those at risk of poverty, when designing the coordinated package of active labour market policy measures, given that those groups experience particular problems in re-entering the labour market. Notwithstanding, the principles of gender equality and of non- discrimination, which are among the Union\u2019s core values and are enshrined in the European Pillar of Social Rights, should be respected and promoted when implementing the EGF. (22) In order to support beneficiaries effectively and rapidly, Member States should do their utmost to submit complete applications for a financial contribution from the EGF. In case the Commission requires further information for the assessment of an application, the provision of additional information should be limited in time. ",
        "6842/19 MC/mk 14 LIFE.1.C EN (23) In the interest of beneficiaries and bodies responsible for implementation of the measures, the applicant Member State should keep all actors involved in the application process informed of the progress of the application. (24) In compliance with the principle of sound financial management, financial contributions from the EGF should not replace but should, where possible, complement support measures which are available for beneficiaries within the Union funds or other Union policies or programmes. (25) Special provisions should be included for information and communication activities on EGF cases and outcomes. (26) To facilitate the implementation of this Regulation, expenditure should be eligible either from the date on which a Member State starts to provide personalised services or from the date on which a Member State incurs administrative expenditure for implementing the EGF. (27) In order to cover the needs arising especially during the first months of each year, when the possibilities for transfers from other budget lines are particularly difficult, an adequate amount of payment appropriations should be made available on the EGF budget line in the annual budgetary procedure. (28) [The Multiannual Financial Framework and the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of [future date] on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management 17 (\u2018the Interinstitutional Agreement\u2019) determine the budgetary framework of the EGF]. 17 Reference to be updated . ",
        "6842/19 MC/mk 15 LIFE.1.C EN (29) In the interest of the beneficiaries, assistance should be made available as quickly and efficiently as possible. The Member States and the Union institutions involved in the EGF decision-making process should do their utmost to reduce processing time and simplify procedures so as to ensure the smooth and rapid adoption of decisions on the mobilisation of the EGF. Therefore, the Budgetary Authority shall in the future decide on transfer requests submitted by the Commission, not requiring a Commission Proposal for the mobilisation of the EGF anymore. (30) In the event of an enterprise closing down, displaced workers may be helped to take over some or all of the activities of their former employer. (31) In order to enable political scrutiny by the European Parliament and continuous monitoring by the Commission of results obtained with EGF assistance, Member States should submit a final report on the implementation of the EGF. (32) The Member States should remain responsible for the implementation of the financial contribution and for the management and control of the actions supported by Union funding, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the \u2018Financial Regulation\u2019) 18 or its successor Regulation. The Member States should justify the use made of the financial contribution received from the EGF.
