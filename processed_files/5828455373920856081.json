        "Beijing: an overview of the Beijing platform for action 1 Women and Health (C) Women and Health (C) In the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action for Equality, Development and Peace (BPfA) 1995 1 , health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Women\u2019s health involves their emotional, social and physical well- being and is determined by the social, political and economic context of their lives, as well as by biology. A major barrier for women to the achievement of the highest attainable standard of health is inequality, both between men and women and among women in different geographical regions, social classes and indigenous and ethnic groups. Women have different and unequal access to and use of basic health resources. Furthermore, women are subject to particular health risks due to inadequate responsiveness and lack of servic- es to meet health needs related to sexuality and reproduction. Women are affected by many of the same health conditions as men, but women experience them differently. The prevalence among women of poverty and economic dependence, their expe- rience of violence, negative attitudes towards women and girls, racial and other forms of dis- crimination, the limited power many women have over their sexual and reproductive lives and lack of influence in decision-making are social realities which have an adverse impact on their health. Sexual and gender-based violence, including physical and psychological abuse, trafficking in women and girls and other forms of abuse and sexual exploitation place girls and women at high risk of physical and mental trauma, disease and unwanted pregnancy. HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, the transmission of which is sometimes a consequence of sexual violence, are having a devastating effect on women\u2019s health, particularly the health of adolescent girls and young women. With the increase in life expectancy and the grow- ing number of older women, their health concerns require particular attention. Statistical data on health are often not system- atically collected, disaggregated and analysed by age, sex and socio-economic status and by es- tablished demographic criteria used to serve the interests and solve the problems of subgroups, with particular emphasis on the vulnerable and marginalised and other relevant variables. Relatively little is known about how social and economic factors affect the health of girls and women of all ages, about the provision of health services to girls and women and the patterns of their use of such services, and about the value of disease prevention and health promotion pro- grammes for women. In order to address these problems, the following strategic objectives were set and agreed to be im- plemented by the national governments. The strategic objectives C.1 Increase women\u2019s access throughout the life cycle to appropriate, affordable and quality health care, information and related services C.2 Strengthen preventive programmes that promote women\u2019s health C.3 Undertake gender-sensitive initia- tives that address sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, and sexual and reproductive health issues C.4 Promote research and disseminate information on women\u2019s health C.5 Increase resources and monitor follow- up for women\u2019s health Women and Health (C) Women and Health (C) ",
        "Beijing: an overview of the Beijing platform for action 2 Women and Health (C) Indicators In 2006, the Austrian Presidency undertook to focus on indicators for measuring progress on women\u2019s health since gender-based data are the prerequisite for gender-related health policies and prepared a report 2 to propose indicators concern- ing women\u2019s health. In developing the indicators for women\u2019s health, the Austrian Presidency considered the communi- cation from the Commission \u2018A Roadmap for equal- ity between women and men, 2006\u20132010\u2019 3 which established that \u2018Women and men are confronted with specific health risks, diseases, issues and prac- tices impacting their health. Medical research and many safety and health standards relate more to men and male-dominated work areas. Knowledge in this field should be improved and statistics and indicators further developed. Social, health and care services should be modernised with a view to improving their accessibility, quality and respon- siveness to the new and specific needs of women and men.\u2019 The number of indicators was restricted to three. The indicators on women\u2019s health proposed by the Austrian Presidency and outlined in the adopted conclusions 4 by the Council of the European Union in 2006 are: healthy life years; access to healthcare; and cardiovascular diseases. Indicator C1 Name: Healthy Life Years Concept: This indicator, the Healthy Life Years (also called disability-free life expectancy) measures the number of remaining years that a person of a certain age is still expected to live without disability. Healthy Life Years (HLY) is a solid indicator to monitor health as a productiv- ity/economic factor. HLY introduces the concept of quality of life into life expectancy. It is used to distinguish between years of life free of any activity limitation and years experienced with at least one activity limitation. The emphasis is not exclusively on the length of life, as is the case for life expectancy, but also on the quality of life. HLY is a functional health sta- tus measurement increasingly used to comple- ment the conventional life expectancy measures. Chronic disease, frailty, and disability tend to become more prevalent at older ages, so that a population with a higher life expectancy may not be healthier. Indeed, a major question within an ageing popu- lation is whether increases in life expectancy will be associated with a greater or lesser proportion of the future population spending their years liv- ing with disability. If HLY is increasing more rapid- ly than life expectancy in a population, then not only people are living longer, they are also living a greater portion of their lives free of disability. The two components of the calculation of the HLY in the EU are the mortality tables and the self-perceived disability assessed by health sur- veys. Life tables which give mortality data for calculating life expectancy are fully available as a demographic long-term series based on the standard procedures of causes of death regis- tration harmonised at EU level. To provide an overview of the situation, the fol- lowing two HLY indicators were used in the re- port by the Austrian Presidency: \u2022 healthy life years in absolute value at birth \u2022 percentage of life expectancy Data source: The calculation of the indicator is based on two data sources 5 : Eurostat demo- graphic data on mortality and the European Un- ion Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The self-perceived disability is based on the EU-SILC survey, where an \u2018unhealthy\u2019 con- dition is defined by the limitation in the activities people usually do because of health problems at least for the last six months and this assessment is based on the question: \u2018For at least the past six ",
        "Beijing: an overview of the Beijing platform for action 3 Women and Health (C) months, to what extent have you been limited because of a health problem in activities peo- ple usually do? Would you say you have been: strongly limited/limited/not limited at all?\u2019. Published: Data are available in the Eurostat online database (hlth_hlye: \u2018Structural indica- tors on health\u2019 6 ). Notes: The data cover all EU Member States: the oldest data are available from 1995 and for all Member States since 2005. The data are up- dated annually. The HLY indicator is calculated using the same method 7 (Sullivan\u2019s) for all countries. However, the comparability of the data across countries may be limited since the question on the existence of disabilities can be interpreted differently between countries. Moreover, breaks in series, caused by the change in the data source for calculating the prevalence of disability in 2004, limits compara- bility. From 1995 to 2001, the EU-ECHP (European Community Household Panel) results were used and since 2004 the EU-SILC (Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) results have been used. The way this question was implemented by the Member States, however, hampers cross-country comparisons for the data up to 2008. Therefore, before 2008, the results should be used with cau- tion and only the evolution in time for each coun- try should be considered. The overall accuracy of HLY is considered good. However, the fact that institutional households are not covered by the EU-SILC raises a poten- tial problem of representativeness especially because these persons are particularly exposed to health problems. Indicator C2 Name: Access to health care (unmet demand) Concept: The access to healthcare indicator measures the share of women and men in the total population aged 16 and over who needed medical examination or treatment during the last 12 months but did not receive it, and the reasons for this unmet need. Social protection systems must ensure that people who need medical or social care can get it regardless of their income or wealth and that the cost of such care does not cause poverty to the care recipients or their relatives. Access to healthcare implies that ability to pay is not a precondition to receiving care and that the need for care does not lead to impover- ishment. Consistent increases in expenditure, coupled with increasing population coverage over the years, have allowed Member States to generally ensure all residents have access to ba- sic healthcare as well as ensuring that the need for healthcare is not a major cause of poverty and financial dependence of patients and their relatives. Despite that, there remain important access inequities to address. Access barriers include lack of coverage of cer- tain types of care, high individual financial costs of care, geographical disparities of supply, wait- ing times and lack of information. Limiting ac- cess can save costs but if too high can result in belated and more costly treatment. Moreover, countries identify different experiences of care use across socio-economic groups (e.g. richer households make more use of preventive and specialist care than poorer households who make more use of emergency hospital care). During the preparation of the Austrian Presi- dency report in 2006, data were not available. Data source: The calculation of the indica- tor is based on the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey health module 8 . The questions on un- met needs of healthcare refer to the situation during the 12 months preceding the survey and are based on the respondent\u2019s own assess- ment of whether he or she needed a medical ",
        "Beijing: an overview of the Beijing platform for action 4 Women and Health (C) examination or treatment, but did not have one and main reason for not having a medical examination or treatment, while needed. The main reasons are the following: 1. Could not afford to (too expensive); 2. Waiting list; 3. Could not take time because of work, care for children or for others; 4. Too far to travel/no means of transpor- tation; 5. Fear of doctor/hospitals/examination/ treatment; 6. Wanted to wait and see if problem got better on its own; 7. Did not know any good doctor; 8. Other reasons. Published: Data are available in the Eurostat online database (hlth_silc_08: \u2018People with un- met needs for medical examination by sex, age, reason and income quintile (%)\u2019 9 ). Notes: The data cover all EU Member States: the oldest data are available from 2004 and for all Member States since 2007. The data are up- dated annually. The indicator relies on self-assessment of the need for care and, therefore, has a subjective dimension. Until 2008, the implementation of health questions in EU-SILC was not fully har- monised and, thus, the comparability of the re- sults is limited. New guidelines should improve comparability between countries from 2008. Indicator C3 Name: Cardio-vascular diseases Concept: Cardiovascular diseases indicator measures the share of deaths of women and men caused by cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (coro- nary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and other CVD). According to the Austrian Presidency report, diseases of the heart and circulatory system (cardiovascular disease or CVD) are the main cause of death in the European Union and the main forms of CVD are coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. Furthermore, the CVD is the main cause of death for women. The incidence of coronary heart disease in wom- en increases dramatically in middle age, which has led to the speculation that menopause marks the end of a protective effect of ovarian hormones on cardiovascular disease. CHD re- sults in many premature deaths and since clini- cal care in CVDs is costly and prolonged, it is also a major economic burden in Europe. Factors that have been identified as contribu- tors to coronary heart disease for women include cholesterol, smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, physical inactivity, hormo- nal changes and diabetes mellitus. To these classical risk factors we can add others if we incorporate the gender perspective to ana- lyse the risk factors, such as socio-economic condition, links with health services, subjec- tive construction of the illness, insertion to the labour market or interconnection among the different areas of work, personal interests and family life. Data source: The calculation of this indicator is based on the Causes of death data 10 coordi- nated by Eurostat. Causes of death are classified by the 65 causes on the \u2018European shortlist\u2019 11 of causes of death. This shortlist is based on the In- ternational Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) 12 . According to the Austrian Presidency report, the causes of death because of cardiovascular diseases should be defined as the following: \u2022 coronary heart disease (CHD): ischaemic heart diseases according to European shortlist (indicator I20\u2013I25 in the table); \u2022 stroke: cerebrovascular diseases accord- ing to European shortlist (indicator I60\u2013 I69 in the table); ",
        "Beijing: an overview of the Beijing platform for action 5 Women and Health (C) \u2022 other CVD such as rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, diseases of the circulatory system, ischemic heart diseases, arterial hypertension: diseases of the circulatory system (indicator I in the table) minus CHD and stroke (indicator I20\u2013I25 and indicator I60\u2013I69 in the table). Published: Data are available in the Euro- stat online database (\u2018hlth_cd_anr: Causes of death \u2014 Absolute number (Annual data)\u2019 13 ). Notes: The data cover all EU Member States: the oldest data are available from 1994 (but not for all Member States). The data are updated annually. Inaccuracies may be due to errors with the issue of the death certificate, errors in the medical diagnosis, in the selection of the main cause of death or in the coding of the cause of death. Sometimes there is ambiguity in the cause of death. Indeed, there is criticism that the coding of only one illness as a cause of death appears more and more unrealistic. For the majority of the deceased of 65 years and older, the selection of just one cause of death may be somewhat misleading as they often have had several chronic diseases that concurrently led to death. For this reason, some Member States have started to consider multiple-cause coding. Although definitions are harmonised, the sta- tistics may not be fully comparable as classifi- cations may vary when the cause of death is multiple or difficult to evaluate and because of different notification procedures. The coverage of residents dying abroad can also affect the comparability among countries (national prac- tices concerning the registration of residents dying abroad and domestic deaths of non-res- idents are far from harmonised across Member States).
