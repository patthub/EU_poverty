        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 11 Executive summary Background This country synthesis report covers the programming period up until the end of 2014 and includes the analysis of expenditure, outputs and results in France across all policy themes. It builds on the Human Capital, Social Inclusion and Access to Employment ex post evaluations, Annual Implementation Reports and on other available ESF evaluations carried out in France. 1. Policy challenges addressed by the ESF The French labour market was not strongly affected during the economic crisis, as unemployment has only risen by one percentage point in the period 2005-2013. The increase of GDP showed a significant drop in 2009 recovering in 2012. The slight slowdown in 2013 continued as productivity remained at a standstill in 2014. However, this does not hide other concerns; the constant increase of youth unemployment on one hand, which was already high in 2005 (21%) and reached 24.8% in 2013, and the recurring high unemployment rate in the outermost regions on the other hand (above 25% for the 15-64 age group and over 50% for young people under 24 years old). Headline figures and key findings at the end of 2014 \uf0b7 Total financial allocation of ESF 2007-2013: EUR 10.4 billion (contribution of EU was on average 52%) \uf0b7 In total, 74.5% or EUR 7.8 billion were reported as certified expenditure by the end of 2014; \uf0b7 Activities were implemented under five Operational programmes (one national OP (88% of allocated budget) and one OP for each of the four overseas departments) Social Inclusion is the largest theme (with 37% of the budget), followed by Access to Employment (27%) and Increasing Adaptability (25%). \uf0b7 6,870,569 participations were registered throughout the programming period. \uf0b7 Of these 59% were unemployed, 22% were employed, and 19% were inactive. A total of 35% consisted of young people, and 44% of all participations were recorded for individuals with lower educational attainment (ISCED 1-2). Aggregation of results T he following results could be linked directly to ESF interventions in mainland France by the end of 2013: - People entering employment: 659,730 - People gaining qualification: 163,217 - People getting self-employed: 139,612 - Products: 84 - Other positive results: 1,627,880 \uf0b7 These absolute figures show that ESF 2007-2013 contributed to positive results for 2,590,523 participants in mainland France. In mainland France, there is strong evidence showing how ESF is crucial to supporting the multi- level governance of social and active inclusion \uf0b7 The result indicators showed good results when comparing the absolute numbers with the targets set. More specifically, two groups are successfully targeted under apprenticeship measures: young people and low skilled persons. A significant number of people (over 100,000) entered self- employment with ESF support. \uf0b7 ESF has brought substantial resources to local delivery mechanisms and key stakeholders in charge of labour market integration of disadvantaged groups such as Local Youth Centres (Missions Locales) and partners involved in Local Inclusion and Employment Plans (PLIE). ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 12 The European Commission Country Specific Recommendations (CSR) have highlighted the need to reduce labour market segmentation and improve active labour market policies (including targeting of support). In this direction, between 2007 and 2009 the European Commission recommended that France improves the balance between flexibility and security of the labour market. In particular, the European Commission promoted the introduction of \u2018flexicurity\u2019 mechanisms in 2008 and 2009 aiming at modernising the labour market and reducing its segmentation. Increasing skills was another of the recommendations expressed by the European Commission and addressed by France\u2019s Operational Programmes. The CSRs repeatedly underlined the need to promote more access to lifelong learning systems, especially for people with low qualifications and the unemployed. The objective is to better meet the needs of the labour market and the economy, as well as improve the employability of the unemployed. Especially in the overseas regions, the lack and mismatch of skills, qualification and the labour market is critical. 2. The scale of ESF investment Funding: France was allocated EUR 5,495 million ESF funding for the programming period 2007- 2013, complemented with national funding (EUR 3,725 million) and private funding (EUR 1,205 million), this totalled EUR 10,425 million 1 . Regarding the financial volume of the policy fields, overall 37% (EUR 3,835 million) was allocated to the policy field Reinforcing Social Inclusion, 27% (EUR 2,786) to Access to Employment and 25% to Increasing adaptability. Promoting partnerships was only included in the OP of Guiana. Public expenditure on active labour market policy (ALMP) exceeded the ESF contribution by far. It was EUR 318,551 million (Cat. 2-7) from 2007 till 2013. 2 Participations: 6,870,569 participations were registered throughout the programming period. Of these 59% were unemployed, 22% were employed, and 19% were inactive. A total of 35% consisted of young people, and 44% of all participations were recorded for individuals with lower educational attainment (ISCED 1-2). 3. The effectiveness of interventions/what works for whom? Aggregation of results Regarding outputs, there were approximately 6.8 million participations recorded until the end of 2014. From this total, around 43% participated in interventions of the policy field Access to Employment and 27% were supported by actions of the policy field Social Inclusion and Increasing adaptability respectively. Regarding the characteristics of the participants, 35% of the participants were younger than 25 years and 44% had Primary or lower secondary education. More than half of the participants were unemployed of which more than one third long-term unemployed (LTU). About 20% were either employed or self-employed, while the share of inactive people is less than 20%. The goal of lifting the rate of low skilled unemployed in training to 76% was almost reached, as on average 70% took part in a training scheme. All in all, the evaluation of the National ESF OP reports positive results for this policy field. Equally good results are achieved by apprenticeship measures, which focus on two groups in particular: young people and low skilled persons. The associated interventions show relatively good achievements with 82% of the participants completing the scheme (143,654 persons), of which 56% gained qualifications (79,992 persons) and 9% entered 1 A detailed table including all PAs is available in the Annex. 2 Eurostat ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 13 employment (13,743 persons), although the rate of disabled people benefitting from apprenticeship measures could be improved. A significant number of people (over 100,000) became self-employed with ESF support. One of the distinctive features of the business creation schemes supported by the ESF is the high proportion of low skilled people (39%). In the case of the National OP intervention to fight against school leaving (sub-measure 3.2.2), the result target was achieved: 90.5% at the end of 2014 (five percentage points more compared to the targeted indicator, 85%). The integration in the labour market of low qualified young people, who benefited from additional support from local employment services and information desks exceeded the target, especially for women. Furthermore, the rate of access to employment of young people registered with Local Youth Centres ( Missions Locales ) has increased significantly in 2014, with 8 percentage points more than previous years where it remained stable, well above the 30% target. In mainland France, there is strong evidence showing how crucial is ESF in supporting the multi-level governance of social inclusion and active inclusion, the best example being the Local Inclusion and Employment Plans and the 444 Local Youth Centres. Imaginative and flexible solutions to get people back onto inclusion and training pathways are implemented through place-based service delivery, close to their needs. ESF support to the provision of integrated pathways to employment through Local Inclusion and Employment Plans (PLIE) achieved good results. The effectiveness of this mix of measures led in cooperation with economic stakeholders, relies upon three complementary principles: (i) a new cooperation model between economic and inclusion stakeholders; (ii) the matching of needs from both demand (local businesses) and supply (PLIE\u2019s final beneficiaries) sides; (iii) a strong partnership with the Public Employment Service. Aggregation of results Because result indicators do not fit the output indicators most of the time, the information in absolute numbers on the results of the French ESF funded interventions based on Structural Funds Common database (SFC) data is scarce. However, based on existing evaluations the following results could be linked directly to ESF interventions in mainland France by the end of 2013. \uf0b7 People entering employment: 659,730 \uf0b7 People gaining qualification: 163,217 \uf0b7 People getting self-employed: 139,612 \uf0b7 Products: 84 \uf0b7 Other positive results: 1,627,880 4. The efficiency of interventions Information about the efficiency/cost effectiveness is very scarce. However, data for certain interventions in the field of Access to Employment are available. Costs of interventions in the field of combating youth unemployment are low, while costs regarding the validation of former experiences and those regarding the Inclusion and Employment Plans (PLIE) are higher. The average cost per participation of the theme Access to Employment (EUR 669) is lower than the average cost for the national ALMP measures (EUR 888). 5. The sustainability In France, participants getting training or recruited are monitored under the \u2018positive exit\u2019 indicator, which shows reasonably good results; roughly 35% of participants in social inclusion interventions were in permanent employment one year after the intervention. ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 14 From the AIR documentation, there is strong evidence that ESF has put participants on a learning curve, improving their skills for the labour market in a sustainable way. In the field of Access to Employment, all interventions being assessed have a strong legal basis and can be considered as sustainable with regard to mainstream provision. The only exception is with Local Inclusion and Employment Plans (Intervention 3.1.2 of ESF National OP), for which in-depth reforms are currently being carried out. 6. The gender sensitivity of interventions Overall, the gender proportion is equally balanced in the French OPs for this programming period. However, when looking at the gender proportion by policy field the share of women is highest for the policy field Human Capital, and lowest for Social Inclusion. The OPs of the outermost regions have even larger differences. The OP Reunion only has a share of women of 35%, while the OP of French Guiana has a share of 62%. According to the evaluation report on ESF effects on training participants, the impact of training actions on individual professional trajectories are more important for women than for men. Indeed, women participating in training activities seem to experience professional change which influences positively their personal life and professional future. 7. Community added value of ESF investment Regarding the community added value (CAV) the ESF had a substantial volume effect by bringing substantial resources to local delivery mechanisms and key stakeholders in charge of labour market integration of disadvantaged groups such as Local Youth Centres (Missions Locales) and partners involved in Local Inclusion and Employment Plans (PLIE). Scope effects can be observed particularly in the interventions of the policy field Human Capital. Here, the amplification of scope occurs mainly in the ESF funding of training activities. For instance, ESF is supporting the already existing overall package of developing entrepreneurship, but the ESF focuses on training actions for entrepreneurs helping them to develop their business. Without the ESF Regulation, the target groups 50+ and ethnic minorities would not have been specifically targeted and would have remained less supported. ESF has provided an added value through role effects as well. From the regional monographs on ESF and social inclusion in mainland France, there is evidence that ESF has fostered partnerships between inclusion, employment and local development stakeholders. It reinforces the capacity to deliver specialist support to outreach groups, through individual coaching, tutorship and job brokerage. The ESF support allows more spending on individual pathways guiding each person through literacy, training, health, housing and transport solutions, before getting into the job-application process. Efforts are made in order to professionalise social workers and to better match social inclusion demand and supply at sub-regional and regional levels. Some approaches currently supported by ESF are now mainstreamed, along two main blocks: 1. The guidance of beneficiaries (social inclusion staff) in relation to pre-vocational and vocational pathways implemented through the regime of \u2018Active Solidarity Income\u2019 (in French: RSA - Revenu de Solidarit\u00e9 Active ) as well as employment pathways implemented by Public Employment Services ( P\u00f4les Emploi ) such as \u2018Cap vers l\u2019Entreprise\u2019 or \u2018Mobilit\u00e9 vers l\u2019emploi\u2019. 2. The support to running costs of some social firms registered as Social Inclusion through Economic Activity (in French: SIAE - Structures d'Insertion par l'Activit\u00e9 Economique ) benefiting from specific fiscal relief. Finally, process effects can be found particularly in the impact of ESF monitoring and evaluation on the behaviour of ESF practitioners. ESF encourages evaluation to a greater degree than domestic practice. A great deal of resources have been put into facilitation ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 15 and knowledge development of monitoring and evaluation tools, allowing for quicker and better ownership of the tools. 8. Socio-economic impact Socio-economic indicators for France for the period 2007-2014 show that the employment rate of 2014 is identical to the employment rate of 2007. The unemployment rate however, increased from 8.0% to 10.3% over this period. The downwards trend of the employment rate for young people since 2010 confirms their difficulty to enter the job market with ESF support is reported as cushioning the effects of the crisis for this category of the population. The financial crisis and its subsequent economic downturn lead to a persistence of the number of NEETs (young people not in employment, education or training) since 2008-2009. 9. Overall assessment of all evaluation criteria While the \u2018positive exit\u2019 indicators show that a lot of participants in the French ESF funded interventions in the 2007-2013 period have added skills and the ESF has stimulated delivery mechanisms and key stakeholders in charge of labour market integration of vulnerable groups, it is very hard to evaluate the ESF in France on effectiveness, efficiency and impact because the combination of output and result indicators doesn\u2019t make it possible to aggregate results in the fields of employment, qualification, etc. It seems that at least in the field of promoting self-employment there have been substantial results. 10. Key lessons One of the lessons regarding policy choices could be that transnational cooperation becomes a mandatory component, like in other funds (lack of priority given to transnational cooperation and innovative actions). As regards target groups, the deployment of a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluation data in the early stages of the programme certainly helped to inform the MAs and its regional ESF managers on the adjustments required in order to reach this good alignment. Furthermore, evidence shows that the priority group young people, is \u2018pushed\u2019 at the detriment of the age group of senior people. In depth policy learning should be worth further investigation in order to avoid such a situation in the future. Finally, with regard to monitoring, the lesson is that the MA should provide financial data per intervention type (measure and sub-measure) in all its reporting activities (AIR & AER). ",

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 17 Introduction This country synthesis report on France is for Evaluation Task 2B: National level analysis of the ESF 2007-2013 Ex post Evaluation Synthesis. The purpose of the present report is to summarise the most recent and most robust evaluation evidence available, analyse the most recent data available and provide a succinct overview of the outputs, results and impacts of the ESF under the main ESF Priorities as defined in the ESF Regulation 3 . These are generally: \uf0b7 increasing adaptability of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs with a view to improving the anticipation and positive management of economic change \uf0b7 enhancing access to employment and the sustainable inclusion in the labour market of job seekers and inactive people, preventing unemployment, in particular long-term and youth unemployment, encouraging active ageing and longer working lives, and increasing participation in the labour market \uf0b7 reinforcing the social inclusion of disadvantaged people with a view to their sustainable integration in employment and combating all forms of discrimination in the labour market \uf0b7 enhancing human capital \uf0b7 promoting partnerships, pacts and initiatives through networking of relevant stakeholders, such as the social partners and non-governmental organisations, at the transnational, national, regional and local levels in order to mobilise for reforms in the field of employment and labour market inclusiveness And, additionally, in Convergence regions: \uf0b7 expanding and improving investment in human capital \uf0b7 strengthening institutional capacity and the efficiency of public administrations and public services at national, regional and local level and, where relevant, of the social partners and non-governmental organisations, with a view to reforms, better regulation and good governance especially in the economic, employment, education, social, environmental and judicial fields The ESF achievements under each Priority have been evaluated in the following sections: Extent to which resources were used, Effectiveness, Efficiency/cost-effectiveness, Socio- economic impact, CAV, Gender sensitivity and Sustainability. For this country synthesis report, existing reports have been used emanating from EU level evaluations, in particular the recent thematic ex-post evaluations on Human Capital, Social Inclusion and Access to Employment and the reports of the ESF EEN expert evaluation network, as well as national evaluation material and other relevant reports. This information has been updated by the AIRs 2014 in the case of this report. Given the reliance of the country synthesis reports on existing material for the most part, some chapters have more detailed information than others. This is the case for the chapters on Human Capital, Access to Employment and Social Inclusion. However, given the high financial volume of the Priorities covered thoroughly by the thematic ex post evaluations, this difference in detailed information is not material. 3 REGULATION (EC) No 1081/2006 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 5 July 2006 Article 3, Scope of assistance ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 18 1 Background and Context 1.1 Challenges and role/position of ESF 1.1.1 Challenges faced by the country in the different policy fields at the time of programming and during the programming period The figures on GDP expenditure per capita show a constant increase between 2005 and 2012, despite a significant drop in 2009. The slight slowdown in 2013 continued as productivity remained at a standstill in 2014. During the 2005-2013 period, the unemployment rate has only risen 1 percentage point, which can be considered as relatively low when compared to other EU countries. But this figure does not hide other concerns; the constant increase of youth unemployment on one hand, which was already high in 2005 (21%) and reached 24.8% in 2013, and the recurring high unemployment rate in the outermost regions (above 25% for the 15-64 age group and over 50% for young people under 24 years old) on the other hand. In France (both metropolitan and outermost regions), over the 2007-2013 period, the risk of exclusion from the labour market has increased in the context of the economic recession and rising (long-term) unemployment, particularly for young people, low skilled and foreign-born individuals. The employment rate went down from 64.3% in 2007 to 64.1% in 2013 and the long-term unemployment rate went up from 1.7% to 2.1% in the same period 4 . In addition, the sharp increase in employment rates of the 55-64 years old is mostly structural and linked to the age pyramid of the active population, but is also related to the extension of the retirement age as of 2011 5 . The employment rate of older workers in the labour force remains however below the Lisbon target with 39.7% against a target of 50% in 2010. The National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) 2007-2013 identified the following challenges in metropolitan France: \uf0b7 a relatively low employment rates for older workers and youth \uf0b7 a strong heterogeneity at regional and local level concerning unemployment rates and high rates of unemployment for third country nationals, including youth \uf0b7 an increase in the number of social deficit recipients In the case of outermost regions, the NSRF\u2019s diagnosis underlined shared but also differentiated situations among the four different regions: Guadeloupe, Guiana, Reunion and Martinique. In terms of demography, these regions are mainly characterised by two elements: \uf0b7 high population growth rates - all outermost regions have higher population growth rates than metropolitan France. \uf0b7 A young population - while in mainland France the population aged 20 or less represents 26% of the total population, in Martinique they account for 29% and in Guiana for 43%. In these regions, the risk of permanent exclusion from the labour market of some groups is particularly high due to lower levels of economic development and high levels of unemployment. In 2007, the unemployment rate stood at 20.1% in Guiana, 24.1% in Reunion, 21.1% in Martinique and 22.6% in Guadeloupe. Over the 2007-2013 period, the unemployment rate even rose by 4.8 percentage points in La R\u00e9union and 4.4 percentage points in Guadeloupe, while lower rates of increase were recorded in Martinique (1.7%) and Guiana (1.2%) 6 . In Guiana, the French region most affected by unemployment in 2007, tensions on the labour market were aggravated by a strong 4 Eurostat (ref: lfsa_emprt & une_ltu_a) 5 The employment rate of the 50-64 class of age increased more significantly between 2009 and 2013, compared to the previous period of 2003-2009. In France, legal changes of the retirement age occurred in 2011, 2012 and 2014. (source: INSEE, 2015) 6 Eurostat (ref: lfst_r_lfu3rt) ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 19 demographic growth; women and young people struggle the most to enter and remain in the labour market. It is also noted that outermost regions covered by the Convergence objective face a much more difficult labour market and social inclusion context, aggravated by demographic trends (fast demographic growth and large youth cohorts), with structurally high unemployment rates, lower levels of qualification of the population on average and higher levels of illiteracy and early school leaving. In 2004, 25% of the population in these areas received social benefits 7 . Another challenge was underlined by the NSRF, was the need to increase the qualification level among its population. This level is lower than in the case of metropolitan France. Early school leaving is a recurrent problem. For instance, in Reunion 16% of young pupils left the school system without any qualifications. The lack of the necessary qualifications is also a consequence of the absence of the required means to face this problem. For example, there is not sufficient capacity to provide an effective vocational training offer. According to the NSRF, the outermost regions need to reinforce their administrative capacity. This affects both the public administration sector as well as the private sector. Regarding the employment field, it is required to strengthen the capacity for action of the institutions. Moreover, the increase in skills and competences in the field of employment will promote a better capacity for development projects and programmes. 1.1.2 CSR addressed by the ESF Since 2007, Country Specific Recommendations (CSR) have been addressed to France in the field of employment, highlighting the need to reduce labour market segmentation and improve active labour market policies (including targeting of support). With this aim, the European Commission between 2007 and 2009 recommended that France should improve the balance between flexibility and security of the labour market. In particular, the European Commission promoted the introduction of \u2018flexicurity\u2019 mechanisms in 2008 and 2009, aiming at modernising the labour market and reducing its segmentation. The CSRs also called for more individualised support provided to those at risk of (long-term) unemployment in 2011 and 2012, and better targeting of active labour part policies (ALMP) to the disadvantaged. Furthermore, some of the recommendations refer to some of the target groups supported by ESF, such as older workers (2013 CSR), young people (2012 and 2013 CSRs) and least qualified adults (2013 CSR). Increasing skills was another of the recommendations expressed by the European Commission and addressed by France\u2019s Operational Programmes (OP). The CSRs repeatedly underlined the need to promote more access to lifelong learning (LLL) systems, especially for people with low qualifications and the unemployed. The objective is to better meet the needs of the labour market and the economy, as well as improving the employability of the unemployed. The CSR in 2013 recommended an increase of adult participation in lifelong learning, especially of the least qualified and of the unemployed; take additional measures to improve the transition from school to work through, for example, a Youth Guarantee and promotion of apprenticeship. In the 2008- 2010 National Reform Programme (NRP), lifelong learning is also mentioned as a main priority. Enhancing human capital (HC) is a condition for reinforcing the economic development of the Guadeloupe Island, which suffers from a lack of jobs, high unemployment, a greater number of people receiving social assistance, and a high rate of low-qualified people. Guadeloupe\u2019s strategic objectives for ESF HC focused on increasing the level of qualification and the skills of the active population by improving the quality of the educational system and increasing number of children at school. Linked to this, an important objective was to bridge the gap with mainland France in terms of the quality and quantity of the educational system. While the strategy clearly focused on improving the educational system, it also stressed the importance of investing in lifelong learning. 7 Les allocataires de minima sociaux dans les Dom: caract\u00e9ristiques et \u00e9volution, ONPES 2004; ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 20 Investing in the development of skills and qualifications can both improve social inclusion and boost the competitiveness of firms. With regard to the latter objective, reinforcing management, training entrepreneurs and employees, and promoting partnership and social dialogue (i.e. prevent social conflicts which have been prevalent in previous years) are equally important measures. The promotion of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) skills and research activities are also part of the strategic objectives of investment in the field of human capital 8 , 9 , 10 . 1.1.3 ESF response to the crisis The main change in France was the transfer of funds (between 2009 and 2010 from Axes 2, 3, 4 to Axis 1 (Adaptability of employees and enterprises to economic change), within the French national OP. These funds were used mainly for a fund to secure professional careers (in order to enhance work transition training and co-finance the widening of the experimentation of occupational transition contracts) in the geographic areas mostly struck by the crisis. The EUR 20 million allocated to CTP (Contrat de transition professionnelle; Securing professional transition) was restricted to a 2-year period due to its experimental nature, yet the rest of the changes have been planned as open-ended measures 11 . 1.2 Support for and Contribution to the Lisbon Strategy and Europe 2020 strategy and targets According to the National ESF OP (covering metropolitan France under the competitiveness and employability objective), 94% of the programmed ESF amount is linked with the priorities of the Lisbon strategy (on the basis of mapping the financial amounts to the Lisbon priorities). At end of 2013 (according to the 2013 Annual Implementation Report), 96% of the ESF programmed amount is linked to the priorities of the Lisbon and its successor EU 2020 strategy, meaning that the linkage has slightly increased over the period 12 . The OP key funding priorities respond to the EU level priorities and strategies in the following manner: \uf0b7 The Lisbon strategy objectives are directly reflected in Axis 1 \u2018to improve adaptability of employees and employers\u2019 and Axis 4 \u2018to invest more in human capital to improve education and skills\u2019. \uf0b7 The National OP France included an ex-ante analysis of the anticipated OP contribution to Lisbon objectives, explaining the OP\u2019s contribution to the Lisbon objectives and the percentage of ESF funds dedicated to them by OP France. This includes a 15% contribution for the ICT priority, 15% for lifelong learning, entrepreneurship and innovation, 2.9% for anticipating and restructuring, 3.9% for modernising educational and training system, and 2.3% for incentives in participating in education and lifelong learning actions. As emphasised in the 2009 OP evaluation report, the National OP is adequately responding to the Lisbon strategy and the European Employment Strategy (EES) with its emphasis on innovation, business creation and entrepreneurship, and access to training and jobs for all target groups. The 2010 OP evaluation report observed that the National OP provided an adequate framework to address the EC recommendations and proposals. The decision to reinforce Axis 1 in 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2011, in response to the crisis, was coherent with the relevant EU level anti-crisis strategy. Looking at the Europe 2020 Strategy, the National OP offered also an adequate framework to implement its key priorities. This is despite the fact that Axis 4, the only axis dedicated to innovation, more oriented on systems and structure, has received only 8 ESF Ex-post evaluation on Human Capital, National Template - France 9 ESF Ex-post evaluation on Access to Employment, National Template - France 10 ESF Ex-post evaluation on Social Inclusion, National Template - France 11 Metis GmbH (2012).

According to AIRs, the OP HC measures linked to the guideline no 8 of EU 2020 strategy \u2018to develop a qualified workforce capable to answer to labour market need and promote lifelong learning\u2019 represented 34% of the total ESF programmed amount in 2010, 35% in 2011, and 33% in 2012. With regard to social inclusion (SI), Eurostat EU 2020 indicators (2011) show that early school leaving has slightly decreased to 12%, but is still far from the target of 9.5%, and there is a growing number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion (11.7 million people or around 18% of the population). In conclusion, there seems to be a good alignment in the way the French ESF programming activity adjusts its interventions with the French National Reform programme, and the way in which monitoring is carried out.

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 22 2 Scale of ESF investment France was allocated EUR 5,495 million ESF funding for the programming period 2007- 2013. Including national funding (EUR 3,725 million) and private funding (EUR 1,205 million), this totalled EUR 10,425 million 13 . Regarding the financial volume of the policy fields, overall 37% (EUR 3,835 million) was allocated to the policy field Reinforcing Social Inclusion, 27% (EUR 2,786) to Access to Employment and 25% to Increasing adaptability. Promoting partnerships was only included in the OP of Guiana. Public expenditure on active labour market policy exceeded the ESF contribution by far. It was EUR 318,551 million (Cat. 2-7) from 2007 till 2013. 14 Eighty-eight per cent of the total funding (EUR 9,165 million) was allocated to the National OP. Overall, about 75% of the allocated financial volume was spent by the end of 2014, with substantial differences across the OPs (from 59.6% in Guadeloupe to 76.5% in La R\u00e9union). The differences across the policy fields are not so significant (except for the SI policy field where the spending rate is about 10 percentage points higher than the rest of the policy fields). The lower implementation rate in Guadeloupe can be explained by delays in implementing Axis 4 in the island of Saint-Martin and organisational changes within the local administrations in charge of global grants under Axis 3 15 .

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 24 3 Effectiveness by Priority 3.1 Outputs and results 3.1.1 Outputs In total, there were approximately 6.8 million participations 16 in the interventions funded by the five ESF OPs of France from 2007-2013, of which (due to the proportion of the population and the financial volume) 98.5% participated in the interventions funded by the National OP (Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective). This high percentage is due to the different reporting phases between the national OP and the overseas OPs. In fact 10% of the ESF is devoted to the overseas OPs. The following figures provide an overview of the employment and educational status of all participants entering an ESF scheme over the programming period. More than half of the participants were unemployed of which more than one third long-term unemployed (LTU). About 20% were either employed or self-employed, while the share of inactive people is less than 20%. The distribution differs among the OPs: While the National OP, the OP Reunion and the OP Guiana show the same distribution, the Guadeloupe OP has a lower share of unemployed and a substantially higher share of inactive (55%) and the Martinique OP has a high share of inactive (27%) and employed people (26%). Figure 1. Employment status of participants in ESF 2007-2013 (entering) Source: own figure on the basis of SFC2007 (AIR2014) The figure below shows the educational status of participants. It must be noted that in the case of the OP Martinique and the OP Guadeloupe the education status was reported only for 86% and 34% of the participants respectively. However, the high share of lower skilled people (ISCED 1 and 2) at 44%, correlates with data within all the OPs in the policy field Enhancing human capital and its focus on pupils. The proportion of participants with upper secondary education (ISCED 3) is 30%, while only 9% have tertiary education. 16 As one person could participate more than once, the term `participations` is used here. In the rest of the document, `participants` is used, but may include double counting of individuals. 17,5% 4,3% 37,7% 21,6% 6,5% 12,4% Employed Self-employed Unemployed LTU of which in education/training Inactive others ",

Education status of participants in ESF 2007-2013 (entering) Source: own figure on the basis of SFC2007 (AIR2014) Figure 3 shows that the share of vulnerable groups is highest for people younger than 25 years, which corresponds with the target of providing apprenticeships and the support of tertiary students. For this reason, the share of young people varies across the policy field, ranging from 46% in the policy field Access to Employment to 24% in the policy fields Enhancing human capital and Reinforcing Social Inclusion. The second highest are \u2018Others\u2019 (i.e. lone parents, etc.), followed by migrants, which are also to a large extent supported in the policy field Access to Employment and Reinforcing Social Inclusion, aiming at including pupils with disabilities in integration classes. Figure 3. Vulnerable target groups participating in ESF 2007-2013 (entering) Source: own figure on the basis of SFC2007 (AIR2014) The following figure provides the share of participants by policy field for all OPs during this programming period. It must be noted that all policy fields are not included in all OPs, which makes it difficult to compare the allocation of the policy fields across the OPs. Furthermore, the number of participants (output indicators) for the National OP is monitored differently according to the Priority Axis, as performance measurement is made at project level and does not systematically provide information on the number of participants. With this bias in mind, we can observe that most of the participants, 43% (=2.9 million), were supported under the policy field Access to Employment. Slightly more than a quarter of the participants were supported under the policy fields Increasing adaptability and Social Inclusion, while only 4% were allocated to the policy field Human Capital. 44% 30% 17% 9% Primary or lower secondary education (ISDEC 1 and 2) Upper secondary education (ISCED 3) Post-secondary non tertiary education (ISCED 4) Tertiary education (ISCED 5 and 6) 35,3% 4,5% 4,7% 0,4% 3,2% 15,4% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% Young people (15- 24 years) Older people (55- 64 years) Migrants Minorities Disabled Others Share of total participants ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 26 Figure 4. Share of participants by policy field Source: own figure on the basis of SFC2007 (AIR2014) Overall, 40% of the output indicators exceeded the target, ranging from 29% for Access to Employment and Human capital, to 69% for Adaptability with 59% of the output indicators remaining below the target. Examining the outputs by policy field and with reference to table 10 in the annex reveals a number of issues: Increasing adaptability Overall, 1.8 million participations were recorded in the interventions of this policy field, which is included in three OPs (National OP, OP Martinique and OP French Guiana). The majority of participants (59%) were employed with a significant proportion being self- employed (22% out of the 59%), 28% were unemployed and 13% were inactive. Comparing the OPs, the OPs of Martinique (46%), La R\u00e9union (67%) and French Guiana (59%) have a substantially higher share of unemployed. Young people are a specific target group of the French OPs (31%). Their allocation varies between 47% (OP Martinique) and 18% (OP French Guiana). Migrants, minorities and disabled people were not targeted strongly (between 0 and 3%), except the OP French Guiana, where the share of migrants is 27%. Regarding the educational status, the participants are equally spread across the different categories, with people with tertiary education only accounting for less than 25%. With regard to the National OP, the share of older people (55 years old and more) remains stable in 2014 and represents 6%. Targeted interventions on active ageing had no impact on the volume of participants. Enhancing human capital This policy field, which is included in three OPs, is the smallest policy field of this programming period with a total number of 269,000 participations, of which 65% are women. Regarding employment status, 63% are unemployed, 22% are employed and 15% are inactive. The share of unemployed people varies between 39% in the OP Guadeloupe and 96% in the OP Reunion. The educational status of the participants is again equally distributed. Young people make about a quarter of the participants. Looking at the output indicators for the OP Guadeloupe, only one indicator (researchers getting a scholarship) reached the final target set. The other interventions are far from meeting the targets set. On the other hand, the OP Reunion performed quite well. Some 15,000 students out of targeted 8,000 were supported, 28,000 job seekers out of targeted 7,500 received support, and 98 out of targeted 20 enterprises benefited from the ESF funding. 26,5% 4,0% 42,5% 27,0% Increasing adaptability Human Capital Access to Employment Social Inclusion ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 27 Nevertheless four indicators (such as the number of unemployed beneficiaries and supported structures) did not reach the final targets set. Access to Employment This policy field, which is included in four OPs, supported about 2.9 million people, of which the vast majority, 75%, were unemployed and 17% were inactive. The OP Martinique is the only OP where this allocation is substantially lower as they also supported employed (28%) and inactive people (27%). Regarding educational status, a significant part of the participants (45%) have lower education (ISCED 1 and 2). Young people make about 46% of the participants. Most of the provision for A2E investment in the outermost regions corresponds to vocational training or integrated pathways into training and employment. There is a unique feature in allocating ESF support to vocational mobility, allowing young people from overseas to study and graduate in metropolitan France. This is mainly due to the fact that there are very few upper education institutions at local level. In mainland France, the link between ESF A2E investment and active ageing is alarmingly low. The 2013 report acknowledges weak results in light of the difficulties of people over 55 years old to find a job 17 . Conversely, the intervention targeting young people reached nearly 600,000 young people 18 . Reinforcing Social Inclusion Overall, 1.8 million were supported under this policy field, which is included in all OPs. 64% of the participants were unemployed, of which a large proportion (55%) are LTU. Furthermore, 28% were inactive and 8% employed. In contrast, in the OP Guadeloupe, 71% were inactive and just 27% were unemployed. Regarding the educational status of the participants, more than half have primary or lower secondary education (ISCED 1 and 2), while only 4% have tertiary education. Other relevant differences in the participants across the OPs are in the OP French Guiana, the share of young people is 71% and the share of migrants 44%. According to the output indicators, the performance of the intervention in terms of participants is satisfactory in the OP Martinique and the OP French Guiana as all indicators reached their target, while in the OP Reunion, the indicators got close to but did not reach it. In Martinique, approximately 11,000 people (out of targeted 5,000) that benefit from a minimum allowance, benefited from training. 15,000 benefited from Local Inclusion and Employment Plans (PLIE) and the programme of the \u2018Adapted Military Service\u2019 trained 5,370 young people. Furthermore, 786 micro-projects were implemented. In La R\u00e9union the output indicators show mixed results. Only 20,000 out of targeted 60,000 people were integrated in a pathway programme. On the other hand, the ESF funding enabled 5,000 business start-ups. In French Guiana, the implementation of the regional programme for training and basic knowledge education was successful, as 19,000 out of targeted 11,200 people participated. Some 17,000 people were trained with the Adapted Military Service and 3,260 people with a minimum allowance participated in training measures. Thirty-seven out of targeted nine structures were supported through the social economy framework. In mainland France, most interventions are devolved at sub-regional level (D\u00e9partement) and take the form of integrated pathways (providing multi-dimensional support to fight against deprivation). This pattern is acknowledging the fact that the main stakeholders are those with institutional powers and competence to intervene, and explains the high volume of intermediary bodies under Priority Axis 3. 17 2013 AIR National ESF OP metropolitan France p.51 18 Sub-measure 2.1.2 / source: Country report France on A2E.

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 28 The most obvious observation to be made is the important number of welfare recipients benefiting from SI interventions. This category includes mostly the long term unemployed, low skilled people and lone parents. Promoting partnerships In the National ESF OP for mainland France this policy Field has been merged with the Priority Axis on the \u2018Development of human resources, innovation and transnational co- operation\u2019. The data could not be disaggregated to show distinct outputs for the different Policy Fields. This Policy Field is only identifiable under the OP of French Guiana. However, the small number of participants, nine in total, does not allow us to draw proper findings about this Policy Field. Strengthening institutional capacities There are four OPs under Convergence objective in France: Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana and La R\u00e9union. Structural Funds Common database (SFC) data does not provide any information about this priority theme. 3.1.2 Results In France in the 2007-2013 period, 47% of the result indicators for which results were recorded and targets set reached at least 90% or higher of their initial targets. Variations can be observed across the various themes. In the field of Human Capital and Social Inclusion for instance the majority of result indicators reached 90% or higher achievement rates (57%, and 55% respectively). While the majority of result indicators under Access to Employment has achieved more than 75% of its targets, most did not reach their full target. Aggregation of results Because the result indicators, most of the time, do not fit the output indicators the information in absolute numbers on the results of the French ESF funded interventions based on SFC data is scarce. However, based on existing evaluations the following results could be linked directly to ESF interventions in mainland France by the end of 2013: \uf0b7 People entering employment: 659,730 \uf0b7 People gaining qualification: 163,217 \uf0b7 People getting self-employed: 139,612 \uf0b7 Products: 84 \uf0b7 Other positive results: 1,627,880 These figures show that ESF contributed to positive results for 2,590,523 participants in mainland France 19 . Increasing adaptability Only three result indicators were available for outermost regions, so no analysis was done for the result indicators. With regard to the National ESF OP, the goal of reaching 80% in the participation of low skilled workers in mainstream employment policies to facilitate job retention was not met, as only 52.3% of the participants were low skilled 20 . The share of older people in ESF training activities was 11.5%, which is below the target of 15% 21 . 19 It should be noted that as there was no control of the service rendered (\u2018controle de service fait\u2019) in i2013, the figures do not include these participants. If one discards the CSF criterion, the numbers of successful participants is much higher: for example, the number of people getting self-employed is 229,000 rather than 139,000. 20 Source: AIR 2014 p.13 21 ibid. p.22 ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 29 The rate of women creating their own business was raised to 39% during this programming period, which is above the target of 38%. Two groups are successfully targeted under apprenticeship measures: young people and low skilled persons. According to external evaluations of the national OP, the apprentice dropout rate is considered relatively low 22 . Except for apprenticeship measures, young employees, and particularly those with a low level of qualification, rarely benefit from training measures in firms. Measure 121 (Development of apprenticeship and part time training system) is dedicated to apprenticeship and training on the job; it shows relatively good achievements with 82% of the participants completing the scheme 23 (143,654 persons), of which 56% gained qualifications (79,992 persons) and 9% entered employment (13,743 persons), although the rate of disabled people benefitting from apprenticeship measures could be improved. 24 The role of regional governments in managing global grants for apprenticeships is also underlined. The regions calling upon ESF to co-finance their apprenticeship policies (not all of them do) use this resource to target the most fragile among the population. Specific actions are also geared towards girls in order to promote these sector and attract them into this kind of training. 25 A significant number of people (over 100,000 persons) became self-employed with ESF support. One of the distinctive features of the business creation schemes supported by the ESF is the high proportion of low skilled people (39%). The 2012 National OP evaluation report 26 insists upon the importance of the early stages in the business creation cycle and these early phases are the least well financed. They represent the crucial steps for securing the pathway for the enterprise with clear targets, avoiding the situation where individuals engage too quickly in projects with poor prospects for success. Failures in business creation pathways can have more dramatic effects on poorly qualified people (loss of confidence, increased indebtedness, etc.), and one-to-one mentoring and coaching support in the very early stages of the creation pathway proved to contribute positively to the risk assessment. 27 Earlier evaluation reports (2009) found that young people do not really benefit from ESF measures to support business creation. This finding is confirmed by the 2013 country report on youth. Enhancing human capital In the OP Guadeloupe, 54.5% out of targeted 46% successfully passed their apprenticeship exams. Furthermore, 88.4% of the beneficiaries passed the exam in the health and care sector. In the OP Reunion, 14% out of targeted 3% were integrated into the labour market. Regarding the targeting of measures concerning training, the situation is in contrast to what one should expect. Adequate results are reported for the least qualified persons. Several regions report difficulties in getting older people involved in training schemes. Regional authorities in charge of implementing training schemes through ESF global grants declare that they prioritise young unemployed people instead of senior people. However, overall improvements are observed in 2012 and the participation rate of older people in training is getting close to target. The general trend towards longer periods of activity and the increase of job search of people over 55 seem to push towards more \u2018active ageing\u2019 28 . 22 Source: AER 2014 pp.37-38. 23 Data source: MA \u2013 May 2013 24 EEN Country Report France 25 Idem. 26 Source: AER 2012 pp.71-82 27 Idem. 28 EEN Country Report France ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 30 In the case of the National OP intervention to fight against school leaving (sub-measure 3.2.2), the result target was achieved: 90.5% at the end of 2014 (5 points more compared to the targeted indicator, 85%). Access to Employment In mainland France, evaluation reports reveal that the five target indicators used to appraise the performance of Access to Employment show results in line with the programme cycle, with the exception of the employability of young people living in deprived urban areas (target no. 14), although five regions show positive results (Ile-de- France, Champagne-Ardenne, PACA, Franche-Comt\u00e9 and Bourgogne) 29 . The employability of older people remains low, and the MA suggests further investigation of these results by distinguishing between the two age groups of 45 > 55 and 55 > 65 30 . The integration in the labour market of low qualified young people, who benefited from reinforced assistance from local employment services and information desks, especially for women, exceeded the target. Furthermore, the rate of access to employment of young people registered with Local Youth Centres (in French: Missions Locales) has increased significantly in 2014, with eight percentage points more than previous years where it remained stable, well above the 30% target 31 . The goal of lifting the rate of low skilled unemployed in training up to 76% was nearly reached, as 70% enter a training scheme on average. All in all, the evaluation of the National ESF OP reports positive results for this policy field. In Convergence regions, evidence of results is considered insufficient 32 . The Martinique education programme in the framework of the Regional Plan for Education of Young people showed good results, as the target of 19% (of young people) was met. The share of women that are guided by the \u2018Workshops for Personalised Learning\u2019 ( Ateliers P\u00e9dagogiques Personnalis\u00e9s \u2013 APP ) is 74%, which is above the target of 65%. Reinforcing Social Inclusion In mainland France, there is strong evidence showing how crucial is ESF in supporting the multi-level governance of social inclusion and active inclusion, the best example being the Local Inclusion and Employment Plans and the 444 Local Youth Centres. Imaginative and flexible solutions to get people back onto inclusion and training pathways are implemented through place-based service delivery, close to the needs. As stated in the Senate report on employment and local government (2012), the leverage effect of local government support to social inclusion and employment development in finding additional sources of funding, in particular ESF has to be acknowledged. For every EUR 1 invested by the city of Maubeuge, EUR 5.56 are invested by partners 33 . Figures on the absolute amounts of successful participants are only available from the report on Social Inclusion of the ESF Evaluation Expert Network. This report shows, on the basis of information from the MA, that in February 2013 47,867 participants in the interventions in the field of Social Inclusion in the Mainland France OP had gained qualifications, while 444, 156 participants had entered employment. The result indicators following the programme performance in this policy field show good achievements. However, the rate of job creation after staying in a social firm ( entreprise d\u2019insertion ) remains relatively low and can be explained by the persistence of high unemployment with tougher competition in the labour market, leaving fewer chances for people coming from inclusion pathways to get recruited, despite tremendous efforts made by the support organisations. In La R\u00e9union, 20,000 participants have entered a social inclusion pathway since 2007 (target: 60,000). The mid-term evaluation reports a gap between the need for more 29 AIR 2012 p.35 30 AIR 2012 p.36 31 AIR 2014 p.20 32 EEN country report France 33 See ID finding 225 \u2013 Inventory France ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 31 basic literacy skills\u2019 development among the population, which does not seem to be met by the OP measures. The success rate from training to employment is 73%, which is above the target of 60%. In French Guiana, 40% of Priority Axis 3 \u2018Social inclusion and cohesion\u2019 (EUR 8.5 million ESF funding) is implemented through 40 projects spread across the region, showing a strong partnership dynamics with local stakeholders 34 , such as the PREFOB scheme (Regional Education and basic Literacy Programme). About 19,000 people participated in the regional programme for training and basic knowledge education. According to the mid-term evaluation, it illustrates the scale of need among people in great difficulty, taking into account the demographic explosion and the rising immigration rate of non- French speaking people. Promoting partnerships No information is available about this policy field. Strengthening institutional capacity No information is available about this policy field. 3.2 Evidence of effectiveness Monitoring and evaluation work reveals substantial achievements in the implementation of the ESF OPs, both in mainland France and outermost regions, for three policy fields in particular: adaptability, employability and social inclusion. For the ESF national OP, the major factors influencing the achievement of the objectives are reported through the 24 target indicators in each AIR. In outermost regions, the effectiveness of the ESF OPs is reported through mid-term evaluation, and to some extent in the AIR section dealing with Conformity and Concentration. One general finding of external evaluation reports is that the autonomy given to Regional Councils through the management of global grants, allows for quicker implementation of the schemes; this is mostly related to training policies and apprenticeships. The progress observed in implementation depends to a large extent on the success of systems and structures, irrespective of the target groups of the measures. Increasing adaptability Achievements in the field of adaptability are much contrasted, depending on the region. In mainland France, seven regions seem more dynamic than others in this field: Ile-de- France, Centre, Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, Auvergne, Poitou-Charentes, Languedoc-Roussillon, Aquitaine. This regional differentiation is mostly due to the presence \u2013 or not - of strong operators able to steer the public-private partnership process at local level. With regard to apprenticeship, two groups are successfully targeted: young people and low skilled persons. An external evaluation of the national OP assessed that the apprentice dropout rate is relatively low 35 . Except for apprenticeship measures, young employees, and particularly those with a low level of qualification, rarely benefit from training measures in firms. Measure 121 is dedicated to apprenticeship and training on the job. It shows relatively good achievements at 82% of the participants completing the scheme 36 (143,654 persons), of which 56% gained qualifications (79,992 persons) and 9% entered employment (13,743 persons), although the rate of disabled people benefitting from apprenticeship measures could be improved. The role of regional governments in managing global grants for apprenticeship is also underlined. The regions calling upon ESF to co-finance their apprenticeship policies (not all of them do) use the EU counterpart to target the most fragile among the population. Specific actions are also geared towards girls in order to promote these sectors and attract them into these kinds of training. 34 Source: mid-term evaluation 2010 p.49. 35 Source: AER 2014 pp.37-38. 36 Data source: MA \u2013 May 2013 ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 32 In the field of business creation, one of the distinctive features of the schemes supported by the ESF is the high proportion of low skilled people (39%). Access to Employment For the ESF national OP, the five target indicators used to appraise the performance of this Policy Field show results which are in line with the programme cycle, with the exception of the employability of young people living in deprived urban areas (obj. 14), although five regions show positive results (Ile-de-France, Champagne-Ardenne, PACA, Franche-Comt\u00e9 and Bourgogne). Reinforcing Social Inclusion In the field of Social inclusion, the \u2018integrated pathway to inclusion and employment\u2019 model is well spread in France, and ESF plays a prominent role in its implementation, allowing intermediary bodies to play their role of territorial \u2018platforms\u2019, to mutualise funds and finance projects. ESF support follows mainstream delivery by adding substantial resources to local delivery mechanisms, mostly at regional and sub-regional ( D\u00e9partement ) level. Other evaluation work reveals that additional schemes being effectively supported by ESF are the Second Chance Schools, innovative pedagogical schemes aiming at social and vocational inclusion of young dropouts with low skills and no job. Second chance schools are particularly targeting young people outside any vocational training scheme, young job seekers, and young people with social difficulties. The educational approach relies upon modular, inter-disciplinary and personalised educational and vocational pathway. All in all, the evaluation activity reflects well the way ESF is maximising the effectiveness of existing initiatives and improves the administrative capacities of its practitioners in delivering public policy. ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 33 4 Efficiency by theme Information about efficiency/cost effectiveness is very scarce in the available project documentation and evaluations. This is caused mainly due to the recurrent judgment of the French Managing Authority and, more precisely, the Department of Evaluation and Studies of the Ministry of Employment (DARES) that Labour Market Policy (LMP) data is not suitable for calculating unitary costs per measure. Therefore, statistical approaches for measuring expenditure against the number of beneficiaries have not been designed for computing unit costs. They argue this is even more the case when comparing results among several countries. The evaluation team in charge of annual evaluation reports for this programming period did not assess efficiency on the basis of financial analysis. The performance of the programme is monitored and assessed against the indicators plan with quantitative targets set for the whole programme, not measure by measure. The table below shows the cost per participation for the several themes of the ESF in France. The cost per participant cannot be measured for Promoting Partnerships. It is the highest for Social Inclusion (EUR 1,712) followed by Human Capital (EUR 1,194). The average cost per participation of the theme Access to Employment (EUR 669) is lower than the average cost for the national ALMP measures (EUR 888). Table 3.

However, it should be taken into account that these unit costs complement existing measures. For intervention 1.2.4 \u2018Development of the validation of former experiences\u2019 for instance, the added value of the ESF support is difficult to identify clearly, as the scheme itself is not monitored and evaluated at national level. A 2014 CEDEFOP country report on France estimated the average cost per participation to be EUR 1,266 . Secondly, it can be deduced from the documentation that ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 34 ESF is contributing to the support of around one VAE (Validation of acquired experience) certification out of five for the period 2008-2013 37 . For intervention 2.2.2 \u2018Improvement and development of the access and the durable participation of women on the labour market\u2019, when dividing the number of participants benefitting from the Intervention with the ESF amount paid, the cost per participation amounts to EUR 299 . Many of the actions reach out to particular groups of women most remote from the job market. Three main groups of activities can be identified: (i) guidance and training actions (representing the highest financial volume); (ii) actions to improve work-life balance, childcare and nursing services; (iii) other creative actions addressing specific needs (i.e. improving social skills of migrant women, time banks run by municipalities, etc.). In the second group, the costs have been calculated for one specific activity from the French Cornwall of Brittany ( Hautes Cornouailles 38 ). Nursing care during special hours \u2013 between 4:30 and 9:00 am and between 6:00 and 10:00 pm \u2013 was provided to 21 families and 40 children, at a public cost of around EUR 2,000 per family 39 . In the third group of actions, the costs are available comes from Calvados 40 . The action targeted 180 women living in deprived neighbourhoods from four middle-sized towns of the region (Caen, Bayeux, Vire, Lisieux) in order to complement their integration pathway to employment with total cost per participation amounting to EUR 1,303 , with 50% ESF support and 33% women returning to work after the intervention. For intervention 3.1.2 \u2018Supporting municipalities and inter-community structures in the implementation of local plans for integration and employment\u2019, the average cost per participant benefitting from the intervention (including the ESF contribution) amounts to EUR 1,381 . However, the government taskforce in charge of following up the reform of Local Inclusion and Employment Plans (PLIE) estimated the public expenditure per full time equivalent position and per type of social firm between EUR 19,757 (high) and EUR 14,865 (low) 41 . The efficiency of PLIE 42 is often explained by its capacity to identify several barriers to employment ( freins \u00e0 l\u2019emploi ) such as mobility (physical and perceived), basic education, self-image, health (mental and physical), housing, debt, family organisation (childcare, work-life balance), long term remoteness from work, altered or distorted representation of work. 37 Taking a total of 86 357 participants over the 7 years ESF programming period gives and average of 12 337 persons/year, against 65 000/year for the national scheme. 38 http://www.haute-cornouaille.fr/Enfance-et-jeunesse/Loustic-Service 39 Based on information from the project promoter Maison de l\u2019Enfance ; total public cost EUR 42,096 with ESF contributing to 50%. 40 http://www.caf.fr/ma-caf/caf-du-calvados/partenaires/newsletter-ndeg08-juin-2012/tendances- caf#Bas%20de%20page1 41 2011 data.

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 35 5 Sustainability Sustainability of result for individuals and entities From the AIR and AER (annual evaluation reports) documentation, there is strong evidence that ESF has put participants on a learning curve, improving their skills for the labour market in a sustainable way. For instance, in the field of social inclusion in Martinique, the thematic evaluation demonstrated positive \u2018 classes relais \u2019 results with 47% of pupils going back to school and 43% going to other kind of training system (apprenticeship, other part time training, etc.). Sustainability of interventions In the field of \u2018Access to Employment\u2019, all interventions assessed have a strong legal basis. This legal basis is a robust starting point for sustainability with regard to mainstream provision. The only exception is with Local Inclusion and Employment Plans (Intervention 3.1.2 of ESF National OP), for which in-depth reforms are currently being carried out where ESF support is shifted from direct support to aided work in social firms ( entreprises d\u2019insertion) to the local inclusion fund managed at sub-regional level (Fonds D\u00e9partemental d\u2019Insertion \u2013 FDI). This evolution of the delivery mechanism corroborates the role of ESF in this policy field. Last but not least, the influence of the ESF on sustainability is often evidenced in activity and evaluation reports by changes and evolutions in organisational capacity, processes, and factors related to the project or its practices. One of the main lessons put forward by the evaluation team of the ESF national OP is the development of a monitoring and evaluation \u2018culture\u2019 among ESF managers at local, regional and national levels. These tools allow a better understanding of how the funds are used, analysing the effects of projects supported by ESF on participants 43 . 43 Ex ante evaluation of 2014-2020 ESF National OP (section 1.8.3).

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 36 6 Gender sensitivity Overall, the gender proportion is equally balanced in the French OPs of this programming period. However, when looking at the gender proportion by policy field and by OP, it appears not to be equally balanced at all. Comparing the policy fields, the share of women is the highest for the policy field Human Capital, and the lowest for Social Inclusion. In-depth investigation of these variations would be worth exploring in order to understand the reasons. The OPs of the outermost regions have even larger differences. The OP Reunion only has a share of women of 35%, while the OP of French Guiana has a share of 62%. Table 5. Share of women by Priority OP Priority Share of women (in % of total participants) All French OPs Increasing adaptability 41.9 All French OPs Human Capital 64.8 All French OPs Access to Employment 54.8 All French OPs Social Inclusion 48.5 - National OP 50.1 - OP Martinique 42.1 - OP Guadeloupe 51.1 - OP Reunion 34.7 - OP French Guiana 61.7 - All French OPs 50.1 Source: SCF2007; Author\u00b4s calculation Regarding the National OP, at mid-term of the programming period, a thematic evaluation focusing on the ESF gender approach has been carried out. The objective was to identify ESF impacts on promoting equal opportunities between men and women. The evaluation considered that due to the relevance of the OP measures, the national OP had the capacity to produce an impact in this matter. The evaluation found that the Priority Axis 1 (which includes interventions 1.1.3, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.3.1 44 ) included a lower involvement of women in its activities. However, each year the rate of female participation improved. In general terms, it was considered that the 2007-2013 programming period included a relevant improvement regarding the integration of equal opportunities between men and women. Finally, the evaluation recommended the inclusion of the gender equality perspective underlining its potential governance multiplier effect, generating a better integration of gender equality principles in delivery mechanisms 45 . According to the evaluation report on ESF effects on training participants, the impact of training actions on individual professional trajectories are more important for women than for men. Indeed, women participating in training activities seem to experience more often professional change which influences positively their personal life and professional future. Comparing the key skills programme implemented under the ESF-supported actions with similar actions funded solely by national programmes, it is shown that more women are involved in ESF-supported measures than in national programmes. 46 44 1.1.3 Support to job mobility and employees outplacement; 1.2.1 Development of apprenticeship and part time training system; 1.2.2 Global strategies for active ageing; 1.3.1 Support to business creation or takeover. 45 Thematic evaluation \u2018ESF and gender equality\u2019, Amnyos-Edater, December 2010. 46 ESF Ex-post evaluation Human Capital, Country Report France.

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 37 7 Community added value 7.1 Volume effects One ESF final recipient out of two in the case of state services, and one out of four in the case of local and regional government services, go to the usual desk to get social or labour market advice and support, and receive broader services thanks to the ESF. This support follows mainstream delivery by adding substantial resources to local delivery mechanisms, mostly at regional and sub-regional ( D\u00e9partement ) level. For example, ESF has brought substantial resources to local delivery mechanisms and key stakeholders in charge of labour market integration of disadvantaged groups such as Local Youth Centres (Missions Locales) and partners involved in Local Inclusion and Employment Plans (PLIE) 47 . The 2010-evaluation team evaluating the National ESF OP carried out a survey of regional Managing Authorities and Intermediate Bodies on ESF added value. The survey gathered more than 200 completed questionnaires. In their opinion, the main added value of the ESF 2007-2013 programming period was the volume effect, i.e. increasing the number of actions and the number of potential participants. This was particularly stressed within the current difficult context characterised by budgetary constraints. For the Guadeloupe OP, the volume effects were reported by the thematic evaluation regarding the outputs under Intervention 3.4 \u2018Fight against school failure and prevent early school leaving without diploma\u2019. For instance, one of the types of actions co-funded by ESF is called \u2018 classes relais \u2019 which are special classrooms for young people at risk of early school leaving. Young people are offered personalised pedagogic services delivered by a team of teachers and specialist educators. Between 2008 and 2011, these kind of classrooms accounted for 23% of the ESF 3.4 intervention resources. For the programming period (except 2012), the thematic evaluation demonstrated positive \u2018 classes relais \u2019 results with 47% of pupils going back to school and 43% going to other kind of training system (apprenticeship, other part time training, etc.). However, the evaluation also demonstrated that there is no difference in results between the classrooms co-funded by ESF and classroom not co-funded. The main value added is in the volume of \u2018 classes relais \u2019 implemented during the programming period. 7.2 Scope effects In the interventions of the policy field Human Capital, the amplification of scope occurs mainly in the ESF funding of training activities. For instance, ESF is supporting the already existing overall package of developing entrepreneurship, but the ESF focuses on training actions for entrepreneurs helping them to develop their business. The extent of complementarity also differs by Axis. All Human Capital measures in Axis 1 are supporting other national or regional initiatives. In France, historical measures targeting young people have different eligibility criteria in terms of age (e.g. over 18, under 30 years old). The ESF regulations created an opportunity to reconsider these age categories and harmonise them. Without the ESF Regulation, the target groups 50+ and ethnic minorities would not have been specifically targeted and would have remained less supported. 7.3 Role effects From the regional reports on ESF and social inclusion in mainland France, there is evidence that ESF has fostered partnerships between inclusion, employment and local development stakeholders. It reinforces the capacity to deliver specialist support to outreach groups, through individual coaching, tutorship and job brokerage. The ESF support allows spending more on individual pathways guiding each person through literacy, training, health, housing and transport solutions, before getting into the job- application process. Efforts are made in order to professionalise social workers and to 47 ESF Ex-post evaluation Social Inclusion, National Template France ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 38 better match social inclusion demand and supply at sub-regional and regional levels. This is based on the empirical proof that counseling policies increase the number of employment results, provided that social inclusion is accompanied by social protection schemes, including anti-poverty strategies 48 . However, there seems to be a gap between target groups successfully achieving inclusion pathways and active labour market measures for target groups registered with Employment Centres ( Maisons de l\u2019Emploi ), especially among young people. The July 2012 Senate report highlights the fact that a shared governance of delivery schemes within Employment Centres is the most advanced and coherent form of place-based delivery (already tested with success in the Picardy region). In this model, Local Youth Centres deliver youth-related policies and Local Inclusion and Employment Plans (PLIE) deliver social inclusion related policies within Employment Centres. This motion was adopted in December 2011 by the general assembly of ' Alliance Ville Emploi ', the umbrella organisation in charge of coordinating Employment Centres and PLIE in mainland France. Thus, in the case of PLIE, the role of ESF is evidenced as it continued until 2014 to achieve its targets. Some approaches currently supported by ESF are now mainstreamed, along two main blocks: \uf0b7 The guidance of beneficiaries (social inclusion staff) in relation to pre-vocational and vocational pathways implemented through the regime of \u2018Active Solidarity Income\u2019 ( RSA - Revenu de Solidarit\u00e9 Active ) as well as employment pathways implemented by Public Employment Services ( P\u00f4les Emploi ) such as \u2018 Cap vers l\u2019Entreprise\u2019 or \u2018 Mobilit\u00e9 vers l\u2019emploi\u2019 . \uf0b7 The support to running costs of some social firms registered as Social Inclusion through Economic Activity ( SIAE - Structures d'Insertion par l'Activit\u00e9 Economique ) benefiting from specific fiscal relief. 7.4 Process effects The evaluation process in itself has a great impact on administrative behaviour of ESF practitioners in mainland France. ESF encourages evaluation to a greater degree than domestic practice. Substantial resources have been put into the facilitation and knowledge development of monitoring and evaluation tools, allowing for quicker and better ownership of the tools. Evaluation has to be regarded not only as mandatory control exercise but also as a learning process informing the ESF community about the performance of policy delivery. 48 EEN Country Report France, 2013 ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 39 8 Socio-economic impact Macro-level The EU Labour Force Survey provides long series of statistics that can help measuring the ESF contribution to active labour market policies at regional and Member State level, thus appraising its performance for the whole programming period. The figures allow an assessment of the intervention logic of the ESF for certain target groups. The following table shows some socio-economic indicators for France for the period 2007- 2014. It shows the employment rate of 2014 is identical to the employment rate of 2007. The unemployment rate however, increased from 8.0% to 10.3% over this period. The table also examines certain categories that were identified as target groups under ESF support in France and helps us to put the ESF results and findings in a meaningful context. For instance, the downward trend of the employment rate for young people since 2010 confirms their difficulty to enter the job market. ESF support is reported as cushioning the effects of the crisis for this category of the population. This rate is weaker than the European average, and remains weak over time, around 30% since 2002, mostly because education in France has a longer duration and there is a smaller proportion of working students than in other countries. The positive note here is that the share of highly educated young persons in France contributes to EU 2020 goals. The table below indicates contradictory trends when disaggregated by gender show that during the same period, the employment rate of women went up while for the men it went down. In absolute figures, there were more than 12 million women in employment in France in 2013. Therefore, ESF support achieved good results, even if the overall number of employed women getting ESF support is relatively small, around 660,000. The financial crisis and its subsequent economic downturn leads to a persistence of the number of NEET people since 2008-2009. Table 6. Socio-economic indicators of France, 2007-2014 (%) Source: Eurostat Meso-level While resources in the dedicated OP on the theme of Promoting Partnerships in Guyana are very small, from the regional reports on ESF and social inclusion in mainland France there is evidence that ESF has fostered partnerships among inclusion, employment and local development stakeholders. This has reinforced the capacity to deliver specialist support to certain groups, through individual coaching, tutorship and job brokerage. 49 ESF investment has also supported the provision of integrated pathways to employment through local Inclusion and Employment Plans (PLIE) which have achieved good results. PLIEs are financial and organisational platforms of stakeholders established on the initiative of local authorities.

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 41 9 Key lessons learned In France, the contrast between the reality of the mainland (National ESF OP) and the reality of outermost regions (Convergence OPs) is such that the following section is making a systematic distinction for each type of lesson learned. 9.1 What are the key lessons in terms of policy choices? National ESF OP The use of ESF resources are mostly concentrated on the first three Priority Axes of the ESF OP, adaptability, employability and active inclusion and they show a relatively good absorption rate at the end of 2014 with 70.2%, 71.8% and 82% respectively. Even though some interventions show unclear results due to overlapping or combined schemes (see section 9.5 and 9.6 below), the ESF instrument adds to the coordination mechanism by generating new institutional behaviours, well away from the redistribution mechanism of certain labour market policies. This mutual learning within the European, national, regional and sub-regional chain of governance represents a lesson in itself. One deficiency can be observed in the strategy; it is the lack of priority given to transnational cooperation and innovative actions. Many ESF managers are still regretting the \u2018EQUAL times\u2019 where ESF opened up effective windows of opportunities for innovation and knowledge transfer at the international level. One lesson learned could be that, like in other funds, transnational cooperation becomes a mandatory component. Convergence OPs In outermost regions, the main lesson from this programing period is that ESF continues to be a rewarding investment in terms of administrative capacity, fostering the work of institutional networks delivering local, regional and national policies. 9.2 What are the key lessons in terms of target groups? National ESF OP The main feature observed in ESF evaluations is the good alignment with the target groups of low skilled people and women (see section 3.1). The deployment of a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluation data in the early stages of the programme certainly helped to inform the MA and its regional ESF managers on the adjustments required in order to reach this good alignment. Evaluation work was appropriately shared to feed policy making. On the gender side for instance, the fact that each ESF project is delivering quantitative data on gender allows the objective assessment of the intervention from the point of view of equal opportunities. Examining gender evidence in terms of \u2018positive exits\u2019 on the labour market, there are more women successfully achieving validation of prior experience or getting aided work than men with the support of ESF (see section 6). Convergence OPs The population of the French outermost regions is younger than that of the mainland. While the proportion of people aged below 20 in mainland France was 25% in 2006, it stood at 34% overseas. The respective proportions were 45% in French Guiana, 35% in La R\u00e9union, 31% in Guadeloupe and 29% in Martinique 51 . The focus on ESF support to young people reflects the important share of young people in the population, with a particular focus on educational policies. ESF represents an important policy incentive supplementing other instruments in the field of youth policy. ESF also plays an important role in gender equality as several ESF interventions are promoting positive discrimination in favour of women (see section 6). 51 Source : INED - National Institute for Demographic Studies ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 42 9.3 What are the key lessons in terms of the appropriate programming? National ESF OP ESF is a major partner in youth policy, as the difficult labour market situation of young people in France cannot be ignored (see section 1.1.1). A wide range of ESF measures have been adopted in recent years to support this target group in their transition to the labour market. Evidence shows that this priority group has been supported more than the priority group of \u2018seniors\u2019, although strong variations exist from one region to another. Seniors did in effect have low participation. In depth policy learning should be worth further investigation in order to avoid such a situation in the future. Convergence OPs In all of the OPs, considerable effort is devoted to examining the effect of programming on the delivery processes. An important part of these analyses focuses on the implementation processes and administrative procedures and the way they impact the programmes\u2019 performance. This can be explained by the fact that important policy fields within the OPs, such as vocational training and social inclusion, are part of devolved competences of the regions. As a consequence, these require specific institutional arrangements (e.g. global grants) (see section 3.1.2). This is the cause for delay. For instance in the Convergence region of La R\u00e9union, apprenticeship measures managed by the regional council were slow on the uptake because of the 2011 policy reform 52 , in which additional fields of activity and certified training schemes were included. 9.4 What are the key lessons in terms of the effective implementation? National ESF OP Observations in evaluation reports mention that the autonomy given to Regional Councils through the management of global grants, allows for quicker implementation of the schemes. This is mostly related to training policies and apprenticeships. The progress in implementation is mostly linked to the systems and structures, independent of the target groups. The role of ESF on decreasing the gap between positive exit of integrated pathways for the disadvantaged and the possibility of their undertaking vocational or professional training that they might need is clearly stated for some policies and measures (see section 3.1.1). Examples include second chance schools and the recruitment of Employment and Inclusion officers. Here, the ESF is fully dedicated to social capital development prior to human resources development. In the fields of Adaptability and Employability, ESF plays a crucial role in apprenticeship, business creation and labour market activation by improving the capacity of stakeholders to deliver \u2018case management\u2019, thus providing more efficient services to jobseekers and helping them to take more responsibility for their careers. ESF allows further support to participants for defining a personal path to employment, individualised monitoring and provision of services such as coaching or training. In the field of social inclusion, the \u2018integrated pathway to inclusion and employment\u2019 model is well distributed in France, and ESF plays a prominent role in its implementation, allowing intermediary bodies to play their role of territorial \u2018platforms\u2019, to mutualise funds and finance projects. Convergence OPs As seen above, prioritised groups are young people. On the one hand, major efforts are dedicated in improving the basic literacy skills of this age group, and at the same time, the ultra-peripheral situation of outermost regions is calling for reinforced support to the upper tertiary education, students\u2019 mobility and curricula development. Training schemes 52 AIR 2011 p.77. ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 43 have been adapted to the needs, but the take up seems to remain very low according to the evidence base. Several agencies have been delayed in their service delivery by cash flow problems (Regional Training Agency in La R\u00e9union and Local Youth Centres in French Guiana). In these two regions, the only well performing schemes are scholarships, apprenticeships and labour market integration of young people in La R\u00e9union, showing around 30% take up among young participants 53 . 9.5 What are the key lessons in terms of the robustness of the monitoring? National ESF OP The evaluation plan adopted a normative approach to data analysis, focusing on the effectiveness of monitoring and evaluation process, rather than focusing on final recipients 54 . Performance measurement was done at the project level (\u2018dossier\u2019), and does not provide information on the number of participants 55 . The target indicators used to monitor progress in the AIR of mainland France provide valuable information on outcomes, despite the fact that some of them covered several types of interventions for which disaggregated data was difficult to obtain. AIR data on participants is reported in a cumulative way for each Priority Axis. It is not possible to distinguish the number of participants targeted by measures or sub-measures, as the evaluation plan suggests (see annex). The OP does not provide any participants\u2019 targets for any of the Priority Axes. The indicator plan sets targets that are expressed in percentages (i.e. reach 80% of inclusion into qualified training). Moreover, the monitoring and evaluation system has evolved over time, as it needed to adjust (i) to changing regulatory contexts (i.e. modification of data collection procedures for multi-annual interventions, setting up of an additional user interface (D& & D2) on the monitoring tool in particular), (ii) to remarks of the European Commission (i.e. redrafting of the AIR 2008 due to missing output indicators \u2013 since then, data entry for authorized applications reached 92.3% in 2013), (iii) or to institutional changes (i.e. the Individualized Social Support - Appui Social Individualis\u00e9 or ASI - was initially included in the indicators\u2019 plan but as it was repealed in 2009, the indicator was modified). ESF micro-data is systematically collected and stored in a monitoring system composed of three interconnected elements: \uf0b7 Presage web: data collection and monitoring of projects\u2019 instruction process with their indicators of transversal priorities and axis of analysis; \uf0b7 D1-D2 Interface: monitoring information on participants (final recipients); \uf0b7 ViziaPROG FSE: reproduction platform for annual evaluation reports. But according to the ESF Unit at the Ministry of Labour 56 , there is no micro-data available from the ESF monitoring system, and this goes for all French OPs of the 2007-2013 period. Data are aggregated at \u2018project\u2019 level ( Op\u00e9ration ) and therefore, cannot be matched with surveys produced by the National Statistics Department (DARES) nor PES files or Local Youth Centres lists. Such comparative analysis is complex even at intervention level, because there is no certainty that concepts for the reference period are comparable, as the ESF monitoring system only reports projects after assessment and control (C ontr\u00f4le de Service Fait \u2013 CSF ). This contradictory information on micro- data and its utility for ESF evaluation is another lesson learnt of this programing period, determining in a clear manner the roles and applications of micro-data collection and analysis. 53 Source : AIR 2011 54 A normative approach aims at finding out not only how things are, but above all how they should be in respect of the targets set by the evaluation indicators, in compliance with ESF guidelines and Regulations. 55 Presentation by the French MA to the ESF Evaluation Partnership, 16 November 2012 56 Interview with Mr. T.Klein, Deputee chief advisor \u2013 ESF Unit \u2013 DGEFP \u2013 Ministry of Labour \u2013February 2015 ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 44 The AIR provides financial data at the level of Priority Axis. AER does not provide any financial information. To obtain financial data below priority axis, a special request has to be addressed to the MA. It is then possible to get details on financial expenditure at sub- measure level (third level). The lesson here would be that the MA provides financial data per intervention type (measure and sub-measure) in all its reporting activities (AIR & AER). Convergence OPs In the Convergence regions, the completeness of data entry remains an issue for many ESF operators, and technical problems with the monitoring tools were still reported in 2014 57 . AIRs only report about final recipients for which a call for payment has been introduced. The reference system is similar to mainland France (D1-D2 indicators of the monitoring system), but the moment of \u2018exit\u2019 is reported differently. This is one of the main reasons why the number of beneficiaries is so low in the ESF evidence base from the Convergence regions. In Guadeloupe, the evaluation team summarised the technical and methodological pitfalls for carrying on the assessment of three schemes \u2013 early school leaving, adapted military service and apprenticeship \u2013 as follows 58 : (i) delayed access of the MA staff to the IT system for monitoring data (PRESAGE, interface D1-D2, Viziaprog); (ii) for the evaluators, limited access to the system leading to the analysis of partial data only. These difficulties are justified by several factors stemming from the two levels of the monitoring and evaluation process: (i) at MA level: staff turnover, long time frames between the initial data collection and the project\u2019s closure, inadequate indicators; (ii) at operator level: insufficient human resources for mid-long term monitoring, loss of contact with participants, lack of evaluation culture. Several initiatives have been carried out in order to improve the situation, such as awareness-raising sessions on monitoring and evaluation organised by the Regional Council, a study on apprentices\u2019 pathways (PEDAG), training of ESF operators from education authorities (Rectorat), and a revision of some indicators. 9.6 What are the key lessons in terms of the robustness of the evaluation systems? National ESF OP The evaluation system and its governance were very robust with a very elaborate evaluation plan coordinated by two evaluation officers at MA level, supervised by a scientific committee and implemented by an external consultancy through a three-years\u2019 service contract The ESF scientific committee includes 20 members, among which are experts and stakeholders of the programme and from the European Commission. It guarantees the quality of the evaluation work, decides on thematic studies, approves the terms of reference and validates the proposed methodology. The evaluation team of the MA (Ministry of Labour) assists the committee, coordinates the overall evaluation work, manages the public procurement procedure for evaluation assistance, informs regional ESF teams, and makes the link between evaluation and policy makers. The team of independent evaluators is selected through a public call for project for a three year assignment, renewable once. The core component of the evaluation plan is the list of 24 target indicators used to measure ESF performance in terms of outcomes in the AER. Several thematic evaluation reports have been produced, including regional reports, which provide detailed evidence and relevant practice, such as the ten case studies presented with the evaluation of ESF and active inclusion services at local level in 2010 59 . Despite the fact that ESF support to the social economy and social enterprises has been widely promoted in institutional circles over the years, little is said in evaluation and monitoring reports about ESF support in this specific innovative field. Having said that, 57 AIR 2014 Martinique and Guyana. 58 Thematic evaluations of ESF OP Guadeloupe, Aramys & ECS, November 2013. 59 Original title: \u2018Le FSE et l\u2019offre d\u2019insertion dans les territoires: 10 \u00e9tudes de cas\u2019, 77 pages. ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 France 45 evidence can be found in the \u2018entrepreneurship and business creation\u2019 assessment 60 . Surprisingly, the comprehensive overview of the various existing schemes to which ESF is backed, ignores the social economy dimension, whereas all major operators in the field are included in the evaluation panel (e.g. ADIE 61 , PFIL 62 ). The ESF support to micro- projects, which is also part of the social economy field, is monitored separately under the Policy Field on Partnerships (measure 423) but is not evaluated under the theme of enterprise creation. However, there is strong evidence from several regional reports that this type of support has boosted small project promoters and created employment, although there is no overall thematic evaluation on this topic. The lack of evaluation data covering the social economy is regrettable as there are indications suggesting that the sector is a strong purveyor of social innovation. Convergence OPs The approach to evaluation is most of the time limited to the mandatory exercise related to the programmes\u2019 financial performance, with mid-term evaluations carried out by external consultants. These reports are not always publicly available. The MTEs (mid-term evaluations) carried out in La R\u00e9union and French Guiana in 2010 and 2011 respectively are results-based evaluations \u2013 meaning that the analysis has focused on data from programme monitoring. No output data is presented in these evaluation reports. Special notice has to be made about La R\u00e9union, where a joint evaluation plan was set up and carried out for the 2007-2013 programming period, covering ERDF, ESF, EAFRD and EFP 63 . In doing so, consistency and coherence among EU intervention is ensured and further learning from this transversal approach to evaluation would be worth investigating. 60 ESF measure 131 - Chapter 4 of AER 2012 61 ADIE: Association pour le Droit \u00e0 l\u2019Initiative Economique 62 PFIL: Plateforme d\u2019Initiative Locale 63 http://www.reunioneurope.org/DOCS/Plan%20Regional%20Evaluation%20plurifonds.pdf ",
