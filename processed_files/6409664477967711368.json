        "STOA Annual Report 2014 Statement by EP Vice-President Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me begin by expressing my appreciation for the committed work of the Chair, Vice-Chairs, STOA Panel members, before and after the European elections, and the STOA secretariat throughout 2014. Scientific progress is rapidly driving the world further. European society enjoys the benefits of scientific and technological advances through better and sustainable lifestyles. These developments touch upon core aspects of everyday life, such as work, communications and transport, pointing to the need for new regulatory instruments to enhance benefits and to diminish costs. In this context, legislators and policy-makers need access to independent, impartial and accessible information; the European Parliament's response to this is STOA. Scientific education in all aspects of life is important. My personal commitment to topics such as agriculture, rural development, environment and food security, is based on science. The challenges of the science-policy interface are significant. Sound scientific knowledge is vital in order to design solid policies and have evidence-based advocacy tools. Communicating science and technology issues and making them understandable to the wider public, is a challenging task. STOA works in both of these important areas and its activities deserves to be appreciated and supported. STOA \u2019 s contribution to the work of the European Parliament is crucial for enhancing the mutual understanding of policy-makers and researchers. Scientific advice formulated by STOA has to become readily accessible to decision-makers and be considered as a relevant and essential basis for their parliamentary work. From my side, I will do my utmost to communicate with and inform fellow Members of Parliament of STOA's activities, and, most importantly, on how STOA can valuably contribute to their work. I readily take up the challenge of making the work of STOA accessible to a growing set of actors, and increasing the visibility of its high-quality services. Scientific research and the innovation which flows from it are key to Europe's future growth. Kind regards Mairead McGuinness Vice-President of the European Parliament ",

        "STOA Annual Report 2014 Preamble by the STOA Chairman Since its launch in 1987, STOA has achieved important results, and has gained increasingly in importance and influence on parliamentary work, becoming an integral part of the European Parliament structure and a reference point for addressing the challenges posed by new and emerging science and technology in modern society. STOA assesses the widest possible range of options to inform policy decisions and equip policy- makers with the best tools to carry out their tasks. Moreover, by claiming an explicit foresight role in the area of science and technology, STOA aims to firmly anchor itself in the agenda-setting phase of the policy cycle. As Chairman of the STOA Panel, I have the honour to present our 2014 Annual Report. During my years of involvement in STOA activities as Chairman, Vice-Chairman or Panel member, I had the opportunity to witness and to be part of the important developments STOA has been through. Not only has STOA continued to brilliantly fulfil its mission, intensifying its interaction with the Parliament's committees and enhancing its visibility to a broader set of actors, but new targeted initiatives have also been set in motion, as it is amply illustrated in the following pages. STOA\u2019s progress regarding the quantity and diversity of its activities has been fuelled by the evolution in competences and powers of the European Union and its Parliament, but also by the rapid and continuous advance of science and technology, which permeate every aspect of our lives and have a bearing on ever more political decisions. Under this light, in 2015 STOA will increasingly analyse long-term impacts of science and technology on society, critically assessing benefits and risks. Informing public policy with ethical and impartial scientific advice today should shape a better future tomorrow. In addition to its many projects and events, by carrying out a new edition of the MEP-Scientist Pairing Scheme, STOA will encourage interactions between policy-makers and scientists to foster mutual understanding and collaborations, in support of high-quality evidence-based decision-making in the EP. While pursuing these objectives, STOA will continue to strive for the highest quality possible as regards the sound science underpinning its products and activities, and the effective and timely communication of their relevance to Parliament's work. Finally, I wish to thank EP Vice-President Mairead McGuinness, as well as STOA Vice-Chairs Eva Kaili and Ev\u017een To\u0161enovsk\u00fd, for their dedicated support and look forward to continuing our excellent cooperation in order to fulfil STOA\u2019s objectives in the coming years.

        "STOA Annual Report 2014 1 Executive summary In 2014 STOA continued to fulfil its mission of providing scientific evidence for decision-making in the European Parliament. This was mainly done by conducting projects and organising events on techno-scientific trends and related issues of interest for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Moreover, it was decided that, as of 2015, STOA should undertake, in parallel with other activities, Scientific Foresight in the areas of science and technology for the purpose of empowering MEPs to anticipate on the long-term impacts of such developments and work towards desirable futures. Following the European elections in May 2014, the new STOA Panel was convened by Vice-President Mairead McGUINNESS in October 2014 and elected Paul R\u00dcBIG as Chair and Eva KAILI and Ev\u017een TO\u0160ENOVSK\u00dd as First and Second Vice-Chairs respectively for the first half of the 8 th legislature. Despite the election break, STOA completed several studies, launched new ones and organised a number of workshops in 2014. The following projects were completed in 2014: \uf0b7 Science Metrics - Measuring scientific performance for improved policy making \uf0b7 Methanol: A future transport fuel based on hydrogen and carbon dioxide? \uf0b7 Integrated e-ticketing for city-based urban transport systems and tourist sites \uf0b7 Potential and impact of Cloud Computing services and Social Network Websites \uf0b7 Surveillance of IT users: what are the risks and benefits for the European Information Society A number of workshops took place, both ad-hoc and related to particular STOA projects: \uf0b7 The energy storage challenge: which contribution from chemical sciences? \uf0b7 Responsible governance of science and technologies - Perspectives from Europe, China and India \uf0b7 Intervention tools and strategies to improve health programmes: The role of operational research in low- and middle-income countries \uf0b7 New learning and teaching technologies \uf0b7 The climate change challenge \uf0b7 Being human in a hyper-connected era \u2013 The Onlife initiative For its 2014 edition of the Annual Lecture, STOA welcomed Professor Thomas S\u00dcDHOF, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine, who delivered a keynote speech about brain function, neuroscience and a personal reflexion on science governance. The event featured some other eminent speakers and a debate with the audience. Apart from publishing studies, briefings and reports, STOA continued communicating on its activities and disseminating project outcomes to a wide audience via blogs. In addition, live tweeting during events has become a standard part of STOA's communication strategy. Finally, STOA continued its good relationship with partners in the international science policy community by attending meetings of the EPTA (European Parliamentary Technology Assessment) network, the EuroScience Open Forum and EU-ANSA (European Union Agencies Network on Scientific Advice, a sub-network of the European Agencies network). ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 2 1. Scientific advice in and for the European Parliament Techno-scientific developments have wide implications across many policy areas, affecting the society and the environment in a broad sense. Therefore, scientific evidence for decision-making is becoming increasingly important. STOA (Science and Technology Options Assessment) is a body of the European Parliament (EP). It was established in 1987 with a mission to provide Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) with independent expert assessment of scientific and technological developments and related policy options for informed political decision-making. STOA activities The main activities of STOA are projects and workshops . These are organised around five priority thematic areas, as follows: \uf0b7 Eco-efficient transport and modern energy solutions \uf0b7 Sustainable management of natural resources \uf0b7 Potentials and challenges of the Information Society \uf0b7 Health and life sciences \uf0b7 Science, technology and innovation policy. STOA projects aim to provide scientific evidence to underpin policy decisions, based upon a state-of- the-art overview of cross-cutting topics that have a scientific or technological dimension, such as: eco- efficient transport, smart energy grids, technology options for feeding 10 billion people, cloud computing, e-government, nanosafety, bio-engineering, intellectual property rights, innovation and science metrics. The main outcomes of these interdisciplinary STOA projects are evidence-based policy options for responsibly promoting and deploying existing and emerging technologies. STOA studies give policy options rather than recommendations, as MEPs may base their decision-making on other factors, such as their political or ethical standpoints. The projects are mostly carried out in collaboration with external experts under strict contractual agreements. These can be research institutes, universities, laboratories, consultancies or individual researchers. This allows for independent expert assessments on legislative, technical, economic, environmental and societal aspects of techno-scientific developments. The publications related to STOA projects are available on the STOA website for everyone who might be interested, thus disseminating information to the wider public and encouraging a dialogue between citizens and legislators. At the end of the 7 th legislature, in April 2014, the Panel decided that, as part of a STOA strategy for the future, STOA should pursue a foresight role in the area of science and technology within the EP. This means that, besides Technology Assessment projects that assess the impacts of relatively known and understood scientific and technological advances and try to identify middle to long-term challenges and opportunities, STOA will also undertake another type of projects in the future. Scientific Foresight projects will identify and assess the widest possible range of trends and impacts (also the unlikely ones) of relatively unknown or uncertain techno-scientific trends with the potential of long-term (20 to 50 years) societal impacts. Another difference between these two types of projects in STOA's portfolio is in how they link to the EP decision-making. In the first case, proposed policy options should be considered as part of the current or already programmed legislative work. In the second case, existing legislation will be analysed in relation to possible future trends and their consequences in all societal areas. This identification of legislative pathways will empower MEPs to anticipate towards desired futures resulting from techno-scientific trends. ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 3 STOA also aims to bridge the gap between the scientific community and decision-makers in a more direct way. This is done by organising discussion forums, mostly in the form of workshops that are often part of a project, on emerging and relevant topics. Events are carried out by the STOA Secretariat by involving, as necessary, representatives of specialist organizations, institutes and external experts in the scientific field. These events are open to the public and their outcomes are published on the STOA website. The STOA Annual Lecture is the high point of STOA\u2019s activities every year. This event gives the opportunity to MEPs, officials, researchers, students and other interested stakeholders to listen to eminent scientists - often Nobel Prize laureates - speaking about subjects placed high on the political agenda, such as the information society, oil-free future, sustainability, advances in medical research, as well as major discoveries in fundamental science. A special instrument for enhancing mutual understanding and the relationship between scientists and policy-makers is the MEP-Scientist Pairing Scheme . This initiative aims at establishing long-term, intensive cooperation between MEPs and researchers and it could serve as a tool for enhancing knowledge-based decisions, facilitating a better public awareness of European Union (EU) policies and fostering a greater mutual understanding. The Scheme has mutual advantages for participants: \uf0b7 MEPs gain awareness of scientific processes and better understanding of the way scientists consider policy issues. The Pairing Scheme facilitates the process of bringing scientific advice into EU policy discussions. \uf0b7 Scientists learn about the role of science in policy-making and the policy-making process in the EU, which should enable them to interact more effectively with politicians. Additionally, they can contribute to the dissemination of information to universities and other scientific institutions on the structure and implementation of relevant European policies and programmes, e.g. Horizon 2020. Last but not least, STOA is active in Technology Assessment networks on an international level. It is a founding member of the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network, and maintains strong connections and actively cooperates with European institutions and organisations, including notably the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and DG Research and Innovation (DG RTD). On a global scale, STOA has strong links with the EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF), the STS (Science and Technology in Society) forum and the World Science Forum. The STOA Panel The STOA Panel is politically responsible for STOA's work. It is composed of 15 Members of the European Parliament: \uf0b7 the Vice-President of the European Parliament responsible for STOA; \uf0b7 four members appointed by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE); \uf0b7 two members appointed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL); \uf0b7 two members appointed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI); \uf0b7 two members appointed by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO); \uf0b7 two members appointed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN); \uf0b7 two members appointed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI). The members of the STOA Panel are appointed at the beginning of each parliamentary term for a renewable two-and-a-half-year period. A constituent meeting is held at the beginning and the middle ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 4 of each parliamentary term, in which the Chair and two Vice-Chairs are elected by the Panel members. The STOA Bureau runs the activities of STOA and prepares the Panel meetings. It is composed of four MEPs, namely the EP Vice-President responsible for STOA, the STOA Chair and the two Vice- Chairs. During the first half of 2014, members of the Bureau were Mr Old\u0159ich VLASA K, EP Vice-President responsible for STOA, Mr Antonio CORREIA DE CAMPOS, STOA Chair, Mr Paul R\u00dcBIG, first STOA Vice-Chair, and Mr Malcolm HARBOUR, second STOA Vice-Chair. At the beginning of 8 th parliamentary term, Ms Mairead McGUINNESS replaced Mr VLASA K as the EP Vice-President responsible for STOA and, as such, became member of the new STOA Bureau. In the constituent meeting of the STOA Panel that took place on 22 October 2014 the new Panel members elected the rest of the members of the STOA Bureau. Mr Paul R\u00dcBIG, first STOA Vice-Chair in the second half of the 7 th legislature, was chosen as Panel Chair for a period of two-and-a-half years. Ms Eva KAILI was elected as first Vice-Chair, and Mr Ev\u017een TO\u0160ENOVSK\u00dd as second Vice-Chair. The STOA Secretariat runs the everyday business and executes the decisions of the STOA Panel, if needed with the assistance of external experts and trainees (see chapter 13). ",

        "STOA Annual Report 2014 7 2. STOA activities in the area of eco-efficient transport and modern energy solutions 2.1. Integrated e-ticketing for city based urban transport systems and tourist sites This study was carried out from January 2013 to January 2014 and it was presented in the Annual Report 2013. 2.2. The energy storage challenge: which contribution from chemical sciences? STOA organised this workshop on 11 February 2014 in cooperation with the European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences (EuCheMS). EuCheMS is a not-for-profit organisation working to promote co-operation in Europe between non-profit-making scientific and technical societies in the field of chemistry and molecular sciences and bring together world- class expertise in the underpinning science and development needed for innovation. The workshop was chaired by Mr Ant\u00f3nio CORREIA DE CAMPOS, MEP and STOA Chair in the second half of the 7 th legislature. Promising supply and storage options The speakers outlined the energy supply and storage challenge Europe is facing and presented two main possibilities to store energy as chemical energy: physical devices such as batteries and super capacitors, and storage of energy in chemical bonds of molecular compounds. However, to achieve this, substantial breakthroughs are needed in materials, electrochemistry and surface chemistry. Developing energy storage is particularly important for capturing the potential of renewables that are often supply-driven systems, such as solar energy. The CO 2 resulting from the use of fossil fuels and causing concerns among climatologists could be transformed into energy vectors, such as methanol and hydrocarbons. Artificial photosynthesis and hydrogen are also promising energy sources. These options could contribute to making Europe more competitive on a global level in this economically important field. The way forward An adequate policy for addressing the energy challenge has to tackle three issues: sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness. Chemical science is already developing answers to the energy challenges, but there is no one single solution or a single \u201csmart energy\u201d for the future. 2.3. Methanol: A future transport fuel based on hydrogen and carbon dioxide? This study ran from October 2012 to February 2014 and was presented in the Annual Report 2013. ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 8 3. STOA activities in the area of sustainable management of natural resources 3.1. Technology options for deep-seabed exploitation - tackling economic, environmental and societal challenges Lead Panel Member: Marijana PETIR Project duration: October 2014 to March 2015 Presentation to the STOA Panel: 12 February 2015 Harnessing the deep sea Exploration and exploitation of the deep sea in search of marine minerals and genetic resources have received increased attention over the past 15 years. Developments in biotechnology and sub- marine technologies, together with the scarcity and rising prices of new materials, are changing the business-case for extending activities in the marine environment. However, many caveats remain concerning knowledge gaps and risks. These need to be clarified before large-scale deep- sea exploitation could take place. Deep-sea mining For deep-sea minerals, the future remains uncertain regarding the extent to which the seafloor resources will be tapped on a commercial scale. Uncertainties in terms of concentrations and size of raw material resources hinder a robust assessment of the commercial viability of mining projects. With regard to the technological breakthroughs, the industry is generally confident that it is a matter of time before offshore mining will begin. However, there are no commercial activities to date and prospects have been delayed repeatedly. Moreover, there are uncertainties in the legal framework and large gaps regarding environmental and societal impacts of large-scale deep-sea mining. Bioprospecting In terms of biological resources, the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors see a large potential for finding more applications from marine genetic and biological resources, with European research being on the forefront of the development. However, the competition is fierce, with companies from the US, Japan and China filing for patents. In comparison with marine mineral resources, the environmental and societal impacts of exploration and exploitation are expected to be less significant considering that underwater sampling is limited and the main part of the value chain takes place in the labs. Position of the EU The European industry is at the forefront of exploration and exploitation of deep-sea resources. The EU has actively supported a number of research initiatives on deep-sea resources, mainly through the FP6, FP7 and Horizon 2020 programmes. However, public support and an adequate legal framework for operation are important for the success of the sector. ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 9 Policy options There are several policy options that the EU could take. These range from supporting a pilot mining project, contributing to the development of a legal framework, encouraging cooperation and knowledge sharing among different industrial sectors and between industry and research, improving the knowledge base, or alternatively resorting to increased recycling rather than deep sea-mining. 3.2. The climate change challenge On 4 November 2014 STOA welcomed the Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Dr Rajendra PACHAURI, who presented the organisation\u2019s latest \u2018Synthesis report\u2019 in the European Parliament, followed by a debate with the audience. This event, organised in cooperation with DG Research and Innovation of the European Commission, took place only a few days after the report was officially launched in Copenhagen. Other speakers were Carlos MOEDAS, Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation; Mairead McGUINNESS, EP Vice-President responsible for STOA; Paul R\u00dcBIG, STOA Chair; and Eva KAILI, First STOA Vice-Chair. In 2013 STOA had hosted Gian-Kasper PLATTNER of the IPCC for a debate on the findings of the Working Group I report on \u2018Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis\u2019. Intergovernmental body for scientific assessment of climate change The IPCC was established at the request of member governments to review and assess the most recent information produced worldwide in relation to the understanding of climate change and its consequences. The result of this process are reports on the science base of climate change; its impacts, as well as the adaptation and vulnerability of mankind; and the mitigation options. These reports support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is the main international treaty on climate change with the ultimate objective to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Humans extremely likely to be responsible for the changing climate The \u2018Synthesis Report\u2019 crowns the effort of the experts working on the IPCC 5 th Assessment Report. The growing evidence has enabled the IPCC to establish the anthropogenic influence on climate change with higher confidence than before and adopt a sterner tone when describing future impacts. The EU is likely to experience the consequences of climate change in terms of extreme weather events that will influence agriculture and industry as well as human health. Tackling the challenge Mitigating climate change comes with a cost that, however, does not account for all the benefits resulting from reducing the effects of climate change. Solutions should be based on international agreements and collective efforts as climate change concerns countries across the board. Developing innovative technological solutions is part of the answer puzzle, together with the decarbonisation of energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Such actions need involvement of the private and public sectors as well as support in terms of research funding. A large share of the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 budget has been dedicated to climate-related objectives, as stated by Commissioner MOEDAS. ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 10 4. STOA activities in the area of potentials and challenges of the Information Society 4.1. Potential and impact of Cloud Computing services and Social Network Websites This STOA study was carried out from April 2012 to January 2014 and it was reported on in the Annual Report 2013. 4.2. Surveillance of IT users: what are the risks and benefits for the European Information Society Lead Panel Member: Eva KAILI Project duration: October 2014 to January 2015 Presentation to the STOA Panel: 18 December 2014 This STOA project was initiated upon request of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) following the adoption by the EP, on 12 March 2014, of a resolution on the \u2018US NSA surveillance programme, surveillance bodies in various Member States and their impact on EU citizens\u2019 fundamental rights and on transatlantic cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs\u2019. The study consisted of two parts: technology assessment and technology foresight. The results of this project will be presented at the conference \u2018Protecting on-line privacy by enhancing IT security and EU IT autonomy\u2019, which the LIBE Committee is planning for the second half of 2015. Moreover, two video clips have been produced and published on YouTube with subtitles in three languages, presenting the study outcomes and making them accessible to a wider audience. Risks raised by the current generation of network services and applications Meta-data is produced when electronic communication channels, like Internet or telephony, are used and provides information about the time, origin, destination, location, duration and frequency of communications carried out. The retention period of this type of data that is routinely gathered by telecom and Internet service providers is defined in the legislation of European and other countries. This type of data does not include the content of communications, but can nevertheless reveal a large amount of personal information when analysed by data-mining techniques and interception software. Cookies, text files that have visited websites stored on a user\u2019s local disk, are also a potential source of private data. There are many highly sophisticated hardware and software interception tools that make it possible to penetrate networking equipment, monitor mobile phones and computers and divert or even modify data without being noticed. The legal context for commercial surveillance technology vendors is defined in different national and international laws, agreements and regulations, but these are often found to be inadequate to deal with the modern communication surveillance environment. Even though for the end user it is possible to hinder unauthorised access to private data or meta-data by applying a mix of different protection mechanisms, there are no means for guaranteeing complete immunity against such attacks. ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 11 The short- and mid-term policy options proposed by the study include promotion and integration of resilient, open-source and user-friendly operating systems, software and applications under the constant scrutiny of experts. Options for longer-term security and privacy improvements The study concluded that there is no single technological solution to help citizens better protect themselves in the light of mass surveillance and other threats against their privacy. Some of the possible policy options to be pursued in combination concern: \uf0b7 current good practices to adopt, such as end-to-end encryption and secure and verified open- source software, \uf0b7 approaches to build and restore confidence among users, by for example ensuring a minimum level of security for critical information infrastructure elements in the EU, \uf0b7 advantages and disadvantages of the implementation of more technology-disruptive approaches such as an \u2018EU Internet\u2019 or an \u2018EU certification scheme\u2019 for encryption, and \uf0b7 enabling long-term innovation, by for example funding a research project to (re)design Internet protocols to minimise traceability of users. The technology-related policy options should be supported by legal, financial and promotional arrangements. It is also important to keep in mind several developments like the Internet of Things and Big Data, which will challenge the technologies and policies described. Finding the right balance Finally, the study emphasised the importance of distinguishing intelligence, marketing and mass unwarranted and indiscriminate surveillance that is a threat to civil liberties from targeted lawful interception of Internet and telephony data for the purpose of law enforcement and crime investigation. Citizens need to be actively involved in deciding on the right balance between the two. 4.3. New learning and teaching technologies The workshop held on 8 April 2014 examined the changing ways in which people learn, and the options presented by new technologies. A discussion of theoretical perspectives in education was followed by demonstrations of some of the technologies currently being developed, for example in medical training. However, technology by itself is not the answer but a tool for enabling more effective teaching and learning. Dr Paul R\u00dcBIG, first STOA Vice-Chair in the second part of the 7 th legislature, chaired the workshop. A need for change: education for the future The workshop speakers agreed that a major change was needed in today\u2019s educational system. Technological development needs to be integrated into the educational process that in turn has to react faster to changes and innovation. Creativity has to be pursued and valued, as a way for preparing today\u2019s learners for solving tomorrow\u2019s problems. A basis for change is the provision of infrastructure and technology at institutional level, but teachers and educational managers must also be able to keep up with the change by acquiring new skills. New technology-enabled models will make it possible for learning to become open and collaborative and the education process more personalised. Personalised learning and assessment involves learners\u2019 data analytics that raises the issues of privacy, security, and data protection and ownership. Education will probably involve more practical learning via for example \u2018serious games\u2019 and combining skills ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 12 and knowledge from several traditional subjects. Technology will also lead to changing roles of different actors in the educational process. A teacher, no longer a sole source of knowledge, should instead act as a mentor and guide to learners, teaching them ethics and critical reasoning. As a follow-up of this workshop, in October 2014 STOA launched a project on \u2018Teaching and learning technology options\u2019. 4.4. Teaching and learning technology options Lead Panel Member: Paul R\u00dcBIG Project duration: October 2014 to May 2015 Presentation to the STOA Panel: 12 March 2015 Effects of technology on education Educational technology encompasses a wide array of technologies and methodologies shaped by stakeholder\u2019s behaviours and affected by contextual factors, that, if adequately mixed, can contribute to students and teachers better achieving their goals. There is evidence that emerging technologies and the internet are changing the way we receive, learn and memorise information, but compelling evidence of the benefits of technology on education is elusive. It is expected that educational technology could contribute to improving educational achievements and increase competitiveness of EU workers. It is clear that more technology does not yield better results by itself, as countries performing better in education worldwide and within the EU show a moderate use of technology. How technology is integrated in the educational process is the factor that makes the difference. Trends Ultra broadband connection and service migration into the cloud allow sharing information and working in collaborative environments. Ubiquitous access promoted by faster mobile networks and intelligent mobile devices creates new ways of communication anywhere, anytime. Personal mobile devices could play a more important role in the educational environment, allowing more flexible uses while keeping the cost low. Unfortunately, currently there is a lack of high-speed connectivity at the school level in the EU, with most schools still being equipped with personal computers and very limited use of personal devices for educational purposes. Furthermore, providing innovative infrastructure and deploying technology needs to be combined with innovation in the curriculum, assessment methods, pedagogies and organization of education. Learner data analytics can substantially improve education by personalising the process, but this raises security and privacy concerns. Role of stakeholders Education leaders are catalysts for change at their schools and universities. Teachers represent the most important actors, however, 75 per cent of students in the EU are taught by teachers who are not digitally confident and supportive. The role of students is becoming increasingly active in the new digital environment, but, despite being digital natives, only 30 per cent of European students can be considered digitally competent. Families should provide a home environment that supports digital learning. The industry is at the same time a provider of educational technology and a \u201cconsumer\u201d of educated employees. ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 13 Other considerations Assessing the value that educational technology brings to the society is a challenging process because of the multiple ways of using it and a wide array of short-term outcomes and long-term impacts. Educational technology is seriously affected by regulation, namely by privacy and security issues, intellectual property rights, and standardization and interoperability of the different technical platforms. Furthermore, although the access divide is shrinking because of the huge deployment of technology at schools, a new digital divide, namely the knowledge divide, is arising as a result of different abilities of students to use technology in their daily activities. The increasing speed of the technology evolution makes current policies obsolete very rapidly. Another challenge is the persistent inequalities among European countries and within the countries that make it difficult to define one- size-fit- all policies. No one solution fits all Such a wide and complex task cannot be addressed by a simple and single intervention. Comprehensive on-going policies are required, covering technological, methodological, economic and regulatory aspects and counting on strong stakeholders\u2019 engagement. In addition, careful evaluation of the results of different interventions is crucial. 4.5. ICT and Developing Countries Lead Panel Member: Virginie ROZI\u00c8RE Project duration: October 2014 to May 2015 This study will build on the conclusions of two past STOA studies on 'Developing Countries and the ICT Revolution' (March 2001) and 'Health and ICT in Developing Countries' (February 2004). Unrealised potentials of ICTs Over recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of the potential of ICTs to tackle a wide range of health, social and economic problems and provide opportunities for inhabitants of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). By improving access to information and enabling communication, ICT can play a role in achieving the Millennium Development Goals such as the elimination of extreme poverty, combating serious diseases and universal primary education. However, the benefits of ICTs are not fully realised in many countries, as ICTs are often out of reach of the poor and those in rural areas. In addition unequal provisions for access to information, knowledge and networks (\u2018digital divide\u2019) mean that many LMICs are unable to seize the opportunities that ICTs bring. To support the diffusion of ICTs in LMICs, many observers suggest that the EU should alter its approach if it is to improve the effectiveness of its actions in the diffusion of ICTs in LMICs. ICTs working for development: the EU's role The study will examine the availability and the impact of ICTs on LMICs, with a specific focus on the health sector. By reviewing the recent literature available, it will first analyse the role of ICTs in the development and reduction of poverty and clarify the main obstacles that currently prevent LMICs from benefiting from ICTs. It will then elucidate which support ICTs may provide to reducing inequalities and strengthening health systems in LMICs. In addition, present and future EU actions and policies in the area of improving ICT diffusion in LMICs will be assessed. Finally, the study will provide policy options for future action which the EU and the European Parliament could undertake to help these countries profit from the full potential of ICTs. These policy options will be based on different levels of support from the EU institutions and organizational approaches. Besides literature review, the study will collect original data by conducting surveys and interviews with leading figures in the fields of international co-operation and development and ICTs in LMICs.

Impact and potential of collaborative Internet and additive manufacturing technologies Lead Panel Member: Virginie ROZI\u00c8RE Project duration: October 2014 to June 2015 Workshop: 27 January 2015 Leveraging the potentials of the crowd A new set of Internet tools and services is allowing virtual communities to easily co- create digital assets and intellectual content at a very low cost. Complex projects can be crowd-sourced and crowd-funded by small and medium sized companies to reduce their cost of doing business. The crowd uses and modifies Open Data to co-create new open- designs for the purpose of participating in crowd-sourced projects. New business and economic models are needed for exploitation of the collective intelligence of the Internet community. Breakthrough of new manufacturing technologies Thanks to the rapid advances in 3D printing, 3D scanning, robotic and Contour Crafting technologies, it begins to be possible to build, from digital data, cheaper objects using much less material than if manufactured traditionally using subtractive manufacturing industrial technologies. New object designs are possible that possess innovative physical properties impossible to obtain otherwise. If 3D printing technology continues to develop, it will be possible to 3D-print some objects when and where needed using designs co-created by many users, and downloaded (legally or illegally) from the Internet. Labour, transport and storage costs might be dramatically reduced, further contributing to the potential emergence of a new industrial era. Innovation and growth through Open Data Making the data produced by public administrations and private companies, as well as generated automatically by connected systems publicly available to all users could push and drive the economy, since this information can be re-used and exploited to create new innovative services. Shift to crypto-currencies On the payment side, the development of the use of crypto-money such as BitCoin might disintermediate banks, credit card companies and other central players in the payment business, making financial traceability and identity tracking harder to achieve for law enforcement and fiscal purposes. Foresight aspects The study will review the latest developments of different Internet and additive manufacturing technologies and their forecasted breakthroughs in the next 10 years. Examples of such technologies include: crowd-sourcing and -funding, Big Data, crypto-currencies, robotics and 3D printing. The study will also analyse the potential long-term impacts of these technologies on service and manufacturing industries, as well as their global macro-economic implications. It will further attempt to identify the likely scenarios in the way services will be designed and goods manufactured in the next 10 years and how it this will affect the society. The study will also identify the key stakeholders involved and it will outline policy options for turning the potentials of these technologies into gains and overcoming the possible barriers identified. Some of the policy areas to be considered include: ",

Being human in a hyper-connected era - The Onlife Initiative This workshop was held on 2 December 2014 with the aim of defining what makes us human in the modern world, where technology has penetrated every domain of society and private life. It was chaired by Ms KAILI, First STOA Vice-Chair. Robert MADELIN, Director-General responsible for the Digital-Agenda for Europe in the European Commission's DG CONNECT, moderated the event, and Mr R\u00dcBIG, STOA Chair, made the closing remarks. The Onlife Initiative The deployment of ICTs and their uptake by society affect radically the human condition by modifying our relationships to ourselves, to others, and to the world. This reshapes established reference frameworks, which impact the public space, the politics itself and societal expectations towards policy-making. The Onlife Initiative gathered scholars in anthropology, cognitive science, computer science, engineering, law, neuroscience, philosophy, political science, psychology and sociology to explore the policy- relevant consequences of those changes. The result of this collective thought exercise was the Onlife Manifesto, published in early 2015. Technologies reshape us The speakers at the workshop reflected on how to re-engineer, re-invent and re-implement our rights such as privacy and freedom, and concepts such as attention, precaution and democracy, in a new technological culture. Technologies change our behaviour and our ethics, creating new values, needs and rights. For example, ultrasound technologies enable us to determine the health of a foetus, thus providing parents with information they can chose to use for deciding to terminate a pregnancy, when the Down syndrome is present. In the past we did not have such technologies and new ethical challenges arise. Another speaker suggested that the current system of representative politics is an outdated way of doing politics in a hyper-connected era. Mr MADELIN stressed that the society needs philosophers to validate politics and to help us think about new forms of public engagement and democracy. Better policy-making in a hyper-connected era Adoption of a responsible framework for research and innovation is needed for addressing and anticipating the impacts of techno-scientific developments before they happen. This pro-active approach should go beyond mere risk assessment for the purpose of risk avoidance. In a hyper- connected era everyone\u2019s behavioural data is being collected, recorded, possibly saved forever, monetised, re-manufactured, and exploited in often unexpected and uncomfortable ways. The workshop also addressed the EU data protection framework and it was suggested that more responsible policy-making was needed to encourage industries to enable their users to envision how their private and behavioural information could be used in the future.

Intervention tools and strategies to improve health programmes: The role of operational research in low- and middle-income countries This workshop was organised on 4 March 2014 in order to examine ways of optimising healthcare measures and discuss the \u2018what, why and how\u2019 of health services research in developing countries. The workshop was co-chaired by Ant\u00f3nio CORREIA DE CAMPOS, STOA Chair in the second half of the 7 th legislature, and Amalia SARTORI, MEP, who was Chair of the ITRE Committee at the time. STOA organised the workshop in collaboration with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, and WHO TDR (Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, hosted at the World Health Organization). Operational research for bridging the gap between research and implementation During the workshop it was agreed that there was often a huge gap between research and application of its findings. Operational research could demonstrate how to introduce and scale up interventions which could have an important impact on public health. It could produce evidence-based solutions for concrete health problems and help implementers and policy-makers to act in accordance with feasible alternative strategies. Large amounts of routine monitoring data are collected within public health systems by ministries of health and/or NGOs. But such data is rarely used. In addition, there is little information about using the research findings in practice and for policy-making. The Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative (SORT IT), under the umbrella of the WHO, was mentioned as promising for country-level capacity building. This initiative teaches the practical skills for conducting and publishing operational research. Better support for operational research Participants also recognised that very limited funding was available for operational research within health programmes. Embedding research into national programmes and health systems was suggested for ensuring cost efficiency, encouraging NGOs and low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) to better embrace operational research, increasing knowledge of scientific literature and better data collection, monitoring and feedback systems. Finally, although international institutions such as The Global Fund Against Tuberculosis, AIDS and Malaria allow up to 10% of country grants to be invested in operational research, absorption of such funds has been poor due to lack of operational research capacity on the ground. It was said that, as the world's largest aid donor, the EU is ideally positioned to support international research collaboration. However, until now the thrust of EU research investment has been towards developing new technologies, drugs, and clinical trials. Knowledge on how to implement these new findings for maximum public health benefit is lacking and could be enhanced by specific EU support and funding for operational research. The EU could also help to get operational research moving rapidly, by investing in programmes like SORT IT. This would enhance the effectiveness of public health interventions in LMICs and bridge the gap between research and implementation. ",

Technological innovation strategies in substance use and psychiatric disorders Project duration: December 2014 to July 2015 This STOA study focuses on the application of technology to the delivery of interventions for the treatment and recovery management of substance use disorders. The study is intended to highlight the current and future state of the science in this area of intervention delivery. Large potentials of technology The field of substance abuse treatment has seen considerable advances in identifying effective interventions such as pharmacotherapies and psychosocial therapies. Despite being at an early stage, a growing line of research has highlighted the promising role that technology may play in improving the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and reach of efforts to assess, prevent, treat, and support the recovery management of substance use disorders. Using technology to deliver evidence-based interventions allows for these complex activities to be implemented with enhanced fidelity and at lower cost, without placing further demands on the time of healthcare professionals. Furthermore, technology may enable entirely new models of care for substance use disorders within, and outside of, current systems of care. Analysing current practices Research is needed to understand how much these technologies are, at present, part of the everyday activities of health personnel working in the addiction field in the EU, which are the technologies more frequently used, if caregivers consider these technologies potentially useful, best ways to engage patients in using these tools, the types of individuals who do (and do not) benefit from these approaches, how to best integrate these tools into different settings of addiction treatment in the EU, and the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. The study includes a literature review, a survey and semi-structured interviews. The survey will collect the responses of at least 300 European experts on drug addiction representing several EU Member States, including at least the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy. Results of the survey will be discussed in semi-structured interviews with at least 10 European leading experts in the field of drug addiction.

Responsible governance of science and technologies - Perspectives from Europe, China and India This workshop, held on 19 March 2014, was an opportunity for sharing perspectives on responsible governance from the EU and the two emerging Asian economies, China and India, and discussing meaningful and viable initiatives of public debate and engagement. Mr Paul R\u00dcBIG, First STOA Vice- Chair in the second part of the 7 th legislature, chaired the workshop, and Mr Malcolm HARBOUR, Second STOA Vice-Chair at the time, closed the event. Development of the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) concept The emergence of the notion of \u2018responsibility\u2019 in science and technology (S&T) developments is related to changes in S&T governance, such as using scientific knowledge for informing policy, raising uncertainty awareness and embedding values, interests and assumptions about S&T options. The diversity of social actors that populate the space of S&T governance broaden the range of options to be considered and the criteria for assessing them when discussing and deciding upon S&T issues. Learning and responsiveness of science and society through anticipation, reflection and inclusion should help us to orient research and technology towards desirable futures. EU research The workshop included presentations of the results of two EU- funded research projects: EST-Frame (Integrated EST framework) and GEST (Global Ethics in Science and Technology). The EST-Frame project (2012-2014) aimed to contribute to a socially robust and ethically sound research and technology development. This was done by developing an integrated approach for social impact assessment and technology evaluation (the 'TranSTEP' approach). GEST (2011-2014) was an international research project with partners from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, China and India. Its aim was to identify the role which had been, and should be, played by ethics in decision-making with regard to S&T in Europe, China and India and to promote cooperation between these regions. Experiences of China and India The state of play regarding RRI in China was illustrated starting with past and current developments in S&T governance in China, and moving on to the evolution of public attitudes towards S&T and issues related to ethics, risk and responsibility. In the future, RRI will evolve from ideology to being embedded in institutions and practice, meaning that it will concern scientists, industries, the public and the government, as well as the scaling-up and application of research findings. Moreover, public participation in S&T governance is becoming increasingly important. In India, already Mahatma Gandhi emphasised the importance of ethics and responsibility in S&T. To date, the concept has been regularly reflected in various policies and initiatives. Responsible S&T governance is seen as objective-oriented and socially responsible and can contribute to sustainable development and inclusive growth. It was emphasised that, instead of generalising, responsible governance should be understood as context-dependent, which in the Indian case encompasses \u2018access, equity and inclusion\u2019. Nevertheless, cooperation and debate are needed for sharing experiences, evaluating approaches and developing the concept further based on best practices. ",

Science Metrics - Measuring scientific performance for improved policy making This study ran from June 2012 to March 2014 and was included in the Annual Report 2013. 6.3. Towards Scientific Foresight in the European Parliament (internal study) Lead Panel Member: Paul R\u00dcBIG Project duration: April 2014 to January 2015 Presentation to the STOA Panel: 15 January 2015 This study was carried out by Lieve VAN WOENSEL with the expert trainee Darja VR\u0160\u010cAJ, both from the Scientific Foresight Service. Context At the end of the 7 th legislature the STOA Panel decided to pursue the recognition of STOA's mission as a permanent structure of the European Parliament with an explicit foresight role in science and technology. With this renewed role, the long-term, strategic nature of STOA's work is placed in the context of the current political discourse. By acquiring an additional foresight dimension, STOA\u2019s work can be firmly anchored in the agenda-setting phase of the policy-cycle. The STOA Panel and its supporting Scientific Foresight Unit aim to strengthen the EP's capacity to implement this new focus on long-term Scientific Foresight in two ways: first, by raising the awareness on techno-scientific trends amongst Members, and second, by empowering the Members and Committees to anticipate through legislative actions, taken during the current legislature, on long-term desirable futures. Aim of the study The report describes an approach to undertaking Scientific Foresight activities by making use of a reasonable time-frame (between 20 - 50 years). It is meant to be a robust approach that goes beyond traditional foresight studies, as it incorporates an additional \u2018sense-making\u2019 phase for the Members. This will translate outcomes from foresight work into an accessible description of a diverse set of possible future scenarios, and provide a range of legislative pathways. Part of the developed framework also offers a suitable methodology for the non-foresight STOA studies. For instance, the STEEPED framework for technical horizon scans (explained below) could be systematically applied in Technology Assessment (TA) studies, and enhance the impartiality and credibility of the TA approach. Importance of foresight for the EP We are living in a technological society in which scientific and technological progress shape our societal norms and cultural identities. However, besides their obvious benefits, these technologies have 'soft impacts' which are often not easily identifiable, let alone quantifiable. It is almost impossible to determine who should be held responsible for such unwanted and unintended impacts. The publication entitled 'Towards Scientific Foresight for the European Parliament' presents a framework consisting of six steps for the Scientific Foresight approach to be used in the European Parliament: ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 20 1. 'Choosing the topic' - this is done based on the following considerations: democratic wishes of MEPs, relevance to the interests of the wider European public, societal relevance of an emerging techno-scientific trend, novelty of the topic and timing (trends not necessarily yet supported by legislation). 2. 'Horizon scanning' - performed to investigate plausible impacts of a techno-scientific trend from an interdisciplinary perspective which is produced by employing a guiding framework called STEEPED, consisting of: Social aspects covering changes in social and cultural values and lifestyles; Technological aspects including how, and in which directions, technology is developing and the diversification of the use of techno-scientific devices; Economic aspects covering issues related to conjuncture, production systems, different distribution and trade systems, and consumption of goods and services; Environmental aspects embracing interactions with our natural habitat and our biophysical environment which is our planet; this category also includes the availability of natural resources; Political/legal aspects describing developments or changes in various policy-making and legislative systems or forms of governance; Ethical aspects covering individual preferences about the diverse values embedded in the broader society; Demographic aspects entailing various aspects of society, looking at the society as a collection of a varied set of social groups based upon parameters such as age, gender, religion, origin, skills, (dis)abilities, profession, education, income level, etc. 3. '360 degree envisioning' - challenging outcomes of the preceding step with the objective to identify possible, including unwanted and unintended, impacts of an emerging trend in a holistic and inclusive manner. 4. 'Scenario development' - describing a diverse set of scenarios based on identification of the drivers of change such as social or cultural values (e.g. consumerism), climate change or ageing society. 5. 'Legislative back-casting' - linking previously described scenarios to present policy-making agendas in the EU and globally so as to create concrete guidelines on how different scenarios could be reached or avoided by legislative actions. 6. 'Sense-making' - for the purpose of serving the Members and the Committees in their parliamentary work, scenarios are translated into accessible description of possible futures, with a range of future- orientated legislative pathways. This step will take the form of written reports, meetings, face-to-face explanations and a 'serious game'. A scientific article on this approach is currently being finalised and will be submitted to a peer- reviewed journal. ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 21 7. STOA Annual Lecture Towards understanding the brain - explained by a Nobel Prize winner On 14 November 2014 STOA held its traditional Annual Lecture. The 13th edition of the event featured yet another Nobel Prize winner, in the good tradition established in previous years. Professor Thomas S\u00dcDHOF, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine, delivered a keynote speech about his ground-breaking work on the functioning of brain synapses. Other speakers included Professor Rosario RIZZUTO from the University of Padua, who moderated the event; Professor David NUTT, from Imperial College London, and Elena BECKER- BARROSO, Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet Neurology. The event was chaired by the STOA Chairman, Paul R\u00dcBIG. Mairead McGUINNESS, the Vice-President responsible for STOA, welcomed the participants, while, Eva KAILI, First STOA Vice-Chair, made the closing remarks. In her opening speech, Ms McGUINNESS reflected on the state of brain diseases in Europe, explaining that approximately one-third of the European population was affected by at least one brain disorder, which had a significant mental, emotional, physical, and financial toll on individuals, families and the wider society. Therefore, the quality and quantity of European research in neuroscience is crucial for the future well-being of all our fellow citizens. Allocating \u20ac 80 billion to research and innovation within the Horizon 2020 framework programme shows the EU commitment to this goal. Building on this, Mr R\u00dcBIG stressed the importance of translating research findings into the language of policy-makers. He concluded by noting how the Annual Lecture, along with other STOA activities, contributed to bringing science closer to political decision-making. In his stock-taking of neuroscience and the way forward, Professor NUTT briefly reflected on how technology enabled grasping fragments of brain structure and function and supported treatment of diseases, such as depression. Mentioning the cost of \u20ac 800 billion attributable to mental disorders in Europe, he called for more investments into neuroscience research that currently lag behind areas such as nanotechnologies and carbon capture and storage. Understanding the synapses for understanding the brain Professor S\u00dcDHOF, together with James ROTHMAN and Randy SCHEKMAN, won the 2013 Nobel Prize for explaining the principle of synaptic function, which is based on a reaction that involves rapid and reliable release of neurotransmitters. This principle is the same for all synapses, although they differ in many properties: transmitters, receptors, speed, strength and plasticity. This illustrates the remarkable importance of his discovery, but at the same time the complexity of the overall challenge of \u2018understanding\u2019 the brain. ",
        "STOA Annual Report 2014 22 Challenges in neuroscience Professor S\u00dcDHOF further explained this complexity by highlighting three areas of importance for brain research: the molecular basis of brain function, understanding and explaining cognition and memory, and understanding disease mechanisms. These, he felt, were often put second in favour of prioritising research on disease treatments, while actually, in his view, greater focus on basic research, i.e. understanding the molecular basis of diseases, would enable better research of possible treatments. Reflexions on science policy The speaker centred the issues of science policy on values, such as knowledge and truth, and goals, such as excellence built on an open and interactive community, mentioning his personal experiences from the Silicon Valley. Furthermore, in his view, successful science needs to be collaborative and trans-national. Explaining how science should be accountable, but cannot be planned, he finally made a concrete suggestion to separate basic research from applied research and fund them independently. In conversation with Professor S\u00dcDHOF During the exchange with Ms BECKER-BARROSO, Professor S\u00dcDHOF stressed the importance for young researchers to seek mentors who value principles such as perseverance, impeccability and inspiration. He reflected on the importance of creativity and inspiration for science that were in his view sometimes forgotten as a result of a strong focus and devotion to fulfilling pre-set goals. During the discussion with the audience, Professor S\u00dcDHOF was asked to comment on a variety of questions. He explained that in his view addiction was a disease for which some were more susceptible than others, and therefore an individual should not be held culpable for it. He added that understanding the molecular basis of the brain\u2019s reward systems would help in developing treatment. Reflecting on ethics in research and respect towards human rights, he said that having strict rules and regulation protects not only humans and animals, but also the scientists themselves. Professor S\u00dcDHOF recognised the importance of underpinning political decision-making with scientific evidence, agreeing that there was a need for political leaders to seek scientific advice. He explained the role of environmental factors on brain plasticity, as brain development cannot be solely explained by genes. Finally, even though it appears that neurodegenerative diseases occur in a very narrow timeframe, these actually develop over decades but remain unnoticed for long due to the brain\u2019s huge capacity for compensation. Ms KAILI closed the event stressing the importance of research and creating research-stimulating and -supporting environments. Finally, she said, seeking the truth should be a goal for both science and politics. ",

Presentations to the STOA Panel During their meetings in Strasbourg, the members of the STOA Panel often listen to presentations of the results of on-going STOA projects. In addition, researchers and experts from different institutions and organisations are invited to give presentations and participate in discussions on techno-scientific topics and related policy issues of interest to the STOA Panel. The final reports of the following STOA projects were presented to the STOA Panel during its meetings in 2014: \uf0b7 Potentials and impacts of cloud computing services and social network websites (16 January) \uf0b7 Methanol: A future transport fuel based on Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide?

STOA Panel Workshop \u2018The bright world of European photonics For its meeting on 6 February 2014 in Strasbourg, the STOA Panel invited Mr Ronan BURGESS from DG CONNECT, European Commission, and representatives of the industry: Mr Michael WALE, Director at Oclaro Inc and Executive Board member of Photonics21, which is the representative body of the European photonics industry in the Photonics PPP (public-private partnership); Mr Carlos LEE, Director General of The European Photonics Industry Consortium (EPIC, the industry association that represents organisations working in the field of photonics in Europe); and Mr Peter HARTMANN, Director at SCHOTT AG and Chair of the European Advisory Committee of SPIE (not-for-profit international professional society for optics and photonics). The speakers presented the potential of photonics for communications, manufacturing, medicine, agriculture, military and security applications, and lighting and displays thanks to the unique properties of light. They also reflected on the features of the European photonics industry, with its strong position in manufacturing and R&D. Photonics was said to have potential for economic growth and jobs in the EU, but there was a need to go beyond Member State efforts in order to strengthen the EU capacity and position in the race with the US and China. The possible impact of recent EU legislative developments (REACH Regulation, RoHS Directive) on the manufacturing of key enabling optical materials was addressed by one of the speakers. During the discussion, Panel members reflected on funding for projects and research in the PPP, the role of universities and their cooperation with the industry, and the need for responsible legislation that would disincentivise the photonics industry from leaving the EU. It was concluded that scaling up of innovation could be fostered by linking universities and research with industry, for example through building platforms for collaboration and exchange. In addition, legislation needs to be shaped in a way that encompasses responsible use of substances for further innovation and development of the EU photonics sector and takes care of health risks and consumer protection.
