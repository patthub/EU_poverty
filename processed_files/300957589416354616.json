        "Workshop summary On 28 th -29 th Setember 2009 in Istanbul, Turkey EC-JRC's Institute for Energy organised the 7 th JRC Energy efficiency workshop on \"Effective Policies and Financial Mechanisms for Energy Efficiency in Buildings\". Over the two days of the workshop were 22 presentations divided in 3 sessions: \u25ca Session 1: Energy Efficiency Policies \u25ca Session 2: Finacing Energy Efficiency and Energy Services \u25ca Session 3: Energy Efficiency in buildings and industry: National Programmes and Projects The workshop covered the main issues of the energy efficiency policies for building sector at the EU and international level, as well as the presentation of the main programmes and financing schemes developed at international, EU and national levels. The workshop was opened by the presentation of Ms. Diana Urge-Vorsatz from Central European University, who was presenting the Opportunities for Climate Change Mitigation in the Building Sector, starting from the results of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Mr. Randall Bowie from Rockwool International presented the view of the industry associations about the re-cast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. Ms. Yasemine Biro from UN Foundation introduced the audience in the new green policy of the USA, speaking about the green stimulus, the clean energy package under the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act and about the UN Foundation Energy and Climate Change Program. Mr. Gianluca Sambucini from UN Economic Commission for Europe spoke about the latest development of the Energy Efficiency in the UNECE region and the Global Energy Efficiency (GEE21) Project, insisting on the existing financing mechanisms in the countries under survey and on the importance of financing in promoting energy efficiency. Ms. Patty Fong introduced the audience in the energy efficiency program of the European Climate Foundation focused on the implementation of the EPD and Eco-design EU Directives, as well as on securing the aggressive utility-scale energy efficiency via regulation, financing mechanisms, and incentive policies. The second session started with a group of three presentations by Ms. Philippine de T'Serclaes, IEA, Mr. Peter Johansen, World Bank and Ms. Monica Beck, KfW, showing the findings of the IEA study on energy efficiency in buildings and the ways to overcome the barriers and trigger increased investments trough well tailored policies, the main barriers in financing effective energy efficiency policies and the mecanisms implemented by a bank (KfW) for financing energy efficiency projects in buildings in Germany and Eastern Europe. Passing to the countries experience, Ms. Mirja Adler from KredEx presented the revolving fund with EU Structural Funds for energy efficiency in multi-apartment buildings in Estonia and Mr. Maxim Titov from spoke about the sustainable energy finance program in Russia managed by IFC. Mr. Ergin Kaya (EVD Energy Management) shown the latest development of the energy services companies in Turkey and Mr. Konstantinos Zaimis (BSEC) presented the BSEC Project Development Fund (PDF) and the BSEC Hellenic Development Fund (HDF) tailored for financing energy efficiency in the Black Sea neighbouring countries. Mr. Bogdan Atanasiu opened the second day of the workshop with an overview of most recent energy efficiency EU policies and the related JRC activities, followed by Mr. Erdal \u00c7aliko \u011f lu from General Directorate of Electrical Power Resources Survey & Development Administration who shown the last development of the energy efficiency policies and programmes in Turkey. The following four presentations were focused on building rehabilitation programmes in new EU MS from Central and Eastern Europe. Ms. Aniko Dobi-Rosza from DVD, Hungary presented the results of sustainable financing and deliverable mechanisms for energy efficiency projects in buildings in CEE, Ms. Raluca Voinea from Ministry of Public Works and Ms. Monika Jarzemska (KAPE) shown the ultimate results of the building refurbishment programme in Romania and Poland and Ms. Dagnija Bloumberga (Institute of Energy Systems and Environment) presented the first results from ESCO of dwellings in Latvia and the Green Investment Scheme in operation in Latvia for energy efficiency in public buildings. In the last part of the workshop, Mr. Eoin Lees (EoinLees Energy, UK) presented the energy efficiency mechanisms for lighting and appliances under Energy Company Obligations in the UK, Italy & France, Ms. Dorien Van Der Weele (Philips) shown the project on energy efficiency in buildings managed by Proceedings of the 7th JRC workshop on Energy Efficiency in Buildings Istanbul, TURKEY, 28-29 September 2009 1 ",

Once a single bill emerges from the conference, it will go back to the House and the Senate for a final vote. This is usually a formality. Finally, the bill will be sent to President Obama to sign.

The figure must be significantly bigger, as time as France, the Netherlands and the UK did not report on. Information technologies \u2022 The majority of European households (57%) had a computer and nearly half of the household population now has access to the Internet (49%) \u2022 There has been a significant increase in Internet penetration rates across Europe since 2007 (+7 percentage points). However, the Internet access remains considerably higher in the EU15 (52%) than in the NMS12 (33%). \u2022 This trend is most pronounced in Slovenia, and Cyprus (+14 percentage points) and the penetration rates remain the Czech Republic the highest in the Netherlands (86%), Denmark (80%) and Sweden (78%). \u2022 Meanwhile, less than a quarter of households in Bulgaria (22%, 57% annual growth), Greece (22%, 15,7% annual growth) and Romania (24%, 100% annual growth) have Internet access.

The overall aim of the workshop was to contribute to the implementation of the new energy efficiency measures and policies in New Member States, Candidate Countries and Neighbouring countries in the building sector and to foster a real market for energy efficiency, with a particular focus on the implementation of Directives and the European Commission Action Plan for Energy Efficiency for achieving a 20% reduction in energy consumption by 2020. To the success of the workshop contributed around 80 participants from 17 European Countries, representing national ministries and local administrations, energy agencies and energy services companies, universities, local energy companies, International, European and national financing groups and banks, commercial companies and industry associations. The presentations from these Proceedings covered instruments and solutions for financing energy efficiency, multilateral and local banks experience, the use of the carbon market and particular flexible mechanisms, ESCO projects, status of electricity consumption in enlarged EU and the European Commission energy efficiency policies and initiatives.
