        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. Introduction Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 (hereafter the Regulation) provided the legal basis between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2013 for the European Union (EU) to fund financial measures in the areas of control and enforcement, basic data collection, additional data collection, scientific advice, governance and international relations. These financial measures (along with a separate financial instrument (Council Regulation (EC) 1198/2006 on the European Fisheries Fund) were intended to support the implementation of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) as laid down in the EU Treaties and set out in the Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002. The Regulation itself (Article 29), along with the Financial Regulation (Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012) and its rules of application, require an ex post evaluation report to be prepared of the expenditure. The objectives of this ex post evaluation (completed between January and September 2015) are: to evaluate the financial measures in relation to the stated objectives in the Regulation; to provide results that can be used to improve the implementation of similar measures in the 2014-2020 programming period; to provide results which can be used by other EU institutions to assess the management, results, and utilisation of the available financing; and to feed into the annual Evaluation Report on the Union's finances based on the results achieved required under Article 318 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). As a number of evaluations or audits on areas supported by the Regulation have already been completed, the scope of the evaluation covers four \u2018thematic areas\u2019: Fisheries Partnership Agreements (FPAs); voluntary contributions to international organisations; data collection and scientific advice; and control and enforcement (excluding financial support to the European Fisheries Control Agency and to inspection and control activities carried out by Commission inspectors). The evaluation takes into account the financial commitments made between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2013, but which may have been disbursed up until 31 May 2015. Overall, EU funding for these thematic areas totalled EUR 1.62 billion of commitments and EUR 1.33 billion of payments (69% of which went to funding FPAs, 3% to international organisations, 19% to data collection and scientific advice, and 9% to control and enforcement). A theory-based approach was used for the evaluation. The formulation of \u2018intervention logics\u2019 (whereby desired relationships were defined between the funding, activities and various levels of objectives) served as the basis for assessing how the financial measures were intended to achieve the objectives of the Regulation. These intervention logics were tested and assessed through evaluation questions related to the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency (and economy), coherence (and consistency) and EU value-added of the financial measures. For all evaluation questions (and sub-questions) within each thematic area, judgement criteria were articulated, along with indicators (quantitative and qualitative), as specified in an \u2018evaluation questions matrix\u2019. Findings were built on primary and secondary data and information, before conclusions were drawn and, where appropriate, recommendations were made. Different research tools were used. Stakeholder consultations included a number of Member State visits, as well as email and telephone communication with Commission Services, administrations in EU Member States and third countries, international fisheries research and management organisations, private sector representatives of the fish catching and processing sub- sectors, and non-governmental organisations. The evaluation team\u2019s work was guided by a project Steering Group comprised of Commission staff (in particular DG MARE, DG ENV, the Secretariat General of the Commission and the JRC), which met regularly with the evaluators during the evaluation. ",
        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 6 During the evaluation, we learned some lessons that could be considered for the preparation of similar evaluations in future. In terms of success factors, the evaluation benefited from an engaged study lead from DG MARE, strong coordination within the evaluation team and between the evaluation team and the relevant units at DG MARE, a team that mixed sector and programme evaluation expertise and an engaged steering group. From the methodological side, the theory-based approach was well suited to the evaluation of the financial measures, and there was a need to gather and analyse evidence from a wide variety of primary and secondary sources. To address challenges experienced, the planning for subsequent evaluations could consider more tightly coordinated feedback requirements from administrations and other stakeholders, improvements to ongoing monitoring systems that would increase the availability of relevant data to evaluators, and an increased focus on qualitative sources to understand the contribution of the funding to Member State processes. 2. Key findings, conclusions and recommendations for funding in the area of international relations, Fisheries Partnership Agreements The Regulation provided for EUR 931.7 million of budgeted commitments and EUR 913.8 million of actual payments for access for EU vessels to fish in the waters of third countries and support for the implementation of sustainable fisheries sector policies in those countries. Funding provided by the Regulation was evaluated for both \u2018multi- species agreements\u2019 with Mauritania, Morocco, Greenland, Guinea Bissau, providing access for EU vessels to fish for a range of species groups, and for \u2018tuna agreements\u2019 for highly migratory species (i.e. tuna and tuna-like species) with Seychelles, Madagascar, Mozambique, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Kiribati, Cape Verde, Sao Tom\u00e9 and Principe, Solomon Islands and Comoros. The FPAs provided fishing opportunities for EU vessels from Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. The objectives of the funding provided by the Regulation for FPAs were: safeguarding employment in the regions of the EU dependent on fishing; securing the continued existence and competitiveness of the EU\u2019s fisheries sector; developing the fisheries resource management and control capacities of third countries to ensure sustainable fishing and promote the economic development of the fisheries sector in those countries; and ensuring adequate supply of fish for the EU market. The evaluation found the Regulation relevant in supporting the implementation of FPAs according to the orientations tabled by the Council and the principle of sound management guiding management of EU budget resources. This relevance stemmed from two main factors. First, it provided the legal basis for payment of the single financial contribution covering both access costs and sectoral support payments. Second, it detailed the specific objectives of FPAs against which FPAs can be evaluated as required by the principle of sound management enshrined in the Financial Regulations and specific Council requirements for FPAs. The funding provided was also largely effective . In terms of payments for access to fishing opportunities in third country waters, the Regulation supported employment for around 2,500 EU nationals on EU vessels in many EU coastal regions, with the highest numbers in the Spanish regions of Andalusia, Galicia, Basque Country and Canary Islands, Latvia and Lithuania, the French regions of Brittany and R\u00e9union, and the Pomorskie region of Poland. However FPA-related jobs tended to decrease over the evaluation period, primarily due to a reduction in fishing opportunities under multi- species agreements in West Africa over the evaluation period (2007-2013). The continued existence of the EU fleet, especially purse seine tuna vessels and other types of vessels with no fishing opportunities within EU waters, was effectively supported by the funding and the resulting fishing opportunities in third country waters, as evidenced by the high proportion of the EU external fleet using FPAs, and provision of access opportunities in different areas constituting a coherent regional network of fishing zones. The Regulation was effective in supporting the competitiveness of the EU fleets, due both to the stable legal environment of the FPAs that were funded, and a more level playing ",
        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 7 field between EU and non-EU vessels in third country waters that resulted. Finally with respect to intended outcomes in the EU, the funding enabling FPAs and the resulting catches was effective in supporting an adequate supply of the EU market in tuna (9% of the EU\u2019s consumption coming from FPA-related catches). For other species groups, the contribution of catches under FPAs to the EU market was much smaller at between 1% and 4% of EU consumption. The funding also led to achievements regarding the development of sustainable fishing practices in third countries waters. Sectoral support funding and mechanisms, joint scientific committees, and the non-discriminatory and transparency clauses contained in the Protocols served to generate improvements in third countries fisheries sector management, such as improved monitoring control and surveillance or scientific advice which were among the priorities of sectoral support in many agreements. There were also positive outcomes from the funding and the resulting FPAs in third countries, in terms of employment for around 3,500 third country nationals as crew on-board EU vessels, and improvements in the business climate in the third countries in particular from some sectoral support measures, such as those to strengthen health certification of fisheries products aimed for export. However, while FPAs resulted in some economic and social benefits in third countries from EU vessels transhipping or landing their catches into local ports for processing (e.g. in Seychelles, Ivory Coast, Madagascar and Kiribati), in many cases EU vessels landed fish in other third countries due to factors such as port location in relation to fishing grounds, the quality of port infrastructure, or local market conditions. In considering efficiency , the access payments were generally, but not always, cost- effective for the EU when considering: the extent to which fishing authorisations (i.e. licenses) and allowable tonnages of fish catch provided for in the agreements were used; costs paid per tonne of fish caught (and as compared to the value of catches); levels of resulting value added; and benefit cost ratios (comparing the benefits in terms of profits and labour earnings, with the costs of access). Given analysis of the costs of access paid by other third country vessels under private agreements and the fees paid by vessel owners compared to landed values of catch, the access fees negotiated by the EU can also be judged as having been advantageous to, and efficient for, vessel owners. Value for money for the EU was not however maximised in all cases, and was generally higher for tuna agreements than for multi-species agreements. For example, benefit cost ratios were less than 1 for the Mauritania and Morocco multi-species agreements, around 2 for Greenland and Guinea Bissau, but 4.5 for the Seychelles tuna FPA and 5.9 for the tuna FPA with Kiribati. Likewise the cost of access as a proportion of the sales value of the fish caught ranged between 7.5% and 13.5% for the tuna agreements with Seychelles, Ivory Coast and Kiribati, but was 23% for the Greenland multi-species agreement, 50% for the Mauritania agreement and 93% for the Morocco agreement. Given the larger share of the EU funds used for multi-species agreements (93% of the total) this reduced overall efficiency for the EU. Correspondingly, from the third countries perspective, the FPAs were more cost efficient for those countries signing multi-species agreements than for those having tuna agreements. Given the sectoral support payments made (around EUR 240 million in total over the 2007-2013 period) and the benefits of that sectoral support, the sectoral support element of the funding was considered cost- effective. However, some weaknesses both in overall effectiveness and the way in which sectoral support payments were managed and monitored (e.g. insufficient transparency of fund utilisation) led to some corresponding inefficiencies in the payments provided. Regarding the coherence of the funding provided with other initiatives, payments were used for interventions that were generally well aligned with other EU policies and interventions, such as the European Development Fund (EDF), the EU\u2019s efforts to combat IUU fishing, EU trade policy, EU policies on poverty and food security, as well as with interventions by other donors. Synergies (rather than duplication) were ensured through ",
        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 8 the Joint Committees approving matrices of actions for implementation of the sectoral support, and by the engagement of fisheries attach\u00e9s in the Delegations in the day-to- day monitoring of sectoral support. One coherence problem, which was subsequently resolved in 2013, was that FPAs did not include safeguard clauses on human rights and democratic principles, leading to difficult situations under which EU development cooperation with certain third countries was suspended based on Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement (e.g. Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritania) while payments on FPAs continued. The evaluation identified a clear EU added value of funding associated with FPAs. The EU funding supported implementation of CFP principles in external waters and the development of the fishing sector in third countries through sectoral policy dialogue. Similar contributions to these objectives would not have been possible if EU ship-owners had negotiated access to third countries\u2019 EEZs on a private basis, without EU involvement. Key recommendations for this thematic area of the evaluation are: 1. Available funding should be used to maintain current FPAs/Protocols, and where/if possible given the overall funding envelope, to enlarge current regional networks of FPAs/Protocols. 2. In order to improve the efficiency of payments for access, prior to FPAs/Protocols negotiations, the EU (informed by ex ante evaluations) should carefully evaluate the likely utilisation of fishing opportunities and trends in landed prices of fish, to inform its decision on the fishing opportunities and the costs of access to be paid. 3. In order to improve efficiency of sectoral support payments, efforts should: enhance transparency by third countries in the use of funds; carefully assess the ability of third countries to absorb and effectively use sectoral support funds; focus payments on a limited number of measurable activities and outcomes; and ensure good coordination between third countries, EU fisheries attaches, the Commission and the Joint Committees. 3. Key findings, conclusions and recommendations for funding in the area of international relations, international organisations The Regulation provided for funding to international organisations in the form of mandatory expenditure arising from the EU\u2019s membership of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) (EUR 21.1 million of budgeted commitments and EUR 20.4 million of actual payments). Funding was also applied to voluntary financial contributions to international organisations (EUR 27.9 million of budgeted commitments and EUR 23.3 million of actual payments) and membership and/or voluntary funding to organisations active in the field of the Law of the Sea, such as the International tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), and the International Seabed Authority (ISBA) (at around EUR 150,000 per year). The evaluation focused primarily on voluntary contributions to the international organisations as the amounts of funding to ISBA and ITLOS were small, and the mandatory contributions resulting from the EU\u2019s membership could not be influenced in any way in the future by the findings of the evaluation. The objective of the Regulation in this thematic area was to support efforts aimed at the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fishery resources at international level by adopting appropriate management measures for these resources. The international organisations supported the most in terms of voluntary contributions were the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), which together accounted for 94% of the total payments made. The rest of the funding was split between a further seven organisations. Funding was provided for different types ",
        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 9 of action such as meetings or projects, and for actions with a different focus such as data collection and science, control and surveillance, or developing country capacity improvements. The evaluation concluded that EU voluntary contributions to international organisations were relevant in that they were directed to organisations with demonstrable needs. These were i) a mandate to manage stocks which were often overfished, subject to overfishing, and / or not assessed at all; ii) weak institutional performance as documented in performance reviews; iii) high numbers of low and middle income countries suggesting the need for financial support; and iv) limited levels of core funding to meet management and science needs. The relevance demonstrated of both the funding in general terms and its spread across different organisations may be partly explained by the fact that EU support was \u2018demand-driven\u2019 in the sense that it responded to recommendations coming from the organisations themselves, as first discussed with the EU at the meetings of the organisations at which EU representatives were present. The evaluation considered effectiveness in terms of the contribution to improved fisheries management. While some meetings funded led directly to the adoption of new management measures, most meetings lacked the mandate for such substantial changes. Instead, they contributed to \u2018softer\u2019 parts of the decision-making process (such as sharing information, agreeing to future action) that eventually (potentially) led to the adoption of new management measures. Even for meetings with a mandate to agree management changes, international organisations operate based on a consensus-based decision-making process, meaning that change can never be attributed solely to any one actor. In terms of the areas where improvements were made, many of the projects funded, such as those implemented by FAO in the Mediterranean and by ICCAT on Bluefin tuna research, focused on improving data collection and science. Others, such as a major project in the Indian Ocean (the Regional Fisheries Surveillance Project, implemented by the IOC) were concerned with control and surveillance. While stakeholders were unanimous in their views that such projects were effective in achieving their aims, project evaluation reports were often unavailable or contained weak evidence of actual achievements, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about individual project performance. This was partly due to a lack of measurable indicators, which were also often poorly specified to the EU in grant applications or not specified at all. Capacity-building actions and funds to enable stakeholders from developing countries to attend international meetings supported greater levels of engagement by developing country representatives in international organisations. The evidence suggests that this had some effect in terms of the specific objective of contributing to conservation and sustainable exploitation of resources at the international level. In terms of efficiency , there were good levels of \u2018additionality\u2019 in the sense that without EU support, the funded actions would often either not have happened at all, or would have occurred but only to a lesser extent or at a later date. Levels of co-financing by the EU (which typically have a maximum limit of around 70-80%) were judged as having been at an appropriate level in the sense that they required organisations to make a sufficient commitment alongside the EU funding, and were neither so high that they crowded out other sources of funding nor so low that organisations were unable to secure the necessary co-financing. Further evidence for efficiency is provided by utilisation rates, which for all the different foci and types of action were high and generally in excess of 80%, with a total utilisation rate for the thematic area funding as a whole of 85%. In terms of the administration of the funding, compulsory payments to RFMOs were made on time by the EU. While there were some delays in voluntary payments (mainly related to delays in requests by beneficiaries for the balancing payments after pre-financing had occurred), the vast majority of funds were disbursed as planned. However, despite these ",
        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 10 generally positive findings, making robust and conclusive judgements about the efficiency of the meetings and projects funded was difficult. As with evaluating effectiveness, this was due to several factors, namely a lack of suitable indicators (which were not required in grant applications made to the EU), insufficient information from regular reporting by beneficiaries, and incomplete / poorly evidenced evaluation reports from individual projects. The funding provided by the Regulation, as well as the actions it enabled, was coherent with the CFP and other EU policies. With regard to the former, the Regulation\u2019s stated objective is nearly identical to the first objective stated in Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002. In terms of alignment with EU development policy, the evaluation identified synergies with development projects funded under the EDF, as well as with other EU maritime policies such as the fight against IUU fishing and with funding provided to the international organisations by other parties. The demand-driven nature of projects and the process for their being proposed and agreed by the EU (as discussed under relevance above) also ensured that actions in support of international organisations complemented other activities/projects funded either through the core funding of the organisations or by non-EU members. Financial support for international organisations by the EU resulted in a range of benefits to the organisations that would not have occurred if the support had not been provided, and was therefore indicative of the EU added value of the intervention. The support had value in terms of supporting the objectives of the organisations themselves, the Regulation, and the CFP. Intervention in the form of actions funded by the EU ensured that the interests of the EU as a whole were supported. Following on from the findings and conclusions, the key recommendation for this thematic area relates not so much to methods of improving effectiveness and efficiency, because as noted above performance was generally good. The recommendation rather concerns administrative processes related to the grant application and management process, particularly weaknesses this assessment identified in project monitoring and evaluation. In order to improve the ability to better demonstrate positive performance and results in terms effectiveness and efficiency, grant applicants should be required to articulate how intermediate aims of the action would contribute to the specific objective of the Regulation. Applicants should also include robust monitoring and evaluation provisions, both for on-going performance management and later measurements of effectiveness and efficiency. Relevant indicators and means for verification would form an important part of such provisions. Progress against these indicators should then be included within regular reporting requirements. 4. Key findings, conclusions and recommendations for funding in the area of basic data collection, additional data collection, and scientific advice The Regulation enabled budgeted commitments of EUR 324.9 million and actual payments of EUR 252.9 million, on data collection and scientific advice under Articles 9- 11. EU co-financing was made available to Member States and key research and science institutions such as the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The objective of the funding provided was to contribute to improving the collection and management of the data and scientific advice required to assess the state of resources, the level of fishing and the impact that fisheries have on the resources and the marine ecosystem, and the performance of the fishing industry, within and outside EU waters. The intention was for financial support to the Member States to result in established multi-annual aggregated and science-based datasets incorporating biological, environmental, social and economic information. The co-financing provided by the EU was relevant in helping Member States meet their data collection needs as specified in the Data Collection Framework (DCF), and in generating the data and outputs used by science and research organisations to generate their advice. Relevance of data collection was further evidenced by the need for the ",
        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 11 resulting data to inform EU policy-making, and to be used in evaluations required of EU expenditure, and by the fact that the EU on its own would have been very unlikely to have been able to have collected the necessary data in Member States. Funding for ad hoc studies and pilots projects in the area of additional data collection, which tended to focus on topics where basic data collection under the DCR/DCF did not provide sufficient information to inform scientific advice, was viewed by more than three-quarters of stakeholders surveyed as being necessary to improve fisheries management decision making at the Member State level. Funding for scientific advice (100% financed rather than co-financed) through the Regulation was also relevant given the need for ICES and STECF to respond to requests for advice. Considering effectiveness , the funding enabled by the Regulation was largely effective in improving data coverage in response to data calls, and improvements in data storage, management and transmission. The number of fields of data collected by all Member States increased from 1,718 to 2,046 between 2008 and 2012, for example, as did the number of secure databases in use by Member States. Co-financing was especially effective in supporting improvements in the transmission of data, through refinement and standardisation of data exchange formats. Documentation of Member State databases and procedures for data transmission also improved during 2007-2013, with financing under the financial instrument effective in facilitating this improvement. Ad hoc studies allowed for the generation of guidance generally considered by Member States as useful for data collection programmes to improve both the quality and timeliness of data transmission. And the regional coordination meetings funded by the EU were generally effective in harmonising data collection across Member States, and in supporting potential improvements in management advice by increasing data robustness. Also on a positive note, although establishing clear causal links is difficult, it is likely that STECF advice was effective in influencing many areas of management decision making under the CFP. For instance, STECF advice on discards may have directly informed the preparation of Article 15 of the new CFP (the landing obligation). However, despite these generally positive conclusions about the effectiveness of the financial measures, data submission failures by Member States, while reducing over the evaluation period, remained in some cases and were most common for economic and processing industry data, and for transversal and survey data under the Mediterranean and Black Sea reporting obligations. In addition, while Commission proposals on Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas mirrored the advice provided by ICES, hinting at a potentially strong link between scientific advice and management decision making, the influence of scientific advice on the actual management measure agreed on by the Council (i.e. the agreed TAC) was not linear, as demonstrated by final TACs that were often higher than EC TAC proposals. The evaluation also concluded that the Regulation was not very effective in resulting in the collection of data on social issues, and therefore in enabling STECF to be able to provide socio-economic advice to feed into decision- making processes, although this was more a weakness of the DCF failing to require necessary socio-economic variables than of the Regulation itself. Turning to efficiency , the cost of basic data collection remained less than 1% of the total value of landings of the European fleet for each of the years between 2007 and 2013, with EU expenditure as a proportion of the value of landings peaking in 2010 (at 0.77%) and falling to its lowest level in 2012 (at 0.32%) when expenditure was approximately EUR 22 million compared to landings valued at EUR 6.9 billion. There are few directly comparable international benchmarks available to assess the extent to which such costs represented value for money, and comparing costs between countries/regions and drawing conclusions about relative efficiency is not straightforward. Some earlier studies (e.g. Burke, 2000) and data from South Africa do however suggest that funding provided by the Regulation for data collection in the EU provided value for money. Ad hoc studies and pilot projects were typically completed by contractors based on competitive tendering processes, which would also suggest that value for money was attained. And ",
        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 12 the cost of these studies was only 0.04% of the landed value of catch during the evaluation period, suggesting good value for money given their positive impacts as noted above when discussing effectiveness. Regional coordination of data collection as supported by the coordination meetings, and potentially also by the guidance provided by ad hoc studies, contributed to cost savings for Member States, with the mean expenditure by Member States on national data collection programmes decreasing by 27% during the period 2007-2013. In terms of the efficiency (and economy) of the scientific advice funded by the Regulation, EC requests for advice were generally delivered by ICES and STECF in a timely fashion and in accordance with the underlying Terms of Reference and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), and both ICES and STECF provided the advice requested of them within the budget allocated. ICES delivered 1,512 items of advice at a total cost of EUR 19.9 million and a cost of EUR 13,458 per item of advice, including costs of experts\u2019 time (with costs per stock assessment being broadly equivalent to those for the US National Marine Fisheries Service). STECF provided 394 items of advice at a total cost of EUR 5.37 million and a cost of EUR 13,629 per item. The unit cost per piece of advice decreased during the evaluation period, in particular for the economic and technical advice provided by STECF, suggesting improvements in cost-effectiveness over time. The data collection and scientific advice enabled by the Regulation was coherent with the CFP, considering the Regulation\u2019s specified objective for this thematic area and the results financial measures supported on the one hand, and the implicit requirements for data collection and scientific advice required by the 2002 CFP on the other, for example when establishing management plans and setting targets, and when consulting the STECF. The Regulation\u2019s support for data collection was also coherent with the requirements of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) for Member States to prepare an outline \u2018Technical Assessment\u2019, with data for Descriptor 3 (commercial fish stocks) collected under the DCF. Many of the Member State fisheries administrations made extensive use of the data collected under the DCF and financed by the Regulation, suggesting additional coherence between the Regulation and the work programmes of Member State administrations. Data and scientific advice enabled by the Regulation were publicly available supporting coherence with EU policies on freedom of information and knowledge sharing. The added value of the Regulation in terms of data collection, related to the positive outcomes described above under effectiveness which would not have been realised through Member States funding of data collection. The added value of the funding for scientific advice by EU institutions related to: the improved cost effectiveness of scientific advice provided at an EU level rather than by all Member States, especially when stocks are shared; provision of advice at an ocean basin level; and a clear separation between the science conducted at the EU level and MS interests, thereby engendering trust by Member States in the scientific process. A recommendation of the evaluation in the area of data collection is that to support effectiveness and efficiency, efforts should be focused towards improvement in the timeliness of data submissions, and submission of complete data fields (specifically discard data, particularly in reference the EU landing obligation). Progress could be made by supporting the means for Member States to store and transmit the required data, but also reviewing the timing of data calls if necessary to ensure that unnecessary administrative burden is not put on Member States. The key recommendation of the evaluation in the area of scientific is that, regarding the evaluation in the area of effectiveness, the EC should construct a mechanism for mapping the pathway from an item of scientific advice (produced by STECF, ICES or other organisations) to policy decision. This is needed to firmly establish the effectiveness of scientific advice in terms of informing policy decision making, which was not possible in this evaluation. Such a mechanism might be based on a comprehensive referencing system that is used to log all advisory documents used in the different stages of policy preparation and drafting. Moreover, the same mechanism, if used by other parts of the EC, may also assist the ",
        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 13 evaluation of coherence between fisheries scientific advice and other EU policies (as illustrated, for example, by the use of topical STECF advice \u2013 e.g. bycatch or ecosystem impact of fishing \u2013 by DG ENV to draft environmental policy). 5. Key findings, conclusions and recommendations for funding in control and enforcement The Regulation enabled EUR 309.9 million of budgeted commitments and EUR 122.5 million of actual payments on control and enforcement (not including financial support to the European Fisheries Control Agency and to inspection and control activities carried out by Commission inspectors). The Regulation\u2019s objective for this thematic area was to contribute to improving the control of fishing activities in order to ensure effective implementation of the CFP within and outside EU waters. This was to be achieved by enhancing Member States control and enforcement capacities and reducing identified weaknesses in their fisheries control activities. Co-financing was provided of measures such as: new control technologies (such as the introduction of Electronic Reporting Systems (ERS), Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), and modernisation of fishing monitoring centres); training and exchange programmes; pilot inspection and observer schemes; cost/benefit analysis and assessments of expenditure incurred by competent authorities; and awareness raising with fishermen of the need to combat IUU fishing. The Commission played a steering role in the implementation of measures and had the ability to approve or reject Member States co-funding requests based on the annual priorities it identified and communicated to Member States. The funding provided was relevant when considering the needs as reflected in: i) the many fish stocks in EU waters which were not considered to be fished inside safe biological limits (around 65% in 2007 falling to around 40% in 2013), ii) infringement rates over 2007 to 2013 of around 10% of inspections, showing that control activities were not yet effective in ensuring full compliance with regulations, iii) the large number of projects (2,119) submitted to the EU for funding by Member States; and iv) Member States control authorities\u2019 views that funding was required to enhance Member States and wider EU monitoring, control and enforcement capacities. At the end of the programming period, many projects supported action plans for the reduction of control weaknesses. Member States provided numerous reasons for those projects that have failed to be initiated or implemented ranging from changes in Member States policy or management priorities, challenges for Member States in providing their own funding contributions to the agreed actions, and insufficient administrative capacity which, in many cases, resulted in missed deadlines. The effectiveness of the Regulation for this thematic area was unclear with no conclusive picture as to whether any particular expenditure categories of control and enforcement activities contributed to enhanced Member States control and enforcement capacities and compliance with the rules of the CFP. The relationship between the total co-funding and the number of inspections was positive, suggesting that EU financing did facilitate the development of Member States capacity necessary to increase levels of inspections. Effectiveness was undermined by the low overall utilisation of budget as just noted (and for the reasons given), suggesting that there was a missed opportunity to use available funds to improve control and enforcement capabilities. While 87% of the funds used were on actions in support of new technologies, information technology (IT) networks and electronic recording (such as electronic logbooks and VMS), there were no discernible trends between expenditure on such items and infringements related to their installation, although in general Member States compliance with VMS and ERS obligations did increase over the evaluation period. Funding by the EU for training represented less than 1% of the total EU expenditure on Member States control and enforcement activities. As a consequence, few training events were held by the Member States and positive outcomes were therefore limited. In terms of the effectiveness of the Regulation in ",
        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 14 supporting regional coordination, there were few electronic data exchanges between the Member States (at least as reported by them in evaluation questionnaires). On a more positive note, the number of inspections did increase over the implementation period of the Regulation, with Member States generally of the view that EU co-financing may have contributed to such increases. There was also a measurable increase in the average attendance at regional control expert meetings/workshops over the evaluation period. Indicators of inspections related to the length of Member States coastline and the number of weight of fish landings suggest a degree of uniformity between Member States, which may have been partly supported by the funds available through the Regulation, but this causal relationship is not identifiable. The efficiency of the Regulation also appears to have been low, in terms of the costs when held up against the outcomes, although this conclusion should be considered provisional on the basis that around half of the co-financed projects are still subject to payments. This is partly due to the low effectiveness as discussed above, and partly due to the poor \u2018economy\u2019 in terms of many approved projects failing to have been implemented, or having been started but then abandoned. However, some value for money was demonstrated through the positive relationship between: i) total co-financing expenditure per Member States and the detection of infringements, suggesting that MS receiving greater financial support were able to better convert this into tangible control and enforcement outcomes, and ii) funding for VMS and ERS, and compliance by Member States with related obligations, suggesting efficiency in allowing Member States to enforce the relevant EU legislation on these technologies. The Regulation, and the funding on control and enforcement enabled, was coherent with other EU interventions. Measures eligible for funding under the Regulation were not eligible under Council Regulation (EC) 1198/2006 on the European Fisheries Fund thereby preventing duplication. And the measures supported, along with the objective of those measures as stated in the Regulation, were well aligned with the 2002 CFP and in particular Chapter V (EU Control and Enforcement System). The added value of the Regulation and EU involvement in supporting improvements in Member States control capacities, laid primarily in providing finance for Member States to support the introduction of VMS and ERS at a speed and resulting in a coverage that would otherwise have been unlikely if left to the Member States on their own. A key recommendation of the evaluation is, to support effectiveness, the EU should more clearly plan in advance or alternatively have greater flexibility in its annual control and enforcement priorities in order to better match with Member State needs and thus improve uptake of funds. This might be achieved through the development of a widely communicated multiyear plan setting out EU priorities and/or through a mechanism that allows under certain conditions for Member States to submit ex ante or ex post applications for control and enforcement activities. 6. Findings, conclusions and recommendations of the overarching evaluation and recommendations The overarching part of the evaluation served several objectives. Firstly, it aimed to identify, across the thematic areas \u2013 although they were very different \u2013 common issues and trends and success factors. Secondly, the overarching evaluation built on the thematic outcomes to assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and EU added value of the Regulation as a whole. The Regulation was found relevant to the extent that it responded to create a stable and results-oriented financial framework supporting the implementation of the CFP. The thematic evaluations concluded that the funding provided in each domain responded to the needs identified, especially in the case when the funding was demand-driven. The alignment of priorities / objectives at different levels (EU, Member States but also third partners) proved a key factor in ensuring that the funding made available by the EU ",
        "Ex post evaluation on Union financial measures for the implementation of the CFP and in the area of the Law of the Sea 2007-2013 15 would have a leverage effect and that the needs identified ex ante would be actually addressed. In addition, the Regulation also responded to the need for simplification. Placing funding for several thematic measures under a single regulatory umbrella encouraged potential synergies between the measures in supporting the implementation of the CFP. The evaluation identified considerable achievements across all four thematic areas, which provides evidence for the effectiveness of the Regulation as a whole, despite variations within and between thematic areas. Given the relative importance of the FPAs, the assessment of effectiveness in this thematic area influenced greatly the conclusions about the effectiveness of the Regulation as a whole. Across measures, the evaluation revealed three main success factors and three particular challenges in terms of the impact reached. A demand-driven approach, the alignment of priorities and regional coordination \u2013 at programming and implementation stage \u2013 contributed to enhancing the effectiveness of the Regulation by earmarking the funding where it was needed and allowing for the projects to be actually implemented. However, the impact depended on the absorption capacity of the beneficiaries (Member States and third parties), as well as on the challenges of multi-level governance and complex decision-making process. The overall efficiency of the Regulation depended on the cost-effectiveness of the different thematic areas, and the impacts achieved set against their relative financial importance. EU funding was spent cost-effectively and represented good value for money, despite differences between and within thematic areas. The economic performance was assessed as good against international comparison. Success factors included process-related aspects, such as regional coordination, and the leverage of co- funding. The evaluation also identified some weaknesses, which were more formal than substantial. They related mainly to the insufficiencies of the monitoring and of the assessment of effectiveness. Nevertheless, in the specific control and enforcement area, implementation failures led to a sub-optimal use of the available funding \u2013 although this finding is provisional as payments are still ongoing. The coherence of the Regulation as a whole was assessed both internally (between the four thematic areas) and externally (between the Regulation and other EU interventions with related objectives). From the internal coherence perspective, interventions in the four thematic areas covered by this evaluation contributed to the objectives of the Regulation not only individually but also through the synergies created between different types of actions. In particular, data collection and scientific advice and control and enforcement objectives were streamlined in the other intervention areas to maximise the financial support provided. Alignment of priorities and objectives at high and operational level overall ensured the absence of contradictions and the creation of synergies between the four areas. Complementarities and synergies were also created between the Regulation and other EU interventions, thereby contributing to the external coherence of the Regulation. EU development and Europe 2020 were two main EU interventions with objectives, funding and projects that were mutually supportive and coherent with the Regulation. The synergies created between the EU development policy and the financial measures had important ramifications in terms of (notably) institution or capacity building, the sustainable economic and social development of fisheries-dependent regions and the empowerment of local economic actors. A high degree of coherence was also achieved between the financial measures and Europe 2020, with the contributions of the financial measures to three flagship initiatives, improving resource efficiency, steering innovation and maintaining/creating jobs in the fisheries sector. Building on the positive assessment of effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of the Regulation as a whole, the evaluation also concluded on the EU added value of the financial measures . The Regulation encouraged consistent approaches across thematic measures, thereby strengthening the impact of the actions implemented.
