        "17. Takes note of the idea of creating a Transatlantic Energy Council; underlines strongly that it should deal only with the clearly foreign and security policy-related aspects of this issue and should in the future be integrated into the Transatlantic Political Council (TPC), and that the TEC should deal with overall energy policy; 18. Welcomes the recent extension of the visa waiver programme to another seven EU Member States; urges the US, however, to lift the visa regime for the entire EU and to treat all EU citizens equally and on the basis of full reciprocity; criticises the planned introduction of administrative fees for the granting of Electronic System for Travel Authorisations (ESTA) to EU citizens as a retrograde step and calls on the Commission to treat this as a priority with the US administration, including the option of imposing reciprocity; 19.

Underlines that a closer transatlantic partnership with a view to the completion of a transatlantic market by 2015, based on the principle of a social market economy, is a vital instrument for shaping globalisation and for dealing with global economic and social crises; points out that many of the non-tariff barriers to trade and investment which the TEC is called upon to remove are rooted in the deliberate efforts of legislative bodies to foster the achievement of social, health-related, cultural or environmental objectives, and hence must not be abolished without a corresponding legislative act; 21. Requests the Commission to set out a detailed road map of existing obstacles to the attainment of that target; recalls the study which Parliament authorised and financed in its 2007 budget; wonders why neither of these documents has so far been released by the Commission despite repeated requests by Parliament that it do so; sets 15 November 2009 as the final date for their submission for publication; 22.

Calls on the US authorities and the Commission to further intensify their negotiations to find balanced solutions concerning inter alia, air security needs and data protection in the field of passenger name records (PNR), reviews of security checks at airports and the more effective incorporation of measures to reduce the impact of transatlantic and international aviation on climate into the Copenhagen negotiations and ICAO agreements; EN C 265 E/18 Official Journal of the European Union 30.9.2010 Thursday 22 October 2009 ",
        "The role of the TLD in the TEC 26. Calls once again on the leadership of the EU and the US, as well as the co-chairs of the TEC, to take account of the crucial role of legislators for the success of the TEC; urges them to involve the representatives of the TLD fully and directly in the TEC, as legislators share with their respective executive branches responsibility for the enactment and oversight of many of the TEC decisions; 27. Believes that it is essential to ensure that the most appropriate members of Congress and of the European Parliament are brought into the Legislators' Dialogue and the TEC process, in order to make sure that legislation has no unintended consequences for transatlantic trade and investment; hopes that the new agreement could upgrade the current TLD into a transatlantic interparliamentary assembly, following recommendations made by Parliament in its above-mentioned resolution of 26 March 2009; TEC and the economic and financial crises 28. Welcomes the fact that the TEC is advised by a range of stakeholders, including representatives of business, and calls for a comparable role to be given to representatives of the trade union movement on each side of the Atlantic, so that the social dimension is fully included; calls for the heads of the Trans\u00ad atlantic Labour Dialogue and the future Transatlantic Energy Dialogue to be included in the Group of Advisers; however, is of the view that their consultative role is to be differentiated from the legislative role of the US Congress and the European Parliament; 29. Underlines the role of the TEC in promoting and ensuring a coordinated US-EU regulatory response to the crises, in particular regarding alternative investment funds, financial market infrastructure (especially as regards over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets), capital requirements, tax havens and cross-border insolvency resolution; calls on the TEC to examine the coordination of, and best practice with regard to, remuneration policy for financial institutions, ensuring that remuneration is based on long-term results, and thus reducing risk exposure; 30. Emphasises that the risk of a credit crunch is not over; stresses in this regard that coordinated macroeconomic policies are vital to achieving a sustainable global economic recovery and addressing the rising level of unemployment; 31. Calls on the TEC to insist that the US authorities take into account changes to the EU capital requirements directives when implementing the Basel II framework; welcomes the proposal of the US Government to regulate all OTC derivatives and its work on a central clearing house for complex structured products, and calls on the TEC to examine how to promote a coordinated approach concerning treatment of asset classes and corporations as well as infrastructure equivalence; 32. Calls on the TEC to ensure that the US authorities coordinate with the proposed EU directive on alternative investment fund managers (the AIFM Directive), in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage; 33. Urges the TEC to address the issue of \u2018too big to fail\u2019 institutions and supports the G-20 proposals for \u2018living will\u2019 contingency plans for systemically important cross-border institutions; considers that systemically important financial institutions could be subject to stricter disclosure requirements such as limitations on commercial confidentiality, in the same way as dominant companies can be under EU competition policy; 34.

Urges the TEC to insist that the US authorities abide by their road map for requiring US domestic users to apply the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); recalls its request that, until the US adopts the IFRS, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should recognise the IFRS, as adopted by the EU and until the decision requiring US users to apply the IFRS has been made, as being equivalent to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the US (US GAAP); urges the TEC to promote the development of a country-by-country breakdown of reporting for multinational groups; EN 30.9.2010 Official Journal of the European Union C 265 E/19 Thursday 22 October 2009 ",
        "36. Hopes that the TEC will urge changes in US insurance supervision that will enable the EU to recognise the US insurance supervisory regime as equivalent under the conditions set out in the Solvency II Directive; is of the opinion that the initiative to set up an Office of National Insurance would improve EU-US cooperation; calls on the TEC to ensure that the US authorities make progress on federal-level insurance supervision by separating, if necessary, tax and other issues from the pure supervision aspect; 37. Welcomes the expansion of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information (GFTEI) and sees it as a promising step that all 87 countries in the GFTEI have agreed to adopt the OECD standard on tax information sharing; urges the TEC to ensure that the EU and the US show their common global leadership by ensuring that the necessary incentives, including sanctions, are in place in March 2010, and to quickly implement, with all parties, a programme of peer review to assess progress, but considers that this framework must be reinforced to combat tax evasion and avoidance; stresses that automatic information should be the standard in all transnational tax matters; 38. Believes that the exchange of corporate social responsibility (CSR) best practices between the US and the EU will have a significant impact on the attitude of enterprises to CSR and on their positive engagement with social and environmental issues; considers that regulatory cooperation should take into account the strengthening of the EU regulatory framework regarding the Capital Requirements Directive, in particular remuneration policies in the financial services sector; 39. Welcomes the G-20 leaders' conclusions; TEC and intellectual property 40.

Calls on the TEC to promote joint actions to ensure that third countries, particularly China, raise their production standards to meet EU/US safety requirements, in particular for toys, and to ensure strict enforcement, on both sides of the Atlantic, of safety laws regarding products, particularly toys, as well as stronger national inspections; 43. Calls on the Commission to develop within the TEC stronger and more effective cross-border enforcement cooperation mechanisms, with the objective of linking the EU \u2018RAPEX\u2019 alert system for consumer products which pose a serious risk to consumers to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission alert system and integrating the activities of the EU's consumer protection cooperation network with those of the US authorities; 44. Proposes that the TEC endorse the adoption of a binding cooperation instrument which would structure and facilitate the sharing of information on product safety and the development of a common programme of cooperative actions; 45. Calls on the Commission to accelerate, with a view to the forthcoming TEC meeting and EU-US Summit, its work on a much-delayed bilateral Enforcement Cooperation Agreement extending to the US, its enforcement activities within the framework of the EU Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation ( 1 ) and the US Safe Web Act; EN C 265 E/20 Official Journal of the European Union 30.9.2010 ( 1 ) Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (OJ L 364, 9.12.2004, p. 1).

Calls on the TEC to voice EU concerns over the US unilateral legislative measure regarding the 100 % scanning of US-bound maritime cargo containers, as adopted by the US Congress; believes that the TEC could usefully organise seminars on the 100 % scanning issue in Brussels and Washington, in order to foster a deeper understanding between US and EU legislators and to promote an early and mutually acceptable resolution of this problem; calls on the Commission to evaluate, for the forthcoming TEC meeting, the potential costs of this measure to business and to the EU economy, as well as the potential impact on customs operations; 49. Is resolved to continue to call on the US legislature \u2013 and calls on the Commission to do likewise within the TEC \u2013 to reconsider the 100 % container-scanning obligation, and to develop cooperation with the US based on risk management, including mutual recognition of the EU and US trade partnership programmes, in accordance with the SAFE Framework of Standards of the World Customs Organization; Mutual recognition and standardisation 50. Calls on the Commission to pursue, in the light of the forthcoming TEC meeting, the formal adoption of procedures for the mutual recognition of declarations of conformity for products subject to mandatory third-party testing, in particular for ICT and electrical equipment, to insist on the mutual recognition of legal units of measurement, in particular acceptance of metric-only labelling of EU products in the US, to explore standardisation with US authorities, to establish round tables on standards focusing on innovative solutions and to coordinate internationally; Environmental and public health issues 51.

Recalls that, within the transatlantic framework of the EU-US agreement on legal assistance, which will enter into force on 1 January 2010, Article 4 provides for access to be granted to targeted financial data upon request, through national state authorities, and that this might constitute a sounder legal basis for the transfer of SWIFT data than the proposed interim agreement; 63. Notes that an interim agreement on the transfer of such data is being negotiated between the EU and the US which would be valid for an intermediate period through a sunset clause not exceeding 12 months, and that a new agreement, negotiated without prejudice to the procedure to be followed under the Lisbon Treaty, will have to fully involve the European Parliament and national parliaments and ensure that the conditions set out in Paragraph 3 of its above-mentioned resolution of 17 September 2009 are fulfilled; * * * 64.
