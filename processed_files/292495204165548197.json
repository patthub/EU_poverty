        "Foreword 3 Welcome back to school! As you begin the new school year, you have been given the eighth edition of the Europa Diary. As well as helping you plan your days for the year ahead, this diary is full of useful information about the European Union, and the ways in which the European Union is working for you as a European student, consumer and citizen. This educational tool is used by more than four million teenagers, just like you, all around Europe. The European Union is a complex subject, and it may even be controversial at times. But if you think about all the wars that Europeans have fought in the past, working together for a more stable, sustainable and prosperous continent is an extremely good and valuable thing. In many ways, EU countries can achieve a lot more when they act together than when they act individually. The aim is to give you a sense of just how valuable that cooperation is and what a difference it makes in your everyday life. Good luck for the upcoming year and happy reading! ",
        "The EU at a glance The European Union (EU) is unique in the world: it is not an international organisation like the United Nations, nor does it replace national governments. So, what is it? 4 Contact Europe Direct by telephone or email, or visit an information centre in your country! 0800 67 89 10 11 http://europa.eu/europedirect/index_en.htm Questions about the EU? The EU was created by national governments as a mechanism to agree on common actions in areas where it makes more sense for countries to work together, rather than each on its own. Cooperation over competition After the devastation of the Second World War, Europeans were determined to prevent another conflict from ever again ravaging the continent. Instead of competing against one another, the governments of six countries decided to cooperate on trade and economic issues. They pooled their resources of coal and steel, the raw materials for weapons, and the threat of war receded as they became each other\u2019s most valuable trading partners. The EU has ushered in an era of peace and prosperity. Today, it embraces 500 million people, deals with issues of everyday importance and operates according to the following principles: \u00bb It can only act in areas where national governments have agreed that it can. \u00bb It should only act where it can be more effective than national governments acting on their own. \u00bb It must promote and defend shared values such as democracy, freedom and justice, as well as Europe\u2019s common heritage, expressed in its many cultures, traditions and languages.

Exercise your right to vote once you can \u2013 in local, national and European elections. Even in large democracies such as the EU, each vote counts and can make a difference in the outcome of the elections. But the responsibilities of citizenship don\u2019t end with voting. A healthy democracy requires more from its citizens than simply casting a ballot once every four or five years. Politicians need to think not only about the next election, but also about the next generation. You don\u2019t have to wait until you can vote to have an opinion and make it heard!

        "An historical perspective \u2013 the EU timeline The process of building the European Union began in the aftermath of the Second World War, with the aim of ensuring security and prosperity in Europe. Over fifty years on, it is still a work-in-progress to which all European citizens can contribute. 6 1945 1950 1968 1979 1986 1957 1945 After nearly six years of fighting in Europe, the Second World War came to an end. 1950 French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman presented a plan for cooperation between European states, \u2018The Schuman Declaration \u2019. This plan led in April 1951 to the Treaty of Paris, which set up the European Coal and Steel Community. It included six countries: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). It brought them together as equals, cooperating within shared institutions. 1957 Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome , which launched the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom). A Common Market was created where goods, services, capital and people could move freely. 1968 The Customs Union was created: all import tariffs among the six EEC countries were eliminated. 1979 The first election of the European Parliament took place through direct elections . 1986 The Single European Act was adopted, setting out a timetable for the completion of the Common Market by 1 January 1993.

This led to the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990. Democracy took root in the countries of central and eastern Europe. 1992 The Maastricht Treaty was signed, which created the European Union (EU). It set new ambitious goals: monetary union by 1999, European citizenship, new common policies \u2013 including a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) \u2013 and cooperation in matters of internal security. 1997 The Treaty of Amsterdam was signed, which further developed the CFSP as well as employment and social protection policies. 2001 The Treaty of Nice was signed, which reformed the institutions and reinforced fundamental rights, security and defence and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. 2009 The Lisbon Treaty came into force in December. It strengthened the EU\u2019s ability to act on the global stage, and gave a greater voice to the European Parliament, national parliaments and citizens. 2002 Euro notes and coins came into circulation in a number of Member States as national currencies were phased out. The euro continues to be adopted by more and more EU countries \u2013 (the seventeenth and most recent country to adopt the currency was Estonia). ",
        "\u00a9 E u r opean P a r li a m en t Fitting the pieces together How do all the pieces of the institutional puzzle fit together to make Europe work? 8 European Parliament \u2013 voice of the people The Parliament is the people\u2019s voice. It adopts European laws together with the Council. It also ensures democratic scrutiny and public debate on all aspects of the EU\u2019s work. Every five years, voters across the EU elect representatives to sit in the Parliament. The last elections were held in June 2009. Citizens elected 736 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), making it the largest multinational body of its type. They meet in Strasbourg, France and sometimes in Brussels, Belgium. Within the Parliament, MEPs do not sit according to country, but rather in transnational groups that reflect their political beliefs. These include groups such as the European People\u2019s Party (Christian Democrats), Socialists, Liberals, Greens and others, not to mention MEPs who are opposed to European integration. www.europarl.europa.eu European Council \u2013 political leadership At least four times per year, the top political leaders from the Member States \u2013 either the prime minister or president, depending on the country \u2013 meet in Brussels to discuss the big issues of the day and to steer the overall direction of the EU. The European Council is chaired by a president who serves a term of two and a half years. www.european-council.europa.eu ",
        "The Council \u2013 voice of the Member States This is where national governments have their say. The Council makes new laws together with the European Parliament. Depending on the issue on the agenda, each country is represented by the minister responsible for that area \u2013 finances, transport, agriculture, etc. They meet in Brussels. Decisions on most subjects can be made by a majority of members. Big Member States, like Germany, have more votes and therefore more power in the Council than a small country like Malta. The voting system ensures, however, that the opinions of smaller states are not drowned out by their larger neighbours. When highly sensitive subjects are discussed \u2013 for example, taxation and defence \u2013 the Council must come to a unanimous decision. This is no easy task with so many different countries and interests around the table! www.consilium.europa.eu European Commission \u2013 the common interest The European Commission, based in Brussels, is the EU\u2019s executive arm. This means that it is the only institution that can propose new laws, which the European Parliament and the Council then debate and vote on. The Commission is also the EU\u2019s \u2018policeman\u2019, in that it is responsible for ensuring national governments play by the rules and apply EU law correctly. If they fail to do so, the Commission can take governments before the European Court of Justice. The president of the Commission leads a team of commissioners, one from each Member State. Each commissioner has a particular area of competence \u2013 research, environment, etc. \u2013 which can be compared to the duties of ministers in national governments. Commissioners are committed to act in the interests of the entire European Union, not just their home country. The EU also has a High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, who leads all the EU\u2019s actions on the international stage and is also Vice-President of the Commission. Around 32,000 people work for the European Commission. The majority are based in Brussels, although the Commission also has offices in all Member States and around the world. http://ec.europa.eu 9 ",

From that point of view, decision-making at European level is similar to national politics. Take, for instance... 12 The \u2018telecoms package\u2019 With the growth of the internet and other new technologies, many people began to speak about telecommunications law and called out for change. In November 2007, the European Commission listened to the arguments and proposed new legislation to reform the telecoms market. This draft law later became embroiled in the debate over online file sharing. A clause which touched upon the rights of internet users became a crucial cause for concern: when can someone\u2019s internet access be cut off? In reality, the debate was about how to fight illegal downloads. Would more people pay for music if the people who copied it illegally might have their internet access shut off as the ultimate punishment? While the European Parliament approved the entire so-called \u2018telecoms package\u2019 on first reading in September 2008, the national ministers in the Council disagreed on several key issues, including, most notably, internet access safeguards. The two institutions tried to find a compromise. But in May 2009, amid protests in the streets and on the internet, the Parliament voted strongly in favour of an amendment at odds with the Council\u2019s position. Is internet access a right? The debate brought out many competing points of view including: governments that sought an effective means to enforce copyright laws in their own countries, parliamentarians who believed the internet is essential to ",

And there are always some people who feel that lawmakers should set up a framework for a fair society, and others who believe that everything works out better when laws do not interfere in people\u2019s lives. A meeting in the middle To find a way out of the deadlock, a conciliation committee \u2013 composed of representatives from the Parliament and Council \u2013 was convened. The committee hammered out a compromise, which ensured that internet users who are suspected of breaking the law cannot have their access shut off without due process. That means internet users are presumed to be innocent, have the right to defend themselves and can only be cut off following a \u2018fair and impartial procedure\u2019. In November 2009, more than two years after it was introduced, the \u2018telecoms package\u2019 was signed into law. ",
        "Money makes the world go round What\u2019s in your pocket? For millions of Europeans, it\u2019s a single currency \u2013 the euro \u2013 which is accepted in many countries across Europe. 14 The last ten years have seen the largest shake-up of currencies in the continent\u2019s history, with 17 of the EU\u2019s 27 countries having adopted the euro as their official currency. The euro can be used in an area that stretches from the Mediterranean all the way to the Arctic Circle. And more EU countries will join once they are ready. A world currency The euro is now used by nearly 331 million people every day. It is the world\u2019s second largest reserve currency, after the US dollar. Around 26% of worldwide reserves are now held in euros. The euro is the second most actively traded currency in the world, used in around 40% of daily transactions on foreign exchange markets. As well as being of obvious practical convenience, the euro is also one of most tangible signs of European integration. And because it is such an important currency, the euro gives the EU a stronger voice in the global economy.

        "15 A trip abroad used to involve a visit to a bank to change money. You then had to do complicated conversion sums when making purchases, and when you got home you usually had a collection of notes and coins which simply ended up gathering dust. Within the euro area this has all been done away with. This makes things much more convenient and also saves us a small fortune! A boon for tourists\u2026 Common currency benefits That\u2019s all very good, but how does a common currency promote trade and economic growth in practice? To start with, consumers can easily compare prices between countries in the euro area, leading to fairer competition between businesses. And by eliminating the risk and uncertainties linked to exchange rates, the euro lowers the cost of doing business across borders. Moreover, sound management of the euro has brought about low inflation and low interest rates. This stability, together with the size of the euro area, not only attracts more foreign investment, but also makes the economy more resilient to external shocks. A history lesson in your wallet? The euro banknotes, depicting architectural styles from the seven ages of Europe\u2019s cultural history, provide a pocket lesson in both history and architecture. The coins are made by national mints, and the bigger the economy is, the more coins the country produces (so there are more German coins than Maltese ones). The coins have a standard image on one side, while the other side is left for national designs. All euro notes and coins can be used in all euro area countries. ",

The strength of a country\u2019s currency is closely related to the state of its economy, and that\u2019s why some important rules have been put in place as we interlink the economies with a common currency. For monetary union to work, euro area countries must have economies that are in similar shape, especially when it comes to public finances and competitiveness. Who can join? All EU countries are required to join the euro once they have fulfilled the so-called \u2018Maastricht criteria\u2019 except the UK and Denmark, which have opt-outs on joining the euro, although they can still join in the future if they wish. The \u2018Maastricht criteria\u2019 These are rules (called \u2018convergence criteria\u2019) that were agreed in the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.

        "Migration: turning challenge into opportunity Migration is vital for our economic and social well-being and brings opportunities as Europe faces the prospect of an ageing and shrinking population. The fact that Europe has become a major destination for migration over the last decade can sometimes be challenging, particularly during tough economic times. 20 Finding solutions to address the challenges and benefits brought by migration requires cooperation among EU countries as well as dialogue and partnership with other countries from which migration originates. This is why the European Union has a comprehensive Migration Policy setting down clear and fair rules for legal migration, which also addresses irregular migration and promotes integration. Integration: a two-way street In Europe, people have different backgrounds and come from different cultures. This is a positive thing, as diversity enriches our communities and broadens our horizons. Nevertheless we sometimes fail to see the benefits that this diversity brings to us; it can be equally difficult integrating into a new culture as adjusting to increased diversity. Integration is therefore a core part of the EU\u2019s immigration policy.

Europe can be proud of its humanitarian tradition of offering asylum to refugees; still asylum applications aren\u2019t always processed to the same standard in all EU Member States: an application for asylum can be denied in one country but approved in another. Therefore, the EU is working towards common rules and asylum procedures, which will help to reduce abuse of the system. A safe haven for asylum-seekers Europe should be a multicultural and diverse society, where difference is a good thing, not something to be fought against. - Andr\u00e9, 18, Portugal. Addressing irregular immigration Irregular immigration is another challenge facing the EU, often with a human cost. Many migrants \u2013 including women and children \u2013 risk their lives along dangerous routes trying to reach Europe and often end up being exploited by smugglers and traffickers. Fighting these criminal networks is a priority for the EU, while emphasis is also placed on monitoring the EU borders. The EU has therefore created an agency called FRONTEX, which coordinates security cooperation along the EU\u2019s external borders. At the same time most people prefer to stay in their home country. Accordingly the EU Migration Policy also includes cooperation with countries outside the EU so as to better manage migration and address the root causes of migration such as poverty and conflict. ",
        "United in regional diversity The EU is a giant patchwork of regions. 22 We all have a particular national identity, but for many of us the region we come from is just as important. Many regions have their own distinct traditions, such as food, clothing, music and dance. But beyond the cultural domain, regions also play a crucial economic role. Engines of growth Ultimately, the regions are where it all happens. It\u2019s where small, local businesses start and grow, creating jobs and fuelling economic growth. Given the right support and building on their strengths, they can be hotbeds of dynamism and innovation. The EU is keen to harness this potential, and so it develops and carries out policies to benefit the regions with local partners. All 271 regions of the EU are covered by these policies, although more help is given to those that need it most. Close to home A total of \u20a4294 (\u20ac347.4) billion is available to help regions develop in the period 2007- 2013. The money is mainly distributed through three channels: the Cohesion Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund, investing in everything from roads and bridges to high-speed internet access and renewable energies. UK regions will receive over \u20a48.97 (\u20ac10.6) billion of the total amount. But is the money being well spent?

Bridging the gap The gap between the richest and poorest regions in Europe is large: the average income in the Severozapaden region of Bulgaria is only 26% of the overall EU average, while in Inner London that number stands at 334%. One of the primary goals of regional policy is to narrow the disparities between different areas, helping the poorer regions to \u2018catch up\u2019 with those better-off by fostering innovation and creating jobs. In this sense, the EU seeks to build solidarity between regions and between people. Do you feel this sense of connection?

        "Money wise What do you with your money? Stuff it under your mattress or deposit it at the bank for safekeeping? Spend it immediately or invest in your future? Your credit history includes the total amount of your current loans, whether you\u2019ve repaid or defaulted (that is, failed to repay) on past loans and if you\u2019ve been refused previous loan requests. All these factors are taken into account when the lender decides whether to grant you the loan or not. You can obtain a copy of your credit history report either before you apply for a loan or after you have been refused credit. Your credit history 42 Opening a bank account To open an account, you\u2019ll need to show proof of your identity \u2013 a passport or a similar form of ID will do. For example, in the UK, with the exception of the Post Office, the minimum age to open a basic bank account is 14 years old. Banks must provide all information on charges and interest rates available, allowing you to compare different accounts. The costly business of borrowing Bank loans, bank overdrafts and credit cards are different ways of borrowing money. But the lenders don\u2019t do it out of charity \u2013 they do it to earn money! The price you pay for the loan is called interest and is a percentage of the amount borrowed (called \u2018principal\u2019). On top of that, you often have to pay a fixed fee. How interest is calculated The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure of the cost of a credit agreement taking into account the interest and other fees. The APR enables you to easily compare the cost of different loans. Usually, the lower the APR, the better the deal. The safest way is to check the total amount to be paid over the term of the loan for borrowed money. ",

This can be done by showing them that you have a steady income. The bank makes a plan on how much you will pay back every month and for how long. Bank overdrafts A bank overdraft can be either authorised or unauthorised. An authorised overdraft is often fee-free and arranged with your bank in advance with an agreed limit (called your \u2018credit limit\u2019) and interest rate. An unauthorised overdraft is where you withdraw more money than you have in your account without a prearranged agreement with the bank. In this instance you will pay charges and a very high interest rate on the amount. Credit cards and store cards With both credit and store cards, you can purchase an expensive item and pay for it over several months, with a minimum amount being paid back every month. The issuer of the card will charge monthly interest on money still owed, usually higher than interest rates charged by banks.

NGOs raise money through fundraising, applications to private trusts, the Government, the European Commission, or other national and international organisations. It is thought that public money, which is raised by taxation, should be re-invested for the public good.

More energy-efficient lighting systems can really make a difference to both our carbon footprint and our wallet. Compact fluorescent bulbs save about 75% of energy compared with incandescent bulbs. Newer and even more efficient technologies like light emitting diodes (LEDs) are also entering the market, and the EU is now gradually phasing out incandescent light bulbs \u2013 they\u2019ll be off the shelves by the end of 2012. Building a green future When it comes to saving energy we should start by looking in our own backyard to find ways to use less energy in our homes and the other buildings that we use on a daily basis.

They are labelled and ranked according to their energy efficiency, helping people to save energy and money. While energy-efficient products might seem more expensive upfront, they easily pay for themselves in the long run with the cost-savings that come from consuming less energy. Check the label! Buildings account for around 40% of the EU\u2019s total energy consumption. Where does it all go? Mostly to temperature control \u2013 heating or cooling. But with a few changes in our behaviour, we can save significant amounts of energy. For example, a change of 1\u00b0C in indoor temperature would reduce the energy requirement by 6%. Simple technological solutions, such as better windows and heating equipment, combined with smart behaviour can also bring about big savings. In fact, we already have the technology to build a house that produces more energy than it consumes! In the future, all new buildings in the EU will have to be as energy-efficient as possible. Simple measures Televisions alone can represent up to 10% of the average household\u2019s electricity bill, and that is to say nothing of computers and other electronic gadgets. You might not be paying the bills yet, but you can help now. The simplest way is to turn off the lights when you leave the room and to completely switch off electrical appliances when you are not using them \u2013 don\u2019t leave your TV or computer on standby!

Due to airspace fragmentation, planes don\u2019t actually fly in a straight line between airports. In fact, the average flight flies 49km longer than strictly necessary, adding time to journeys and pumping out an additional 5 million tonnes of CO 2 per year. For those of us booked on upcoming flights, news coverage of severe storms or industrial action is enough to make us break into a cold sweat. But away from the headlines there is another problem that is threatening to bring permanent delays \u2013 not to mention increased costs and pollution \u2013 to the EU\u2019s increasingly congested airspace: Europe\u2019s compli- cated air traffic control system. A joint European undertaking called SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) involving airport operators, technology companies and national authorities has been set up to help develop a new air traffic control system that is fit for the 21 st century. Some of the main issues being addressed include: Old technology In an era in which some airlines now offer passengers wireless internet connections for their mobile devices, it may surprise you to know that pilots still communicate with air traffic controllers using old radio technology.

Pilots have to change radio frequency and contact the next air traffic controller each time their plane enters a new sector, which is estimated to cost \u20a4847M (\u20ac1 billion) a year. In the US for example, where airspace is not fragmented in this way, air traffic controllers manage twice as many flights at the same cost.

But with the number of flights expected to grow steadily over the next ten years, delays, increased emissions, greater costs and greater safety risks are almost inevitable unless something is changed.

Here are the details of a few EU research projects, which are working to improve our future. Arctic peril The Arctic is a crucial component in the global climate system. During the last 100 years, its atmosphere has warmed twice as fast as the global average. The sea- ice cover has rapidly decreased, and it might completely disappear during the summer months by the end of this century. The dwindling sea-ice will have serious impacts not only on the livelihoods of indigenous people, but also on the exploitation of non-renewable resources such as oil and gas, as well as fishing and shipping, all of which raises major environmental, economic and geopolitical questions. Since we do not know all the consequences yet, it is essential to enhance our understanding of the Arctic. Scientists involved in one of the largest EU-funded research projects to date are studying climate change in the Arctic and its potential impacts. An important part of the project was the Tara expedition; no other ship had previously reached so far north \u2013 only 160 kilometres from the North Pole! High-tech measuring instruments were tested in an extremely remote and harsh environment. Today, these instruments communicate with satellites and transmit real-time data to scientists in Europe, helping them to understand what is going on in the region. www.damocles-eu.org ",

All of this means that fuel consumption remains relatively high, even though car engines have become more fuel-efficient. European engineers working on the Super Light Car project have found an effective diet for modern cars by replacing heavy steel parts with lighter materials, such as aluminium and carbon fibre reinforced plastics. To do so, they first had to develop not only advanced ways to join the materials together but also safeguards to make sure that cars would still live up to safety and performance standards. Lighter cars will use less fuel and therefore emit less carbon dioxide. Car bodies developed through this EU-funded research project will be 35% lighter than ordinary vehicles. The Super Light Car prototype could be on the market in a few years. www.superlightcar.com ",

        "67 Tending the seeds of agriculture Where does the food you eat come from? From farmers, of course! Not only do they supply our food but they also care for the countryside as well as provide raw materials for the clothes you wear and the medication you take when you\u2019re ill. In addition they have quite a role to play in the fight against climate change. The European Union is facing new challenges and so we need to look at agriculture in a new context. We need to make sure that we have enough food, but we need to do this in a Europe where people are getting older and older - especially in our farming communities - and in a world confronting the prospect of climate change; a population heading towards nine billion by 2050 and increasing pressure on our natural resources. Finally, we need to recognise that we live in a world in which globalisation has changed the way our markets work. The EU\u2019s policies are constantly developing in order to meet the needs of farmers, who are responsible for not only producing enough safe and affordable food, but also for preserving the countryside. If there is one thing to remember about agriculture in the European Union, it is the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Why do we need an agricultural policy? It is crucial that we look after our land and food resources \u2013 simply put it\u2019s a matter of caring about our future. Plus, while farmers need this policy for stability and predictability, European consumers need to be guaranteed a continual supply of safe food. ",
        "68 Did you know? The average farm size in Europe is 12 hectares or roughly 24 football fields. By way of comparison, an average farm in the United States is 180ha or 360 football fields. Get paid for what you do Nine to five? Five days a week? Long holidays? That\u2019s not the case for most farmers. However, when European consumers are buying their food, they are not paying enough to guarantee a fair income to farmers. In agriculture, everything depends on the weather. Heavy rain in harvest, severe drought in the growing season or flooding can ruin a farmer\u2019s finances. There are many other factors, of course, such as the price of energy and the level of production in other parts of the world. In 2009, the average EU farmer\u2019s income fell by 11.9% \u2013 in some countries up to 25%. Imagine if that happened to your parent\u2019s income! The CAP provides farmers with a basic income support so that they can continue to make a decent living from producing our food and taking care of our countryside. The EU spends around \u00a346.6 (\u20ac55) billion a year to support its farmers and rural areas, which means that each of us contributes around 26 pence (\u20ac0.30) a day. Do you think it\u2019s money well spent? One size doesn\u2019t fit all So who benefits from what? Different types of farms have different benefits. Mountain farmers keep the hillside alive and organic farms help to maintain our environment. Quite a lot of rural areas revolve around small farms. These small farms form part of our social fabric. Have a look at your local markets and you will be astonished at what small farmers are capable of delivering. ",
        "69 Can you imagine life without the internet? No e-mails, no chats, no blogs? That\u2019s exactly how it is in some rural areas of Europe. Nowadays, internet access is a \u2018must\u2019, not only to socialise with friends online, but also for distance working, economic development and the exchange of information. That\u2019s why the EU is promoting free public internet centres and broadband access in many rural regions of Europe. For example, in remote areas of Bulgaria you can find more than 100 iCentres with free public internet access and multimedia devices (using satellite internet technologies!). A Rural Internet Network is being installed in Lithuania, connecting villages, schools, libraries and public access points. In Cumbria the public institutional promotion of broadband access has been a priority for several years and now reaches more than 99% of the population and businesses. Driving innovation Larger farms are also important. They often produce at competitive prices, making their products more affordable, whilst creating rural employment in the processing chain in dairies, mills and the like. Studies show, that without public support, our landscape would change. Small farms would struggle to survive, and we would see very intensive farming in some regions and land abandonment in others. Clean air, groundwater, biodiversity and the recreational value of the countryside would be threatened. No region left behind The goal of the EU is to create smart and sustainable growth across the board. No region should be left behind. To this end, the CAP gives active support to projects that make the countryside a better place to live \u2013 like rolling out broadband internet access, producing renewable energy, protecting bird species or helping people to set up new and innovative businesses.

        "70 The global challenge Check the labels of the clothes you are wearing, the products you are using and the food you are eating. They come from all over the world. This is a result of what we call globalisation. We generally see the fast exchange of information and goods as a benefit. But stop and think again: how does that impact on our farmers? They are now competing with farmers from all over the world, including countries where it is much cheaper to produce because salaries for the workers are lower, the weather is better and people care less about animal welfare and the environment. The CAP helps our farmers become more competitive and improve the value of their production whether it\u2019s destined for the local, regional or global market. Why is it vital for Europe to keep a strong agricultural sector? Feeding the world The world\u2019s population is forecast by the United Nations to grow from 6.7 billion in 2009 to nine billion in 2050. At the same time, countries like India and China are eating more meat, which increases pressure on cereal production. In fact, more food will have to be produced over the next few decades than has been produced during the past 10,000 years. That alone is a challenge. Doing it sustainably and with minimal impact on the environment is yet another challenge. Not only our farmers, but also our researchers and experts, play an important role in developing new ways of protecting our farmland and making better use of our natural resources. ",

Farming produces two major greenhouse gases: nitrous oxide from the use of fertilisers and methane from cattle burping and farting! Currently, about 9% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to agriculture, but since 1990 farmers have managed to cut their emissions by more than 20%. What is more, some agricultural products can be put to use in the fight against climate change \u2013 for example, biomass (plant-derived organic matter) is used to produce clean and renewable energy. However, farmers suffer from the effects of climate change more directly than any of us. Droughts, floods and extreme weather conditions affect agriculture negatively, and this is likely to become worse. That is why a part of the CAP budget is devoted to helping farmers not only to adapt to climate change but also to develop ways of combating climate change for the benefit of us all. A green countryside While farmers depend on nature, in many ways nature also depends on farmers. With help from EU support schemes, farmers throughout Europe manage their land in a sustainable and responsible manner, which protects nature and biodiversity. ",

But from time to time it is good to go there. - \u0160tefan, 19, Slovakia. Portable music players, discos, concerts and noisy workplaces can all damage our hearing. The risk of permanent hearing loss increases the louder the sound is and the longer you are exposed to it. Simply put, the higher the volume, the less time you should listen. In addition, loud noises tend to make us less aware of our surroundings, masking traffic and warning signals. This is particularly dangerous in the workplace, where one in five workers have to raise their voices to be heard for at least half of their working hours. Listen up! \u00bb Stay away from the loudspeakers at clubs and concerts. If you go frequently, invest in a pair of earplugs. \u00bb \u2018Silent\u2019 discos put you in control. They offer partygoers their own headphones to use when dancing, so you can set the volume for yourself while others can socialise without having to shout over the music. \u00bb If your personal music player drowns out the background noise, the volume is probably too loud. \u00bb It\u2019s not only loud music that can cause hearing problems.

Labelling provides information for consumers and allows them to make an informed choice. 84 Did you know? A recent study carried out in six EU countries revealed that only 17% of shoppers look for nutrition information. This number varied widely between countries, as did the information the shoppers sought. Labels tell us how long food will last, how to store or prepare it and, most importantly, what\u2019s in it. This is particularly important for people who suffer from allergies. And while labels don\u2019t tell us how much to eat, they do provide nutrition information so that we can choose a healthy and balanced diet. Most labelling rules apply across the EU \u2013 so you can always find the same basic information, no matter which country you are in. Good to know: \u00bb Every ingredient, including food additives and water (over a certain amount), must be listed, in descending order of weight. \u00bb Nutrition labelling provides information on, for example, the amount of energy, protein, carbohydrates, fats, fibre and sodium in the food. This does not have to be provided unless a claim is made relating to energy (calories) or to the nutrients provided by the food, or if vitamins and minerals are added. \u00bb And finally, the label must clearly state the manufacturer\u2019s or the seller\u2019s contact details, so that you can either obtain more information about the product or complain about it.

Well, without international trade, prices would be higher and the range of goods on offer would be more limited. Consider, for instance, a normal pair of jeans: the cotton is grown in Mali, woven in Egypt, dyed with indigo from India and sewn together in Bangladesh, based on a pattern from a European designer.

        "88 Because international trade is so important, 153 countries have joined the WTO. It sets out trading rules and acts as referee if one country believes another has not been playing fairly. Playing by the rules The benefits of trade Trade is based on the simple premise that each country should do what it\u2019s good at. A country doesn\u2019t have to be the absolute best at producing something, but if it is relatively better than others, then it makes sense for the country to specialise in that area and meet its other needs through trade. This is called comparative advantage, and it creates benefits for all trading partners. From this perspective, trade is rewarding for all countries that engage in it, while those which close themselves from the outside world tend to lose out. Through agreements to reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade, the EU seeks to open new markets for European companies and thereby create jobs and stimulate growth. Beyond goods and services, trade is closely linked to international money flows, which also promote growth and development. On average, the EU annually invests \u20a4319 (\u20ac380) billion around the world, while other countries invest over \u20a4233 (\u20ac277) billion in Europe. Working together Just as the 27 EU countries share a single market and a single external border, they also share a single trade policy. It is the European Trade Commissioner who sits at the negotiating table on their behalf at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and vis-\u00e0-vis individual trading partners. By working together, EU countries are able to pack a big enough punch to shape an open international trading system based on fair rules \u2013 and to ensure that those rules are respected. In addition to its important role at the WTO, the European Commission works directly with Europe\u2019s trading partners to remove problems for exporters, open up new opportunities for investment, and reduce the counterfeiting and piracy of European goods. At the same time, the European Parliament is fully involved in trade policy, which ensures that the concerns of ordinary citizens are taken up in negotiations. ",

Surprisingly, there is no all-encompassing definition of what constitutes a \u2018developing country\u2019, but needless to say they have less material wealth than the advanced economies of Europe or North America. Many dislike the term \u2018developing country\u2019 because it suggests a sense of inferiority compared to so-called \u2018developed\u2019 countries, and lumping economic giants like China into the same basket as countries like Burkina Faso seems to make little sense.

Not only do developing countries benefit, but so does Europe through greater global security, better environmental protection and a strengthened global economy. Education for all In Europe, we take education for granted. Not only is it compulsory for children to go to school, we also see education as our \u2018right\u2019. In developing countries, the situation is very different, with almost 70 million children out of school around the world. The EU wants to change this and is committed to achieving universal primary education as part of its development policy. In the poorest countries, children are often unable to attend school because they are needed at home to contribute to their family\u2019s survival. While education offers a way out of extreme poverty, poverty reduction is a prerequisite for education, leading to a vicious circle. The fragile health of impoverished children might also prevent them from learning effectively, and even if the cycle of poverty is broken, money is still required to train teachers, build classrooms and buy textbooks. In conflict-ridden countries, it must also be declared safe for children to actually attend school. For all this to happen, development policies must be comprehensive: it is not simply a matter of building new schools, but looking at the education system as a whole and all the factors that contribute to a successful learning environment \u2013 teachers\u2019 training, curriculum quality, etc. ",

It all starts by identifying the specific needs of a developing country, reviewing the state of education and assessing the challenges. Diverse organisations need to work in concert: governments to strengthen the education system as well as civil society to act at local level. Aid is usually delivered in the form of financial support to government budgets or assistance to specific projects. For example; the EU works with local governments, non- governmental organisations and civil society to address education-related challenges such as access to school for the most vulnerable. However, development aid is about more than money. It is also about effectiveness. Better aid Aid effectiveness means, for example, that donors should work better together to coordinate their support and make it more transparent and predictable. Development aid can also be made better by: \u00bb improving the quality of project preparation and implementation; \u00bb focusing on fewer areas of support (education, healthcare, etc.); \u00bb transferring more responsibility and ownership to local partners. Once the aid is delivered, it is important to measure its impact; that is why projects and programmes are continuously monitored and assessed to ensure that they meet accepted standards. Unconditional support? What do you think? Should development aid be contingent on things like democracy and respect for fundamental rights? ",
