        "The Week March-2005 STATEMENTS Remembrance of Renzo Imbeni with the result and I congratulate the Spanish Prime Minister and all the political parties involved. \" EXTERNAL RELATIONS 23.02.2005 At the opening of Wednesday's session, President BORRELL asked the House to observe a minute's silence in memory of Renzo IMBENI, who had died the previous evening after an illness. The President recalled Mr Imbeni 's human and professional qualities, recognised and appreciated both by his friends and his political opponents. He said that Parliament, of which Mr Imbeni had been Vice-President for ten years from 1994 to 2004, was proud to have counted him among its members. A complete biography of Renzo Imbeni can be found on the website of the Italian delegation of the Socialist group: http://www.delegazionepse.it/delegazione/det taglio.asp?id aut=6 Statement by President Josep Borrell on the referendum in Spain 21.02.2005 Recalling that Spain had been the first Member State to hold a referendum on the Constitution, President BORRELL welcomed the fact that 76.7 per cent voted in favour. He also pointed out that 74 per cent of the European Parliament had voted in favour of the Constitution. \"Spaniards ' vote in favour was similar to the European Parliament's vote\" he said. The turnout, he said, was slightly less than the last European elections in Spain but close to the average turnout for the EU 25 Member States at the last European elections. To conclude, President Borrell said \"I am extremely happy President George W. Bush's visit to Brussels - European Parliament participation 23.02.2005 President BORRELL reported on the meeting with President BUSH, the 25 Heads of State and Government, the Commission President and himself. President Borrell made a statement, although not all the Heads of State and Government had an opportunity to do this. President Borrell said that he was delighted that Parliament's voice could be heard. In his speech, Mr Borrell made reference to the resolution adopted by Parliament on transatlantic relations in January of this year. He called for the creation of a new era in transatlantic relations. He also raised the situation in the Middle East and the Kyoto Protocol. On the Middle East, President Borrell stated that the opportunity for peace must not be missed and he also welcomed the common approach of the US and the EU to the Middle East. The European Parliament supported the position of President Bush, he said. Furthermore, he underlined the importance of the Kyoto Protocol to President Bush. He hoped that the US would move to agree an international framework for the protection of the environment. PE 349.801 ",
        "March-2005 The Week Viktor Yushchenko: \"Ukraine's future is in the EU\" Address by President of Ukraine 23.02.2005 Parliament President Josep BORRELL welcomed the President of Ukraine, Viktor YUSHCHENKO to the Chamber, noting that the elections in his country had shown a shared democratic desire among Ukrainians, as well as a great maturity among the people and a desire for peace and progress. He said the impressive programme of political and economic reform President Yushchenko had put forward would not be easy to implement, but that it would have the support of the EU. He recalled Parliament's resolution on Ukraine, which had called for the Commission and Council to go beyond the present action plan and begin an association process with Ukraine with a view to that country having the possibility of EU membership in the future. President Yushchenko said it was a great honour and pleasure to be addressing the European Parliament, the symbol of democracy in the EU: \"Democracy is a value which unites us all. It is the cornerstone of our prosperity. I am also proud to be here representing a country which has built a new symbol on the European continent. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, we now also have the Orange revolution. This has shown that totalitarianism is no longer possible in Europe. The people have chosen the path of freedom and truth. The borders of Europe now stretch from the coast of Portugal to beyond Kiev. We have chosen Europe: it is not just a question of geography, but a matter of shared spiritual and moral values. We have seen the election of a second president, this time in a transparent and democratic manner. It was the development of a civil society which made our victory possible. It is almost a new nation which has been born, and you in the European Parliament are its godparents. Your support was a great symbol and encouragement to us in our struggle in the difficult month of December. Here in the European Parliament we understood that a new democratic society was possible in the Ukraine. I want to thank you for your support in our struggle for freedom. Ukraine still has much to do to become a full member of the European family, but we are all now united by values, history and aspirations. We have embarked on a path of reforms. Like making bread, you need the right ingredients and a lot of work. European integration is the only path open for Ukraine. It is time to move beyond words and take action to develop democracy, the rule of law, freedom of the media and to tackle corruption. We must not lose this unique opportunity to bring the EU and Ukraine closer. It was visionary of the European Parliament to support Ukraine's European aspirations. We will do all we can to make the Action Plan work, and extending it was a positive gesture, but the neighbourhood policy has already been overtaken by events. We hope that at the end of the Action Plan, in 2007, we will be in a position to begin EU membership negotiations. Ukraine is already a part of an integrated Europe. We are able to make an application under Article 49 and will aim to meet the Copenhagen criteria. We know that the largest part of the work needs to be done on our side. Without action from us, the EU's support will not help us. But we already have a plan of action for the next five years with EU membership as our objective. We want a transparent economy, alleviation of taxes, less corruption and an independent media and judiciary. While I am President, no one will hear of human rights abuses in Ukraine. We also have much work to do to adapt our administration to European standards. PE 349.801 ",
        "The Week March-2005 We have plans for important social reforms, for judicial reform, to tackle illegal immigration and the drugs trade. All these will be based on human rights and respect for the dignity of human beings. We aim to implement these changes meticulously and at all levels, doing all this within the European spirit. It is a European philosophy which underpins my work and that of the government. Ukraine's definitive choice of Europe cannot be denied. Being part of the Atlantic alliance will further strengthen our civil society, rule of law and human rights. But we also want to deepen relations with the Russian Federation. Moving closer to Europe does not prevent closer cooperation with Russia. Ukraine's membership of the EU and NATO is not against Russian interests - on the contrary, a stable Ukraine could help bring Russia closer to Europe. We have also developed a new regional policy, with our first action being to work for a peaceful resolution of the Transdniestria problem. We want to reach out with cross- border cooperation and development of energy networks to bring European standards into play from Baku to the western shores of the EU. Nothing is guaranteed, we still need to develop values on a common basis. You need solid foundations or a house will collapse, and, as the Bible says, a house divided upon itself cannot stand. You have witnessed the emergence of a new colour - Orange - on the European map. You know Ukraine can be part of the future of Europe. Now is the time for concrete action. It will not be easy, but together we can achieve our common goal. \" MEPs gave a standing ovation to the Ukrainian president. Forthcoming elections Moldova in Joint motion for a resolution on the parliamentary elections in Moldova Doc.: B6-0122/2005, B6-0123/2005, B6- 0124/2005, B6-0143/2005, B6-0144/2005, B6- 0145/2005 Vote : 24.02.2005 MEPs urged the Moldovan authorities to ensure that the parliamentary elections to be held on 6 March will be free and fair, not only on polling day but also during the campaign. In the resolution adopted, MEPs stressed that compliance with international democratic standards will be of the greatest importance for the further development of relations between Moldova and the EU. Parliament specified that the elections should be held in a transparent fashion and that there should be pluralist media coverage of the campaign, and that public administration should be even-handed towards all candidates, parties and supporters. Another concern for MEPs was that all citizens should have the right to vote, including students, people working outside the country and people whose identity cards have expired just before the elections. MEPs welcomed the Moldovan invitation to international observers to monitor the elections, but hoped this opportunity would also be provided to Moldovan domestic observers. Parliament will send a seven strong delegation to Moldova from 3 to 7 March. The resolution concluded by calling for the reopening of talks between Moldova and its breakaway region of Transniestria; stressing that \"Russia carries a great responsibility for the situation by maintaining about 2,500 troops there.\" Press enquiries: Marjory van den Broeke (Strasbourg) tel.(33-3) 881 74337 (Brussels) tel.(32-2) 28 44304 e-mail : foreign-press @europarl.eu.int 8 PE 349.801 ",

The resolution was put forward by the EPP-ED, ALDE and UEN groups with other groups, notably including the Socialists, voting against. This comprehensive overview included the following points, amongst others: A more competitive and cohesive European parliament MEPs welcome the central importance attached to implementing the Lisbon Strategy and support attempts to target fewer and more complementary objectives. They invite the Commission to review the EU's Sustainable Development Strategy alongside the Lisbon Strategy. They also stress the importance of action at Member State and regional level as well as by the EU and call for rigorous impact assessment of all new initiatives. Parliament calls for further action to complete the single market, notably in energy, transport, telecommunications and financial and other services. It invites the Commission to review its proposal for a software patents directive (in line with the decisions already taken by the Legal Affairs Committee and the Conference of Presidents).

        "The Week March-2005 Commission to avoid bringing forward new proposals unless they are duly justified and assessed. They applaud steps to improve the business environment, including entrepreneurship and good corporate governance, while stressing the importance of consistency in the contract law area. Parliament welcomes the high priority given to strengthening the EU's research and development effort. MEPs state their belief that a strong competition policy and the effective enforcement of its rules are extremely important in improving competitiveness. They welcome the Commission's plans to promote competitive practices in a number of sectors, while supported the aim of ensuring less, better focussed state aid - though there should be no discrimination between the Members States on this matter. Parliament call for the essential structure of the Stability and Growth Pact to be safeguarded in any proposed reform, in particular regarding the three per cent deficit rule, but also with more attention to be paid to the public debt position of the Member States. Cohesion policy, they assert, is important in its own right, but also as a method for achieving the Lisbon objectives. They support the Commission's efforts to persuade Member States that the Trans-European Network projects should be planned and financed on the basis of support both from the EU budget and, where possible, through public-private partnerships. Improving Europe's quality of life MEPs say the effective implementation of the EU Biodiversity Plan will require appropriate financial resources, including for the Natura 2000 network. They call for the Commission and Parliament to work together to find a balanced solution on the REACH proposals. They also say it is time to update the rules on animal health and welfare in the light of new scientific developments. They call for the use of renewable and innovative energy solutions to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Parliament welcomes the ongoing reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, but is concerned that this should not lead to distortions of competition among farmers in the Member States, while opposing renationalisation. On the other hand, MEPs regret the lack of proposals on the Common Fisheries Policy, given the large number of outstanding issues for the fundamentally important fisheries sector. MEPs look forward to concrete guidelines for the manifold challenges linked to an ageing population, especially proposals to provide the highest possible quality of life for the elderly, while ensuring sustainable pensions and health systems. They call on the Commission to work with Member States to increase the labour market participation of people over the age of 55, and call for a stronger emphasis on a 'child-friendly' working environment. They repeat that a strong and vibrant social dimension is an important component of a successful and dynamic economy. Parliament also calls for adequate EU funding for education, culture, youth and media programmes, and looks forward to the Commission communication on youth policy. It also wants to see detailed proposals on how to tackle the gender pay- gap in coming years. A safer Europe for the citizen Parliament stresses the need to seek an appropriate balance between increased security for citizens and proper protection for their fundamental rights. This requires a proper evaluation of measures already adopted. The fight against terrorism and organised crime is, say MEPs, critical to building a safer Europe, and the Commission should urgently work on clearer definitions of certain cross-border crimes. MEPs welcome the common approach to border control, asylum and immigration, including better external border security and agreements with third countries. They call for national governments to forewarn other Member States before taking significant unilateral steps in this area. They also call for the 10 PE 349.801 ",

Parliament wants the new European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to be up and running as soon as possible, and stresses the need for early warning and immediate response mechanisms for natural disasters and health crises. It calls for intensified research into HIV/AIDS medication. On consumer protection, MEPs stress in particular the need for simplification of the rules on cross-border contracts, while opposing the merging of consumer policy and public health programmes. A stronger Europe in a safer world Parliament calls for the steady and determined development of the EU's common foreign, security and defence policies to help project European values on the world stage. It wants to see rapid agreement on the setting up of the joint external action service, in a way which protects the prerogatives of both the Commission and Parliament. MEPs put a high priority on implementing a comprehensive neighbourhood policy, while developing a strong new Eastern dimension and a strengthening and deepening of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. The EU's relationship with Ukraine should be upgraded to give that country \"a clear European perspective.\" MEPs also ask for every possible effort to be made to achieve the reunification of Cyprus. Parliament calls again or a strengthening of EU-US relations, including a genuine Transatlantic Partnership agreement, with commitments to remove the remaining trade barriers by 2015. MEPs oppose any lifting of the embargo on arms sales to China. They also call for clear and balanced EU input into the process of finding a lasting peace between Israel and a viable, democratic Palestinian state. They welcome the EU's positive role in the reconstruction of Iraq and in efforts to prevent Iran form acquiring military nuclear capability. Parliament is gravely concerned that none of the eight Millennium Development Goals for sub-Saharan Africa have been met or are on track to be met by 2015. It says the international community must dramatically increase both the quality and quantity of its development assistance. MEPs support the Commission's aim to build a strong coalition for further post-Kyoto action on climate change, while encouraging the USA to bring forward its own proposals in this field. They also underline the importance of a multilateral approach to trade policy and a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda. They stress the importance of progressively removing import barriers on goods from developing countries and progressively eliminating all forms of EU export subsidy on agricultural products. A Europe that works better - closer to the citizen MEPs welcome the Commission's commitment to applying an impact assessment process for all legislative measures of substance. They invite the Commission to develop a more ambitious approach for guaranteeing Member States comply with their obligations to implement EU directives. They also want a considerably more ambitious approach to the simplification of existing legislation. Parliament stresses the paramount importance of making Europe work better and bringing it closer to the citizens, and that therefore the EU institutions should work together to help ensure the ratification of the Constitution. MEPs welcome the Commission's emphasis on value for money and accountability as well as the suggestion of a roadmap aimed at securing a positive statement of assurance from the Court of Auditors. They again call for reforms to the EU Financial Regulation to remove all obstacles to proper implementation.

Unfortunately, this is a boon not just for law- abiding citizens but also for criminals. A recent, often-cited case is that of the paedophile convicted in France who later committed a similar crime in Belgium; but another area where cooperation is needed is the fight against terrorism. If information on criminal records were swapped more easily and reliably between Member States, this could help track down those suspected of such crimes. Against this background, Parliament adopted a report which seeks to tighten up a Commission proposal on the exchange of information on criminal records between Member States, so as to make it more effective while also improving safeguards for personal data protection. The Commission's draft decision requires each Member State to designate a central authority responsible for the exchange of information. Rapporteur Antonio DI PIETRO (ALDE, \u0393\u03a4) agrees with this but would like to speed up the process of exchanging information. Parliament cuts the deadline by which the central authority must deal with a request for information from the judicial authorities of another Member State from five working days to \"48 hours in urgent cases and otherwise within a period not exceeding 10 working days\". Mr Di Pietro's justification is that, in emergencies, 48 hours is the minimum amount of time required in many Member States for confirmation to be provided as to whether or not an individual is being held in custody. Data protection A cornerstone of the directive will of course be the question of data protection. How can one ensure that the personal information of a convicted person obtained by a country is only being used by the judicial authorities and only for criminal proceedings? What other uses might be allowed? The Commission proposes that the limits on the use of personal data will be decided by the national law of the Member State receiving the request. But MEPs say that where personal data are forwarded for purposes other than criminal proceedings, both the requesting Member State and the one receiving the request must be aware of this 12 PE 349.801 ",
        "March-2005 The Week and must have mutually agreed the limits within which such information may be gathered. Furthermore, Parliament says that the directive must comply with existing conventions on personal data protection. This EU decision, which the report says should come into force within six months of its publication, focuses essentially on better coordination of resources to speed up the information exchange process. However the Commission also intends to put forward further legislation in the near future to create a complete, computerised database of all criminal records in all EU countries, so as to make it quicker and easier to check these records.

At the same time, membership of the EU will entail an obligation to treat all European citizens \"in a comparable fashion\" , a principle which will also apply to judicial proceedings. With this in mind, Parliament adopted a recommendation to the Council calling for better standards of criminal justice in the different Member States. for Member States to hand over their citizens to judges in other Member States\", explained the rapporteur, Antonio COSTA (PES, PT). For this purpose, the report suggests \"a Quality Charter for Criminal Justice in Europe\" to serve as a reference framework for all EU countries. Imagine the following scenario: an EU citizen is accused of a criminal offence while on holiday in a Member State other than his or her own. Should not this person have the right to immediate access to a lawyer, a fair judicial procedure or even a translator so that they enjoy the same standard of legal treatment as they would at home? MEPs would like to see an \"essential minimum degree of harmonisation\" in areas of national legislation such as the minimum rights of prisoners, the possibility for them to serve their sentence in their Member State of residence and the gathering and assessment of evidence. And rules on the right to a fair trial, the right to access to legal aid and the right to be tried within a reasonable time should also be harmonised. Lastly MEPs say the Quality Charter should be based on the establishment of \"a mechanism for ongoing mutual evaluation of the quality of justice\" in the different EU countries, based on measures such as a comparative statistical database, benchmarking exercises and sharing of best practice. Guidelines for strengthening trust between Member States, especially by improving the quality of justice, were included in the Hague Programme adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council last November.

The internal market has helped improve public services too. It is important to get away from corporatist requirements and focus on the needs of the citizen as consumer of public services and as taxpayer. \" In the July 2003 'Altmark' case, the Court of Justice ruled that certain forms of government support for public services did not constitute 'state aid' as defined in the Treaties, and thus did not require approval from the Commission under the competition rules. The judgement left some legal uncertainty as to exactly which cases would meet the criteria. The Commission has put forward proposals on how it intends to interpret the ruling, and on a clearer framework for its future approach to the whole area of compensation for public services. Exemption of small scale public services from state aid rules Sophia Helena INT VELD (ALDE, NL) Report on State aid in the form of public service compensation (2004/2186(INI)) Doc: A6-0034/2005 Procedure : Own-initiative Debate : 21.02.2005 Vote : 22.02.2005 Parliament has welcomed plans to clarify the rules on how EU competition law applies to state aid in the form of compensation for public services. By 478 votes in favour to 155 against with 10 abstentions, MEPs adopted an own-initiative report from Sophia INT VELD (ALDE, NL) which says small service providers should be excluded altogether from the requirement to notify the Commission of public funding, as should relatively small- scale sea and air transport links to islands and remote areas. The Commission proposes to exclude small scale public service compensation altogether from the notification requirements, but has not precisely defined 'small' leaving this question open for discussion during the consultation. MEPs say that the exclusion should apply to undertakings with turnover under \u20ac50 million receiving annual compensation of under \u20ac15 million. The Commission also planned to exclude sea transport to islands carrying fewer than 100,000 passengers per year. Parliament says services to remote communities whether by land, sea or air should be excluded, providing there are fewer than 300,000 passengers per year. The Commission, subject to certain criteria, plans also to exclude public compensation to hospitals and social housing undertakings, but MEPs warn that extensive state aid may lead to distortions of competition in these areas. Since the organisation of these sectors varies widely between Member States, they say exclusion should be introduced only when a Member State has provided a detailed report to the Commission on their health and social housing sectors 14 PE 349.801 ",
        "March-2005 The Week The Altmark ruling said that where open tendering was not used, 'compensation' (as opposed to 'state aid') was limited to that needed for a typical well run undertaking to provide the service and make a reasonable profit. Parliament is now asking the Commission to use a benchmarking exercise to clarify what this would mean in practice. While the Commission proposed that its new Framework should run until the end of 2007, MEPs say they should be valid for four years. They stress the importance of consulting widely, in particular with the users of public services, in putting the plans into action, and call for an extensive impact assessment before the rules are renewed. Parliament also asks the Commission to clarify the legal status of its planned framework.

Parliament calls for the Commission to work to complete the internal market and ensure fair competition in all sectors. MEPs support the independence of the European Central Bank and the harmonisation of both the economic hypotheses and the timetables for setting national budgets for eurozone members. MEPs warn that increased productivity alone will not lead to sufficient growth to cope with demographic change and cover all economic and social needs and that structural reform cannot be a substitute for macroeconomic policy. Alarmed at continuing high unemployment, they stress the need to create an environment which promotes the spirit of enterprise and a risk-taking culture, by simplifying the regulatory environment, reducing the administrative burden on small businesses and by reducing the general level of taxation. They also consider that the growth of free and fair international trade, founded on equal opportunities, will both contribute to the development of poor countries and create new markets for developed countries. The report was adopted despite a call from rapporteur Robert GOEBBELS (PES, LU) for MEPs to vote against. He argued that the final text after amendments at committee stage and in plenary had become distorted and no longer reflected his views. During the debate, he said, \"Structural reforms have taken place but without growth they will not be effective. The problem in the eurozone is not a lack of stability, it is a lack of growth, especially in France, Germany and Italy.

The plenary adopted an own-initiative report, drawn up by Othmar KARAS (EPP-ED, AT), which notes that higher deficits are \"largely the result of a discretionary loosening of budgetary policy by some Member States. \" MEPs also said that there should be no exception to the rules and procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact calling for \"all Member States, large or small, to receive equal treatment. To achieve that, the Commission's role, particularly in launching the excess deficit procedure, should be enhanced.\" The House says, however, that there is a need to find \"strong, fair and workable solutions\" for the Stability and Growth Pact while \"strengthening the preventive aspect, paying greater heed to differences in economic situations and improving the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (the corrective part of the Pact) and economic governance\". Mr Karas told the plenary debate: \"The EU is a community of law, but since the introduction of the Stability and Growth Pact, 12 Member States have violated its treaty based provisions, including some members of the eurozone. The common currency is a great success, but we have no common budget policy. There is a need for structural change and long term reform. We want more stability, more growth and more employment. \" Noting that some governments have not taken sufficient measures to combat their deficits, Parliament says there are \"grounds for concern regarding their prospects from bringing their deficits below 3% of GDP in the immediate future. \" Member States, say MEPs, should reduce their deficits to significantly less than 3% of GDP to allow for sufficient financial reserves to be built up to face up to difficult times without breaking the Pact's mies. They also recommend a greater emphasis in the Pact on economic developments and an increased focus on safeguarding the sustainability of public finances. Excessive deficits, they say, put price stability, low interest rates and government investment plans at risk. MEPs also highlight the need to improve budgetary statistics with more accurate and standardised definitions, and greater powers for Eurostat to coordinate, monitor and carry out on-the-spot controls on the figure provided by Member States.

The programme seeks to highlight the richness and variety of European cultures as well as their shared features, and to improve the understanding that Europe's citizens have of each other. But the Union has grown in size since the programme started and so, from 2009, there will be two European Capitals of Culture per year to enable the countries that joined the EU at the last enlargement to take part as early as possible.

Parliament voted strongly in favour of an agreement, reached last week at an informal trilogue between Parliament and Council delegations on the common position regarding pollution from ships. Until now, Council had been reluctant to accept such Parliament's proposals, arguing that criminal sanctions were a competence of the Member States. All the 13 compromise amendments were adopted following the agreement with Council. Criminal sanctions could, in the most serious cases, even include imprisonment or heavy fines. The new directive will be supplemented by detailed rules on criminal offences and sanctions in order to strengthen the legal framework for the enforcement of the law against ship- source pollution. Under the new law, all those responsible in the pollution chain could be prosecuted, not only captain and crew. Another success for the EP Delegation was the agreement on the setting up of a European coastguard, opposed by some Member States.

A majority of MEPs (548 votes in favour, 103 against and 9 abstentions) decided that these licences should be replaced by a \"credit card\" model within 10 years and that a single EU driving licence should be introduced within 20 years. They also were in favour of the introduction of a European driving licence information network to combat fraud and \"driving licence tourism\". Member States by a single EU format. The proposals would lead to easier movement for drivers and greater safety on the roads. Member States should be allowed to introduce a microchip if they wish as an anti- fraud measure. MEPs also were in favour of the introduction of a single focal point for access to driving licences in each state - in effect a driving licence network. EU states could then refuse to issue a licence to an applicant who has his licence restricted, suspended or withdrawn in another EU country. This would stop the \"driving licence tourism\" in the Member States. The Commission had proposed that ordinary licences issued to drivers who are 65 or more should be valid for only 5 years. Parliament took the view that a blanket restriction for the over-65s was not justified. Medical checks, say MEPs, are a matter for the Member States.

Based on advanced information and communication technologies, this River Information Services (RIS) system will give information regarding the navigation conditions of waterways, the actual situation in the immediate vicinity of a vessel as well as strategic information for the planning of voyages including lock, port and terminal scheduling. Data such as the position and heading of the vessel, the ship's name and speed as well as information related to the cargo will be captured electronically and processed automatically. Although participation in RIS is not compulsory, the system is expected to have many economic and environmental benefits for the inland waterway sector. While endorsing RIS in principle, the Transport Committee had adopted 40 amendments on several issues. MEPs in the committee felt that RIS guidelines and technical specifications should take account of, and build on, preliminary work carried out in this field by relevant international organisations. The Commission was asked to monitor the setting up of RIS and to report within three years of the Directive's entry into force. At an informal trilogue on 1 February 2005, Parliament and Council delegations reached agreement on a range of technical and practical aspects regarding RIS such as a uniform European vessel number system, interoperability and the use of satellite positioning. Parliament therefore adopted rapporteur Renate SOMMER's (EPP-ED, D) amendments relating to this compromise. The adoption of these amendments implies that this legislation can be finally adopted at first reading.

MEPs, however, adopted a range of compromise amendments forming part of a package aimed at a first reading agreement with Council and Commission. These amendments seek to tighten up the proposals. At an earlier stage, Parliament had already expressed its deep concern on fraud involving seafarers' certificates.

Members took into account that fraud involving certificates was mainly a problem outside the EU, but that vessels flying the flag of, and with crews from, third countries also entered EU ports and waters, thus constituting a risk to maritime safety. Member States should also take and enforce the appropriate measures to prevent fraud and other unlawful practices and should provide for sanctions that were effective, proportionate and dissuasive. They also should designate the national authorities competent to detect and combat fraudulent practices and exchange information with other countries' competent authorities concerning the certification of seafarers.

MEPs also said that the Agency should provide the Member States and the Commission with the technical and scientific assistance necessary to help them apply the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy correctly, including aspects relating to health and safety at work. The Agency should, according to MEPs, coordinate operations to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in conformity with Community rules. As well as a greater input into the Agency from representatives of the fisheries industry, MEPs stated that the Agency should be based in Vigo, Galicia, in view of the port's highly important status in world fishing, in terms of the sheer volume of catches and of international shipping.

But there are still too many cases, with nearly 300,000 workers suffering permanent disability each year. And the figures are not declining for everybody: in some Member States the high rate of accidents among temporary workers is at least double that of permanent workers. To help the Member States, especially the new ones, to enact in their national legislation the EU's directives on health and safety at work, Parliament is asking the Commission to consider using the \"open coordination method\" in this area. This method requires the Member States to swap experience and good practice - but without introducing binding European legislation. In a report adopted by MEPs, Parliament noted the drop in the number of accidents at work but voiced concern at the less positive trend for temporary workers. They therefore want the Member States to reach swift agreement on the directive on working conditions of temporary workers. Parliament believes the EU's future strategy on health and safety should include the liberal professions but should focus above all on the construction, fisheries, agriculture and health sectors. Quicker assessment of the results of the second half of the Strategy on Health and Safety at Work 2002-2006 is also needed. In addition, Parliament urges an increase in the number, standard and powers of work inspectors. Parliament's resolution highlights the importance of preventive measures in reducing the risk of workplace accidents and long-term health problems. Around 50% of workers in the EU do not have access to prevention services, so the report calls on the Commission \"to examine the state of Member States' preventive systems in greater detail and to come forward with proposals for framing coherent national prevention policies based on an overall EU strategy\". This would include, for example, guides on how to apply existing directives, taking into account the sex and age of workers as well as the nature of the risks. MEPs note that a high level of worker protection will lead to a competitive disadvantage for the old Member States within the Community unless it is ensured that, in the new Member States, the acquis communautaire is fully implemented and the health protection directives are applied in practice. 26 PE 349.801 ",

You may be wrongly led to believe that the after-sales service included in your guarantee can only be provided in the country where the product was sold. A letter may drop into your mailbox saying you have won a prize, apparently with no strings attached, when in fact the prize does not exist or you will have to pay to receive it. Or you may pick up a scratch card that urges you to dial a number to win a prize - without mentioning the exorbitant cost of the phone call. These are clearly unfair commercial practices and the European Parliament adopted a report by Mercedes BRESSO (PES, \u0393\u03a4) on measures designed to tackle them. Under a new EU directive put forward by the European Commission, which defines and lists such practices, there would be standard rules at European level to replace the existing patchwork of national laws. The goal of maximum harmonisation in the field of consumer protection has never been so clearly formulated. MEPs voted to amend the blacklist of unfair practices proposed by the Commission in the draft directive. They also emphasise that no single country will be able to alter the list, which can be changed only be revising the directive itself. One aim of the new rules is to give better protection to consumers regarded as 'vulnerable', such as children. MEPs voted to outlaw advertising that includes 'a direct exhortation' to children to buy a product or persuade their parents to buy it, although without imposing an outright ban on advertising directed at children. They also voted to stop traders posing as consumers of their own products to boost sales without revealing their commercial intent, and to prevent insurers deterring clients from exercising their contractual rights, asking for unnecessary documents or systematically ignoring important correspondence. Parliament also demanded a better definition and stronger protection of vulnerable consumers. The 'average consumer' is still the benchmark, as the Commission itself suggested, but the definition of this, plus a reference to Court of Justice case-law, have been tightened up by MEPs. Member States will have 24 months from the entry into force of the directive to adopt and publish the necessary national legislation.

The Council, which had already agreed to a majority of Parliament's 58 first reading amendments, made it clear that it would not accept some of the MEPs' resubmitted proposals. In particular, with regard to the 'common market' clause, the Council refused to reintroduce (as in the Commission's initial proposal and as favoured by certain MEPs) the 'country of origin' principle (under which the law of the Member State where the trader is established is applicable).
