        "www.eesc.europa.eu 1 Bring Rio home & seize the momentum Dear Readers, Th ere\u2019s no denying the fact that the economic situation in the European Union remains fragile despite the eff orts of all those involved to fi nd a solution. Every- where you look there is bad news. But there is less said about the progress that is being made. In recent months we have witnessed a lot of developments regarding economic growth. At the G8 Summit in Camp David in May, growth and employment, two of the EESC\u2019s main priorities, were at the heart of discussions. A month later at the G20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, once again these were the main topics on the agenda. Th at\u2019s all very well, some may say. Talk is cheap. But where\u2019s the action? Where are the strategies and concrete measures to back this up? I would argue that we already have a growth and jobs strategy designed to face the challenges and get results \u2013 one which is making an impact now and which can help to shape the future: the Europe 2020 framework strategy to get the EU back on a prosperous track. European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso recently said that \u201cthe EU has a world-class growth strategy in its Europe 2020 strategy\u201d and called for the initiative to be embraced as the only \u201cplatform for a new growth initiative\u201d. Th e consensus is that the Europe 2020 strategy is our most eff ective framework for action and one that meets real grass-roots needs. We at the EESC believe that the Europe 2020 strategy is now more important than ever. However, we also believe that Europe 2020 will only be a success if it is the subject of a determined and focused eff ort at both the EU and national levels. At the EU level, key decisions are being taken to complete the Single Market in services, energy and digital products, and to invest in essential cross-border links. At national level, many obstacles to competition and job creation must be removed and more focus placed on local and regional capacity for sustainable development, creativity and innovation, with the well-being of EU citizens at heart. But only if these eff orts are combined and coordinated will they have the desired impact on growth and jobs. Th e four workshops at the heart of the Europe 2020 EESC Conference on 25 September will tackle all the levers that can be used to foster growth, such as genuine European political and economic governance, backed up by a proper European budget, the internal market, and employment, research and develop- ment, and industrial policies. Th e objective is to build on the progress we\u2019ve already made, to continue to work together to ensure Europe 2020\u2019s success, and ultimately to provide a robust, prosperous and fair future for us all.

Like so many others, I cer- tainly have mixed feelings about the Rio outcome. It is good that we have an agreement, and the outcome text contains various elements on which we can build. I was particularly impressed by the level of involvement at the side events and the voluntary commit- ments from diff erent stakeholders to the various thematic initiatives. With over 10 000 participants from civil society, the Rio+20 Conference had the biggest contribution ever from civil society. However, I can clearly see the gap between civil society\u2019s aspirations, ambitions and com- mitments and the actual wording of the outcome document agreed by the heads of state. It does not refl ect the sense of urgency felt by civil society, and lacks concrete action-oriented decisions and precise timelines. Being an advisory body, the EESC was not directly involved in the nego- tiations, but our civil society members\u2019 grassroots knowledge and expertise contributed to the EU\u2019s input to the negotiations. Th e purpose of our con- tribution to the Rio+20 Summit was two-fold: to mobilise and promote the role of EU civil society in sustainable development issues and to engage in a dialogue with the EESC\u2019s third coun- try partners to explain European val- ues and positions. As a result, some of the main posi- tions that the EESC was advocating have been refl ected in the fi nal doc- ument: the social dimension , food security , the Sustainable Develop- ment Goals (despite an absence of clear themes), the 10 year frame- work programme on sustainable consumption , an agreement on the green economy as an essential tool for sustainable development and the limitations of GDP. Furthermore, there was broad recognition for the role of civil society (albeit without binding institutional mechanisms). I have been actively supporting the idea of an Ombudsman for future generations to introduce a long-term approach and ensure inter-genera- tional solidarity when deciding on our future. Th e UN Secretary Gen- eral will follow up on this. Th e other institutional reform is the decision to establish a new High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Develop- ment , which will replace the Com- mission on Sustainable Development, and ensure the regular participation of heads of state in reviewing progress on all commitments. Th e road from Rio is at least as important as the road to Rio. It is crucial for the EESC to seize the momentum and it is doing this by continuing to mainstream sus- tainable development in additional policy areas (i.e. Europe 2020), further coordinating its policy work and, on the external front, by working closely with the European Commission on initiatives to create common ground with comparable organisations in other countries, including our major trading part- ners, and encouraging it to continue the dialogue. Th is autumn, we will organise an inter-institutional workshop on the follow-up to Rio with the support of Commissioner Poto\u010dnik. I would like to stress the importance of the process for defi ning the Sustainable Development Goals. The EESC is ready to make a strong commitment to facilitate civil society\u2019s involve- ment in and meaningful contribu- tion to this process, as we did in the run-up to Rio. The road from Rio needs our support and continued civil society action to secure political decisions in favour of an inclusive, green econ- omy. \u25cf Staff an Nilsson, President of the EESC \u201cWorld-class\u201d Europe 2020 strategy needs EU and national support to succeed \u201c \u201d Th e road from Rio is at least as important as the road to Rio. \u201c \u201d I can clearly see the gap between civil society\u2019s aspirations, ambitions and commitments and the actual wording of the outcome document.

        "2 Europe needs a bigger budget \u201cThe budget is not just about fi gures. It is a tool for pursuing a political project\u201d, argue Jacek Krawczyk (Employers\u2019 Group, Poland) and Stefano Palmieri (Workers\u2019 Group, Italy) in their recent opinion on the next 2014-2020 multiannual EU budget This is why the EU\u2019s budget policy must be defi ned in accordance with the fundamental choice between fed- eralism and an intergovernmental sys- tem and hence the desired level and scope of future integration, they say. Yet at a time when Europe is trying to get out of the economic quagmire it fi nds itself in, there is a risk that long- term development will be sacrifi ced on the altar of short-termism. With austerity sweeping across Europe and some Member States calling for cuts, there is a risk and danger that a mini- malist budget will be adopted. Th e European Commission is pro- posing to keep the EU\u2019s total budget at the current 1% of EU GDP. The Committee considers this proposal to be too obsessed with preserving the status quo and thinks it would mean failing to address many of the upcom- ing challenges. An EU budget for growth Th e EESC argues that the 2014-2020 European budget should be increased to 1.11% and seen as a part of the European growth agenda. Some Member States want to cut at least EUR 100 billion from the next 7-year budget. If these demands were followed through, they would axe the policies that boost EU growth the most: cohesion, research and innovation. National treasuries would be wise to view EU tasks and the corresponding funding more as an investment and less as an expense. Some might worry that a bigger EU budget might jeopardise fiscal consolidation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Th e EU budget represents no more than 2.5% of public spending in the EU and actually helps Member States not to veer off the consolidation path. By way of comparison, it is worth noting that the bail-outs granted to date to financial institutions in Europe, excluding guarantees, have totalled some 4-5% of EU GDP. Th e EU budget is one of the main drivers of investment in many EU countries. In some Member States, cohesion policy alone is responsible for between a third and three-quarters of all public investments. However, cohe- sion policy does not just bring advan- tages to its most obvious recipients: newer or less-developed EU countries. A tough task to win hearts and minds over the budget Th e EU budget cannot be increased without winning over public opin- ion. Th e problem is two-fold. First, citizens oft en fail to see the EU\u2019s impact on their lives. Th is is why the EESC is now carrying out an evaluation of the cost of \u201cnon- Europe\u201d, which means implement- ing policies separately at national level. Th e goal of this exercise is to show how things can be done bet- ter and more cheaply if countries work together and avoid duplica- tion in national budgets. It would also show how much delays in EU integration \u2013 agreeing a common patent system or a single Euro- pean sky, for example \u2013 are costing European citizens. On the latter, for example, we can say that consumers pay dearly for the fragmentation of European airspace. It has cost around EUR 150 billion in lost GDP for the EU and has caused 150 million extra tonnes of CO2 to be pumped into the air over a decade. In other words, a truly single European airspace could save EU citizens \u20ac920 million, as well as reduce carbon emissions by 12%. The last time research into the cost of non-Europe was carried out was in 1988. Second, EU citizens often fail to appreciate the impact of the EU budget. Procedures are too cum- bersome and seem very opaque to the public. We advocate a \u201creal revolution\u201d, to speed up proce- dures and introduce greater trans- parency, to make the EU budget a model of governance, eff ective- ness, transparency and control of administrative expenditure. (mb) \u25cf The EU budget is a great investment tool Interview with Janusz Lewandowski, European commissioner responsible for Financial Programming and Budget EESC Info: In a recent statement you argued that the European budget would boost growth. Yet many are concerned that, at a time of economic hardship and sweeping austerity measures, this European growth agenda might jeopardise fi scal consolidation. Do they have a point? Janusz Lewandowski: I am not sure who those \u201cmany\u201d you refer to are. Can I simply stress that on 29 June, the European Council, i.e. the Member States, unanimously called for investment to boost com- petitiveness; they also adopted the \u2018Compact for growth and jobs\u2019 stat- ing that the EU budget must be a catalyst for growth and jobs across Europe. Indeed, I feel that more and more governments understand that austerity alone will not get us out of the current crisis. What we need is a blend of savings and investment, and the EU budget is a great invest- ment tool. In many areas, one euro spent at EU level can generate 7, 10, sometimes even 14 euros simply by attracting private investors and facilitating bank loans. Furthermore, all 27 Member States have endorsed \u2013 and are sticking to- the Europe 2020 strategy, a roadmap for inclu- sive and sustainable growth in which the EU budget plays a key role. EESC Info: The EESC strongly backs your proposal to provide the EU with its own resources, as that would take the EU budget forward from an \u201cI want my money back\u201d attitude to one that creates more transparency. You suggest introducing a tax on fi nancial transactions and a new VAT. What kind of VAT would that be? JL: Th e idea is to take one percent- age point of the standard rate VAT collected by every Member State for the EU budget. It is NOT to add 1% to the current national VAT rates. Th e new VAT resource would there- fore be a single EU rate applied on all the goods and services currently subject to the standard rate in all EU Member States. The current VAT own resource is purely statistical: it is merely a comparison between the amount of VAT collected in any Member State and its GNI; it there- fore affects Member States differ- ently. Th e new system will be 1% for all Member States, in other words, a simpler, more transparent and more equal system. EESC Info: EU citizens often see the EU budget as being opaque, with cumbersome procedures and stifl ing red tape. What are the main simplifi cations contained in your proposal? JL: Well, the good news is that from 1 January 2013, access to EU funds will be simplifi ed for businesses, NGOs, researchers, students, municipalities and other ben- efi ciaries. Aft er two years of nego- tiations with the Council and the Parliament, we now have agreement for measures such as scrapping the obligation for benefi ciaries of funds to open separate bank accounts, shortening the time for payments to benefi ciaries (to 30, 60 or 90 days depending on the complexity of the deliverables), more use of lump sums and flat rates to reimburse smaller expenditures, removing the need to fi ll in the same details every time one applies for EU funds and on-line applications, to name just a few. At the same time, easier access to EU funds will not mean slack controls of taxpayers\u2019 money: up to 80% of EU budget expendi- ture is managed by Member States under so-called shared manage- ment, in areas such as agriculture, growth and employment aid to EU regions (structural funds); under the new rules, national fund managers for structural and other EU funds under shared management will have to issue annual management declarations that will be subject to independent audit. EESC Info: When do you expect a deal on the next multi-annual fi nancial perspective? JL: It is always tricky to read a crys- tal ball, of course. However, at the last European Council last June, the 27 Member States unanimously stated that their aim is to reach a global agreement by the end of this year. Th at would be excellent news, as we will need about one year to prepare the legal basis for each pro- gramme adopted under the overall fi nancial framework. Th e European Parliament is also committed to reaching an agreement by the end of the year, so the mood is promis- ing.

        "3 EESC Groups\u2019 Presidents look at the Europe 2020 Strategy Europe 2020 is now more important than ever EN ISSN 1725-1923 EE S C in fo European Economic and Social Committee a bridge between Europe and organised civil society Dear Readers, As we all know, the European Union is currently experiencing the worst economic, social and political crisis in its history. It is a crisis which is severely aff ecting Member States and their people and threatening the single currency, the Stability Pact and the internal market. In this climate, the Europe 2020 strategy, the EU\u2019s economic initiative to stimulate sustainable growth and employment, has taken on greater importance and signifi cance. By off ering a comprehensive agenda for reforms aimed at securing sustainable growth, Europe 2020 is the basis for a more secure, resilient Europe in the future. A great deal is riding on the success of this strategy, which is why many across the EU have been asking whether it does in fact provide an effi cient and coherent framework for growth. So, will it all work out as planned? In my view, given its structure and priori- ties, Europe 2020 is the right response under the current circumstances. It builds on the Lisbon Treaty, which defi ned the broad responsibilities of the European institutions, and has opened new avenues for further integration. But that alone is not enough. As well as the need to monitor more closely the implementation of EU decisions by national governments, it is a fact that some Member States are currently maintaining a certain distance from the Union, which will not further common European interests. Europe 2020 can, if applied according to the various Council conclusions, be a reliable way to bring Member States and the EU closer together. Europe 2020 does not represent \u201charmonisation\u201d. In fi elds that are not explicitly covered by the Treaty, such as education or national industrial and innovation policies, it envisages a pooling of EU and national competences in a common framework in order to achieve the objectives laid down in the Treaty. To make it a success, political will and continuity are indispensable. As things stand, it is a moot point whether there is enough of either of these two elements. Th e EESC takes the view that Europe 2020 should be seen as a key conduit to future EU development, in particular through national reform programmes, sound public fi nances, and a badly needed growth strategy. It is becoming clear that national policies alone are not suffi cient and that European-level policy cooperation needs to be beefed up. Achieving the Europe 2020 goals requires fi rm, integrated monitoring to address key macro-economic challenges and the application of a thematic approach to speed up growth-enhanc- ing structural reforms. Th is is why the proposed changes in governance of Europe 2020 are so important and integral to its success. Th rough the European Semester\u2019s annual cycle of economic and fi scal policy coordination, the European framework can be reinforced and procedures made more effi cient. With this in mind, it is a matter of priority to secure closer cooperation between the European institutions and the full involvement of national parliaments, social partners, regions and other stakeholders in implementing the required policies and ensuring wide ownership. Th e involvement of European social partners and organised civil society is integral to the success of Europe 2020. For this to be fully harnessed, barriers to genuine dialogue with social partners and civil society organisations must be removed and the consultation and mobilisation of organised civil society at all levels needs to be improved. Organised civil society in the Member States should also be involved as active partners in the monitoring and implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy. Th e Europe 2020 process should be a process in which all parties concerned are involved, not limited to policymakers, legislators and expert groups. Joost van Iersel President of the Europe 2020 Steering Committee September 2012/7 Special edition Henri Malosse, President of the EESC Employers\u2019 Group Georgios Dassis, of the EESC Workers\u2019 Group Luca Jahier, President of the EESC Various Interests\u2019 Group Henri Malosse, President of the EESC Employers\u2019 Group Georgios Dassis, President of the EESC Workers\u2019 Group Luca Jahier, President of the EESC Various Interests\u2019 Group Economic governance: is Europe doing enough? The economic and financial crisis has revealed a number of weaknesses in the economic governance of EU economic and monetary union. Th e Union and its Member States have therefore taken a series of important decisions which will strengthen eco- nomic and budgetary coordination in the EU as a whole and for the euro zone in particular. With regard to the new rules on economic governance and regula- tions on budgetary processes, the EU response has so far been welcomed by many European organisations, but some \u2013 including the EESC \u2013 have called for more to be done. In December 2011 EESC President Staff an Nilsson declared that Europe had to step up its economic govern- ance if it was to guarantee budgetary and fi scal discipline in each Member State, particularly in the euro zone. He called for fi scal discipline and a rebalancing of national budgets to go hand in hand with long-term Euro- pean growth strategies. As well as improving economic governance, the strengthening of the participatory process and the involvement of stakeholders, such as regional and local authorities, social partners and organised civil society, has been highlighted as an impor- tant factor in implementing Europe 2020. Organisations and institutions have called on European institutions and national governments to make a renewed political commitment to engage with all relevant partners as part of the Europe 2020 governance process. The recommendations made by organisations such as the EESC make clear that for the participatory process to be improved in the short term, engagement and communica- tion between Member States and the European institutions must be made more effective. Actions also need to be clearer and more transparent, with the bodies responsible for car- rying out the Europe 2020 measures clearly identifi ed. All parties involved agree that, in the long term, organ- ised civil society has to be more pro- active in its role as a key partner, explaining the Europe 2020 strategy in Member States at all levels and being involved in all consultations and actions relating to the strategy at European, national and local level. \u25cf Th e Europe 2020 strategy is a positive thing, but it needs to be genu- inely focused on employment, youth and entrepreneurship, and on the interests and concerns of European citizens. Now more than ever, the hopes of Europe rest in its people, and particularly in its young people, who are looking for real prospects for the future. Th e Europe 2020 project will only be a success if it is implemented via tangible projects according to the Com- munity method; in other words, by pooling resources and taking decisions by a qualifi ed majority of Member States. Th at is one of the key messages coming out of the EESC\u2019s work on the cost of non-Europe. Th e priority for the Workers\u2019 Group is the immediate implementa- tion of the Europe 2020 strategy and, more specifi cally, a European recovery plan for jobs, new programmes to get the unemployed, in particular women and young people, into the labour market and earning a decent salary. For this reason, we are calling for urgent action to ensure real economic governance to set a limit to risks on the fi nancial markets and to specu- lation. Th e aim is to prevent the mass unemployment and misery these have recently created. It is imperative that both the EU and Member States rapidly move away from theory to decisive action in implementing the Europe 2020 strategy. In particular, during the current socio-economic crisis which has led to high levels of poverty, the EU and Member States must substantially increase their eff orts and better coordinate activities, in order to enhance EU competitiveness and sustainability, to stimulate innovation, growth, employ- ment and social and territorial cohesion. Th e key actors in this process are SMEs, the social economy and wider civil society, whilst the green economy in particular should be prioritised. \u201c \u201c \u201c \u201d \u201d \u201d EESC info \u2014 September 2012/7 Special edition Europe 2020 is now more important than ever S p e c i a l e d i t i o n E u r o p e 2 0 2 0 ",
        "4 A Single Market fi t for the 21st century When it launched the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Com- mission issued a gloomy appraisal of progress towards a Single Mar- ket in the EU, enabling goods, ser- vices, capital and people to move freely across borders. \u201cTh e current trend shows fatigue and disenchant- ment\u2026\u201d, it admitted. Indeed, while a fully operational Single Market is already two dec- ades behind schedule, the economic crisis has increased pressure on Member States to re-erect national barriers. And yet research shows that completing the Single Market is exactly what is needed to kick-start European growth. The European Economic and Social Committee firmly backs the Commission\u2019s view that: \u201cA new momentum \u2013 a genuine political commitment \u2013 is needed\u201d. Ultimately, the aim of the EU\u2019s ambitious Single Market project is to improve living standards. Th e EESC sees it as \u201cthe centrepiece of Euro- pean integration, with the potential to deliver directly felt benefits to European stakeholders\u201d. So mem- bers are impatient with EU leaders\u2019 failure to keep up the momen- tum. \u201cCome on decision-makers, it\u2019s time to act, no to give lessons or to preach!\u201d says Henri Malosse, President of the Employers\u2019 Group. \u201cHarness the potential of Europe\u2019s 500 million citizens \u2013 you cannot let them down!\u201d Recent projections from France suggest that if all obstacles to inter- nal trade were removed, by 2020 the EU\u2019s national income would be 14 % higher than if barriers remained. Trade between EU Member States would almost double. Personal benefi ts Market integration would benefi t Europeans in all sorts of ways. For example, making it simpler for workers to move between countries would ease unemployment and fi ll gaps in services. Planning train journeys across Europe can be complicated and frustrating. A Single Railway Area would make rail travel more attrac- tive and competitive. At the same time, a Single European Sky could An expert eye on the Single Market The leaders of the three EESC groups representing employees, workers and various interests give their opinions on the Single Market make air transport safer, and sim- plify passengers\u2019 rights. It is estimated that creating an integrated EU energy grid could cut consumers\u2019 power bills by EUR 110 billion by 2020. And in the eco- nomic crisis, easier access to cross- border credit could help many small businesses. The Commission is currently preparing the next phase of legis- lation: the Single Market Act II, and the EESC has highlighted what needs to be done. One top priority is boosting confi dence in the digital market. \u201cTh is requires an ambitious action plan, with the consumer at its heart,\u201d says EESC vice-president Anna Maria Darmanin. Consumers need to know their rights are protected, and here the EESC can help. Various Interests Group president Luca Jahier points out: \u201cWith the participation of organised civil society, we have an insight into what is actually happen- ing on the ground.\u201d \u25cf Table 1 \u2013 Eff ect of full integration: change in national income in 2020 by area (%) Total EU-27 14.1 Benelux 25.3 France 11.6 Germany 11.5 Italy 13.6 Poland 10.8 Spain 9.5 Sweden 10.2 UK 7.1 Rest of EU-27 27.9 Source : V. Aussilloux, C. Emlinger, H. Guimbard & L. Fontagn\u00e9 (2011). Martin Siecker, Workers\u2019 Group We agree with the European Com- mission\u2019s assessment that further integration will be necessary in order to improve the way the Euro- pean services market functions and unlock its full potential, and that this will involve the removal of any obstacles and barriers that take the form of discriminatory, unjustifi ed or disproportionate requirements. However, not all barriers are inap- propriate; whilst Member State leg- islation of certain professions is oft en considered as a barrier, it may well be motivated by a desire to maintain the quality of the service provided, and thus be in the public interest. That such regulation may be seen as a barrier to the freedom to pro- vide cross-border services does not automatically mean that it should be removed. Consumers\u2019 and workers\u2019 rights may be given greater weight than considerations relating to eco- nomic freedoms. Th e freedom to provide services is not equivalent to the free movement of labour. For instance, the monitor- ing and enforcement of working con- ditions applicable in a given country cannot be considered as an obstacle or barrier to the functioning of the single market unless it would impede competition. National or regional governments should be entitled to ensure that their legislation is prop- erly applied and implemented, as this may help prevent cross-border dumping and unfair competition, and close cooperation between Mem- ber states is key to upholding work- ers\u2019 and employers\u2019 rights. We need to make sure that moves to create employment in what will hopefully be an increasingly complete Single Market increase the number of high-quality jobs rather than swelling the ranks of the working poor. Placing consumers at the heart of the Single Market Benedicte Federspiel, Various Interests\u2019 Group Consumer rights that derive directly from the Single Market are a key building block of market integration. Th ey are of clear benefi t to European economic integration, whether they relate to passenger rights, roaming charges, or e-commerce. Yet in many areas consumer protection is still not sufficiently guaranteed. Let me just give you one example. By and large, consumers are still not feeling the benefi t of the Sin- gle Market in retail fi nancial services. While it\u2019s good that work is continu- ing on the transparency of bank fees and better protection for borrowers, more needs to be done to encourage cross-border access to retail fi nancial services. I also think that basic pay- ment accounts should also be available to all citizens across the EU. As regards cross-border services in general, these should be safer, bet- ter and more aff ordable. Th e imple- mentation of the Services Directive should be improved, the activities of single points of contact developed, and information about cross-border services available in different lan- guages. Access to justice is key to boost- ing consumer confidence in the Single Market. Any future alterna- tive dispute resolution schemes must allow fast and cheap settlement of dis- putes, which is more attractive than court proceedings. Group actions, whereby consumers who have been treated badly by the same company can seek collective redress, should be made possible and easily accessible. Ivan Vole\u0161, Employers\u2019 Group Despite considerable progress in adoptng legislative proposals to remove barriers to the Single Market at EU level, too little has been done at national level. Better govern- ance of the Single Market is needed. Another challenge is the lack of com- munication and information about its positive and negative aspects. Without targeted information, com- panies, consumers and society as a whole will remain unaware of the real benefi ts the Single Market brings. It must enhance innovation poten- Martin Siecker, EESC member Workers\u2019 Group Benedicte Federspiel, EESC member Various Interests\u2019 Group Ivan Vole\u0161, EESC member Employers\u2019 Group tial and thus the competitiveness of European companies, whilst the obstacles impeding the application of the Community patent must be quickly removed. To release the Single Market\u2019s full potential, we must tackle the remaining barriers in the fi eld of services, improve access to fi nance, open public procurement to compa- nies from other Member States, and remove the administrative burdens on SMEs. More effi cient and user- friendly regulation is also needed. \u25cf EESC info \u2014 September 2012/7 Special edition ",
        "5 Tackling youth unemployment in the EU Th e under-30s account for one-fi fth of the EU\u2019s total population and are abso- lutely vital to its economy. However, the European Union\u2019s youth unem- ployment rate (20.4%) is more than double the rate for the working popu- lation as a whole (9.6%). Th ere are now fi ve million unemployed young people under the age of 25 in the EU \u2013 one million more than in 2009. In an eff ort to reduce youth unem- ployment, countries such as Germany, Austria and Denmark have adopted robust and structured vocational edu- cation and training (VET) schemes which have helped these countries to achieve the lowest levels of youth unemployment in the EU. In Germany, nearly two-thirds of young people leaving school take part in an apprenticeship scheme. Compa- nies such as electronics and engineer- ing giant Siemens take on around 10 000 apprentices each year, while Mercedes Benz provides apprentice- ships to around 2 000 young people \u2013 about one-third of the German car industry\u2019s annual total intake. One in fi ve German apprentices is a woman. Nine out of 10 young trainees will land Strategy targets jobs for young people The issue of youth employment, education and training is a crucial part of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Flagship initiatives such as \u201cYouth on the Move\u201d and \u201c Your first EURES job\u201d aim to improve young people\u2019s chances of fi nding a job by helping them gain experience in other countries, and improv- ing the quality and attractiveness of education and training across Europe. \u201cYouth on the Move\u201d focuses on young people\u2019s education and employability in a bid to increase the youth employment rate in line with the wider EU target of achieving a 75% employment rate for the working-age population (20-64 years). Th e objec- tive is to make education and train- ing more relevant to young people\u2019s needs, encouraging more of them to take advantage of Union grants to study or train in another country. \u201cYour fi rst EURES job\u201d is designed to help young Europeans fi nd work in other EU countries. Its target is to help some 5 000 people to fi ll job vacancies throughout the Union in the 2012-13 period. It is open to EU nationals, aged 18-30, who are legally resident in a European Union country. Th e EESC welcomes the Commis- sion\u2019s youth employment initiatives and has expressed its willingness to play a part in promoting and imple- menting them. However, the Com- mittee has also stated that the EU\u2019s austerity policy and the lack of a clear and generally recognised growth policy could jeopardise the success of these initiatives, making it vital to put in place an appropriate economic and fi nancial environment. Th e Commission\u2019s youth employ- ment initiatives can represent a source of new opportunities but will not create any new jobs without ade- quate economic and fi nancial sup- port, according to an EESC opinion adopted in July. Th e Committee sug- gests that a European Youth Employ- ment Strategy be adopted as part of the 2014-2020 fi nancial framework in order to ensure the availability of resources for young people under the European Social Fund. \u25cf permanent jobs, while the remainder may well be off ered short-term con- tracts. In Austria, apprenticeships are organised as part of a dual-education system where company-based training is complemented by compulsory part- time attendance at a vocational school. About 40% of all Austrian teenagers begin apprenticeship training on com- pletion of their compulsory education, mostly in the retail, administration and automotive sectors. Denmark has a similar dual-edu- cation system in place for its appren- tices and also provides the option of between one and two years\u2019 training in another country in cases where the skills and knowledge acquired abroad correspond with the apprentice\u2019s pro- fession back in Denmark. Th is foreign \u201c \u201d In Germany, nearly two-thirds of young people leaving school take part in an apprenticeship scheme. placement may be organised at a VET school or foreign company which has signed a training contract with the apprentice\u2019s parent fi rm in Denmark. In terms of employment, VET is hugely important for many profes- sions. By 2020, it is anticipated that around 50% of jobs will depend on medium-level qualifi cations provided by such schemes. Th e European Com- mission is actively promoting current VET programmes and researching ways of modernising the VET system. Th e EESC has welcomed the Com- mission\u2019s efforts to implement new instruments and to launch new ini- tiatives in the area of VET. However, it believes that more can be done, and has called on the Commission to encourage the Member States to achieve the long-term and short- term objectives set out in the Bruges Communiqu\u00e9 on enhanced European Cooperation in Vocational Educa- tion and Training. Improvements in the quality and effi ciency of the VET scheme will boost its attractiveness and make it more relevant to both employers and apprentices. \u25cf \u2018Young people need opportunities and investment now\u2019 President of the European Youth Forum Peter Matja\u0161i\u010d talked to EESC info about the current challenges young people in Europe face when seeking work, and the youth aspects of Europe 2020\u2019s employment strategy How can the current levels of youth unemployment in the EU best be tackled? Bring in a \u2018youth guarantee\u2019 in Europe, where young people are guaranteed a job, training or retraining within four months of being made unemployed. Also, a European Charter for Quality Internships would commit policy- makers and business to better regu- late vital internships and training. There must also be more invest- ment in formal and non-formal education. All in all, a coordinated approach is required to make sure that young people from all over Europe have equal opportunities in terms of access to employment and autonomy. How eff ective have past and current EU measures been in tackling youth unemployment? Th e initial focus of youth employ- ment measures was solely on skills and the responsibility of young peo- ple to adapt to a changing labour market. Little emphasis has been placed on a rights-based approach for young people, the protection of their right to social benefi ts, and the need to create jobs for young peo- ple. Th ere has been a slight shift in focus, but overall it has to be said that decision-makers have been slow to react to the needs of young people. What is your opinion of the Europe 2020 fl agship initiatives for tackling youth unemployment? Although Europe 2020 does address youth employment, it fails to rec- ognise that young people have the same right to high-quality and sta- ble employment as other members of society. Th e European Platform against Poverty points out that young peo- ple are the group most likely to face poverty and social exclusion in Europe, and yet austerity meas- ures have targeted youth organisa- tions and education providers who provide lifelines to people aff ected by these problems. In some EU countries, young people\u2019s unem- ployment benefi ts have been cut, whereas they have been protected for older people. In other countries, a lower minimum wage has been introduced for younger workers. It is the lack of high-quality and stable employment that makes young people vulnerable to unem- ployment, and this needs to be addressed. If young people are expected to carry the European economy forward into the next dec- ade then they need real investment and opportunities now. \u25cf Peter Matja\u0161i\u010d, President of the European Youth Forum EESC info \u2014 September 2012/7 Special edition ",
        "6 Crisis must not be an excuse for inaction In July, the EESC adopted an opinion on the European Commission\u2019s com- munication on the Youth Opportuni- ties Initiative. EESC Info met Tomasz Jasi\u0144ski, rapporteur for the opinion. EESC Info: Two years have passed since the European Commission launched its Youth on the move initiative. Has it been a success? Tomasz Jasi\u0144ski : Not really. And this is mainly because of Member States\u2019 lack of decisive action. The Youth on the move initiative published in September 2010 aimed to \u201cunleash the potential of all young people\u201d through better education and train- ing, quality jobs and mobility oppor- tunities. Yet Member States have failed to move decisively towards these targets. To try to get Member States back on track, the Commis- sion adopted a communication on the Youth Opportunities Initiative only a year aft er the launch of Youth on the move programme. EESC Info: Did the crisis throw a spanner in the works? TJ: Th e diffi culties that young people face on the labour market are struc- tural and predate the crisis, which has only exacerbated their problems. Let\u2019s not forget that unemployment in the 15-24 age group is more than twice that of the economically active population as a whole and nearly three times that of economically active adults. The fact that one in fi ve young people in the EU is cur- rently unable to fi nd a job is cause for alarm. And, the increase in long-term unemployment among young people is a particular cause for concern. On average, 28% of young unemployed people under the age of 25 remain out of work for over 12 months. To make matters worse, the economic crisis has proved so serious that it now seems more diffi cult to achieve the objectives outlined in the Youth on the move initiative. EESC Info: What should Member States do? TJ: If the austerity policy, which is the buzzword across Europe, is not accompanied by a growth policy, it may jeopardise the success of the Youth Opportunities Initiative. This key initiative can only bring the expected results if we create an appropriate economic and fi nancial environment. Anti-crisis and debt- reducing measures must not run contrary to stimulating demand and employment during and aft er the cri- sis and to cushioning social impacts. To put it simply, Member States must not lose sight of the impact their strict budgetary policies have on the posi- tion of young people on the labour market. EESC Info: The Commission urges Member States to act in four key areas: reducing the number of school drop- outs, ending the mismatch between labour market needs and education, supporting on-the-job experience and helping young people land their fi rst job. It sounds costly. TJ: Responsibility for employment and education lies with the Member States. Yet the EU can provide not only expertise, but also funding, not least through the European Social Fund (ESF). At the end of 2011, some EUR 30 billion was still available to Member States from the ESF for pro- jects under the 2007-2013 fi nancial perspective. Th e Commission should do all in its power to ensure that the Member States use these funds eff ec- tively and without delay. Failure to do so might result in calls for the funds to be cut in the next fi nancial per- spective \u2013 and it is precisely that that we have to prevent from happening. Moreover, taking into account the seriousness of the situation, a Euro- pean Youth Employment Strategy should be adopted under the next multiannual budget. (mb) \u25cf Industrial policy makes a comeback \u201cNow more than ever, Europe needs industry and industry needs Europe.\u201d Th e European Economic and Social Committee has consistently fought to place industrial policy centre stage in Europe, even at times when EU lead- ers seemed to dismiss manufacturing as a relic of the past. So the European Commission\u2019s decision to make \u2018an industrial policy for the globalisation era\u2019 one of the fl agship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy was a vin- dication of the Committee\u2019s position. Th ese days, it is widely recognised that Europe must have a strong, sus- tainable industrial base, not only to remain globally competitive, but also to generate growth and provide jobs and wealth for its citizens. \u201cWe have pushed to give importance to manufac- turing sectors because it is good from both the economic and the social point of view,\u201d explains Enrico Gibellieri, co- rapporteur of the EESC\u2019s 2011 opinion on industrial policy. \u201cWe cannot live on fi nancial transactions alone.\u201d Th ankfully, despite the impact of globalisation and major restructuring, the EU is not starting from scratch. \u201cTh e industrial base is still a dominant economic force in Europe,\u201d says rap- porteur Joost van Iersel. \u201cLarge and medium-sized exporting European companies still do a good job.\u201d Coun- tries such as Germany remain among the strongest industrial performers in the world. Redefi ning what industry means However, as the EESC\u2019s Consulta- tive Committee on Industrial Change (CCMI) is well aware, industry today is no longer the grimy leviathan of past eras. Industry and services are ever more closely linked, so that industrial policy must encompass a vast range of sectors. Any coherent strategy also has to recognise the sig- nifi cance of value chains, created by overlapping sectors or the outsourc- ing of production and logistics tasks. Europe has to focus on the latest technologies and the newest innova- tions in order to stay ahead and be able to transfer research advances to the market. And with small and medium-sized enterprises making up 97% of EU companies and cre- ating 80% of new jobs, backing for SMEs is vital. \u201cSMEs need greater self-confidence. They have yet to receive the support they need to enable them to step out and take on the world,\u201d argues CCMI President Jorge Pegado Liz. Most of all, as energy prices rise and raw materials become scarcer, the EU has to redirect its indus- tries towards a more sustainable economy. \u201cSupport for widespread deployment of new breakthrough low-carbon technologies is particu- larly important, to accelerate the learning curve and the rate of take- up,\u201d says Richard Adams, rapporteur on the opinion on the Low Carbon Economy Roadmap. Finally, the promise of good- quality jobs must be at the heart of EU industrial policy, says the EESC. Successful transformation will need the support of all involved, and that means full consultation between policy-makers and representatives of employers, workers and other parts of civil society. \u25cf Tomasz Jasi\u0144ski, EESC member, Workers\u2019 Group Go online or go under Anna Maria Darmanin, Vice-President of the European Economic and Social Committee on the digital single market Th e current crisis provides a not-to- be-missed opportunity for Europe to modernise and adjust to an increasingly competitive, multipo- lar world, but without jeopardising its welfare state. Th at cannot be achieved without a fully operational, eff ective digital single market. Europe\u2019s Internet economy is already bigger than the entire Belgian economy and is growing fast. We need to remove barriers to this growth whilst ensur- ing that swathes of society are not left behind. First of all, every citizen must have equal access to the web. To Anna Maria Darmanin, Vice-President of the EESC achieve this, the price per Mbps should be capped and basic hard- ware produced in Europe and made available at aff ordable prices. Infra- structure should cover the whole of Europe and be upgraded to meet rising demand for online services. Second, people will go on line only if they feel safe. Only 12% of European Internet users feel safe performing online transactions. Malicious soft ware and online fraud are the main stumbling blocks. Increased international coopera- tion and European coordination to counter cyber-attacks and better protect personal data would raise the level of consumer protection and enhance the perception of security. Third, people must have the necessary skills to go online. 30% of Europeans have never used the Internet! One in four adults have never gone online. Th ey risk being excluded from society. Th is skills gap must be closed. Fast-start skills should be off ered to young people, digital schools need to be developed and tailor-made projects should target older generations, for exam- ple through public libraries. European civil society should become a champion of the digital revolution in European countries, regions, businesses, trade unions and NGOs. Th ere is no doubt that in these troubled times, if the Digi- tal Agenda succeeds, the European economic and social model will once again prove its worth. \u25cf \u201c \u201d Europe\u2019s Internet eco- nomy is already bigger than the entire Belgian economy and is growing fast. \u201c \u201d With small and medium- sized enterprises making up 97% of EU companies and creating 80% of new jobs, backing for SMEs is vital.

        "7 Defence industry: is Europe lagging behind? A European strategy for youth employment Th e problems experienced by young people in the European labour market were exacerbated by the economic crisis, which we have been experiencing since 2008. The Commission\u2019s Youth Opportunities Initiative represents a new attempt to remedy this situation. In July, the EESC adopted an opinion on the subject, expressing its willingness to play a part in promoting and imple- menting it. However, the Committee noted that the EU\u2019s austerity policy could jeopardise the success of such a proposal. \u201cThe Youth Opportunities Ini- tiative \u2013 focused on young people who are not in employment, education or training \u2013 can represent a source of new opportunities but will not create any new jobs without adequate economic and fi nancial sup- port\u201d stated Mr Tomasz Jasi\u0144ski (Workers\u2019 Group, Poland) , rapporteur of the opinion. \u201cI suggest that a European Youth Employment Strategy should be adopted as part of the 2014- 2020 fi nancial perspective in order to ensure the availability of resources for young people under the European Social Fund.\u201d Th e EESC opinion also called on Member States to properly implement the Youth Guarantee , so as to ensure that young people are in a job, education or training within four months of leaving school. (rdr) \u25cf For better jobs and fairer competition on the seas In an opinion draft ed by Dr Anna Bredima (Greece, Employers Group) on the 2006 Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), the EESC pushed EU countries to ratify the convention quickly and to support new EU legislation for its implementation, stating that it wass essential in order to ensure fair competition\u201d. Th e MLC, which is oft en dubbed the Seafarers\u2019 Bill of Rights, aims to ensure comprehensive worldwide protection of the rights of seafarers, to establish a level playing fi eld for countries and ship-owners committed to providing decent working and living conditions, and to protect them from unfair competition from substandard ships. In a bid to enforce social rules, the EESC called for an increase in the number of inspectors. It also suggested tasking the European Commission with greater powers of control and recommended a more effi cient complaints procedure. Th e Committee has also advocated the full enforcement of the International Labour Organization\u2019s rules on the defi nition of a \u201cseafarer\u201d. (mb) \u25cf Adequate, safe and sustainable pensions Last February, the European Commission published its White Paper on \u201cAn agenda for adequate, safe and sustainable pensions\u201d. The EESC opinion, drafted by rapporteur Petru Dandea (Work- ers\u2019 Group, Romania) together with co-rap- porteur Krzysztof Pater (Various Interests Group, Poland) , deplored the lack of attention given to pub- lic pension systems, which need to be strengthened as an important component of the social security net. It recognised the role played by complementary private retirement schemes, provided that they are guaranteed and protected, both against speculation and against the misman- agement of savings. The Committee also expressed its concerns over the policies currently pursued by many EU countries: cutting expenditure on pensions and raising the statutory retirement age could pose long-term social risks as they may expose many pensioners to poverty. Finally, the EESC made a num- ber of proposals to improve the EC White Paper, including a recommendation that minimum pension standards and pension income protection mechanisms should be incor- porated into future legislation to protect pensioners and to avoid major social problems. (rdr) \u25cf PLENARY SESSION IN A NUTSHELL While defence budgets across the European Union are being cut, defence spending in China, India, Brazil, Russia and other countries is rising. If Europe wants to maintain a sound security and defence industry, Member States need to coordinate their defence budgets, avoid over- laps and step up joint research pro- grammes. Th is is the message which the EESC emphasised in the opinion on the European defence industry it adopted at its July plenary session. The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) World players like China, India and Brazil, have their own for- eign political ambitions, refl ected in rising defence budgets. By contrast, there is an ongoing debate in Europe over the future of the CSDP, although it is rarely couched in such terms. This aff ects many aspects, such as the use of Battle groups, the contro- versy over the development of a single operational HQ, funding of EU CSDP missions, fi nding the resources for those missions and calls for a review of the Europe Security Strategy. However, the EU has not yet undertaken a thorough review of the CSDP as a whole. Does this refl ect a delib- erate lack of interest? According to the EESC, the indi- vidual eff orts of Member States are totally inadequate and a waste of tax- payers\u2019 money. \u201cWhile certain third countries are increasing their defence expenditure, we cannot continue to waste time with separate research programmes or defence strategies. Th e EU goal should be clear: a com- mon defence policy, a common research programme and shared defence production\u201d, stressed rap- porteur, Joost van Iersel (Employers Group, Netherlands). The Chinese defence budget is expected to rise from EUR 120 bil- lion to EUR 250 billion by 2015. Rus- sia has announced a huge increase in its defence budget by 2015. Th e US spends more than double the total European budget: EUR 450 bn. com- pared with EUR 204 bn. in 2007 and the European budget is shrinking even further. Indeed, the Americans have been severely criticising the way Europeans approach their defence obligations within the Alliance for a long time. Th ere have been repeated calls on both sides of the Atlantic for a \u201cEuropean pillar\u201d in NATO, but these have so far not been heeded. Continuing budget cuts, which under present circumstances result in considerable limitations, should sound a wake-up call. They affect spending on investment and procure- ment, particularly when operational and maintenance costs remain at the same level, or increase as a result of ongoing military operations (Afghani- stan, Libya, anti-piracy operations, to name but a few). Th e industrial land- scape behind the various armed forces \u2013 land, sea, air \u2013 diff ers signifi cantly from country to country, hence the need, now more than ever, for a com- mon defence policy, with coordinated defence industry action. Th ere are a number of areas in which individual countries can no longer be consid- ered capable of developing new gen- erations of armaments on their own. Together, the EU-27 can continue at the forefront of defence technology and R&D. (ail) Defence industry in Europe. State of play Th e EU defence industry is still a key actor worldwide. France, Germany and the UK are the main European producers of Main Battle Tanks (MBT). Many countries develop their \u201cown\u201d naval industry, and build naval vessels diff ering greatly in size and complexity from one country to another. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, UK and Nether- lands lead the field in the area of concept design and complex naval research facilities. Military aircraft are developed by EADS, BAE-Systems, Dassault and Saab- Aircraft . Th e electronics sector, including Command, Communi- cation and Control, is of increas- ing importance for defence with major industrial players such as Th ales, \u201cBAE Systems\u201d and \u201cFin- meccanica\u201d. It is time to decide whether we want to continue being defence industry leaders or to lag behind. \u25cf Following last year\u2019s seminar on media freedom in the EU and its eastern neigh- bours, the Euro- pean Economic and Social Com- mittee is once again embarking on its annual con- ference for communications experts and national and international media professionals. Th is year\u2019s conference will be held in Nicosia, Cyprus, on 11-12 Octo- ber, and will focus on media freedom in the Mediterranean region. Anti-government protests and revolutions have swept through North Africa and the Middle East, toppling rulers in their wake and lay- ing the ground for new leaders. How- ever, they have also left the region in turmoil. Media \u2013 old and new \u2013 played a role in these revolutions by helping people to organise themselves and multiply their voices, thus expedit- ing socio-political processes which, according to some, were already underway. Others go further and boldly state that had it not been for the media, especially the social media, the Arab uprisings would not have occurred at all. Whatever your views on the extent of the media\u2019s impact on the recent Arab revolutions, it is beyond doubt that civil society and its push for media freedom, including online freedom, played and will continue to play a role in reshaping Europe\u2019s and the Mediterranean region\u2019s political, economic and social landscape. The kind of political future we will see will to some extent depend on whether or not the media has the ability and latitude to make the most of its new-found freedom. Th ere is no shortage of challenges: the safety of journalists remains a concern; censorship is never com- pletely out of sight; hate speech is rampant; the formerly state-owned media is struggling to reinvent itself in a new environment; trust needs to be regained; regulation and self- regulation are tricky; ethical and professional standards are being transformed \u2026 Europe must not be a passive bystander. It should not restrict itself to providing moral and political support but should also off er practi- cal peer-to-peer assistance involving civil society and media organisations across the Mediterranean. Questions abound on what form cooperation and assistance should take, and the best answers will come from active stakeholders in the region. Admittedly, Europe has its own challenges and media freedom shortcomings to address, which is why a lively exchange of best prac- tices with actors in the Mediterra- nean region will indubitably benefi t both sides. Speakers from political circles, media and civil society organisations on both shores of the Mediterranean will address all the questions listed above and many more. Th e seminar is organised in con- junction with the Cyprus EU Presi- dency and the European External Action Service.

Next issue: November 2012 P RINTED ON 100% RECYCLED PAPER PEER-TO-PEER INTERVIEW SOON IN THE EESC IN SHORT The pleasure of being socially active In a new series of interviews, Tomasz Jasi\u0144ski, Polish Member of the EESC Workers\u2019 Group and Members\u2019 rep- resentative on the board of the EESC Info newsletter, is speaking to his fellow Members to find out what makes them tick. He recently met Kinga Jo\u00f3, a Hungarian Member of the EESC\u2019s Various Interests Group representing the National Union of Students and the National Civil Fund. Here are some excerpts: Tomasz Jasi\u0144ski: As a young person, what do you think young people in Europe need most at the moment? Kinga Jo\u00f3 : They definitely need stability, so that they can look for- ward to a quality life, off ering them career opportunites, healthcare and the opportunity to plan their families. On the other hand, young people need challenges. Th is is why I think the EU should be a hotbed of innovation and artistic achievement, and it should become a place of true participatory democracy. Society is attractive to young people if it is both stable and stimulating, I believe. TJ: You are one of the newer Members of the EESC. What are your impressions of the institution? KJ: I keep getting lost around the corridors of the EESC headquar- ters. I am only half-serious, but the truth is that it\u2019s extremely dif- fi cult for new members to fi nd their \u201cright way\u201d in the Committee. Th e handbook given to new members can be very informative, but it fails to explain the dynamics of the organisation. All Members have to fi nd out for themselves how to get involved in the work of the EESC and how best to contribute. TJ: What do you do back in your home country? KJ: I work as an advisor for a number of Hungarian state agen- cies and private foundations that provide funding for civil society organisations. In the EESC, I rep- resent a couple of Hungarian civil society organisations. One of them is an association of student repre- sentatives and the other is a fund that distributes state money to NGOs on the basis of competitive applications. TJ: Why did you decide to get involved in student movements? KJ: I have always been active socially. It all started off in an elementary school just after the political transformation in Hun- gary, when each class had to send a representative to a school coun- cil. I was appointed, and that was how I learnt about participatory democracy. While at college, I was elected to the board of the National Union of Students, which went on to become one of the strongest in Europe. TJ: And what do you do in your free time? KJ: I do not have as much as I would like. During weekends and holidays I am a happy full-time mum of three small kids: Linda, who is 6, Marcell, 4, and Helga, 2. My husband and I love to try diff erent foods, both at home and abroad. If I have any free time left , I run to the nearest swimming pool for a good swim and hot sauna. \u25cf Kinga Jo\u00f3, EESC member Various Interests Group The EESC: its role and action Betting on civil society as Europe\u2019s future Eradicating domestic violence To mark the International Day of Peace, the EESC will be holding a conference on 21 September on domestic violence. Domestic violence, whether physical or psychological, is one of the gravest violations of human rights: the right to life and to physical and psy- chological integrity. Since the roots of such violence lie in the unequal balance of power between the sexes that still character- ises our society, it aff ects women at all levels of society. Th at is why one of the most important functions of a European policy based on respect for fundamental human rights is to prevent such acts and to establish eff ective educational, preventive, law enforcement and support procedures. Although the main responsibility for combating domestic violence lies with individual countries, there is need to intensify pressure at EU and international level to put an end to this scourge. \u25cf To fi nd out more, go to our website: www.eesc.europa.eu.

Yet the EU has become more than a market, expanding into new policy areas and increasing in size over the last 50 years. Despite these undeniable achieve- ments, the European Union remains far from complete. It has failed to take its people along with it and develop a common EU identity built around a project in which all citizens share, argue Henri Malosse, the EESC Employers\u2019 Group Presi- dent, and Laure Limousin, a graduate from the Paris-based Institute of Political Science, in their brand new book \u201cHistoires et avenir d\u2019une Europe des peuple\u201d (Histories and future of a Europe of peoples). Worse still is that we do not have a single European leader, either in the Member States or in Brussels, willing to dream up a new vision for Europe , they write. Mr Malosse and Ms Limousin call for European civil society to take up the torch of European integration. Since the 1948 Hague Congress, civil society has repeatedly proven its worth in pushing for greater and better integration. Recently though, civil society has increasingly been elbowed out of the European arena, supplanted by professional lobbyists, experts and technocrats. Th e resulting opaqueness has turned people off , further eroding the EU\u2019s legitimacy. It is high time that civil society be allowed to play its proper role in European integration, argue the book\u2019s authors. No sector is better placed than civil society to bring people closer together, the very objective which inspired European integration from the beginning. (mb) \u25cf Th e latest book by Mr Pavllikkas \u2013 Th e EESC: its role and action \u2013 fi lls a gap in Greek-language bibliography relat- ing to the EU institutions. As an EESC member for the past six years, Mr Pav- likkas draws on his experience to assess the impact of EESC opinions on a wide spectrum of topics with a social and economic dimension. As a trade unionist, Mr Pavllikkas naturally adopts a labour-related per- spective. The EESC is a consultative body and its opinions are adopted only aft er long debates amongst the EESC\u2019s three groups: the workers group, to which Mr Pavlikkas belongs, the employers group, and the various inter- ests group. What impact have the EESC\u2019s opinions had? How do they help enhance EU legislation by bringing in the voice of organised civil society and, in so doing, enriching representative democracy? And how does the EESC reach out to young people in Europe? By providing tangible examples, such as the \u201cYour Europe, Your Say\u201d youth plenary sessions for school pupils organised annually by the EESC, Mr Pavlikkas makes the point that the Com- mittee\u2019s contribution runs deeper than oft en thought. But his focus also includes Cyprus, his native island. Mr Pavlikkas draws on his experience at home aft er Cyprus\u2019s accession to the EU to showcase exam- ples of where the impact of the EESC on civil society and its organised insti- tutions has been benefi cial. Th e book is published at a time when Cyprus is holding the six-month rotating presidency. As such it will be an asset to Greek-speaking readers who wish to enlighten themselves on a variety of issues and get better acquainted with a little known but very active EU institution \u2013 the European Economic and Social Committee.
