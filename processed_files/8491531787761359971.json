        "Country of Origin Information Report | Iraq: The protest movement and treatment of protesters and activists 8 Introduction The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of political protests that have taken place in Iraq from 1 January 2019 until 31 July 2020, and the treatment by state agencies and other actors of those organising and/or taking part in such protests. The main focus of the report is on the protests that began in Baghdad and the southern provinces in October 2019, and which continued for several months, as these constitute the bulk of the protests that have taken place within the reference period. Protests taking place in other locations and/or concerning other issues will also be covered, although these were limited both in scope and frequency, as requested in the terms of reference. Methodology Research for the report was done in line with the EASO COI Report Methodology 2 , and the report was written in accordance with the EASO Writing and Referencing Guide for EASO Country of Origin Information (COI) Reports. 3 Research for the report was conducted in June and July 2020. Additional information was added following peer review feedback, before the report was finalised on 25 August 2020. Defining the terms of reference The terms of reference were defined in consulation with COI and policy experts from EU+ countries, along with the drafter of this report, within the framework of developing the update for the EASO Country Guidance on Iraq. The reference period was January 2019 to 31 July 2020. Terms of Reference for this report can be found in the Annex. Quality control In line with the EASO COI Report Methodology, peer review was performed by COI researchers from the departments listed as reviewers in the Acknowledgements section. Sources and information collection This report is based on a number of publicly available sources. These include but are not limited to reports and statements from United Nations agencies such as the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); Iraqi governmental and official sources such as the Prime Minister\u2019s office, committees of the Iraqi Parliament Council, and the semi-independent Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights (IHCHR); international rights groups such as Human Rights Watch (HRW), Amnesty International (AI), and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ); reports from governmental agencies of other countries, such as the US State Department; academic institutions and think tanks such as the Middle East Institute (MEI) and the Atlantic Council (AC); important sources of opinion and guidance such as the Friday sermons given on behalf of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani; and Iraqi and international media. With regard to Iraqi media, the US State Department points out that it \u2018was active and expressed a variety of views, largely reflecting owners\u2019 political viewpoints (\u2026) Political parties strongl y influenced, or controlled outright, most of the several hundred daily and weekly print publications, as well as 2 EASO, EASO Country of Origin Information (COI) Report Methodology, June 2019, url 3 EASO, Writing and Referencing Guide for EASO Country of Origin Information (COI) Reports, June 2019, url ",

In order to avoid bias and misinterpretations, and in line with EASO COI Report Methodology 6 , information has been compared, contrasted, and corroborated through different sources whenever possible and relevant, a process commonly referred to as cross-checking, or triangulation. 7 Information has been gathered from various online platforms, including both websites and social media such as Twitter, Facebook and Telegram. Only information from official accounts on social media, such as the Twitter account of the Iraqi Prime Minister\u2019s office, has been used. All the material referred to has been downloaded and stored by the author. All sources referred to are listed in the bibliography. This report has relied upon both English- and Arabic-language sources in order to provide a comprehensive picture of the protests and events covered. The expert from Landinfo who wrote this report in English frequently used Arabic sources. Most Arabic sources quoted, including all newspaper articles, social media posts and information from government websites, have been informally translated from Arabic into English by the expert. Due to the volume of Arabic sources used, for the citation of all these non-English sources, this report does not follow the EASO Writing and Referencing Guide signalling in the citation each time a source is translated. This is for maximal readability and efficiency. Structure and use of the report The report begins by briefly describing the background and the wider context of the protests that have taken place in Iraq over the past few years and the social and political grievances on which these were based, before it provides a short overview of protests prior to 1 October 2019. It then moves on to the protests from October and onwards, describing how they began, the demands raised, the extent and scope of the demonstrations, how they were organised, and the political response it drew from the authorities. The third chapter deals with the treatment of protesters by state agencies and other actors, including the use of violence against those taking part, the targeting of organisers and activists, arrests and detention of protesters, as well as attacks on the security services and public and private property. The final section deals with access to redress measures, as well as investigations into the use of violence and accountability on part of the actors involved. Throughout these sections, separate sub-chapters deal with protests in other parts of the country, and/or focusing on other issues. At the time of writing, it is unclear whether or not protests will resume on a large scale following the measures imposed in Iraq in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, as detailed below. 4 USDOS, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 Iraq, 11 March 2020, url, pp. 26-27 5 USDOS, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 Iraq, 11 March 2020, url, pp. 26-27 6 EASO, EASO Country of Origin Information (COI) Report Methodology, June 2019, url, pp. 14-15 7 Stake, R.E., Qualitative Case Studies, 2005.

        "Country of Origin Information Report | Iraq: The protest movement and treatment of protesters and activists 11 1. Background Political protests have taken place regularly in Iraq over the past few years but have varied in scope and focus between different regions. In late 2012 and 2013, protests took place in Sunni-majority areas, including the provinces of Ninewa, Anbar, Diyala, Salah al-Din and Kirkuk 9 , that led to frequent clashes with security forces 10 , some of which were infiltrated by extremist groups. 11 The protestors accused PM al-Maliki of discriminating against and marginalising the Sunni population. 12 In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) 13 , there have been recurring protests or attempted protests against austerity measures and unpaid wages following the cut in government funding transfers from Baghdad as well as the fall in oil prices in 2014. 14 In Baghdad and the southern Shia-majority provinces, protests have taken place since 2011, often focusing on similar grievances related to corruption and a lack of opportunities and services. 15 1.1 Socioeconomic and political grievances Iraq has a young population, with 60 % being under the age of 25. 16 Many young people, however, are excluded from the labour market, and as of 2016, youth unemployment stood at 36 %, compared to 16 % in the overall population. 17 According to the World Bank (WB), poverty has \u2018risen sharply\u2019 over the past few years, with the poverty rate reaching 30 % in the south of the country. 18 The state has proved unable to provide continuous electricity and sufficient amounts of safe drinking water, exacerbating the effects of high summer temperatures. 19 At the same time, Iraq is ranked as one of the world\u2019s most corrupt countries by Transparency International (TI). 20 The state is the largest employer in the country 21 , and the US State Department (USDOS) reported that nepotism and misappropriation of funds have been \u2018common at all levels and across all branches of government\u2019. 22 Protesters have seen these issues as connected, accusing the political elite of enriching themselves and their allies at the expense of opportunities and services for ordinary Iraqis, squandering the country\u2019s oil wealth. 23 In the summer of 2018, the lack of adequate services became acute in the city 9 New York Time (The), Dozens Killed in Battles Across Iraq as Sunnis Escalate Protests Against Government, 23 April 2013, url; BBC, Iraqi Sunni protest clashes in Hawija leave many dead, 23 April 2013, url; Guardian (The), Iraq protests signal growing tension between Sunni and Shia communities, 26 December 2012, url 10 See for instance: BBC, Iraqi Sunni protest clashes in Hawija leave many dead, 23 April 2013, url 11 Badawi, T., Why Arab Sunnis are disengaged from Iraq\u2019s protests, AC, 7 February 2020, url; BBC, Iraqi Sunni protest clashes in Hawija leave many dead, 23 April 2013, url 12 BBC, Iraqi Sunni protest clashes in Hawija leave many dead, 23 April 2013, url; Guardian (The), Iraq protests signal growing tension between Sunni and Shia communities, 26 December 2012, url 13 The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) is governed by the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) under the Iraqi Constitution, and responsible for the governorates of Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Dohuk. 14 Reuters, Protests intensify in Iraqi Kurdistan amid economic crisis, 9 February 2016, url; NRT, Protesters briefly block major road in Sulaimani to demand KRG pay salaries, create job opportunities, 21 June 2020, url 15 Hasan, H., Iraq Is Currently Being Shaken by Violent Protests, Carnegie, 4 October 2019, url; Bobseine, H., Iraqi youth protesters: Who they are, what they want, and what\u2019s next, MEI, 14 October 2019, url 16 WB, Iraq Economic Monitor : Toward Reconstruction, Economic Recovery and Fostering Social Cohesion, 2018, url, p. 14 17 WB, Jobs in Iraq : A Primer on Job Creation in the Short-Term, 2018, url, p. 6 18 WB, Iraq Economic Monitor : Toward Reconstruction, Economic Recovery and Fostering Social Cohesion, 2018, url, p. 9 19 BBC, Iraq sweats in near-record heatwave, 22.

In the KRI, however, protests against austerity measures and unpaid wages have taken place regularly. For instance, in February 2016 29 , and again in March and April 2018 30 , public employees held protest and/or engaged in strikes in several cities. In the latter case, Human Rights Watch reports that both journalists and protesters were detained and subjected to beatings as the authorities sought to quell demonstrations. 31 1.2 Protests in 2019 prior to October On 22 March 2019, anti-government protests erupted in Mosul following a ferry accident the day before in which almost 100 people lost their lives. 32 The protesters blamed corruption and negligence by the local government for the accident. The Iraqi parliament swiftly voted to investigate the accident as well as to fire the Governor of the Ninewa province 33 , and a warrant was issued for his arrest. 34 On 15 May, four people were reportedly killed and 17 injured in Najaf in protests initiated by Muqtada al-Sadr. 35 A few days later, \u2018thousands of supporters\u2019 of al -Sadr took part in demonstrations demanding Iraq stay out of any conflict between the US and Iran. 36 In early August, protesters reportedly blocked the Mosul- Erbil road in response to the Prime Minister\u2019s decision to withdraw PMF-forces from the area. 37 url; Hasan, H., Iraq Is Currently Being Shaken by Violent Protests, Carnegie, 4 October 2019, url; Bobseine, H., Iraqi youth protesters: Who they are, what they want, and what\u2019s next, MEI, 1 4 October 2019, url; 24 Human Rights Watch stated that 118 000 people were hospitalized with symptoms related to water quality, whereas NPR a nd Vox refer to \u2018thousands\u2019 of hospitalisations HRW, World Report 2020 \u2013 Iraq, 2020, url; NPR, Months Of Protests Roil Iraq's Oil Capital Basra, 27 September 2018, url; Vox, The violent protests in Iraq, explained, 8 September 2018, url 25 HRW, World Report 2019 \u2013 Iraq, 2019, url 26 Reuters, Unrest intensifies in Iraq as Iranian consulate and oil facility stormed, 7 September 2018, url; HRW, World Report 2019 \u2013 Iraq, 2019, url; BBC, Basra protests: Rioters attack Iran consulate, 7 September 2018, url; HRW, Iraq: Security Forces Fire on Protesters, 24 July 2018, url; AI, Iraq: Effective investigations needed into death of protesters in Basra, 7 September 2018, url 27 Guardian (The), Protesters set fire to Iranian consulate in Basra, 7 September 2018, url 28 DW, Protests spread from oil-rich Basra across southern Iraq, 15 July 2018, url 29 Reuters, Protests intensify in Iraqi Kurdistan amid economic crisis, 9 February 2016, url 30 HRW, Kurdistan Region of Iraq: Protesters Beaten, Journalists Detained, 15 April 2018, url; Denmark, The Danish Immigration Service and Norway, Landinfo, Northern Iraq - Security situation and the situation for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the disputed areas, incl. possibility to enter and access the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), November 2018, url, p. 25 31 HRW, Kurdistan Region of Iraq: Protesters Beaten, Journalists Detained, 15 April 2018, url 32 Reuters, Grief turns to anti-government anger after boat capsize in Iraq's Mosul, 22 March 2019, url; EPIC, ISHM: MARCH 15-21, 2019, 21 March 2019, url 33 Iraqi Parliament Council, 2019 / \u0631\u0627\u0630\u0622 24 / \u062f\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0627 )5( \u0629\u0633\u0644\u062c\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0627\u064a\u0635\u0648\u062a\u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0642 [Decisions and recommendations from session 5, Sunday 24 March 2019], 24 March 2019, url 34 Al-Mada Paper, \u0647\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0625 \u0646\u0645 \u0645\u0627\u064a\u0623 3 \u062f\u0639\u0628 \u0649\u0648\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0638\u0641\u0627\u062d\u0645 \u0642\u062d\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0621\u0627\u0636\u0642\u0644\u0627 [The Judiciary is pursuing the Governor of Nineweh three days after his dismissal], 27 March 2019, url 35 Kurdistan24, Deadly anti- corruption protests restart in Iraq\u2019s Najaf, 16 May 2019, url 36 Middle East Eye, Thousands of Iraqis protest against potential war between US and Iran, 24 May 2019, url 37 Rudaw, Iraqi PM assures eventual Hashd al-Shaabi withdrawal from Nineveh Plains, 10 August 2019, url.

The protests can be divided into three stages. First, protests took place from 1 until 9 October 2019, when they were paused due to the Shia holiday of Arbaeen and the violence experienced. 49 Calls quickly went out for new protests to begin on 25 October 2019 50 , and these lasted until March/April 2020, when they largely ended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 51 It should be noted that a brief pause in the protests occurred following the killing of the commander of the Quds force of the IRGC, Qassim Sulaimani, and the deputy leader of the PMF, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a US drone strike on 3 January 2020. 52 Finally, new protests began in May and June 2020, albeit with markedly fewer participants. 53 The demonstrations have been seen as part of the same protest movement, albeit a loosely defined one without an organised leadership, but unified by similar demands, tactics, and in terms of the demographics of the participants. 54 2.1.1 The protesters\u2019 de mands The protests did not have a leadership that could present demands on behalf of those taking part 55 , but according to available sources, key demands uniting the movement can be identified. From the outset, the demands raised were recognisable from previous protests. 56 Protesters called for economic reforms, jobs and opportunities for young people, social justice, better services, better and impartial governance, increased accountability, and an end to corruption. 57 In addition, protesters 48 UNAMI, For Iraq \u2013 The United Nations in Iraq 2019, 31 March 2020, url, p. 5 49 New York Times ( The), \u2018All of Them Are Thieves\u2019: Iraqis Defy Security Forces to Protest Corruption, 25 October 2019, url; Al-Amal, and Al-Namaa, Preliminary Report on the Violation Against the Iraq Protest of October 2019, 10 November 2019, url , p. 1; Alhassani, M., ECFR The Evolution of Iraq\u2019s Protests: Excessive Force Pushes Protesters to Adapt, WINEP, 4 February 2020, url 50 Al-Mada Paper, 50 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0627\u0638\u062a\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0645\u0642 \u0628\u0628\u0633\u0628 \u062f\u0634\u062d\u0644\u0627 \u0644\u0626\u0627\u0635\u0641\u0648 \u0634\u064a\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0648 \u0629\u0645\u0648\u0643\u062d\u0644\u0627 \u0633\u064a\u0626\u0631 \u0642\u062d\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0629\u064a\u0626\u0627\u0636\u0642 \u0649\u0648\u0639\u062f [50 Lawsuits against the PM, the army, and the PMF for suppressing the demonstrations], 14 October 2019, url; VOA, Firebrand Cleric Green-Lights Fresh Protests in Iraq, 20 October 2019, url 51 UN Security Council, Implementation of resolution 2470 (2019) - Report of the Secretary-General, 6 May 2020, url, para. 15; Asharq al-Awsat, Coronavirus Brings Abrupt End to Iraq Protest Movement, 22 March 2020, url 52 Gulf News, After brief pause, Iraq anti-government protests resume, 20 January 2020, url; Al-Jazeera, Hashd deputy Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis: Iran's man in Baghdad, 3 January 2020, url; New York Times (The), U.S. Strike in Iraq Kills Qassim Suleimani, Commander of Iranian Forces, 2 January 2020, url.

        "Country of Origin Information Report | Iraq: The protest movement and treatment of protesters and activists 15 expressed support for the decommissioned lieutenant general al-Saadi and anger at Iranian and other foreign interference in Iraq. 58 Some protesters also decried the government\u2019s recent removal of informal housing settlements. 59 As the protests developed, the demands raised developed with them. The initial demands for better and more accountable governance soon developed into demands for systemic change. 60 These demands entailed the resignation of the government and new elections based on a revised electoral law 61 , but also \u2018complete reform\u2019 62 including constitutional changes and an end to Iraq\u2019s post -2003 ethno-sectarian political system known as muhasasa . 63 Critics argued that the system, within which positions and resources are divided based on an ethno-sectarian quota system, enables the political elite to enrich themselves and their allies at the expense of the population. 64 Sources note that the protests were explicitly anti- sectarian, and that a popular slogan was \u2018we want a homeland.\u2019 65 The protesters also responded to events as they progressed, adjusting or raising new demands. Following Prime Minister Abdel Mahdi\u2019s resignation, protesters in Baghdad issued a statement on 11 December with demands for a new prime minister, including, among other things, a commitment to \u2018substantial reforms\u2019. 66 On 13 January, protesters in Nasiriyya, and according to Human Rights Watch also other provinces, responded to what they perceived as inaction and demanded the government enact reforms within seven days. 67 When Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi was named Prime Minister on 1 February, protesters immediately rejected the move. 68 Similarly, when Adnan al-Zurfi was named Prime Minister on 17 March following Allawi\u2019s inability to form a cabinet, protesters in several cities rejected the appointment. 69 In June, protesters in several provinces focused their What's behind the protests in Iraq?, 5 October 2019, url; Al-Jazeera, Several killed as Iraq protests escalate, spread nationwide, 2 October 2019, url 58 Byman, D.l., Is change likely in Iraq?, Brookings, url; Czulda, R., Protests challenge Iran\u2019s future position in Iraq, AC, 2 December 2019, url; DW, What's behind the protests in Iraq?, 5 October 2019, url; Washington Post (The), Hundreds wounded in Iraq as police fire tear gas, bullets at protesters, 2 October 2019, url 59 Bobseine, H., Iraqi youth protesters: Who they are, what they want, and what\u2019s next, MEI, 14 October 2019, url; Al-Amal, and Al-Namaa, Preliminary Report on the Violation Against the Iraq Protest of October 2019, 10 November 2019, url, p. 1 60 Washington Post (The), Iraqi protests broaden; violent crackdown spirals, 6 October 2019, url; Alaaldin, R., The irresistible resiliency of Iraq\u2019s protesters, Brookings, 31 Ja nuary 2020, url 61 Time, Over 300 Killed as Hundreds of Thousands Take Part in Iraqi Protests.

Sources show that the demonstrations that were part of the protest movement described so far most of all took place in Baghdad and the Shia-majority provinces of the south. 95 While Sunni inhabitants in Baghdad and other areas that saw protests took part, and while some reportedly travelled from other parts of the country to join in 96 , this meant that the protesters predominantly belonged to the Shia part of the population. 97 Sources note, however, that the protesters\u2019 demands were \u2018not religiously - specific\u2019 98 , and that the protests were \u2018not a Shia revolt\u2019. 99 During the first period of protests from 1 \u2013 9 October, most sources identify the protesters as \u2018young men\u2019, often marginalised and un - or underemployed, as well as civil society activists. 100 There are, however, also reports of women taking part during this first phase. 101 95 Sweden, Lifos, L\u00e4gesanalys: Demonstrationarna i Irak \u2013 evolution eller revolution?

        "Country of Origin Information Report | Iraq: The protest movement and treatment of protesters and activists 20 Many sources report that the composition of the protesters changed when the second round of demonstrations began on 25 October. From that point, \u2018demonstrators from demographically diverse groups\u2019 102 took part, as more women, older people, school children, students, and professionals joined in. 103 In several places, teachers, students and other professional groups declared open-ended strikes in support of the protests. 104 The UN stated that women played an unprecedented part within the protest movement. 105 Former members of the PMF reportedly also took part in demonstrations. 106 Sources report that most of the protesters did not belong to any particular political party or group, that they were not led by any religious or political leader, that they did not subscribe to any particular view or ideology, and that they did not have any unified or formal leadership. 107 At the same time, however, sources report that supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr took part in the protests from 25 October until late January, following al- Sadr\u2019s call for them to do so. 108 Thus, it appears that some newspapers and other sources make a distinction between \u2018protesters\u2019, with no given political affiliation, and supporters of al-Sadr, all taking part in the same protests. Information on the relative sizes of the two groups could not be found. 2.1.4 How are the protests organised? Sources are somewhat conflicted as to how the protests began. Whereas some refer to the initial demonstrations as \u2018spontaneous\u2019 109 , other sources note that calls for protests on 1 October began circulating in September 2019. 110 Still, numerous sources report that no particular party or organisation initiated the demonstrations, and that they were spontaneous in the sense that people took part due to anger over particular issues as well as at the violent response with which the initial protests were met. 111 102 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq: update, 5 November 2019, url, p. 2 103 UNOCHA, Iraq: Humanitarian Bulletin, October 2019, url, p. 3 ; New York Times (The), \u2018All of Them Are Thieves\u2019: Iraqis Defy Security Forces to Protest Corruption, 25 October 2019, url; UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq: update, 5 November 2019, url, p. 2 104 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq \u2013 2 nd update, 11 December 2019, url, p. 2; Wing, J., Iraq Protests Get Huge Boost As Students And Professional Groups Join In, Musings on Iraq [Blog], 29 October 2019, url; Reuters, Iraqi protesters pack Baghdad square, anti-government movement gains momentum, 29 October 2019, url 105 UNAMI, For Iraq \u2013 The United Nations in Iraq 2019, 31 March 2020, url, p. 8; UNAMI, Briefing to the Security Council by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert 3 March 2020 (as delivered), 3 March 2020, url 106 New York Times (The), \u2018All of Them Are Thieves\u2019: Iraqis Defy Security Forces to Protest Corruption, 25 October 2019, url 107 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq 1- 9 October 2019, 22 October 2019, url, p. 3; UNOCHA, Iraq: Humanitarian Bulletin, October 2019, url, p. 3; Iraq, Standing Committee on Human Rights \u2013 Iraqi Parliamentary Council, \u0646\u0639 \u0646\u0627\u0633\u0646\u0644\u0627\u0627 \u0642\u0648\u0642\u062d \u0629\u0646\u062c\u0644 \u0631\u064a\u0631\u0642\u062a \u0642\u0627\u0631\u0639\u0644\u0627 \u064a \u0641 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0627\u0638\u062a\u0644\u0627 [The Report of the Standing Committee on Human Rights on the Demonstrations in Iraq], 17 November 2019, url; p. 4; Abdulhadi, R., Iraqi protestors unite behind demands, not sectarian identities, 31 October 2019, url; Salam, D., Will protests herald a new era in Iraqi politics?, AC, 31 October 2019, url; Al-Jazeera, \u0644\u064a\u0628\u0633\u0648 \u062f\u064a\u0639\u0635\u062a\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0633\u0623 ..\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0639\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0627\u0638\u0645 \u0644\u062d\u0644\u0627 [The protests in Iraq..

        "Country of Origin Information Report | Iraq: The protest movement and treatment of protesters and activists 21 Mobilisation for the protests, both earlier calls for demonstrations as well as mobilisation in response to particular issues, reportedly took place online 112 , with one source pointing to Facebook as a particularly important platform. 113 Iraqi authorities, however, blocked internet access on 2 October for more than 24 hours, and again for varying periods of time as the protests progressed. 114 In addition, the authorities blocked access to social media from 2 October until 21 November. 115 While social media could be accessed using VPNs when internet was available, this could suggest that other channels of communication were important as well. For instance, the Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights reportedly resorted to using SMS when internet was unavailable. 116 Few details are available concerning those calling for and mobilising for protests online (and possibly elsewhere), but they are described as civil society activists 117 , citizens 118 , or social media influencers. 119 Some services were organised and provided for those taking part in protests. For instance, tents were set up at the sit-in in Tahrir Square in Baghdad providing food, legal advice, and other services. 120 Sources refer to this being done by \u2018volunteers\u2019 or simply \u2018protesters\u2019 121 , and it is unclear how these efforts were funded. Similarly, health care volunteers reportedly provided medical aid for protesters at the square 122 , while Tuk-Tuk vehicles functioned as make-shift ambulances. 123 Supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr, however, seem to have been organised through his movement. While some reportedly initially joined the protests spontaneously 124 , they followed his orders when such were given. 125 For instance, when al-Sadr gave the order to end roadblocks 126 , his followers attacked their former co-protesters. 127 While taking part in demonstrations, his movement reportedly provided logistical support for the protests. 128 2.1.5 Political initiatives in response to the protests Several sources report that the demonstrations on 1 October took the government by surprise 129 , although UNAMI notes that the government was aware of the protests in advance and deployed large 112 UNOCHA, Iraq: Humanitarian Bulletin, October 2019, url, p. 3; UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq 1- 9 October 2019, 22 October 2019, url ; Bobseine, H., Iraqi youth protesters: Who they are, what they want, and what\u2019s next, MEI, 14 October 2019, url 113 International Crisis Group, Widespread Protests Point to Iraq\u2019s Cycle of Social Crisis, 10 October 2019, url 114 Netblocks, Iraq blocks Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram, then shuts down internet amid civil unrest, 2 October 2019, url; Netblocks, Iraq shuts down internet again as protests intensify, 4 November 2019, url; Knights, M., Exposing and Sanctioning Human Rights Violations by Iraqi Militias, WINEP, 22 October 2019, url 115 Netblocks, Social media partially unblocked in Iraq after 50 days, 21 November 2019, url 116 Yahoo News, In Iraq protests, counting the dead is a dangerous job, 31 October 2019, url 117 Bobseine, H., Iraqi youth protesters: Who they are, what t hey want, and what\u2019s next, MEI, 14 October 2019, url; UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq 1- 9 October 2019, 22 October 2019, url, p. 2; 118 Al-Amal, and Al-Namaa, Preliminary Report on the Violation Against the Iraq Protest of October 2019, 10 November 2019, url, p. 1 119 International Crisis Group, Widespread Protests Point to Iraq\u2019s Cycle of Social Crisis, 10 October 2019, url 120 France24, Iraq protesters set up free public services in Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square, 3 November 2019, url 121 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq \u2013 2 nd update, 11 December 2019, url, p. 2; France24, Iraq protesters set up free public serv ices in Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square, 3 November 2019, url 122 Al-Jazeera, Despite threats, Iraq's medical volunteers keep protests alive, 23 November 2019, url 123 MSF, Tuk-tuks, the ambulances of the nation, 14 January 2020, url 124 Washington Post (The), How powerful cleric Moqtada al- Sadr could snuff out Iraq\u2019s mass street protests, 4 March 2020, url 125 Reuters, Iraqi security forces raid protest camps after Sadr supporters withdraw, 25 January, url; Washington Post (The), How powerful cleric Moqtada al- Sadr could snuff out Iraq\u2019s mass street protests, 4 March 2020, url 126 Mu_AlSadr, [Twitter], posted on: 2 February 2020, url 127 Reuters, Iraqi cleric Sadr tells followers to clear sit-ins after PM appointed, 2 February 2020, url 128 Jiyad, S., Iraq's unsustainable status quo, ECFR, 27 February 2020, url 129 Abdulhadi, R., Iraqi protestors unite behind demands, not sectarian identities, 31 October 2019, url; Reuters, Iraqi police fire on protesters in new unrest, death toll passes 100, 6 October 2019, url; CNN, Iraqi protesters say they have videos of government atrocities.

Treatment of protesters 3.1 Responses to the protest movement in Baghdad and the southern provinces 3.1.1 Freedom of assembly and the right to protest Freedom of expression as well as of assembly and peaceful protest is enshrined in Article 38 of the Iraqi constitution. 172 UNAMI f urther states that the \u2018international and domestic legal framework applicable in Iraq guarantees\u2019 the right to peaceful assembly and expression, as well as the right to life, liberty, and security. 173 A draft law on freedom of expression, assembly and peaceful protest that had been criticised by rights groups was reintroduced in parliament in 2019 174 , but no reference is made to it in the sources covering the protests surveyed. Sources report that in most of the cases where arrested protesters were charged, this was done with reference to Article 355 of the Iraqi Penal code, as well as Articles 222, 226, 230, 240, 342 and 345. 175 Among other things, these concern insulting public authorities, endangering public security, contravening an order given by a public official, and causing damage to public and private property. 176 While the High Judicial Council on 25 October 2019 stated that acts of violence and damage to public property could be prosecuted under anti-terrorism laws, UNAMI reported in December 2019 that this had not been done and that the statement was overturned. 177 Numerous sources stated that Iraqi authorities are obligated to respect the right to life, and that security forces can only use force proportionally as required by a given situation. 178 3.1.2 Responses during protests The protests were met with violence on the part of both security forces and other forces more difficult to identify, causing a high number of casualties. Sources refer to quite similar figures concerning the number of people killed: approximately 150 killed between 1 and 9 October 2019 179 ; approximately 100 killed between 25 October and 4 November 180 , and approximately 170 killed between 5 November and 8 December. 181 Some sources refer to further approximately 175 killed after 172 Iraq, Iraq\u2019s Constitution of 2005, undated, url, p. 15 173 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq 1- 9 October 2019, 22 October 2019, url, p. 2 174 MENA Rights Group, Iraq must halt reintroduction of controversial draft laws harmful to fundamental freedoms, 15 July 2019, url 175 HRW (Human Rights Watch), Iraq: Lethal Force Used Against Protesters, 10 October 2019, url; UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq \u2013 2 nd update, 11 December 2019, url, pp. 5-6 176 Iraq, Penal Code Law No (111) of 1969, July 1969 (Amended 14 March 2010), url 177 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq: update, 5 November 2019, url, p. 6; UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq \u2013 2 nd update, 11 December 2019, url, p. 5 178 AI, Iraq: Rein in security forces to prevent a bloodbath, 9.

Some sources refer to reports that people believed to be intelligence officers as well as unknown men showed up at protests and took photographs of people taking part. 244 Sources further refer to rumours of a government- compiled \u2018blacklist\u2019 of wanted protesters. 245 UNAMI reports \u2018most abductees described those questioning them as knowing significant amounts of information about their identities and demonstration- linked activities.\u2019 246 Sources indicate that kidnappings happened in a similar manner, with people being abducted near or on their way to protest sites, close to their homes, or during regular and fixed commutes, often by masked and/or armed men forcing them into vehicles. 247 While sources stated that it often is unclear who the perpetrators are, they point to both Iraqi security forces and armed groups including forces that are part of the PMF as responsible for targeting individuals. 248 3.1.6 Media and access to information Sources report of at least five journalists having been killed in connection to protests, and that several have been wounded, arrested, threatened, harassed, kidnapped and in other ways prevented from doing their work. 249 Both governmental agencies and security forces as well as forces that are part of the PMF were responsible. 250 On 5 October 2019, armed forces raided several television stations, stole equipment and mistreated employees. 251 The US State Department identify the forces involved as 239 Al-Jazeera, Despite threats, Iraq's medical volunteers keep protests alive, 23 November 2019, url 240 CPJ, Al-Rasheed TV CEO Nizar Thanoun shot and killed in Baghdad, 12 February 2020, url 241 NINA, \u0629\u0636\u0628\u0644\u0627 \u0637\u0633\u0648 \u064a\u062d\u0644\u0633\u0645 \u0646\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u0628 \u064a \u0626\u062f\u0645 \u0637\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0629\u0628\u0627\u0635\u0627 [Civil society activist shot and injured by gunmen in central Basra], 17 July 2020, url 242 Reuters, Threats, arrests, targeted killings silence Iraqi dissidents, 29 November 2019, url 243 UN OHCHR, Press briefing on Iraq, 20 December 2019, url 244 Washington Post (The), Fear spreads among Iraqi protesters as government cracks down, keeps death toll secret, 11 November 2019, url; Al-Jazeera, Despite threats, Iraq's medical volunteers keep protests alive, 23 November 2019, url 245 AI, Iraq: Stop security forces from threatening, forcibly disappearing and abusing activists, 18 October 2019, url; HRW, Iraq: Government Promises Action On Security Force Abuse, 24 October 2019, url 246 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq: 3 rd update, 23 May 2020, url, p. 4 247 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq: 3 rd update, 23 May 2020, url, p. 4; Euro-Med, Iraqi Protests: An Audacity to Kill and Absent Justice - A report documenting violations against peaceful protesters in Iraq, 22 December 2019, url, pp. 8-9; AI, Iraq: Stop security forces from threatening, forcibly disappearing and abusing activists, 18 October 2019, url 248 HRW, Iraq: Abductions Linked to Baghdad Protests, 2 December 2019, url; AI, Iraq: Stop security forces from threatening, forcibly disappearing and abusing activists, 18 October 2019, url ; AI, Iraq: End \u2018campaign of terror\u2019 targeting protesters, 13 December 2019, url; USDOS, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 Iraq, 11 March 2020, url, p. 6; UN OHCHR, Press briefing on Iraq, 20 December 2019, url 249 CPJ, Hisham Fares al-Adhami killed, 4 October 2019, url; UNAMI, Amid ongoing protests and violence, UN urges stepped up efforts to break political deadlock, 30 January 2020, url; CPJ, One journalist killed, another missing amid protests in Iraq, 9 December 2019, url; CPJ, Al-Rasheed TV CEO Nizar Thanoun shot and killed in Baghdad, 12 February 2020, url; UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq 1- 9 October 2019, 22 October 2019, url, p. 7 250 UNAMI, Amid ongoing protests and violence, UN urges stepped up efforts to break political deadlock, 30 January 2020, url; CPJ, One journalist killed, another missing amid protests in Iraq, 9 December 2019, url; UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq 1- 9 October 2019, 22 October 2019, url, p. 7 251 CPJ, Unidentified assailants raid 4 broadcasters in Baghdad, assault staffers, 7 October 2019, url; UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq 1- 9 October 2019, 22 October 2019, url, p. 7; USDOS, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 Iraq, 11 March 2020, url, p. 27 ",

Accountability and access to redress measures 4.1 Investigations into the excessive use of force UNAMI stated that the Iraqi government has a responsibility to not only allow peaceful protest, but to take \u2018adequate preventive measures\u2019 to protect demonstrators from attacks perpetrated by, for instance, armed groups. 265 The state is further required to investigate and prosecute unlawful actions. 266 On 12 October 2019, the government announced the formation of an investigative committee tasked with identifying perpetrators of violence and bring them to justice 267 , and the report of the committee was made public on 22 October 2019. 268 The report acknowledged excessive use of force on part of security forces 269 , and identified \u2018a dozen\u2019 senior military and police commanders to face prosecution. 270 Human Rights Watch criticised the report, however, for not addressing serious abuses and the role of the PMF. 271 Similarly, Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani criticised the report and demanded an independent investigation. 272 Sources also state that many protesters viewed the report as inadequate, or were frustrated with the impunity for the deaths and injuries caused by the excessive use of force, which in turn contributed to the new protests of 25 October. 273 Moreover, sources report that Iraqi authorities at times were unwilling to admit responsibility or share information: On 16 November, the defence minister stated that \u2018third parties\u2019 rather than security forces were responsible for killing protesters. 274 In its report on the protests, the standing committee on human rights in the Iraqi parliament noted that relevant ministries and security agencies did not cooperate fully with the committee. 275 Sources also report that Iraqi authorities forced hospitals and morgues to withhold figures concerning the number of killed and injured during protests. 276 Similarly, USDOS repor ted that the IHCHR at one point \u2018briefly discontinued publishing the number of protest - related deaths\u2019 due to pressure from the PM\u2019s office. 277 USDOS further noted that \u2018efforts to achieve 265 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq 1- 9 October 2019, 22 October 2019, url, pp. 2, 14 266 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq 1- 9 October 2019, 22 October 2019, url, p. 14 267 UNAMI, Demonstrations in Iraq 1- 9 October 2019, 22 October 2019, url, p. 9;
