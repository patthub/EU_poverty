        "EN 4 EN G ENERAL INFORMATION Lead DG: Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities (DG EMPL) WP Reference: 2008/EMPL/021 E XECUTIVE SUMMARY The Union has set itself the strategic goal of promoting more and better jobs and so offering equal opportunities for all. In order to reach this goal, the attractiveness of entrepreneurship needs to be increased. This is true for entrepreneurship in general, but even more so for women\u2019s entrepreneurship. In Europe, there is a considerable gender gap in terms of women participating in self- employed activities: according to the most recent Eurostat figures, there are almost three times as many men as women self-employed with employees 1 . On the other hand, a significant number of women play an active part in the activities of family businesses without appearing in statistics and without any legal status. These are the so-called \u2018assisting spouses\u2019. They participate actively in around 11% of businesses, one third of them working more than 30 hours per week. Nevertheless, they have no recognition in the social security systems in 19 Member States and are at a high risk of poverty in the event of divorce, death of the self-employed partner, or bankruptcy. With Directive 86/613/EEC 2 , the EU extended the principle of equal treatment between women and men to the self-employed and assisting spouses. Nevertheless, the implementation of the Directive in the Member States has had no significant impact, notably because of its imprecise formulation 3 . The present report looks at whether a review of Directive 86/613/EEC would improve the application of the principle of equal treatment between women and men and increase the participation of women in self-employed activities. Three main policy options have been identified: no action at EU level, non-binding measures, and an amendment to Directive 86/613/EEC to make it a more effective instrument in meeting its aims. 1 Eurostat, The entrepreneurial gap between men and women, Statistics in focus 30/2007, available at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-07-030/EN/KS-SF-07-030-EN.PDF. 2 Directive Council Directive 86/613/EEC of 11 December 1986 on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture, in a self- employed capacity, and on the protection of self-employed women during pregnancy and motherhood, OJ L 359, 19.12.1986, p. 56. 3 See the report from the Commission on the implementation of Council Directive of 11 December 1986 on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture, in a self-employed capacity, and on the protection of self-employed women during pregnancy and motherhood, Document COM(94) 163 final. ",
        "EN 5 EN The report looks at the impacts of each option. For this purpose, the option to amend the Directive is divided into a further four policy options: \u2013 improving protection in the event of maternity \u2013 providing leave to care for family members \u2013 recognising the contribution of assisting spouses \u2013 giving National Equality Bodies competence in the field. After analysing the impact of each option, the report concludes that not taking any new action at EU level will not achieve any of the objectives. As far as non-binding measures are concerned, the report concludes that those already in place seem adequate to deal with certain obstacles to women\u2019s entrepreneurship, and will continue and be extended independently of the current exercise. Nevertheless, such measures can only complement, but not replace, an amendment to Directive 86/613/EEC. The report comes to the conclusion that the option that best meets the objectives is a proposal for a Directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC to \u2022 include a period of maternity leave for self-employed women, \u2022 recognise the contribution of assisting spouses to the family business by providing them with social protection equivalent to that of their self-employed partners, \u2022 give national equality bodies competence in cases of discrimination. In order to take into account the specificities of self-employment and to avoid imposing additional costs to family businesses, the envisaged proposal could provide that self-employed women and assisting spouses are given the possibility to join the social protection system at their own request. In that case, any additional cost to family businesses would be a consequence of the choice made by the self-employed woman or the assisting spouse. ",
        "EN 6 EN 1. B ACKGROUND AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT In its report 4 on the implementation of Directive 86/613/EEC, the Commission concluded that the practical result of the implementation of the Directive was \u2018not entirely satisfactory when measured against the prime objectives of the Directive, which was a general improvement in the status of assisting spouses\u2019. The report also stressed the lack of an overall policy for dealing with the situation of assisting spouses and pointed out that \u2018with a view to the recognition of the work of the spouse (...), the only way in which this objective is likely to be achieved is for spouses to be granted social security entitlements in their own right\u2019. In its Roadmap 5 for equality between women and men, the Commission announced that in order to improve governance of gender equality, it would \u2018review the existing EU gender equality legislation not included in the 2005 recast exercise (...) with a view to updating, modernising and recasting where necessary\u2019. Directive 86/613/EEC was not included in the recasting exercise. In the Council conclusions \u2018Balanced roles of women and men for jobs, growth and social cohesion\u2019 6 , the Council called on the Commission to \u2018consider the need to revise, if necessary, Council Directive 86/613/EEC in order to ensure the rights related to motherhood and fatherhood of self-employed workers and their helping spouses\u2019. The European Parliament has consistently called on the Commission to review the Directive 7 , in particular to improve the situation of assisting spouses in agriculture. The 2000 Lisbon European Council set a strategic goal for the EU to transform itself into \u2018the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\u2019. Following initially modest results, the Lisbon Strategy was simplified and re-launched in 2005. To achieve this goal, the Union needs to increase entrepreneurship in general and women\u2019s entrepreneurship in particular. 2. P ROCEDURAL ISSUES AND CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES The review of Directive 86/613/EEC was announced in the Commission\u2019s legislative work programme 2008 (forward programming 2008, item 2008/EMPL/021). 4 Report from the Commission on the implementation of Council Directive of 11 December 1986 on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture, in a self-employed capacity, and on the protection of self-employed women during pregnancy and motherhood (COM(94) 163 final). 5 Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions A Roadmap for equality between women and men (COM(2006) 92 final). 6 4 December 2007 (Document SOC 385). 7 See the report adopted by the European Parliament on 12 March 2008 on the situation of women in rural areas of the EU (2007/2117(INI), Rapporteur Christa Klass, A6-0031/2008. ",
        "EN 7 EN An Inter-Service Group was set up to prepare the impact assessment and the following DGs and services were invited: SG, SJ, ENTR, MARKT, ECFIN, COMP, AGRI and MARE. SG, AGRI, ENTR and ECFIN designated representatives to participate. One meeting was held and bilateral meetings were organised with these and other DGs. 2.1. Consultation of the stakeholders In preparing this initiative, EMPL sought the views of stakeholders with a potential interest in this matter, i.e. those potentially affected by the initiative (representatives of the self- employed and SMEs) and those who would be involved in implementing the policy. The European social partners were consulted even though there was no obligation to do so (Article 138 EC is not applicable) and this initiative does not fall within the competence of the social partners at national level. The documents for the consultation of the social partners have been published 8 . European social partners have divergent views on the review of this Directive. Basically, trade unions and agriculture organisations are in favour of amending the Directive and improving gender equality for self-employed workers and assisting spouses. The organisation representing agricultural organisations supports equal rights for equal commitment for all partners in farm businesses. On the other hand, organisations representing SMEs and sectoral employers are mostly concerned about the potential costs of any changes and opposed to any changes that would increase social security contributions. The Commission also consulted the Member States, since Directive 86/613/EEC raises issues concerning the social protection of assisting spouses and the self-employed, which essentially fall within the competence of Member States. As expected, the position of the Member States is far from unanimous, some asking for improvement of the EU legal framework, but the majority stating that they do not see any need to review national legislation on the issues covered by the Directive. However, the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men (composed of representatives of Member States, European social partners and NGOs) is of the opinion that the Directive should be amended in order to give assisting spouses a clear professional status, with coverage by social protection schemes, and to provide for paid maternity/paternity leave for self-employed workers and assisting spouses. A list of civil society organisations to be consulted was drawn up with the assistance of the members of the Inter-Service Group. These organisations have been consulted in writing. The European Women\u2019s Lobby supports the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities. The Confederation of Family Organisations in the European Union (COFACE) strongly advocates revision of Directive 86/613/EEC to give self-employed women maternity leave of a long enough duration to ensure the proper course of a normal pregnancy and physical recovery of the mother after a normal childbirth and to oblige Member States to recognise the contribution of assisting spouses in family businesses and ensure that they benefit from the same level of social protection as self-employed workers. 8 See http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/social_dialogue/consultations_en.htm. ",
        "EN 8 EN In view of the very specific nature of this initiative, a public consultation was not considered necessary. The minimum standards set out in the Commission\u2019s 2002 Communication on consultation and dialogue 9 have been met. Annexes I to IV give detailed information on the consultations and contributions received. 2.2. External expertise and information gathering Women\u2019s entrepreneurship has been the subject of much analysis and many studies, to which this report refers as and when relevant. For an analysis of the need to review Directive 86/613/EEC, the Commission asked the Network of Independent Legal Experts on the application of Community law on equal treatment between men and women to produce a report on the implementation of the Directive and on loopholes, weaknesses and ways to improve the Directive 10 . This study is cited in this report as the \u2018Legal Network study\u2019. DG EMPL also commissioned a study to provide an overview of the situation in Member States and assess the costs and benefits of different policy options. This study was carried out by the European Policy Evaluation Consortium (EPEC) and is cited in this report as the \u2018EPEC study\u2019. In addition, a study commissioned by DG ENTR was extensively used in the preparation of this report. This study, entitled \u2018Good practices on social protection of new entrepreneurs and assisting partners and the impact on business creation\u2019 was conducted by EIM 11 . It is cited in this report as the \u2018EIM study\u2019. 2.3. Consultation of the Impact Assessment Board A first draft of the impact assessment report was submitted to the Impact Assessment Board (IAB) and was analysed at the Board meeting of 9 July 2008. The IAB produced an opinion on 18 July 2008. Given the nature of its recommendations, the IAB asked to examine and issue an opinion on a revised impact assessment report. A second draft of the impact assessment report was resubmitted to the Board on 30 July 2008. In its second opinion of 26 August 2008, the IAB states that the impact assessment is based on a detailed stocktaking of the situation of self-employed and assisting spouses in the Member States. It recognizes that the resubmitted version takes account of the Board's first 9 Communication from the Commission Towards a reinforced culture of consultation and dialogue: General principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the Commission (COM(2002) 704 final). 10 The study is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/gender_equality/legislation/report_draft2.pdf . 11 This study is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/entrepreneurship/craft/craft- studies/documents/social_protection_final_report_en.pdf.

        "EN 9 EN opinion by improved presentation of cost estimates and problem definition and by providing details about the transposition and compliance issues. Nevertheless, the Board makes some recommendations for improvements. The Board calls the final version of the impact assessment report to: \u2022 further improve the problem definition by better clarifying which of the reasons behind it could be addressed by the proposed initiative; \u2022 assess more thoroughly the necessity and added value of EU action; \u2022 improve the evaluation of cost and benefits by including the analysis underpinning the assessment of cost effectiveness and substantiate the statements on the administrative burdens. \u2022 explain why the time-limit for transposition has been changed. The present version of the impact assessment report takes full account of the recommendations of the second opinion of the IAB. The problem definition was complemented with information on the obstacles to women's self- employment that the proposal could help removing and explaining why the intervention on reconciliation issues for employees has successful. The paragraphs on the necessity of an EU action and on subsidiarity and proportionality were reinforced in order to make clearer the need and the legitimacy of the proposal. As the IAB notes in its second opinion, the presentation of the costs estimates has already been improved. This version has been complemented to better underpinning the analysis of cost-effectiveness and administrative burdens. 3. P ROBLEM DEFINITION Directive 86/613/EEC covers two distinct categories of persons, with differing characteristics and needs, namely the \u2018self-employed\u2019 and \u2018assisting spouses\u2019. This section will address these two categories in turn. 3.1. Self-employed The current EU legal framework prohibits discrimination based on sex in the following areas: \u2022 social security and other elements of social protection (Directive 79/7/EEC); \u2022 occupational schemes (Directive 86/378/EEC); \u2022 conditions for access to self-employment (Directives 2002/73/EC and 2006/54/EC); \u2022 access to and supply of goods and services (Directive 2004/113/EC). Directive 86/613/EEC is the only text dealing specifically with self-employed workers (and assisting spouses). The main provisions of the Directive are as follows. ",
        "EN 10 EN \u2022 Personal scope : it applies to self-employed workers and their spouses who perform the same tasks or ancillary tasks; \u2022 Principle of equal treatment : this implies the absence of all discrimination on grounds of sex, either directly or indirectly, by reference in particular to marital or family status. Member States must eliminate all provisions that are contrary to the principle of equal treatment, especially in respect of the establishment, equipment or extension of a business or the launching or extension of any other form of self-employed activity, including financial facilities. \u2022 Creation of a business : the conditions for the creation of a company between spouses should not be more restrictive than the conditions for the formation of a company between unmarried persons. \u2022 Assisting spouses : such persons should be able to join a contributory social security scheme voluntarily, if one exists, and Member States should examine how to encourage recognition of their work. \u2022 Protection of maternity and motherhood : Member States should examine whether, and under what conditions, female self-employed workers and the wives of self-employed workers may, during interruptions in their occupational activity owing to pregnancy or motherhood, have access to services supplying temporary replacements or existing national social services, or be entitled to cash benefits under a social security scheme or under any other public social protection system. Directive 86/613/EEC defines the self-employed as \u2018all persons pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law, including farmers and members of the liberal professions\u2019. Self-employment is a significant \u2014 albeit minority \u2014 form of employment in Europe: in 2005, the self-employed represented 16% of the active population in the EU25. In 2005, according to Eurostat 12 , self-employed women in industry and market services in the EU as a whole accounted for 12% of the total number of women working in these sectors, which is considerably lower than the percentage of self-employed men ( 19% ). 12 See \u2018The life of women and men in Europe, A statistical portrait\u2019, 2008, available at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-80-07-135/EN/KS-80-07-135-EN.PDF . ",
        "EN 11 EN Moreover only one-third of entrepreneurs are female. Being self-employed can be different from being an entrepreneur. The figures above include both the self-employed with employees and those without. Many of the last group are professionals or do much the same job as employees do, but their status or terms of employment are different. The category of the self-employed without employees also includes \u2018bogus self-employed\u2019 and economically dependent or \u2018parasubordinate\u2019 workers 13 . Entrepreneurs are essentially (but not exclusively) those with employees, though many entrepreneurs managing businesses, even their own, are classified as employees, since they are employed by the company and receive a salary for their work. Nevertheless, this report uses the terms \u2018self-employed\u2019 and \u2018entrepreneurs\u2019 as synonymous, as the statistical data do not usually distinguish between them. Only 3.5% of women working in industry and market services in 2005 were self-employed with employees, whereas the percentage for men was twice as high at around 7% . More significantly, this gender gap in self-employed activities shows no sign of narrowing. As the next table shows, although the majority of the jobs created in the period 2005-2006 were taken by women, the majority of the self-employed jobs created were taken by men.

In a Flash Eurobarometer survey published in April 2007 14 , some questions were asked about people\u2019s preferences in terms of employment status. The gap between men and women was significant: 50% of men declared a preference for self-employment, compared with only 39% of women. When asked about their desire to become self-employed within the next five years, the disparity between men and women was the same: 33% of men declared it very or rather desirable, against 27% for women. On the other hand, 69% of women considered it rather undesirable or not desirable at all to become self-employed within the next five years, compared with 62% of men. The reasons given by men and women for taking up self-employment also differ. According to a recent Eurostat survey 15 , women are keener to accept self-employment to avoid unemployment or to better reconcile professional and family and private life. The table below presents the main motives for starting entrepreneurial activities. It shows that \u2018better possibilities to combine work and private life\u2019 is a reason indicated by 26% of respondents (the fourth in the ranking of motives).

If we look at gender, the importance of the different motives differs between men and women. The chart below confirms that many of the factors that influence a decision to take up self- employment are gender related. Motives like \u2018avoiding unemployment\u2019, \u2018combining work and private life\u2019 and \u2018children are big enough\u2019 are substantially more important for women than for men. ",
        "EN 14 EN Source: Eurostat 16 Since women are more likely to focus on reconciliation between work and family life, including the protection granted in the event of maternity, Directive 86/613/EEC does not respond to the new challenge of increasing women\u2019s participation in self-employment. Currently, the provisions of Directive 86/613/EEC on maternity leave give no entitlement to female self-employed workers. Therefore, a change in the law as set out in the proposal could help more women take that step. It should be added that the data on intentions to become self-employed and on the reasons for doing so show that certain women have no real choice whether or not to take up self- employment. Where the possibility to reconcile professional and private or family life is non- existent or very difficult for self-employed women, women are not in a position to become self-employed. Social security as a whole plays an important role in the decision to take up self-employment. According to the EIM study, \u2018 Social security may have a negative and positive influence on entrepreneurship. (...) Social security may have a negative effect because of the relatively high opportunity costs of entrepreneurship (...) when the social security position of entrepreneurs is worse than the position of alternative types of employment (...). On the other hand, social security may have a positive influence when the difference between the social security position of entrepreneurs and of alternative types of employment is very small. It may also have a positive influence when e.g. a safety net is created in case of business failure .\u2019 Therefore a proposal that brings the positions of self-employed workers and employees more into line is also likely to have a positive impact on women in particular. In the field of gender equality, the EU has intervened successfully in the past for employees. The existing directives on equal treatment between women and men were at the origin of most on national law on this field. Although it is difficult to prove the direct link between the corpus of Community law forbidding discrimination between women and men has improved the employment situation of women and the higher employment rates of women, some data show that the link exists. In general terms, Member States with strong reconciliation policies have higher employment rates of women, essentially with children. The table below, for instance, shows that this is the case as far as the level of payment of family-related leave is concerned. 16 Eurostat, Key figures on European business with a special feature on the factors of business success, 2008, ISSN 1830-9720.

There is a considerable gender gap in entrepreneurship: only one third of entrepreneurs are women. This gender gap has remained stable in the last few decades and surveys show that it is likely to remain so if no changes are made to encourage more women to take up self- employment. The surveys of motivations to become an entrepreneur show that women are more inclined to give as a reason the reconciliation of working life and family and private life. Any improvement in the possibilities to pursue self-employment and meet family responsibilities at the same time will therefore impact on the choice made by women to take up self- employment. Directive 86/613/EEC fails to tackle those issues by not giving enforceable rights to self- employed women, in particular in the case of maternity, thus reinforcing the gender gap. The envisaged initiative, by giving self-employed women an entitlement to a period of paid maternity leave will tackle two of the obstacles identified to women's access to self- employment: on one hand, it will contribute to increase the possibilities of combining self- employed activities and family responsibilities and, on the other hand, it will approximate the social protection in case of maternity, therefore facilitating the choice of self-employed activities. 3.2.

        "EN 16 EN habitually, under the conditions laid down by national law, participate in the activities of the self-employed worker and perform the same tasks or ancillary tasks\u2019 . In accordance with that definition, spouses who participate in the activities of the family business without having the status of employee or self-employed person therefore fall within the scope of the Directive (in particular its Article 2(b)). For the purposes of this report, such spouses are referred to as \u2018assisting spouses\u2019. Conversely, spouses who have the status of self-employed workers or employees and the spouses of self-employed persons who do not participate in the activities of the family business do not fall within the scope of the Directive, are not assisting spouses, and will not be considered in this report. Although Directive 86/613/EEC defines assisting spouses, it does not provide a legal status for them, in terms of employment protection or social security. The Directive was based upon Articles 100 and 235 of the EEC (now Articles 95 and 308). Article 100 which allowed the Council to adopt directives on the establishment or functioning of the common market and Article 235 was the residual legal base that could be used when action by the Community is necessary to attain one of the objectives of the Community but there is no other more specific legal base in the Treaty. With such a legal base, Directive 86/613/EEC could not set out a legal status for assisting spouses, in order to give them clear rights to social protection measures such as minimum periods of maternity leave or social security entitlements. As a result, this status is determined (or not) under national law, and there is no minimum level of equal treatment guaranteed to assisting spouses. There are no reliable statistics on the number of assisting spouses in Europe. Because they do not have a recognised status (if the spouses of self-employed persons are employees or business partners, they cannot be \u2018assisting spouses\u2019), their number is difficult to establish. Assisting spouses are therefore not included in existing statistics. Where statistics are available, they frequently do not distinguish between family members and spouses. The EPEC study (see Table A in Annex 1) estimates that there around 3.75 million assisting spouses/contributing family workers in the 27 Member States, corresponding to around 11.5% of all self-employed people within the EU (32.5 million). The estimate in the EPEC study is consistent with the findings of the EIM study (see Graph 2 in Annex 1). According to the latter, a survey of entrepreneurs found that 11% had an assisting spouse, while 16% declared that their spouses were co-entrepreneurs and 22% that they were employees. For the purposes of the survey, the definition of \u2018assisting spouses\u2019 excluded business partners and employees and was therefore close to that used in the Directive and in this report. According to the survey, two thirds of assisting spouses were female. Hours worked by assisting spouses may be significant. According to the EIM study\u2019s survey, more than 30% of entrepreneurs declared that their assisting spouses worked more than 25 hours a week. In 19 Member States the contribution of assisting spouses to the family business is not recognised in the social security system (for details see Table 6 in Annex 1). Even though the ",
        "EN 17 EN possibility does exist for an assisting spouse to join a voluntary social security scheme and hence be entitled to certain benefits, such provisions for joining voluntary schemes do not ensure the universal coverage of assisting spouses. Two consequences need to be emphasised: \u2022 Family businesses where the regular work of assisting spouses is not recognised have de facto an unfair competitive advantage over the same kind of businesses where both the self-employed worker and the assisting spouses are registered and covered by social security schemes. \u2022 Assisting spouses do not generally receive any financial compensation for their work. Their participation in the activities of the self-employed worker is often considered as a continuation of their household and family care tasks. As a consequence, most assisting spouses would be unable to continue the business or to remain in control in the event of divorce or death of the self-employed partner, or to resume activity in the event of bankruptcy. In such cases, assisting spouses are at a high risk of poverty. Around 11% of the self-employed rely on the assistance of their spouses to manage the family business. The numbers of hours worked can be significant, with one third of assisting spouses working more than 25 hours per week. Nevertheless, in most Member States, their contribution to the family business is not recognised, as they are not covered by social security systems. In consequence, assisting spouses are totally dependent on their self-employed partner and at a high risk of poverty in the event of divorce, death of the partner or bankruptcy. By not providing a legal status for assisting spouses or for social security protection in their own name, Directive 86/613/EEC fails to tackle this problem. 3.3. Likely development of the situation in the absence of EU action (baseline scenario) If no new EU action is taken, the current legal framework will continue to apply. Some Member States could take measures in order to improve the social protection of self-employed workers (in particular as regards maternity) and assisting spouses, but others would not. The previously identified gaps in the Community legal framework would not be tackled. The task of the Community, as set out in Article 2 of the EC Treaty, of promoting equality between women and men, will not be achieved as regards assisting spouses. The actions provided for in the European agenda for entrepreneurship 17 , and more recently the Communication \u2018Think Small First \u2014 A Small Business Act\u2019 for Europe 18 , would continue to encourage women\u2019s entrepreneurship by, for example, encouraging more people to become 17 Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions Action Plan: The European agenda for Entrepreneurship (COM(2004) 70 final). 18 Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - \u2018Think Small First\u2019 \u2014 A \u2018Small Business Act\u2019 for Europe, Document COM/2008/0394 final. ",
        "EN 18 EN entrepreneurs, improving access to finance, and creating a more SME-friendly regulatory and administrative framework. Given that family responsibilities are still borne primarily by women, no improvement in social protection, particularly in the event of maternity, and in the possibilities for reconciling self-employment and family responsibilities will mean that a number of women will be discouraged from becoming entrepreneurs. The 2002 Barcelona European Council urged the Member States to remove disincentives to female labour-force participation by aiming to provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90% of children between three years and the mandatory school age and at least 33% of children under three years. Although most Member States are not on course to meet the targets, especially for children under three, and existing facilities are often costly or the opening hours are not compatible with atypical hours, common in self-employed activities, the effort of Member States to reach the Barcelona targets will improve the possibilities of women with children to pursue or engage in self-employed activities. In most Member States, the contribution of women to the family business will continue to be unrecognised and unpaid, and assisting spouses will be at a higher risk of poverty in the event of divorce or the death of their self-employed partners. 3.4. Does the EU have the right to act? Right to act Article 2 of the EC Treaty provides that promoting equality between men and women is part of the tasks of the European Community. Furthermore, it should be noted that, following the changes introduced by the Amsterdam Treaty, the EU now has an appropriate legal basis for action (Article 141(3) EC). Previously, as Annex V explains in detail, the Community legislator adopted Directive 86/613/EEC using a residual legal basis. Necessity to act As far as access to employment is concerned, it has been recognised that improving the possibilities to reconcile work and family or private life is essential to increase the participation of women in the labour market and to give women equal opportunities in employment. Although reconciliation issues and family responsibilities in general should not be seen as mainly the concern of women, it is uncontested that domestic work is not shared equally between women and men: women spend twice as long as men on unpaid work. The planned proposal touches upon the area of social security, which falls in principle within the competence of Member States. This initiative should not interfere with the organisation of Member States\u2019 schemes or their financing, and should be limited to what is necessary to ensure application of the principle of equal treatment between women and men. Nevertheless, this is also an area where, mainly for employees but also in some cases for the self-employed, the EU has intervened in the past, through a series of Directives (92/85/EC, ",
        "EN 19 EN 96/34/EC, 79/7/EEC, 86/367/EEC 19 ) with the aim of ensuring the application of the principle of equal treatment between women and men. The low participation of women in self-employment is a matter of gender inequality: women are not equal where family responsibilities are concerned and gender stereotypes are also an obstacle with a negative impact on women\u2019s participation in entrepreneurship. The EU should intervene for the self-employed as it has done successfully for employees in the past. The existing directives have set out clearly that there must be no discrimination between women and men employees in terms of pay and other conditions of work. They have improved the employment rights and health and safety of working pregnant women. Most importantly perhaps, people who are subject to discrimination have a clear legal right of complaint, as well as the right to be helped by the so-called \"Equality Bodies\" in each Member State. Although difficult to prove empirically, the corpus of Community law forbidding discrimination between women and men has improved the employment situation of women, raised awareness that discrimination is unacceptable and unlawful, and given women a proper remedy when they have been discriminated against. As far as assisting spouses are concerned, the lack of coverage by social security and the non- recognition of their contribution to the family business give some businesses an unfair competitive advantage, so this initiative would ensure a level playing field throughout Europe. Proportionality and subsidiarity The EU has already in place a Directive covering the matters touched upon by the envisaged proposal. The assessment shows that this Directive has been ineffective in meeting its objectives. An EU legal instrument is the only way to ensure a level playing field in Europe. Strongly divergent national legislations, in particular concerning the status of assisting spouses, could lead to an unfair competitive advantage of businesses where the level of protection is lower or inexistent. The envisaged proposal goes no further than necessary to ensure that the aim of the initiative is met. As far as self-employed female workers are concerned and female assisting spouses, a period of 14 weeks of maternity leave is envisaged, at their request, but the period of compulsory maternity leave would be 2 weeks, in line with the existing Directive on pregnant workers. The proposal will establish the principle of a payment during maternity leave, without fixing any amount of the allowance, provided it guarantees adequate revenue. As for assisting spouses, the proposal should give assisting spouses, at their request, the possibility to benefit from at least an equal level of protection as self-employed workers, under the same conditions, without imposing a specific scheme for self-employed workers. The envisaged directive would be a minimum standards instrument and would set out basic minimum standards whilst allowing those Member States which wished to go further. Member States which already have detailed protection for assisting spouses and self- employed female workers would not need to make major changes to their legislation. 19 See Annex V for more details. ",
        "EN 20 EN The envisaged proposal therefore respects the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, as it is taken at the appropriate level and does not go beyond what is absolutely necessary at EU level in order to achieve the objectives set for the initiative. 4. O BJECTIVES 4.1. What are the general policy objectives? Any policy intervention should meet the following general objectives: 1. To improve gender equality for self-employed workers 2. To improve gender equality for assisting spouses. The main policy objective of such action is to improve the way the principle of equal treatment applies to the two categories of persons covered by Directive 86/613/EEC. It is widely accepted that most European legislation on equality between women and men covers employees only. Although there is historical justification for this (the limitations of the primary legal basis), this situation is no longer acceptable given the development of Europe\u2019s societies. It should be stressed that the aim is not to equalise the situations of employees and the self- employed or bring them more into line, but only to make sure that gender equality is applied in practice for self-employed workers and assisting spouses. 4.2. What are the more specific objectives? Achieving the general objectives set out above entails the following specific objectives: 1. To increase the number of women in self-employment 3. To give assisting spouses a legal status 4. To increase the number of assisting spouses covered by social security in their own name 5. To give the self-employed and assisting spouses effective legal remedies 4.3. Consistency of the objectives with other EU policies and horizontal objectives As pointed out above, the objectives are totally consistent with EU policies and in particular the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. According to the Treaty, the Community\u2019s aims, among others, are to eliminate inequalities and promote equality between men and women in all its activities. Gender equality lies at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy: since the gender gap in self-employment is still wide, bridging the gender gap in the field of entrepreneurship is vital if the target of a 60% female employment rate is to be met. ",
        "EN 21 EN 5. P OLICY OPTIONS 5.1. No new action at EU level If no new action is taken at EU level, the EU legal framework will remain unchanged. Other actions to meet the specific objective of encouraging female entrepreneurship could, of course, be taken by the EU or by Member States. 5.2. Non-binding measures In addition to the non-binding measures already in place, essentially entrepreneurship policy and SME policy (see point 3.3), some new legally non-binding measures could be considered, either alone or in combination with legally binding measures. A Commission communication or report could present findings on best practice with respect to self-employed women and assisting spouses. A Commission recommendation (a Council recommendation is excluded in areas where the EU has a legal basis to act) could encourage the adoption of national measures to improve the way the principle of equal treatment is applied to self-employed persons and assisting spouses. Such a recommendation could provide for Member States to report to the Commission and for the Commission to report to the Council and Parliament. As to the open method of coordination, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on jointly agreed and easily applicable indicators. Targets could be set for female participation in self- employment, for example, but it is more difficult to envisage such indicators for assisting spouses. Exchanges of information and good practice between the Member States could also be envisaged through existing or new expert groups of high-level national civil servants. 5.3. A directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC The legal situation concerning the self-employed and assisting spouses is explained in detail in Annex V. Although Directive 86/613/EEC is not the only legal text dealing with the self- employed, it is the only specific and general legal text that applies the principle of equal treatment to the self-employed and assisting spouses. Any change in the legal situation of one or both of these categories therefore requires an amendment to the Directive. 5.4. Preliminary screening of options 5.4.1. Non-binding measures In this field, non-binding measures have already been extensively used in order to promote entrepreneurship and female entrepreneurship in particular. In a sense, some of the provisions of Directive 86/613/EEC could also be included amongst the non-binding measures, since they are \u2018recommendations\u2019 to Member States, rather than legal obligations. In order to promote women\u2019s entrepreneurship, the European Commission set up a European Network to Promote Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship (WES) in 2000. It is composed of government representatives responsible for the promotion of female entrepreneurship. It has ",
        "EN 22 EN members from 30 European countries: the EU27, Iceland, Norway and Turkey. WES members provide advice, support, information and contacts regarding existing measures to support female entrepreneurs. They also help in the identification of good practices. WES publishes an annual activity report that presents the activities undertaken by national governments to promote women\u2019s entrepreneurship. One of the findings of the Commission\u2019s 2004 BEST project \u2018Promoting Entrepreneurship amongst Women\u2019 was that networking and access to information for women entrepreneurs should be further promoted. As a follow up to this project, DG ENTR set up a women\u2019s entrepreneurship portal on Europa in March 2006 20 . The Portal provides links to the websites of organisations representing women entrepreneurs and networks, projects and events relating to the promotion of female entrepreneurship. It facilitates finding contacts for networking and mentoring. DG ENTR is also collaborating with a number of European-level business organisations concerned with women entrepreneurs. It holds bilateral meetings to exchange views and explore future initiatives. The main business partners are: FEM-UEAPME (\u2018Female Europeans of Small and Medium Enterprises\u2019), FCEM (\u2018The worldwide network of women business owners\u2019), EWN (\u2018Eurochambres Women\u2019s Network\u2019) and EUWIIN (EU Women Inventors and Innovators Network). Moreover, in the Communication \u2018Think Small First \u2014 A Small Business Act for Europe\u2019 21 , adopted on 25 June 2008, the Commission proposes some further actions to promote female entrepreneurship: \u2022 establishing an EU network of female entrepreneur ambassadors, \u2022 promoting mentoring schemes to inspire women to set up their own businesses, \u2022 promoting entrepreneurship among women graduates. The General Block Exemption Regulation 22 adopted by the Commission on 7 July 2008 also provides that aid schemes for new enterprises set up by female entrepreneurs are compatible with the common market provided the aid does not exceed EUR 1 million in each case. A further way of achieving the intended objectives could be better enforcement of the Directive. The Directive was adopted in 1986 and has been the subject of only one report, adopted in 1994, therefore covering only 12 Member States. Monitoring of the Directive could be improved, for instance through a reporting exercise, from Member States to the Commission and from the Commission to the other institutions. It should be assessed whether the generally agreed 23 low impact of the Directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment for the self-employed and assisting spouses could be improved by better enforcement of the Directive without substantial changes. 20 http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/entrepreneurship/women.htm. 21 Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - \u2018Think Small First\u2019 \u2014 A \u2018Small Business Act\u2019 for Europe, Document COM/2008/0394 final. 22 http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/state_aid/reform/gber_final_en.pdf. ",
        "EN 23 EN A further analysis of the impact of non-binding measures is therefore needed. 5.4.2. A directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC Since a directive already exists, a proposal for a directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC is the only appropriate legal instrument in this case. It is generally accepted that Directive 86/613/EEC has had limited impact on women\u2019s participation in self-employment and the situation of assisting spouses. It does not set out a clear legal status for assisting spouses who therefore remain in a precarious situation should anything happen to their self-employed partner. It is also acknowledged that the gender gap in the field of entrepreneurship must be bridged if the EU is to meet the Lisbon targets for the employment rate of women. On the other hand, the contribution of assisting spouses to the family business is far from being generally recognised and their status in terms of social protection is unsatisfactory. A further analysis of the impact of revising Directive 86/613/EEC is therefore needed. 6. A NALYSIS OF IMPACTS After the preliminary screening of possible policy options, three have been retained for further analysis: no new action at EU level, non-binding measures, and a proposal for a directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC. Furthermore, to assess the impact of the third, legislative option, it is divided into the following sub-options: \u2013 Improving protection in the event of maternity (option 6.3) \u2013 Providing leave to care for family members (option 6.4) \u2013 Giving assisting spouses a legal status and social protection in their own name (option 6.5) \u2013 Giving national equality bodies competence in this field (option 6.6). In assessing the impact of the various options, each option\u2019s financial costs are quantified as far as possible. The costs are expressed in absolute terms, as a percentage of overall social security expenditure, and, where possible, as the maximum percentage increase in the contributions by self-employed workers to social security. However, quantifying the percentage of the additional costs to be paid by insured persons (self-employed and assisting spouses) is difficult and depends on the political choices at national level. 23 See, for exemple, the Commission\u2019s report on the implementation of the Directive (document COM(94)163 final) and the report of the Network of Independent Legal Experts (http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/gender_equality/legislation/report_draft2.pdf). ",
        "EN 24 EN 6.1. No new action at EU level This option means that the current situation would continue to apply. It therefore implies no new costs for the Member States or the EU, since the current situation would be maintained. The economic impact of this option would be indirect. As there would be no improvement in the situation, there would be an opportunity cost equal to the benefits of the other options. In other words, if another option involving, say, a legislative proposal would have had a positive impact in terms of increasing women\u2019s participation in self-employment, the benefits forgone as a result of choosing this \u2018no action\u2019 option are its opportunity cost. Some social impacts can also be identified. Once again, this option\u2019s social impacts are directly connected with the positive impacts of the other options. This option would not contribute to improving gender equality in self-employment or for assisting spouses. In addition, in certain Member States, assisting spouses would be left with no social protection in the event of divorce or the death or bankruptcy of the self-employed partner. As the Advisory Committee argues in its opinion (see Annex IV), \u2018[m]any women that are not covered by social protection systems while engaged alongside their male partner in self- employed activities, including agriculture, often require financial assistance in the form of payments provided by collective solidarity funds later in their lives due to the fact that they have no contributions to social security systems and are therefore excluded from state pensions and other complementary forms of pension schemes.\u2019 No environmental impacts have been identified. 6.2. Non-binding measures A large number of non-binding initiatives have been developed at different levels, as shown previously, while others could be in the next future. These measures have certainly yielded positive impacts. In future, permission to grant State aid to businesses set up by women could have a real impact, since access to finance has been identified as one of the obstacles to women\u2019s entrepreneurship. As mentioned previously, the gender gap in entrepreneurship has no single cause. It is the consequence of a number of inequalities and stereotypes. The initiatives noted above can deal with some of the obstacles: difficulty in access to finance, lack of social networks, etc. The Impact Assessment supporting the Commission Communication \u2018Think Small First\u2019, referred to above, assesses the impact of the measures planned to promote women\u2019s entrepreneurship by establishing an EU network of female entrepreneur ambassadors and by promoting mentoring schemes to inspire women to set up their own businesses and promote entrepreneurship among women graduates. It indicates that these measures \u2018would have a positive effect on female entrepreneurs but also bring additional opportunities for economic growth and therefore employment. Increased women entrepreneurship could contribute to higher economic growth and at the same time favour the inclusion of women in the labour market.\u2019 24 24 SEC(2008) 2101 http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/docs/ia_2008/sec_2008_2101_en.pdf. ",
        "EN 25 EN Nevertheless, the Communication does not address two of the main reasons that could explain the gender gap in entrepreneurship: the difficulty to combine family and private life with entrepreneurial activities and the lower level of social protection compared with employees, in particular as regards maternity. Indeed, the Impact Assessment for the \u2018Think Small First\u2019 initiative notes that: \u2018Today female entrepreneurs constitute only 34.4% of self-employed people in the EU25. Their share in start ups is around 30%. In terms of preferences, only 39.4% of women would choose to be self-employed compared to 50.2% of men, which shows that women are more reluctant than men to become entrepreneurs. In addition to economic and sociological elements common to both genders, the lack of social protection or the reduced level of protection available to self-employed women, notably in the case of maternity protection, constitutes an additional obstacle to the participation of women in self-employed activities\u2019 [emphasis added]. As far as the monitoring and enforcement of Directive 86/613/EEC are concerned, most of the Directive\u2019s provisions are drafted in such a way that Member States are obliged only to \u2018undertake to examine\u2019 whether a certain action could be taken. This is notably the case with Article 7 on the recognition of the work of assisting spouses and Article 8 on protection in the case of pregnancy and motherhood. Therefore, the problems identified cannot be seen as having its source in an incorrect or incomplete implementation of the Directive, since the Directive requires no obligatory result. In conclusion, non-binding measures are already in force and can be extended independently of the current exercise. They cannot, however, provide an alternative to amending the Directive if improving the legal situation of the self-employed and assisting spouses at EU level is considered necessary. Better enforcement of the provisions of the Directive would be ineffective in view of their largely non-binding nature. 6.3. A directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC: improving protection in the case of maternity The assessment of the costs of this option is based on the period of maternity leave provided for in Directive 92/85/EEC 25 , i.e. 14 weeks. Economic impacts Paid maternity leave As far as the duration of maternity leave is concerned, in five Member States (Austria, Belgium, Greece, Lithuania and France), maternity leave for the self-employed is currently less than 14 weeks. This means that those Member States would have to amend their provisions to bring the duration of maternity leave up to 14 weeks.

        "EN 29 EN As a percentage of the country\u2019s overall social security expenditure, the costs would amount to 0.111255% in Bulgaria, 0.11003% in the Czech Republic and 0.01232% in Romania (for farmers only). The absolute and relative costs for the Member States where changes are necessary are summarised in the table below. If such an option is retained, it is difficult to assess exactly what the costs would be for each self-employed worker. The costs of extending maternity protection to self-employed women cannot be borne by self-employed women only, or only by women of a certain age, for instance. In social security, the principle of equal treatment between women and men would rule out such a solution. Therefore, we could divide the annual costs of the option by the total number of self-employed and assume this would be the additional amount to be paid by all self-employed workers if this option were implemented. Nevertheless, this would be also misleading, since contributions by the self-employed are not the only source of financing. According to Eurostat 29 , at EU27 level, payments by the self-employed constitute around 60% of all social protection receipts (with the remaining 40% coming from general taxation). In order to assess the potential costs for self-employed workers, the fourth column of the table below shows the increase in the contributions by self-employed workers to social security assuming that the costs would be borne entirely by the self-employed, although this is not the case in practice. These are therefore the maximum costs for self-employed workers, since part of the financing comes from other sources. The real costs would be lower in practice. It should be noted that the costs for the Member State of the implementation of the Directive (second column of the table below) could be neutral if the Member State decides to pass entirely the costs to self-employed workers. The second and the fourth columns show the maximum costs of two extreme decisions: to support the costs entirely by the social security system or entirely by the self-employed workers themselves. In any case, the proposal could leave self-employed women a choice whether or not to benefit of maternity leave. The costs for the social security system and to the self-employed workers would therefore depend on the individual decision of self-employed workers and there would be no imposed additional costs to businesses. The costs for Member States would also be lower since it is not likely that all self-employed women will decide to benefit from maternity leave and pay the relevant contributions.

In two countries (Austria and Germany) the situation is difficult to assess: in Austria, a relatively moderate maternity allowance is paid under the compulsory insurance scheme whereas sick leave benefit is paid at a potentially higher rate under voluntary insurance schemes. In Germany, both maternity and sickness benefit are paid under voluntary insurance arrangements open to the self-employed, which means that the range of both maternity and sickness benefits is open-ended. Consequently, any change to align maternity benefit or allowance to sickness benefit would not entail any changes in the rate of maternity payments, as maternity benefit is already similar to or higher than sickness benefit in most Member States. The provision of a temporary replacement (as an alternative to payment) Most Member States do not provide such a service to self-employed people on maternity leave. Exceptions are: \u2022 Austria, where self-employed workers can to ask for business assistance for the 8 weeks before and after the calculated due date. There are few data available on the rate and costs of using this service. The only figures that exist indicate that \u20ac2.5 million was spent in 2007 on business assistance in all cases, including maternity. \u2022 Finland, where such a service is available to self-employed farmers and assisting spouses when they receive a salary for their work. \u2022 France, where such service is provided to self-employed farmers and assisting spouses of all the self-employed, but not to self-employed workers other than farmers. \u2022 Germany, where members of the agricultural health insurance scheme can receive home help or farming help. ",
        "EN 31 EN In the 4 Member States where a temporary replacement service is provided, it is not an alternative to maternity leave payment, but a supplementary service for the self-employed. Some Member States have other measures to encourage temporary replacement, without providing a formal replacement service: \u2022 Slovenia, where if the self-employed employ a registered unemployed person as a temporary replacement during maternity leave, the state covers social security contributions for the replacement worker for up to 15 months. \u2022 Spain, which has some measures to encourage the hiring of temporary replacements, but does not formally provide this service to self-employed women. Consequently, the provision of a temporary replacement service for 14 weeks would require significant changes in the Member States. The costs of this option are calculated assuming different percentages of self-employed mothers wanting to use such a service (20%, 40%, 60%) and different rates of payment for the replacement service as a proportion of average self-employed income (50%, 70%, 100%). The calculation assumes a replacement for 14 weeks, even though the length of maternity leave could be less. The estimated number of self-employed women who become mothers per year in the 23 Member States with no temporary replacement service is around 200 000. At the high end of the range considered, if 60% of such women were to take advantage of the temporary replacement service at 100% payment, i.e. fully paid by the state, the costs would be substantial \u2014 \u20ac418 million per year. However, such a scenario is not very likely. It can be anticipated that a lower proportion of self-employed women would use the temporary replacement service. If 20% of self-employed women used the service at 50% payment, the total cost would be significantly lower, at \u20ac69 million per year. The cost would be even lower if the replacement period is less than 14 weeks. Table 3 in Annex 1 provides a detailed assessment of the costs by Member State. As regards administrative costs , in particular the administrative burden on businesses, no specific negative impacts have been identified, as this option would only apply to limited category of self-employed workers (pregnant self-employed workers and self-employed workers who have recently given birth). The proposal would, in any case, give self-employed women the choice to benefit (or not) from maternity leave. The impact would be limited to those having opted-in. In any case, the fact that self-employed workers are given the choice to join would mean that there would be no imposed additional costs on businesses. Social impacts Taking into account that the average age for starting a business (35 years) is close to the average age of women at the birth of the first child (29 years), this option would undoubtedly allow women to remain at work during pregnancy and motherhood and could encourage more women to take up self-employment.

A directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC: providing leave to care for family members Economic impacts In 15 Member States, the self-employed are entitled to paid leave in order to care for family members, as part of either mandatory or voluntary social insurance. In most Member States, however, data on the numbers of self-employed making use of this benefit are not collected on a routine basis (Table 4 in Annex 1 provides summary information on the situation in the Member States). Member States where such a benefit is not available for the self-employed are Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and UK. The table below illustrates some potential cost implications if leave to care for family members is introduced for the self-employed in these Member States. In the absence of actual data, some assumptions are made about the numbers of self-employed who would take up this benefit (2%, 4%, and 6%), the rates of payment (80%, 100%), and the total number of days of leave per year (5). The table indicates that the 12 Member States providing no leave to care for family members have around 18 million self-employed people. At the high end of the range, if 6% of these people were to make use of such leave for 5 days a year at 100% payment, this would cost around \u20ac340 million p.a.

Social impacts One of the dominant features of demographic change over the coming decades in Europe will be the rising share of people aged 80 years and over. A common feature across Europe is also that the burden of caring for relatives falls mainly on women. Providing for a period of leave would allow some self-employed women to stay in work despite the need to care for family members. Given that reconciling work and family life is one of the main factors behind decisions by women to take up or reject self-employment, provision for care leave could have a positive impact. Environmental impacts No environmental impacts have been identified. 6.5. A directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC: giving assisting spouses a legal status and social protection in their own name Economic impacts Table 6 in Annex 1 presents information on recognition of the contribution of assisting spouses and their subsequent coverage in social security schemes (including maternity leave payment). This shows that 8 Member States recognise the contribution of assisting spouses: they are insured in social security schemes as are their self-employed partners and receive the same level of social protection, notably maternity leave benefits. In 19 Member States, the contribution of assisting spouses to the family business is not recognised. In some, however, an assisting spouse can join a voluntary social security scheme and hence be entitled to certain benefits. However, such provision for joining voluntary schemes does not ensure universal coverage of assisting spouses. The costs of this policy option to Member States, estimated to be around \u20ac2.9 billion p.a. in 19 Member States, represent around 0.113% of current social security expenditure in these Member States (around \u20ac2.5 trillion in 2005, Eurostat). Under this option, the contribution to the family business would be recognised and assisting spouses would join social security schemes on the basis of the contribution rates currently paid by the self-employed in the Member States concerned. As mentioned above, many Member States do not collect data on assisting spouses. Often, the broader category of \u2018contributing family members\u2019, \u2018unpaid family workers\u2019, or \u2018relatives\u2019 is used. These definitions encompass not only assisting spouses, but also other members of the family, such as parents, children, brothers or sisters.

Recognition of the work of assisting spouses should mean that they are granted the same protection and benefits for maternity and motherhood as self-employed workers. Eight Member States provide maternity leave payment to assisting spouses at a level similar to that for the self-employed. These Member States are Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Sweden. If such an option is retained, it is difficult to assess exactly what the costs would be for each self-employed worker, for assisting spouses or for the family business as a whole. According to Eurostat 30 , at EU27 level, payments by the self-employed constitute around 60% of all social protection receipts (with the remaining 40% coming from general taxation). This being an average, it is not possible to quantify exactly the contribution required from self-employed workers, assisting spouses or family businesses as this would in any case depend on political decisions taken by the Member States concerned. The costs for the social security scheme and for self-employed workers depend on how the proposal is implemented in each Member State. The experience in at least one Member State shows that assisting spouses can be covered by a social security scheme without increasing the level of contributions to social security, by providing for a distribution of benefits and contributions between both members of the couple. In that case, the contributions and the benefits remain only dependent on the revenue of the family business.

What has happened in MS where assisting spouses receive social protection in their own name? In order to assess the impact of this option on social security contributions, it is useful to look at the experience of Member States where this option has already been implemented. Belgium Before 2003, assisting spouses were not obliged to take up any form of social security insurance. From January 2003 however, it became obligatory for assisting spouses to take up insurance with limited protection, called the \u2018mini-status\u2019. Since July 2005, assisting spouses have been obliged to register for the so-called \u2018maxi-status\u2019 covering sick leave, invalidity and maternity. ",

Luxembourg In Luxembourg, assisting spouses are covered by the same social protection scheme as for self-employed workers. Nevertheless, the level of contributions has remained unchanged, since the professional revenue of the family business is divided, where applicable, between the main insured person (the self-employed worker) and the persons assisting the family business (spouse or other relatives). The revenue attributed to the assisting spouse or relative is limited to a certain amount (twice the minimum wage), with the remaining part of revenue always attributed to the self-employed worker. In any event, the system in Luxembourg shows that assisting spouses can be compulsorily covered by a social security scheme in their own name without increasing the level of contributions to social security . As regards administrative costs , in particular the administrative burden on businesses, no specific negative impacts have been identified. Although the implementation of the option would require some administrative steps to be taken, the costs would be limited and would be exceeded by far by the advantages to the family business of the implementation of the option.

Environmental impacts No environmental impacts have been identified. 6.6. A directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC to give competence to national equality bodies to deal with the self-employed and assisting spouses In all Member States, one or more bodies have been set up in accordance with Directives 2000/43/EC, 2002/73/EC and 2004/113/EC. Such national bodies are responsible for providing independent assistance to victims of discrimination in pressing their complaints, conducting independent surveys, publishing independent reports and making recommendations on issues related to discrimination. As explained in Annex V, the legal situation of the self-employed is complex. Nevertheless, they are already covered by Directive 2002/73/EC, as far as conditions of access to self- employment are concerned, and by Directive 2004/113/EC as providers or users of goods and services. Both Directives provide for the establishment of an \u2018equality body\u2019. Giving the national equality bodies competence to deal with both the self-employed and assisting spouses would not impose any significant administrative burden on Member States. First, these bodies already partly cover these groups (the self-employed), and second, the limited numbers of assisting spouses compared with the total number of persons that national equality bodies may have to handle (all potential victims of discrimination based on race, all employees, all vocational trainees, all providers of goods and services, and all users of goods and services). Furthermore, the possibility to lodge complaints with national equality bodies and benefit from their assistance could very like reduce substantially the cases of litigation coming before the national courts. Since national equality bodies are already in place in all Member States, the extension of their competences to the persons and matters covered by the envisage initiative would not entail high additional costs. The cost effectiveness of this option appears therefore very positive. 7.

The option of amending the Directive is therefore the only one capable of achieving the objectives. As the Directive covers two different categories of persons (the self-employed and assisting spouses), it is hardly surprising that no single option for amending the Directive can achieve all the objectives. The table above shows clearly that measures have to be taken for both the self-employed and assisting spouses if the objectives are to be met. The cost of the option to provide for leave to care for family members has proved to be difficult to assess. The figures advanced by the EPEC study are based on assumptions impossible to validate (percentage of persons wishing to benefit, length of leave). Also in view of its less evident impact on filling the gender gap in entrepreneurship, the option of providing leave for the self-employed to take care of dependent relatives should not be selected: its impact on the decision to become self-employed is not evident and the cost/benefit ratio seems negative. In conclusion, in order to meet the objectives as far as possible, and taking into account the cost-effectiveness of the options, the preferred option is a combination of options 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, and 6.6, i.e. continuation of the non-binding measures that are in place or envisaged, combined with a proposal for a directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC to provide for maternity leave for self-employed women, to give assisting spouses social security coverage comparable that that enjoyed by the self-employed and to give competence to the national Equality Bodies in the matters covered by the Directive. In addition to the non-binding measures, the preferred option therefore consists of a proposal for a directive amending Directive 86/613/EEC and containing the following elements: \u2022 the right for self-employed women to benefit from maternity leave, the length of which would be 14 weeks maximum, with 2 weeks mandatory leave; \u2022 the right of assisting spouses to be covered by the same social security provisions applicable to self-employed workers; \u2022 the competence of national equality bodies in the area covered by the Directive. In order to take into account the specificities of self-employment and to avoid imposing additional costs to family businesses, the envisaged proposal could provide that self-employed women and assisting spouses are given the possibility to join the social protection system at their own request. In that case, any additional cost to family businesses would be a consequence of the choice made by the self-employed woman or the assisting spouse. 8. M ONITORING AND EVALUATION ARRANGEMENTS 8.1.

Nevertheless, assessing the extent to which any change in the level of female entrepreneurship can be attributed to an amendment ",
        "EN 42 EN to Directive 86/613/EEC will be difficult, since there are many reasons why people decide to become self-employed, or not as the case may be, and only a few will be influenced by the legal situation in the areas covered by Directive 86/613/EEC. No indicator is currently available for assisting spouses. The registration of assisting spouses in social security schemes, if this option is retained, could serve as a direct indicator. In any case, certain indirect indicators could be used, such as the number of new registrations in social security schemes, the number of self-employed persons declaring their spouses as partners or employees, etc. The proposal should include an obligation, to apply three years following transposition, for reporting by the Member States to the Commission and by the Commission to Parliament and the Council. Such reports should analyse the way the Directive has been transposed and consider its impact in practice. 8.2. Monitoring Like the recent Directives on gender equality, once adopted the proposed directive will be monitored with the aid of the Progress Programme (2007-2013) 31 . Under the latter the EU has set up a European network of legal experts in gender equality to support the Commission\u2019s work by providing independent information and advice on legal developments in this area in the Member States. In accordance with the Communication A Europe of results: Applying Community law 32 , the Commission will also set up an expert group, comprising representatives of the Member States and the Commission, to discuss issues concerning the directive\u2019s transposition into national legislation. 8.3. Transposition The time limit for transposition will be two years after adoption. Two years appears to be an adequate period for transposition of the Directive into national law since an additional period will be granted for the most complex issue (assisting spouses). Indeed, in order to allow time to comply with the provisions for assisting spouses (recognition and coverage by social security schemes), an additional period would be granted to Member States. Six years after the adoption of the directive, the Governments of the Member States and the national Equality Bodies are to send the Commission information for a report to Parliament and the Council on the application of the Directive. When drafting this report, the Commission will also take due account of the opinions of and information provided by relevant stakeholders (including businesses, European NGOs, and social partners). 31 Decision No 1672/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity \u2014 Progress, OJ L 315/1 of 15.11.2006. 32 Document COM(2007) 502 final.

        "EN 43 EN The report could be accompanied, if needed, by any proposals to update the Directive in the light of its impact. In order to prevent difficulties in the transposition of the Directive and reduce the number of infringement proceedings, the Commission will set up an ad-hoc group of national experts in order to prepare the transposition by Member States.

Entrepreneurs do have their own pension regulations within the earnings-related pension scheme but in terms of content they essentially correspond to the regulations for employees. The creation of uniform rights and obligations for all citizens, including entrepreneurs, corresponds to the Finnish perception that all citizens must be treated equally and fairly irrespective of their social status. Nevertheless, unlike employees, the entrepreneur can declare his/her own business income, based on which the level of earnings-related social security benefits and payments is set.

LV Self-employed workers are subject to mandatory social insurance. MT In Malta, there is a mandatory social protection scheme for self-employed workers, which covers all sectors of activity. NL Generally speaking, the Netherlands does not have a specific system of social protection for self-employed workers. Essentially, therefore, the Netherlands takes the view that a self-employed person bears full responsibility for his/her income and supplementary pension and for providing against loss of income as a result of sickness or disability. The Netherlands does, however, consider it a task of the government to ensure that self-employed workers are in a position to assume certain risks, i.e. that they can insure themselves privately at a reasonable price. In cases where the private sector does not offer a satisfactory solution, it is appropriate to examine whether and how government can play a part (where, for instance, there are ",
        "EN 82 EN special social needs, or where certain groups are in exceptional circumstances). In the Netherlands, self-employed workers are covered by the general rules governing social security and similar provisions. Self-employed workers have the same entitlements as employees (and other entitled persons) to public provision such as family allowance, retirement pension (AOW), survivors\u2019 pension (ANW) and reimbursement of health expenses (health insurance and exceptional medical expenses). They also qualify for contributions towards specific cost items such as child-care. The Work and Social Assistance Act (WWB) makes provision for self-employed workers whose income is below, or likely to fall below, the statutory minimum wage. PL In the Polish legal system there has been a social protection system for self-employed workers for many years, also covering those working in agriculture. Individual farmers, i.e. individuals pursuing an agricultural activity who are self-employed and own their own arable farms, have their own system of social security separate from the universal system. Generally social security is compulsory for farmers for whom agriculture is their only means of making a living and whose arable farm comprises usable arable land with an area greater than 1 comparative fiscal hectare. Voluntary social security applies to farmers pursuing agricultural activities on arable farms with an area less than 1 comparative fiscal hectare. Another voluntary social security scheme covers farmers who are gainfully employed in addition to their arable farming, but the scope of insurance is limited solely to insurance against the risk of an accident during farm work (one-off compensation). The social protection system for persons pursuing non-agricultural activities is mixed in character because those persons are subject to compulsory retirement and disability insurance and insurance against accidents at work and occupational diseases and to voluntary insurance in the event of sickness and motherhood. In the Polish legal system, persons pursuing an activity other than an agricultural activity as defined in the Act on the Social Security System, notwithstanding the type of activity performed, come under the social security system.

Statutory cover is permitted in cases where several professional activities are practised. SK Act No 461/2003 Coll. on social insurance defines a gainful activity for the purposes of sickness and pension insurance as the activity of an employee or the activity of a self-employed worker. It is therefore clear that this is a universal system applying to all employees and self-employed workers (with the exception of members of the armed forces and the police, etc.) Self-employed workers are compulsorily covered by sickness and pension insurance if their income from business and other self-employed activity or revenue associated with business or other self-employed activity (for the previous calendar year) exceeds 12 times the minimum assessment basis.

        "EN 86 EN Question 2.3: How are the social security contributions of self-employed workers calculated? MS Reply AT Contributions are first (provisionally) assessed on the basis of the income of the insured person in the third previous calendar year and \u2014 once statements of income have been submitted \u2014 then (retrospectively) definitively on the basis of the insured person\u2019s income in the year for which the contributions are due. The income taken into account for this purpose is that earned by the insured person from the self-employed activity to which the mandatory insurance relates, plus the statutory pension and sickness insurance contributions for that year, minus, under certain circumstances, any recapitalisation and capital gains. The contribution ceiling (2008) is \u20ac4 585 a month and, for most insured persons, the minimum contribution is \u20ac951.87 (which will, however, be reduced gradually up to 1 January 2015). In the pension insurance scheme for self-employed workers, the contribution rate is 22.8% of the contribution basis, of which, in 2007, 15.5% (rising by 0.25% a year to 17.5% in 2015) was accounted for by contributions from insured workers and 7.30% (falling by 0.25% a year to 5.30% in 2015) was contributed by the State. The contribution rate for sickness insurance in 2007 was 9.1%, but this was reduced from 1 January 2008 to 7.65%. The contributions of self-employed workers in the agricultural and forestry industries are based primarily on the standard value of the agricultural/or forestry holdings in question. The standard value is a capitalised income value determined by the tax offices for tax assessment purposes. The contribution basis is a percentage of the standard value of the agricultural/forestry holding and represents a flat-rate \u2018notional\u2019 monthly income from the agricultural/forestry holding. However, the person working the holding can also apply to have the social insurance contribution basis determined on the basis of the actual income tax assessment. BE Les cotisations repr\u00e9sentent principalement un pourcentage des revenus professionnels. Le pourcentage varie en fonction de la cat\u00e9gorie de cotisant et de la tranche de revenu du cotisant.

CY Contributions to the social security scheme are proportional to insurable earnings. The total contribution for self-employed workers is 15.6% of insurable earnings. Of this amount, 11.6% is paid by self-employed workers themselves and 4% is paid by the State. For each occupational category, there is a mandatory minimum amount of insurable earnings. However, self-employed workers are entitled to pay contributions based on a higher amount of insurable earnings, up to the maximum amount. If the actual income of self-employed workers is lower than the minimum amount for the relevant occupational category, they are then entitled, on request, to pay contributions based on their actual income. DE Self-employed persons pay the normal monthly contribution irrespective of their actual earnings (the exceptions are marine pilots, home-workers, coastal mariners and coastal fishers). They can also pay lower or higher contributions if they can prove that their income sufficiently deviates from the norm. During the first three calendar years following the start of their self-employed status, they only pay half the normal contribution, but this can be increased to the full contribution. Provision is made to protect farmers in their old age by requiring them to pay uniform contributions not based on income. The contribution amount is based on the relationship between contributions paid in and benefits paid out under the statutory pension schemes (the Government makes up any shortfall). Where necessary, farmers\u2019 contributions may be subsidised depending on their income. The amount the self-employed pay in contributions to the professional associations\u2019 pension schemes is primarily based on the type of professional work they do and on their income. In the case of statutory occupational accident insurance, the regulations of the relevant occupational accident insurance fund prescribe the amount of annual earnings that serves as the basis for determining the contributions paid by the self-employed, who may be either 1) persons insured by law 2) employers and their spouses insured in accordance with the regulations of the occupational accident insurance fund or 3) persons insured on a voluntary basis. The regulations must provide persons insured by law and those insured in accordance with the regulations with the opportunity to upgrade their insurance. Under farmers\u2019 occupational accident insurance, the amount of the annual earnings of farming entrepreneurs and their spouses on which contributions are chargeable is laid down by law. Under certain circumstances, the regulations of the various farmers\u2019 occupational accident funds can set higher or lower contributions. ",
        "EN 88 EN In the case of persons who pay unemployment insurance on a voluntary basis, the income subject to contributions is 25 per cent of the monthly reference figure (section 345b Title III Social Code). In 2007, the income subject to contributions in the case of persons who voluntarily participate in a statutory health insurance scheme was \u20ac3562.50 per month; a person\u2019s contribution is determined by multiplying this figure by the percentage rate set by the health insurance fund in question (the average for 2007 was 13.9+0.9 per cent). If a person proves that he/she is earning less than the above amount, his/her actual earnings will represent the income on which contributions are chargeable, whereby the lowest possible amount is \u20ac1 837.50 per month (figure for 2007). Based on this amount, the minimum contribution is about \u20ac250 a month. As from 1 April 2007, the minimum income subject to contributions has been reduced further to \u20ac1225 euros per month for persons in need. To determine whether a person is in need, not only that person\u2019s income is taken into account but also his/her assets and the income of others living together with the person (in a joint household). This rule means that the person saves about \u20ac80 in contributions (now paying about \u20ac170 a month instead of the previous minimum monthly sum of about \u20ac250). Self-employed persons who are insured under a statutory health insurance scheme on a voluntary basis, or who are compulsorily insured in accordance with the new legal provisions for boosting competition in the statutory health insurance system (section 5(1)(13) of Title V of the Social Code), are automatically compulsorily insured under a long-term care insurance scheme. The income on which long-term care contributions are chargeable is the same as for statutory health insurance. The minimum amount for 2007 was thus \u20ac31.24 a month (\u20ac1 837.50 x 1.7 per cent), or \u20ac35.83 a month (\u20ac1 837.50 x 1.95 per cent) for childless persons. Self-employed persons who have taken out private health insurance are compulsorily insured with a private long-term care insurer. The premiums charged for long-term care insurance are subject to certain conditions to ensure that they are socially acceptable. EE In order to be covered by pension and sickness insurance, self-employed persons pay social tax like other workers. The rate of social tax is 33% of a self- employed person\u2019s declared income, of which 20% goes to fund pension insurance and 13% to fund sickness insurance. Minimum and maximum rates are laid down for the calculation of the social tax for self-employed persons. The monthly rate laid down in the national budget for a given financial year may not be less than 75% of the minimum monthly wage set by the Government for 1 July of the previous year. The maximum monthly rate is 15 times the minimum monthly wage set by the Government. EL There are 7 insurance classes for OGA Fund contributions (agriculture), and the level of contributions is calculated based on these classes.

FI Under the Employees\u2019 Pension Act (TyEL), a self-employed person\u2019s pension contribution is set at the level of the average TyEL pension contribution. A rebate is granted to farmers, so that the average farmer\u2019s contribution is about half that of an employee\u2019s. The occupational pension contribution is calculated as a percentage of earnings. Self-employed persons and farmers can themselves, within certain limits, decide on the income level they insure. The contributions of employees or self-employed persons aged 53 and above are higher than those of younger persons. This finances the higher pension accrual rate in the final years of working life. Entrepreneurs pay a mandatory 1.24% sickness insurance contribution on their annual earned income, which is used to finance the pharmaceutical costs of outpatient treatment as a result of illness and expenses arising from the use of private medical services, plus a 0.81% daily payment, which pays for sickness allowance and maternal, paternal and parental leave. The State and municipal taxes paid by entrepreneurs are also used to fund public municipal health care services covering the whole population, on which the Finnish health care system is essentially based. Entrepreneurs do not pay the unemployment insurance contribution. The basic unemployment allowance is tax-financed. Entrepreneurs can take out optional additional insurance to obtain an earnings-related (i.e. linked to income level) daily unemployment benefit \u2014 as can employees. If they so wish, entrepreneurs can join the entrepreneurs\u2019 unemployment fund. The earnings-related share of the daily unemployment benefit is financed in full by entrepreneurs\u2019 own contributions, i.e. by the members\u2019 contributions to the unemployment fund.

When paying social insurance contributions, self-employed persons must comply with the minimum and maximum bases for social insurance contributions established in Cabinet Regulation No 193 of 6 June 2000 \u2018on the minimum and maximum bases for social insurance contributions\u2019. MT There are four categories of social security contributions for employees and self-employed workers: those who earn up to \u20ac8 446 per year pay a fixed social security contribution of \u20ac24.37 per week; workers who earn from \u20ac8 449 up to \u20ac16 417 per year pay social security contributions equivalent to 15% of their total pay per week; those who earn more than \u20ac16 420 per year pay a fixed social security contribution of \u20ac47.38 per week; while those workers who are not self-employed and earn from \u20ac1 004 up to \u20ac6 986 per year pay a social security contribution of \u20ac20.17 per week. NL The contributions of self-employed workers towards their state old-age and survivors\u2019 pensions are income-dependent. The amount of the contribution for the voluntary continuation of state sickness and disability insurance is based on the insured amount, subject to a ceiling (the \u2018full daily wage\u2019). Where former employees opt to continue contributing to a pension fund, they must pay the full contribution themselves, even in cases where part of that contribution was formerly paid by the employer (as part of the worker\u2019s terms and conditions of employment). PL Social protection contributions for persons pursuing a non-agricultural activity are calculated as a percentage of the contribution calculation base. The calculation base for retirement and disability pension contributions for persons pursuing non-agricultural activities is the income declared by these persons, but no lower than 60% of the average monthly wage for the previous quarter. The calculation base for sickness and accident social security contributions for persons pursuing a non-agricultural activity is the calculation base for retirement and disability pension contributions.

The declared monthly income may not be less than the minimum gross guaranteed national wage. As regards insurance contributions to the public pension scheme, there are special rules for self-employed workers. Under the rules, contributions are borne entirely by the insured person and rates vary according to working conditions as follows: normal working conditions \u2014 29%; difficult working conditions \u2014 34%; special working conditions \u2014 39%. The calculation is based on declared monthly income. As regards insurance contributions to the health insurance scheme, the monthly contribution of an insured person is set at a rate of 6.5%, which applies to the taxable income of a self-employed person paying income tax. If that income is the sole income upon which the contribution is calculated, the contribution may not be less than the minimum gross national monthly wage. The contribution is paid on a quarterly basis. SK The assessment basis for a self-employed worker subject to mandatory sickness insurance and pension insurance is half the proportional amount of the income tax basis for natural persons pursuing a business or other self-employed activity. The proportional amount of the tax basis is the amount corresponding to one calendar month of pursuing the business or other self-employed activity. Depending on the assessment of the start of mandatory sickness and pension insurance and the amount of the assessment basis, a self-employed worker is required to submit a tax return statement to the competent office (according to the place of residence) by 30 June of the calendar year.

CY The employment of a spouse in a self-employed worker\u2019s business, where he/she carries out the same or similar tasks, is recognised as insurable. DE The important role played by farmers\u2019 wives in agricultural holdings is recognised under the farmers\u2019 old-age protection schemes, especially by the fact that they enjoy protection in their own right \u2014 this new protection was at the heart of the agrarian social reform of 1995. An assisting spouse is insured in the same way as the farmer. With regard to unemployment insurance, there are no special rules for assisting spouses or other persons employed by a member of their family beyond those that apply to all other employees. They require mandatory insurance under the same conditions as all other employees, and if they become redundant they may claim employment-promotion benefits. The deciding factor here is whether a genuine agreement underlies the work in question, and whether such work is actually done, or whether it is merely a case of a relative helping out the family. If the following criteria are fulfilled, this would suggest than the job is subject to mandatory insurance: there is a written employment contract, the family member is integrated within the business in the same way as an employee from outside the family, he/she carries out work as agreed, the employer has the authority to give orders to the family member (even if in a milder form), the family member receives appropriate remuneration for the work done, the family member pays income tax, and the family member\u2019s remuneration is entered in the accounts as operating expenditure.

LV The social insurance contributions of the spouse of a self-employed person are calculated by multiplying the base for voluntary contributions by the rate defined for the spouse of a self-employed person. This rate is determined according to the forms of social insurance for which the spouse of the self-employed worker pays contributions (the rate of social insurance contributions and its breakdown by type of social insurance is determined each year by the Cabinet of Minsters). When making social insurance contributions, the spouse of a self-employed person must comply with the minimum and maximum bases for social insurance contributions. MT The social security contribution is calculated according to the assisting spouse\u2019s salary. The spouse often chooses to be considered as an employed worker, where his/her contribution is then equal to 10% of his/her basic pay (another 10% is paid by the employer); while if the spouse chooses to be considered as a self-employed worker, the social security contribution would be equal to 15% of his/her net work income.

In the past five years, the number of self-employed workers with cover was approximately 100 000, including farmers, out of a total number of approximately 2 million eligible persons. For this reason, the Ministry of Employment, the Family and Equal Opportunities is seeking to increase the number of self-employed workers who register for cover, and regards this process as crucial for the long-term sustainability of the public pension scheme. Failure in this area could lead to the development of a two-tier system, in which those who have insured themselves during a period of professional activity obtain adequate pensions upon retirement, whereas a large proportion of the elderly will depend on social assistance, resulting in the need for unanticipated transfers of income for the elderly in the future.

MT Maintaining the status quo would present advantages and disadvantages. Under the current system, the assisting spouse has the right to choose whether or not to pay social security contributions in order to be covered under the social security scheme. The fact that Malta\u2019s social security scheme (in line with the Directive) leaves the choice to join the insurance scheme up to the assisting spouse (where he/she is participating in the business) offers some flexibility to both spouses in the management of the business. Among other things, this flexibility results in less expenses for the business and more profit, from which both spouses will benefit, or, where the assisting spouse chooses to enter the social security scheme, the benefit of being covered for one of the contingencies mentioned in question 2.2. On the other hand, if assisting spouses choose not to insure themselves, this means that they would have no social security rights apart from those deriving from the spouse\u2019s insurance, which primarily covers the payment of the widows\u2019 pension. Assisting spouses often choose not to insure themselves in order not to increase the business\u2019s expenses. This means that assisting spouses would remain financially dependent on the business\u2019s owner. Moreover, in the event of bankruptcy, death, separation or abandonment by their husband/wife, they can have no right to that business and are therefore at risk of social exclusion, poverty and dependence on other systems of optional benefits. NL The Netherlands believes that the current Directive works well, partly because it is worded in a manner that allows the Member States to take account of national conditions and provide the type of social protection best suited to the particular circumstances of the self-employed. PL Potential amendments to the law intended to support a pro-family policy should concentrate on making such solutions more popular, which would enable persons bringing up children to reconcile family life and career obligations.

        "EN 112 EN Annex II: Consultation of the European social partners 1. The seminar The Commission departments held a seminar on 7 March 2008 with European social partners on the review of Directive 86/613/EEC. The following organisations were present: EFFAT (European Federation of Food, Agriculture and Tourism), COPA/COGECA (Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations), CEC (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration europ\u00e9enne des cadres), EUROCHAMBRES (Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry), EUROCOMMERCE (Retail, Wholesale and International Trade Sectors in Europe), UEAPME (European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises), CESI (European Confederation of Independent Trade Unions), HOTREC (Hotels, Restaurants, Caf\u00e9s and Similar Establishments in Europe), ETUC (European Trade Union Confederation). During the seminar, the European social partners gave their views on the possible direction of an initiative concerning Directive 86/613/EEC. The views of the social partners can be summarised as follows: UEAPME stressed the lack of knowledge about women entrepreneurship and assisting spouses. Because of the absence of statistics on both groups, it was difficult to say whether a review of the Directive would be beneficial or not. UEAPME underlined that the Directive currently covers two very different types of persons (the self-employed and assisting spouses), with totally different legal situations and needs. COPA/COGEPA views positively an initiative to review the Directive, since every woman should get a set of minimum rights to social protection. Nevertheless, it also underlined the lack of information preventing a clear overview of the situation, notably in terms of costs. EFFAT congratulated the Commission on the initiative to revise Directive 86/613/EEC. According to this trade union, women in agriculture and other sectors were frequently left without any social protection in cases of divorce, for instance. EFFAT also recognises the lack of reliable statistics and contests the accuracy of certain statistics on women in the agricultural sector. HOTREC started by saying that family businesses with assisting spouses were very common in its sector. Although HOTREC had no time to consult its members, it mentioned that as the legislation dates back to \u201986 and there have since been important changes in society, there could be a case for reviewing the Directive. HOTREC underlined that legislation alone would not bring about change and bridge the gender gap in terms of entrepreneurship. EUROCHAMBRES, like other organisations, had no time to consult their members and therefore had only received replies from two national associations (from DE and UK). Both seem very sceptical about the need to modify the Directive and to \u2018extend employees\u2019 rights to the self-employed\u2019. In both cases, national legislation has gone beyond what is required by the Directive and both regard the extension of employees\u2019 rights as problematic for small companies. CEC explained that the organisation represents employed executives and managerial staff but is interested in this issue, since some of their members have been or will be engaged in self-employed activities. CESI sent a written contribution on the issue before the seminar. It underlines that the main objective of the review should be to give the self-employed and assisting spouses social protection in their own name. The costs of such a move could be offset by tax benefits. CESI also mentions that, in order to bridge the gender gap in terms of entrepreneurship, the revised Directive should provide for positive action, notably on access to finance. ",
        "EN 113 EN ETUC is in favour of a review of the Directive, but stressed that it needs more time to collect the views of their members. Following the seminar, UEAPME and HOTREC sent written contributions to the Commission. UEAPME recognises the importance of equal treatment between men and women and that this particular Directive appears to concern women to a very great extent. Evidently, female entrepreneurship needs to be encouraged particularly in view of the gender gap in entrepreneurial activities. With women currently representing 60% of graduates in Europe, UEAPME agrees that this untapped source of entrepreneurship needs to be better utilised. UEAPME warns against the risk of trying to apply the same rights to employees and to the self- employed. It regrets the absence of reliable statistics, especially on the situation in the new Member States, and believes that further regulation at EU level is questionable, as the Directive covers a wide range of laws including marital law, company law, tax and fiscal law, as well as different social protection and social security systems, which very often fall under the exclusive competence of the Member States. According to UEAPME, it is difficult to evaluate the exact correlation between social security benefits and starting up businesses as the situation varies among Member States. There clearly needs to be a balance to allow for business creation and flexibility and in particular not to create overly heavy burdens on new businesses, which by definition are micro-companies. On assisting spouses, UEAPME completely supports the idea of full recognition of their contribution to the family business. This acknowledges in particular their often greater responsibility and higher economic contribution to the family business compared to \u2018normal\u2019 employees. However, this does not necessarily call for the same level of social protection as for the self-employed. UEAPME calls for an in-depth impact assessment before any decision is taken which will have a financial impact on micro-businesses and the self-employed. Nevertheless, it considers that there is no need to review the Directive. Member States should be called upon to ensure better implementation of the current Directive and to create more supportive conditions. For its part, the Commission should contribute to better information and awareness-raising through specific campaigns. HOTREC is of the opinion that many of the challenges faced by the self-employed and assisting spouses are practical, not legislative in nature. Therefore, a revision of this Directive will not help to solve them. Moreover, according to HOTREC, because the issues are linked to national social protection systems, they should be dealt with at Member State level, respecting the principle of subsidiarity. Thus, HOTREC considers that there is no need to revise the Directive. In conclusion, some organisations voiced their doubts on the need to review the Directive and on the suitability of using it to reduce the gender gap in entrepreneurship. Most of the consulted organisations stressed the lack of information on the current state of play and the short period for proper consultation of their members. The need to strike the right balance between improved protection and costs was mentioned frequently as the challenge for this initiative. 2. Written consultation On 30 April 2008, DG EMPL sent a letter to the European social partners asking their views on the envisaged content of a proposal to update Directive 86/613/EEC. DG EMPL asked social partners the following questions: (i) Do you consider that there is a need for further action concerning Directive 86/613/EEC? If you consider action to be necessary, should such action be undertaken at Community level? ",
        "EN 114 EN (ii) What are the main areas in which improvements could be needed, taking into consideration in particular: 1) improving protection in the case of maternity for both self-employed women and assisting spouses; 2) extending social protection to assisting spouses; 3) recognising the work of assisting spouses; 4) providing leave to care for family members? (iii) How can the best balance be struck between the costs and benefits of measures aimed at improving the application of the principle of equal treatment between women and men to self- employed workers and assisting spouses? In particular, do you consider that increased protection of self-employed women and assisting spouses would impact negatively on the contributions paid by the self-employed to social security schemes and therefore on the viability of family businesses? The following organisations replied to the consultation: \u2013 CESI (European Confederation of Independent Trade Unions) \u2013 UEAPME (European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) \u2013 COPA (Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations in the EU) Their views can be summarised as follows. CESI On question (i) CESI is in favour of a review of Directive 86/613/EEC. In order to obtain the same level of protection for the self-employed and assisting spouses, common, EU-wide goals and measures are required. At the same time, when integrating these goals and measures within the recast Directive, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Directive can be successfully implemented within the national social systems of each of the Member States only if the latter are given sufficient room for manoeuvre in the way they put the Directive into practice. On question (ii) CESI feels action is needed to improve protection in the early stages of parenthood. A key problem here is the fact that the labour provided by the spouse who helps his/her partner must be replaced for a certain period. Here, the extra financial burden of hiring a relief worker must not fall on the parents. Especially when one considers that self-employed people and assisting spouses often receive no or few state benefits to compensate for their lack of income, this added financial burden ought to be funded as an independent benefit by the social security systems. Redressing the financial balance in this fashion would lead to both revaluation and greater recognition of the work done by people who work alongside their spouses. Any problems in translating the work done by the workers in question into financial amounts could be eliminated by providing flat-rate sums on the basis of the qualifications needed to do the job and the scale of the work. Thought might also be given to carrying out a needs analysis based on self-evaluation. CESI takes the view that independent social security for spouses working with their partners must be all-encompassing and include all areas, particularly health care, care insurance, old-age cover and unemployment. CESI sees a clear need for action here in recasting Directive 86/613/EEC and stresses that independent social security for all family members is necessary for each individual to flourish, and, as such, is a crucial component of human dignity. In order for these demands to be met at Member State level, however, the diversity of the Member States\u2019 social systems must be sufficiently acknowledged in the new Directive. ",
        "EN 115 EN CESI feels that the primary motivation for recasting Directive 86/613/EEC lies in the desire to recognise the work done by spouses working with their partners. Independent social protection is the first step towards valuing and recognising the work performed by spouses working with their partners and, at the same time, provides the basis for society to recognise this work as proper and equal work. A further step along this road might involve thinking about including access to training and further training for assisting spouses in legislation to the same extent as for dependent employees. CESI would like to stress that demographic change is also making the matter of care for family members an increasingly pressing issue. Action must be taken on this issue in reworking Directive 86/613/EEC. As with the issue of parents, the problem here lies in bringing in support staff and the financial burden that this entails. In addition to the comments under (ii)(1), it should be stressed that it is harder to anticipate and thus provide for situations prompted by an ill relative suddenly being in need of care. This sudden and, at times, short-term need for help can therefore only be met by equally speedy support to redress the added financial pressures. In smaller family businesses in particular, the funds are often not available in advance. This is why CESI considers it necessary for the Directive to provide for immediate, short-term financial support where needed. On question (iii) Although a high level of social security cannot be realised without spending extra money, social security nevertheless embodies a social value that exceeds its monetary value. Especially where the equal treatment of the self-employed and assisting spouses are concerned, added financial pressures must not be used to explain away persistent discrimination. To this extent, the present practice under Directive 86/613/EEC of making voluntary contributions to social security systems has not been a success. Therefore, CESI feels that the Commission should focus on reflecting on how a balance can be struck between the burden borne by the worker and that borne by the state security systems. Here, CESI stresses that, by providing independent social protection for the self-employed and assisting spouses, the burden on the state social security systems as a whole would be spread equally. Such a measure would also do away with state transfers that might be needed when the person in question has insufficient cover. With the money saved, we might then ease the demands on individual companies where required. At the same time, the way these kinds of measures to redress the balance are implemented should initially be decided at the level of the Member States, in order to guarantee optimum implementation taking into account the differences between the various national social security systems. Above and beyond the questions posed by the Commission, CESI would like to point out once again that social security can only be a first, albeit important, step in promoting the cause of women on the path towards self-employment and setting up companies. Additional measures addressing, among other things, the problem of bogus self-employment and the establishment of a supportive loans system specifically geared towards women founding their own business are also called for if we want to achieve the goal of equal opportunities. At the same time, a support programme should accompany the implementation of a new Directive 86/613/EEC, both to establish the database called for by all who participated in the seminar and to raise awareness and inform the women and business owners concerned. UEAPME On question (i) There are clearly insufficient quantitative and qualitative data to discuss effectively the implementation of the Directive and make recommendations for both groups of persons covering all ",
        "EN 116 EN 27 EU Member States. The last report of the European Commission on the 1986 directive was in 1994 and only gives data on 12 Member States. Overall, however, there appears to be scope for improvement at national level to support the self- employed and assisting spouses in entrepreneurship, which could easily be undertaken without revision of the Directive. The current legal framework in place does not need to be modified in order to bring about changes at national level for both the self-employed and assisting spouses. Moreover, the Directive mainly deals with subjects that fall within the exclusive competence of the Member States, such as marital law, company law, tax and fiscal law, as well as different social protection and social security systems. In all these areas, the principle of subsidiarity must be respected. On question (ii) For the self-employed, UEAPME cannot support any provision for compulsory leave as this very much interferes with entrepreneurial choice and independence. In the case of maternity leave some countries provide assistance in the form of a temporary replacement worker, others do not, but the decision lies once again with the Member States. There clearly are practical problems for self-employed women: e.g. in Finland, self-employed women already have a right to maternity leave, but cannot afford to take it in full because of the problems caused by being absent from the business. In this particular case, formal revision of the Directive would not help. UEAPME takes note of the EIM study on business creation, which suggests a positive influence of social security on \u2018opportunity-based entrepreneurship\u2019 when the differences between entrepreneurship and alternative types of employment are very small in terms of their social security position. In the case of women, it can be assumed that the existence or absence of protection in the event of maternity, for example, would be a factor to consider. This is an aspect that would need to be discussed at Member State level, taking national specificities into account. Regarding assisting spouses, this group of persons has in some Member States better maternity protection than the self-employed. Again, this is an issue that needs to be decided nationally taking into account the wide range of laws affected. In other Member States, assisting spouses also have better social protection in general than the self- employed. Again, this is an issue that needs to be decided nationally considering the wide range of laws affected. Minimum social security coverage should be provided. UEAPME completely supports the idea of full recognition for the contribution of assisting spouses to the family business. This acknowledges in particular their often greater responsibility and higher economic contribution to the family business compared to \u2018normal\u2019 employees. Provision of leave to care for family members For the self-employed again, the principle of entrepreneurial independence takes precedence. Regarding assisting spouses, this has to be seen within the context of already existing leave provision and supportive measures in individual Member States.

Additional comments Any new possible measures at EU level should not be detrimental to economic growth and job creation. More widely beneficial conditions for business creation should be put in place and any remaining obstacles should be removed. UEAPME would like to call on Member States to ensure better implementation of the current Directive and to create more supportive conditions. COPA Given that Directive 86/613 dates back to 1986, COPA understands the need to update it. Before any changes or adaptations to the Directive are proposed, COPA would like a prior examination of how the Directive is applied in practice in the EU countries. The review proposed should prioritise evidence-gathering. The review should also identify whether shortcomings are found at Member State or pan-EU level.

        "EN 118 EN Annex III: Consultation of other stakeholders The Commission departments drew up, with the assistance of the members of the Steering Group, a list of other stakeholders to consult on the review of the Directive. A letter was sent by DG EMPL on 11 March 2008 to the following organisations: \u2022 Conseil europ\u00e9en des Jeunes Agriculteurs \u2022 Coordination Paysane Europ\u00e9enne \u2022 Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des organisations familiales de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne \u2022 European Women\u2019s Lobby \u2022 Platform of European Social NGOs \u2022 Femmes Chefs d\u2019Entreprises Mondiales \u2022 European Union Women Innovators and Inventors \u2022 The European Network for Promoting Women In order to facilitate processing of the replies, a questionnaire was attached to the letter.

EWL entirely supports the opinion issued by the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men. COFACE strongly advocates revision of Directive 86/613/EEC, along the lines detailed below: \u2022 Improvement of protection in the event of maternity COFACE insists on the need to extend maternity leave to self-employed mothers at EU level. The duration of compulsory maternity leave as specified in Directive 92/85/EEC has as its prime objective the protection of the health of the mother and the child. Self-employed mothers must benefit from the same health protection as other workers. They should be entitled to maternity leave long enough to ensure the proper course of a normal pregnancy and physical recovery of the mother after a normal childbirth. Beyond the period of leave aiming to protect the health of the mother and the child, self- employed mothers should also be entitled to a period of post-natal settling-in leave as part of the measures to reconcile family life and working life. Maternity leave should be covered by social protection. During maternity leave, self-employed mothers should be able to benefit from maternity benefits at least equivalent to the allowance received in the case of sick leave. The absence of such benefits would act as a real disincentive for self-employed women to stop working, to the detriment of their own and their child\u2019s health. Entitlement to maternity leave for self-employed women also implies the organisation of temporary replacement services. These services should be tailored to the diversity of activities exercised by self-employed persons. They should be complementary to maternity benefits. Furthermore, during the settling-in period, self-employed workers and assisting spouses must have the choice between taking the leave and returning to work. This means that they must be able to find suitable replacement services for child care. \u2022 Recognising the contribution of assisting spouses Assisting spouses still suffer from a lack of legal status in many Member States, which leads to specific financial and legal problems, for example in the case of family breakdowns. COFACE therefore urges the Commission to propose amendments of Directive 86/613/EEC to oblige Member States to recognise the contribution of assisting spouses to the family business and to ensure that they benefit from the same level of social protection as the self-employed. Regarding protection in the event of maternity, assisting spouses should be entitled to maternity leave, with a right to maternity benefit and access to temporary replacement services. \u2022 4) Providing leave to care for family members and paternity leave Measures enabling reconciliation of family life and work life, including leave entitlements, are key to encouraging better integration of women in economic activities and supporting families in their desire to have children. This holds true for all workers, whether employed, self-employed or assisting spouses. Moreover, the specific characteristics of self-employment often impose more constraints on the work-life balance. Therefore, any EU legislation providing for reconciliation measures should apply to all workers, while taking into account the specific needs of self-employed workers and assisting spouses. The current parental leave schemes should be made accessible to these categories of workers. Should a right to paternity leave, adoption leave and leave to care for family members be provided at EU level, as supported by COFACE , these schemes should be made available to all workers. Leave entitlements should be accompanied by a right to financial compensation. The level of compensation should be high enough to enable workers to make use of these leave arrangements. Self- ",

        "EN 121 EN Annex IV: Consultation of the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men The Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men was created in 1981 by Commission Decision 36 , as amended. The Advisory Committee assists the Commission in formulating and implementing the Community\u2019s activities aiming to promote equal opportunities for women and men and fosters ongoing exchanges of experiences between Member States and the various parties involved. It comprises representatives of Member States, European social partners and NGOs. ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND MEN Opinion 37 on the revision of Directive 86/613/EEC on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture, in a self- employed capacity, and on the protection of self-employed women during pregnancy and motherhood 38 . Background A Working Group was set up following the decision of the Advisory Committee at its meeting of 16 November 2007 to prepare an opinion on Directive 86/613/EEC. In particular, the working group was asked to consider the following issues: \u2022 How to improve the provisions on the protection of maternity (for the self-employed and assisting spouses) \u2022 How to recognise the work of assisting spouses \u2022 How to provide leave to care for family members and paternity leave \u2022 Any other options for improvement. This Directive was adopted in 1986 and covered 12 EU Member States. Since then, the EU has more than doubled and the Directive has never been revised. The implementation report produced by the Commission in 1994 39 highlighted a number of issues that the Advisory Committee believes are equally relevant today. The main point stressed at the time relates to the failure of the Directive, due to the lack of any obligation on the Member States, to ensure action to clarify the professional status and subsequent social security entitlements of assisting spouses. Transposition of the Directive into national law did not require amended legislation due to the absence of obligations on the Member States. Therefore, women, particularly those engaged in an \u2018assisting\u2019 role in economic activities alongside their male partner (husband or otherwise), continue to remain 36 Commission Decision 82/43/EEC of 9 December 1981 relating to the setting up of an Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men, OJ L 20, 28.1.1982. 37 The opinion of the Advisory Committee does not necessarily reflect the positions of the Member States and does not bind the Member States. 38 OJ L 359, 19.12.1986. 39 Commission of the European Communities, report from the Commission on the implementation of the Council Directive of 11 December 1986 on the application of the principle of equal treatment between women and men engaged in an activity, including agriculture, in a self-employed capacity and on the protection of self-employed women during pregnancy and motherhood (86/613/EEC), COM(94) 163 final, 15.09.1994. ",
        "EN 122 EN outside social protection systems during pregnancy and motherhood and at other moments in the life- cycle (for example retirement, separation, divorce, bankruptcy or death of husband/partner). This concerns women engaged in agriculture and trade 40 and the assisting spouses of other self-employed professionals, including those in the medical professions (self-employed doctors and specialists), the legal profession (self-employed lawyers), self-employed entrepreneurs in the building and construction industry and those in other manual professions where women provide the necessary administrative backup work without either jointly owning and/or being employed by the business. While the Directive establishes the rule that the principle of equal treatment applies to the self- employed and assisting spouses, it does not create any direct right to compulsory social security coverage or to protection in the event of maternity, so the Advisory Committee is of the opinion that the principle of equal treatment is not met. The Directive addresses two categories of workers: firstly, those engaged in self-employed activities and pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, including farmers and the liberal professions, for which not all Member States require compulsory social security protection, and, secondly, the partners or \u2018spouses\u2019 of these self-employed workers, the majority of whom are women, which the Directive acknowledges by reference to the terms \u2018spouse\u2019 and \u2018wife\u2019. The Directive has never been amended nor updated despite the number of directives adopted since 1986 in the area of equality between women and men. Therefore, there is an urgent need not only to update the Directive in order to reflect the reality of the self-employed and assisting spouses but also to ensure that this latter invisible category of workers benefit from equality legislation particularly in matters of social protection, and that the objective of the Directive itself is met by improving the status of assisting spouses in the context of an enlarged EU. \u2022 How to improve the provisions for the protection of maternity (for the self-employed and assisting spouses) It is difficult to ascertain the numbers of women who fall outside social security protection systems. Given the nature of the problem itself and the fact that Member States are not obliged to provide compulsory social security protection, they remain invisible. A lack of data and statistics on the numbers of women who have opted for voluntary coverage as provided for in the Directive, coupled with the lack of data on the actual number of women who could be covered (again on a voluntary basis), impedes identification of the scope of the problem in terms of the overall numbers and percentages of women who are not protected. Therefore, the Advisory Committee strongly insists on the need for more visibility in terms of data and statistics in order to understand the scope of the problem, the take-up rate of the voluntary measures provided for in the Directive and the numbers of women unprotected. The scarce data that do exist show, for example in France 41 , that 91% of those employed in agriculture in 2006 as \u2018assisting spouses\u2019 42 were female, 61 521 women as against 6 121 men. The total number of spouses (all categories) in 2005 43 was 247 000, of which only 28% were affiliated to the social security system. The number of women working as employees has risen an average 1% per year since 1999, with variations according to the production sector. The average hourly wage varied in 2005 between 9- 40 Many assisting spouses work in restaurants or shops owned by their husbands/partners. 41 Commission Nationale des Agricultrices, Assembl\u00e9e G\u00e9n\u00e9rale 13/12/2007 \u00ab L\u2019installation des femmes en agriculture \u00bb. 42 France has created a new category ( conjoint collaborateur ) for spouses of self-employed workers, but they must voluntarily opt for this status. 43 Sant\u00e9, famille, retraite, services , Direction des \u00e9tudes, des r\u00e9pertoires et des statistiques, \u00ab Les femmes dans l\u2019agriculture en 2005 \u00bb, d\u00e9cembre 2007.

Women farmers represented one quarter of the total number in 2005, and this figure has remained stable since 1999. 45 Data from the Netherlands 46 reveal that 97% of assisting spouses have no social protection. However, new legislation expected to come into force in July 2008 will grant a replacement income to female entrepreneurs for maternity leave. 47 In 2006, Portugal 48 had 90 000 \u2018non-remunerated family workers\u2019, 62.7% of whom were women. This category of workers had the highest proportion of women compared with the other categories: \u2018employed\u2019, \u2018self-employed\u2019 and \u2018employers\u2019. Given the absence of data, the Advisory Committee urgently calls for reliable data and statistics from all Member States to provide a more accurate picture of the situation of assisting spouses, including the numbers of women with and without social security protection. The compilation of such data will necessitate the compulsory registration of assisting spouses in all Member States. The Advisory Committee stresses that it is regrettable that self-employed workers do not have compulsory social protection cover in all Member States. The Advisory Committee, however, strongly advises that those Member States where social protection is compulsory for-self employed workers should provide automatic cover for assisting spouses under existing systems. The Advisory Committee wishes to point out there are a number of underlying contradictions in assisting spouses continuing to be without social protection. Firstly, the cost factor needs to be considered within a broader economic framework. Assuming that it is too costly to provide mandatory cover for assisting spouses in social security protection schemes is in fact a false \u2018saving\u2019. Many women not covered by social protection systems while engaged alongside their male partner in self- employed activities, including agriculture, often require financial assistance in the form of payments from collective solidarity funds later in their lives due to the fact that they have made no contributions to social security systems and are therefore excluded from state pensions and other complementary forms of pension schemes. For example, in France, in the area of agriculture, the average monthly pension paid to assisting spouses who have contributed to social security systems represents \u20ac304.94/month as against \u20ac147.85/month for widows on the basis of derived rights. For the category \u2018family members\u2019, which includes women who do not opt for \u2018assisting spouse\u2019 status, the monthly pension based on direct rights (contributions paid) is \u20ac60.08/month. 49 The \u2018savings\u2019 that are made earlier in their lives in fact represent a cost for the whole of society later in life, hence shifting the financial burden from economic activities throughout working life to compensation paid at minimal levels later in life. This contributes to the feminisation of poverty in old age, due to the excessively low levels of non-contributory pension schemes. Rendering compulsory social protection coverage for the self-employed and \u2018assisting spouses\u2019 should therefore be considered as a long-term investment that will contribute to ensuring a safety net of coverage particularly in the later stages of life. 44 Op. cit. 45 It should also be noted that the general level of women\u2019s entrepreneurship across the EU remains stagnant at 30%. 46 Provided by the Women\u2019s Committee of COPA (Beleidsadviseur Vrouw & Bedrijf/Internationale Samenwerking). 47 The replacement income for a period of 16 weeks will be based on the equivalent of the minimum wage on the basis of 1225 hours/year worked. For women who have less than the required number of hours, a basic payment based on the previous year\u2019s income will be provided. 48 Portuguese Inquiry on Employment \u2014 average data for 2006, provided by Isabel Rom\u00e3o Coordenatora da Unidade para as Rela\u00e7\u00f5es Internacionais. 49 Groupe de travail \u2014 retraite minist\u00e8re agriculture 120308 \u2014 Statistiques 2007 Mutuelle Sociale Agricole (MSA). ",
        "EN 124 EN Another contradiction that the Advisory Committee wishes to point out relates to the issue of undeclared work. All employers condemn any form of undeclared or illegal work. However, the non- binding registration and protection of assisting spouses can be seen as an endorsement of work that is carried out in the informal economy and can be deemed as a form of illegal work. \u2022 How to recognise the work of assisting spouses Assisting spouses are part of the informal economy and their contribution to economic growth and development is invisible and unknown. It is the view of the Advisory Committee that compulsory registration of assisting spouses is urgently required to avoid loopholes in valuing the work and the real contribution of these invisible workers. Compulsory registration should also \u2014 while respecting the principle of subsidiarity \u2014 lead to compulsory social security protection with the possibility of a voluntary opt-out clause, and not the contrary as is currently the case with the Directive. Such compulsory coverage should include income replacement during maternity leave following pregnancy at a level decided by Member States, for example, where possible, at the rate equivalent to the national minimum wage. In situations of separation, divorce and/or widowhood, the assisting spouse should be entitled to either claim benefits immediately (widowhood for example) or to carry the contributions with her so that these are counted as contributory years, particularly towards the pension. Without the vital input of assisting spouses, there is a strong likelihood that self-employed activities would not be sustained, whether within agriculture or in any other area of self-employment. Therefore, given that the majority of assisting spouses are women, maintaining them in the informal economy should be considered as a form of indirect gender discrimination, which is contrary to the EU\u2019s objective of equality between women and men and contrary to Article 3 of the Directive itself, which specifically mentions \u2018 [..] the absence of all discrimination [..] directly or indirectly, by reference in particular to marital or family status .\u2019 Since the Directive was adopted in 1986, socio-cultural norms have also changed. It is therefore the opinion of the Advisory Committee that the Directive needs to reflect these changes by including, alongside the terms \u2018wife\u2019 and \u2018marital status\u2019, references to non-married and same-sex couples. Many Member States recognise unmarried couples while others recognise same-sex relationships (including marriage), so the Directive should refer to these in recognition of their contribution to the economic sustainability of self-employed activities, including in agriculture. While the scope of the Directive does not address issues of equality in ownership, it is the view of the Advisory Committee that this issue should be further explored in the context of national legislation. By recognising legal ownership by one of the partners only, the assisting partner remains either invisible or, in cases where they opt for employee status, are in a relationship that is both intimate and subservient, which goes against one of the intended objectives of the Directive, which is to clarify the particular situation of assisting spouses. The \u2018particular situation\u2019 in this context should be understood as a partnership that extends beyond economic gains and contributes to the well-being of the two adults of the partnership and their off-spring. Derived rights are not, in the view of the Advisory Committee, an option due to the dependency factor, where women\u2019s rights are derived from those of their husband/partner, which is contrary to the principle of equality between women and men. In relation to derived rights the term \u2018dependent person\u2019 is used. \u2022 How to provide leave to care for family members and paternity leave The nature of self-employment, including in agriculture, entails atypical working times and patterns where the division between work time and rest time is often blurred. In this context, existing child care and dependant care structures, which are generally insufficient in most Member States as testified in ",
        "EN 125 EN the reporting on the Barcelona targets for child care 50 , are unlikely to respond to the specific needs of combining self-employment with family life. Therefore, the Advisory Committee proposes that further initiatives be taken, including possibilities for financial compensation, to provide care facilities corresponding to the particular areas of activity and working patterns of the self-employed and their assisting spouses/unmarried partners. The level of the benefit could be the legal minimum wage, unless the actual earnings are less than that amount The Advisory Committee believes that future decisions on new measures concerning maternity leave for self-employed workers and assisting spouses/unmarried partners living as a couple should take into consideration the outcome of the current consultations between the social partners on measures to reconcile professional, family and private life. Some Member States do not believe that there should be further EU legislation in the area of maternity/paternity/parental leave. The majority of the Advisory Committee believes that any new and amended measures in directives should also apply to self-employed workers and assisting spouses/unmarried partners living as a couple and that the principle of two weeks leave after childbirth, as in other forms of maternity leave, should also apply to self-employed workers and assisting spouses. The Advisory Committee also proposes that the Structural Funds be used to fund pilot and innovative projects for childcare/dependent persons care to cater to the needs and working patterns of the self- employed, which require more flexible forms of replacement and care services. Any other options for improvement The Advisory Committee proposes that action be taken to ensure that the costs of compulsory social security protection for both self-employed workers and assisting spouses/unmarried partners living as a couple are covered. In the context of a rapid changing economy, self-employment will continue to grow and expand and assisting spouses/partners will continue to play a vital role in sustaining businesses and adapting to changing economic environments. Therefore, it is crucial that self-employed workers and assisting spouses/unmarried partners are provided with opportunities to remain competitive, notably through training opportunities and representation in professional organisations. The Advisory Committee believes that the Member States have an important role to play in facilitating this and in ensuring the visibility of the self-employed and their assisting spouses/unmarried partners. The Advisory Committee recommends that: A. Legal Aspects \u2014 EU legislation 1. Assisting spouses are given every possibility to acquire a clear professional status. 2. Compulsory registration of assisting spouses is systematically carried out, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity, to ensure social security protection with the possibility of a voluntary opt-out clause. 3. In addition to the terms \u2018wife\u2019 and \u2018marital status\u2019, \u2018unmarried partner living as a couple\u2019 and \u2018same-sex couples\u2019 should be added. 4. Assisting spouses are given every possibility to be covered under existing systems in Member States where compulsory social protection is in place for self-employed workers. 50 The report on the 2007 Cambridge Review of the National Reform Programmes, EMCO/27/141107/EN-Final-rev1, states that the Barcelona targets are not met by most Member States.

Financial compensation should be made available for the self-employed and their assisting spouses to enable them to find suitable replacement services for child and dependent person care. 6. Provision for paid maternity/paternity leave should be made available to the self-employed and assisting spouses, on the same basis as for other employers and employees, in accordance with national laws, practices and traditions. B. Non-legal aspects 1. Reliable data and statistics, based on homogeneous criteria for data collection, are available in all Member States. The compilation of such data will necessitate the compulsory registration of assisting spouses in all Member States. 2. While the scope of the Directive does not cover equality in ownership, this issue should nevertheless be further explored in the context of national legislation. 3. The Structural Funds should be used to fund projects for childcare/dependent persons care, particularly in rural areas. 4. Access to training opportunities and professional representation is facilitated as a means to remain competitive. C. Other actions as appropriate. Under the Treaty establishing the European Community, income taxes are not subject to harmonisation, with the exception of those cases where it is necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market and compliance with the Treaty freedoms. In full recognition of the principle of subsidiarity in matters relating to taxation, the Advisory Committee nevertheless proposes that, in the context of national legislation on taxation, possibilities for tax incentives should be explored at national level to ensure that the costs of compulsory social security protection for both self-employed workers and assisting spouses/unmarried partners living as a couple are covered. The opinion of the Advisory Committee does not necessarily reflect the positions of the Member States and does not bind the Member States ",
        "EN 127 EN Annex V: Legal context The main primary legal base for legislation implementing the principle of equal treatment is Article 141 EC (former Article 119). In the original Treaty of Rome, Article 119 was not applicable to self-employed workers. This was recognised by the established case law of the European Court of Justice 51 . This situation changed with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty. The new paragraph 3 of Article 141 EC now applies to \u2018matters of employment and occupation\u2019 and therefore covers self-employed workers. Because of this limitation in the scope of Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, the legal texts adopted under this basis before the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty do not cover the self-employed. This is the case notably with the first two directives adopted on equal treatment between women and men: Directive 75/117/EEC 52 on the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women and Directive 76/2077/EEC 53 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion and working conditions. Nevertheless, three Directives adopted before the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force also apply to self-employed workers, namely Directives 79/7/EEC, 86/378/EEC and Directive 86/613/EEC. In all these cases, the residual legal basis concerning the internal market was used: Article 235 in the case of Directive 79/7/EEC and Articles 100 and 235 for the other two Directives. After the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, the self-employed were included in the scope of Directives 2002/73/EC 54 and 2006/54/EC 55 . Finally, another recent Directive is relevant to the self-employed, although it does not directly concern them: Directive 2004/113/EC 56 . This Directive lays down a framework for combating discrimination based on sex in access to and supply of goods and services. The legal framework for self-employed workers regarding the implementation of the principle of equal treatment between women and men is complex and fragmented. In short, the legal situation can be summarised as follows. Discrimination based on sex is prohibited in the following areas: 51 See for example points 67 and 68 of the Court\u2019s judgment in case C-256/01, Allonby . 52 Council Directive 75/117/EEC of 10 February 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women, OJ L 45, 19.2.1975, p. 19. 53 Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions, OJ L 39, 14.2.1976, p. 40. 54 Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions, OJ L 269, 5.10.2002, p. 15. 55 Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (recast), OJ L 204, 26.7.2006, p. 23. 56 Council Directive 2004/113/EC of 13 December 2004 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services, OJ L 373, 21.12.2004, p. 37.

Member States must eliminate all provisions that are contrary to the principle of equal treatment, especially in respect of the establishment, equipment or extension of a business or the launching or extension of any other form of self-employed activity, including financial facilities. \u2022 Creation of a business : the conditions for the formation of a company between spouses should not be more restrictive than the conditions for the formation of a company between unmarried persons. \u2022 Assisting spouses : should be able to join a contributory social security scheme voluntarily, if it exists, and Member States should examine how to encourage recognition of their work. \u2022 Protection of maternity and motherhood : Member States should examine whether, and under what conditions, female self-employed workers and the wives of self-employed workers may, during interruptions in their occupational activity owing to pregnancy or motherhood, have access to services supplying temporary replacements or existing national social services, or be entitled to cash benefits under a social security scheme or under any other public social protection system.
