        "1. European union 1.1.1. Parliament resolution on the European Council report for 1991 on progress towards European union. Adopted on 11 March. Following its examin\u00ad ation of the European Council report on pro\u00ad gress made towards European union in 1991, Parliament suggested a number of ways in which the process could be speeded up. These include strengthening the democratic control of economic and monetary union, mainly by more transparent decision-making procedures and increased participation by Parliament itself. Stressing the urgent need to ratify the Treaty on European Union, it expressed the view that substantial improvements could be achieved without amending the text of the Treaty, especially as regards the questions of subsidiar\u00ad ity, citizenship and the transparency of the Community legislative process. Parliament also deplored the Council's tendency, when conferring executive powers on the Com\u00ad mission, to make use of committees guarantee\u00ad ing it a particularly broad measure of control over the measures proposed by the Com\u00ad mission. It also called for a clear classification of Community acts and a revision of the insti\u00ad tutions' information policy. As regards the internal market, Parliament deplored the delay in the adoption of certain key proposals, particularly those relating to the free movement of persons. OJ C 115, 26.4.1993 1.1.2. Parliament resolution on the European Council report on progress towards European union. Adopted on 11 March. In the belief that strengthening the Community presence in some parts of the world would make an important contribution to international peace and security and that the action taken in the sphere of external relations and political coop\u00ad eration in 1991 was not sufficiently effective to safeguard the Community's interests, Parlia\u00ad ment feels that full use needs to be made of the instruments contained in the Treaty on European Union. In particular, it considers that foreign and security policy should be included in the Community's terms of refer\u00ad ence, making it subject to fully democratic and controllable decision-making procedures. Parliament also welcomed the reorganization of the Commission to address common foreign and security policy issues in greater depth but believes that the provisions adopted in this field must not be allowed to call into question the existing mechanisms for dealing with the external aspects of Community policies.

COM(93) 80 Economic and monetary policy Economic situation Annual Economic Report 1.2.18. Council Decision adopting the Annual Economic Report for 1993 on the economic situation in the Community and the economic policy guidelines to be followed in the Community in 1993. Commission approval: COM(93) 44; Bull. EC 1/2-1993, point 1.2.38 Economic and Social Committee opinion: Bull. EC 1/2-1993, point 1.2.38 Parliament opinion delivered on 12 March. Par\u00ad liament is concerned about the scale of unem\u00ad ployment in the Community, particularly among the young, and is aware that, without growth-promoting measures to supplement those adopted by the European Council in Edinburgh, unemployment will continue to rise alarmingly. It considers that only a strategy combining sustainable growth, job creation, reductions in social and economic inequalities and reinforcement of monetary stability will be socially acceptable and economically suc\u00ad cessful. Parliament asks the Commission and the Council to recognize that measures to combat unemployment and the recession must be given priority by the public authorities at both Com\u00ad munity and national levels. It calls on them to present a package of measures to stimulate growth and employment as a matter of urgency and puts forward a series of suggestions designed to reinforce the multilateral surveil\u00ad lance procedure, to adjust interest-rate levels to those of the Community's main competitors, to reduce the threat to the competitiveness of European business posed by costs, to improve the European Monetary System with a view to promoting monetary stability in the Com\u00ad munity and to encourage contacts between the G7 countries aimed at establishing inter\u00ad national monetary stability. Parliament emphasizes the importance of the impact of economic activity on the environ\u00ad ment and the need for the legislation relating to the single market to be applied properly. It warns that economic problems could stimulate protectionist reflexes in Member States. It con\u00ad cludes that a sustained high economic growth rate, though necessary, is not on its own suf\u00ad ficient to eliminate unemployment in the medium term and it calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to adopt a rigorous European industrial strategy.

Reference: Council conclusions on national medium-term adjustment programmes: Bull. EC 7/8-1991, point 1.1.2 Adopted by the Council on 15 March. On 15 March 1993 the Council examined and endorsed the Greek programme for economic con\u00ad vergence 1993-98. The Council welcomed the accel\u00ad eration of major structural reforms and fiscal con\u00ad solidation achieved in 1992 and noted that deter\u00ad mined continuation and full implementation would be needed to achieve the targets of the convergence programme. The Greek convergence programme is an ambitious attempt to prepare Greece to meet the conditions necessary for participating in EMU. While recogniz\u00ad ing the optimistic nature of the programme, the 16 Bull. EC 3-1993 ",
        "Economie and monetary policy Council also noted that an ambitious programme was essential in the light of Greece's economic prob\u00ad lems. The Council therefore fully supports the efforts of the Greek Government. Structural reforms and the privatization programme need to be pursued vigorously if the private sector is to achieve the dynamism outlined in the programme. The Council underlined the need to give priority to budgetary consolidation and to ensure the achieve\u00ad ment of the programme targets by effective implementation of measures. In particular, there was a need to increase the efficiency of the tax collection system and to reduce overmanning in the public sector. It noted the commitment of the Greek authorities to take adequate contingency measures to ensure the attainment of the budgetary and inflation targets.'

EC 1/2-1993, point 1.2.40 Second Parliament opinion on the holding of an intergovernmental conference delivered on 12 March. As unanimity among the Member States is required to amend the Protocol on the Statute of the EIB in order to set up the European Investment Fund and as it is there\u00ad fore unnecessary to require unanimity of the Governors of the EIB in order to take an identical decision, Parliament has adopted two amendments to the proposal for an addition to the Protocol: one concerning the adoption of the decision by a majority of the members of the Board of Governors and the other pro\u00ad viding for the addition to enter into force on the date of its ratification by a 'majority of Member States representing 75% of the total population of the European union'. OJC 115,26.4.1993 Intergovernmental conference held, and addition to the Protocol signed, in Brussels on 25 March. The act signed by the representatives of the governments of the Member States adds to the Protocol on the Statute of the EIB an Article 30 empowering the Bank's Board of Governors to create a European Investment Fund (EIF). The article provides inter alia for the statute of the Fund to be adopted by the EIB Board of Governors, for the Bank to participate in the management of the Fund and to contribute to its capital, and for the European Economic Community to become a member of the Fund. The addition will come into force once it has been ratified by all Member States. 1.2.21. Proposal for a Council Decision on Community membership of the European Investment Fund.

OJC 115,26.4.1993 European Monetary System 1.2.22. Economic and Social Committee own-initiative opinion on minimum reserves in the context of the internal market. Adopted on 24 March. The Committee emphas\u00ad izes the importance of minimum reserves for the future attainment of economic and monet\u00ad ary union and subsequently for the single mon\u00ad etary policy and the European System of Cen\u00ad tral Banks. It therefore recommends that the basis for calculating minimum reserves be alig\u00ad ned, that the minimum reserve ratios be reduced in all Member States to 1 to 2% of deposits and that compulsory investments be abolished; this should be done as soon as poss\u00ad ible without waiting for the third stage of mon\u00ad etary union. The Committee argues that these measures would reduce the risks of distortion of competition \u2014 both between Community banks and between Community and third- country banks \u2014 and the danger of any Bull.

OJ C 118, 28.4.1993; COM(93) 76 Results Retailing in the European single market 1993 1.2.29. A new survey published by Eurostat, 'Retailing in the European single market 1993', examines the retail trade and the purchasing habits of consumers in the Community, look\u00ad ing in particular for any convergent trends with the arrival of the single market. One finding is that consumption by households is still very disparate, since there is little product standard\u00ad ization at Community level \u2014 least of all in food, clothing and footwear, where regional differences persist. The survey also points out that 40% of the average household budget in Portugal, Greece and Ireland is spent on food in retail outlets, but less than 20% in Germany, France and Benelux. Similarly, clothing accounts for a high proportion (nearly 10%) of non-food con\u00ad sumption in the Mediterranean countries, while consumers in northern Europe prefer domestic appliances. Expenditure on cars is relatively high (10 to 12.5% of total consump\u00ad tion) in Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany; car ownership ranges from 475 per 1 000 inhabitants in Germany to 125 in Portugal. Ownership of consumer durables (see Table 1) shows certain conver\u00ad gences (in refrigerators and washing machines) between Member States but some big differ\u00ad ences as well (freezers, dishwashers and micro\u00ad wave ovens); 50% of households in the United Kingdom have a microwave, compared with only 19% in Germany and France and 0.3% in Greece. The report stresses that an efficient and mod\u00ad ern distribution network is essential for suc\u00ad cessful European integration and looks at the structure of that network, particularly at changes in the density of sales outlets and their regional distribution, the proportions of part- time and female workers, turnover by size, class and type of retail outlet, cooperation and concentration in the retail trade and inter\u00ad nationalization and diversification strategies. It reveals that the distributive trades (wholesale and retail) employ 19 million persons in the Community (14% of an active population of 133 million), with retailing alone accounting for some 10% of employment in the Com\u00ad munity (13 million). The distributive trades also account for over 30% of the 12.6 million businesses in the Community, the percentage varying widely from one Member State to another \u2014 from some 20% in Denmark and Belgium to 40% in Portugal and Greece. Val\u00ad ue-added in the sector amounts to some 13% of Community GDP (10% for the retail trade alone). The age structure of the population affects the way in which consumers spend their money: all Member States except Ireland are experiencing net ageing of the population, with almost 15% of Community citizens aged over 65. Because of their relative purchasing power, older people are now a key target group for Community retailers. Falling birth rates mean that families are smaller, but the number of households has increased, particularly in northern Europe. One-parent families are now an important factor. Retailers have to adapt their products in response to these trends. Average per capita consumption in the Com\u00ad munity in 1990 was ECU 8 500. There are wide national disparities, however, with indices (Community average = 100) ranging from 57.5 Bull. EC 3-1993 19 ",
        "Statistical area in Portugal to 121.5 in Germany and 121.7 in Luxembourg. Food retailing is way out in front in Denmark at 50.4% of total retail turnover, compared with 20 to 40% elsewhere in the Community. Food cooperatives, which have existed for many years, are still very prominent here, accounting for one fifth of turnover on food; the country has 526 supermarkets and 18 hypermarkets. In Germany, small retailers in the east are struggling to survive in the face of an invasion of large firms from the west. The number of food sales outlets in the east is expected to fall by 43 000 by the year 2000, while turnover will have risen from DM 13 to 14 million (in 1992) to DM 50 million. Greece has 174 retail outlets per 10 000 inhabitants. Portugal has the highest density of retail outlets in the Community, but also the smallest aver\u00ad age size, with 2.1 persons, usually a husband and wife, per outlet. Food and clothing are very prominent, accounting for more than half of total turnover. Spain's retail trade shows contrasting trends: the number of hypermar\u00ad kets \u2014 126 at the last count \u2014 is growing rapidly, with strong foreign investment and high concentrations in tourist regions such as Andalusia, which has 32, while over half of all towns and villages still hold their traditional markets. With over 170 000 stalls managed by 133 000 persons, this form of distribution accounts for 2.5% of retail sales. France has the highest density of hypermarkets at 1.5 per 100 000 inhabitants, followed by Germany and the United Kingdom with 1.3 and the Mediter\u00ad ranean countries with roughly 0.3. In Ireland, public houses and off-licences account for one fifth of all retail outlets (6 570) and 11% of turnover. Italy has the largest number of retail outlets in the Community with nearly a million, as many as France and the United Kingdom put together. Most of these are family busi\u00ad nesses. In the United Kingdom, large-scale retailers, with annual sales of more than UKL 500 million, account for 0.01% of retail businesses, 5% of sales outlets but 40% of turnover. Most of these are food hypermar\u00ad kets. The 10 leading retail sales groups are responsible for 54% of all food sales.

Ericsson will transfer its activities relating to the supply of telecommunications network management products for networks compris\u00ad ing equipment from more than one supplier to a company controlled jointly with Hewlett- Packard. Since Hewlett-Packard is entering the market while Ericsson is withdrawing from it, the Commission took the view that the joint ven\u00ad ture was concentrative and would not pose any problems as regards competition. Sanofi Yves Saint-Laurent 1.2.32. Adopted on 15 March. The decision authorizes the Elf Aquitaine group to acquire control of Yves Saint-Laurent. The merger is not liable to create or strengthen a dominant position, given the combined mar\u00ad ket shares involved and the structural charac\u00ad teristics of the relevant markets. The basic rel\u00ad evant market, which is that for perfumes and luxury beauty products, has a fairly low con\u00ad centration ratio, strong competitors and fairly contestable market positions. On the haute couture market, the merger will not appreciably affect the present situation since only Yves Saint-Laurent is directly involved on it. OJC 89, 31.3.1993 Matra/Cap Gemini Sogeti 1.2.33.

The Commission took account of the fact that, on the French market, which is the only rel\u00ad evant market in this case, the new entity will have a number of strong competitors with size\u00ad able market shares and R&D budgets at least as large as its own. It also took account of the fact that there is only one customer, the French Ministry of Defence, providing a powerful counterweight on the demand side.

This joint acquisition in the treatment of spe\u00ad cial industrial waste, in particular through incineration in cement kilns, will not entail any increase in market shares in respect of the collection, pre-treatment and burial of special industrial waste. As regards the incineration of special industrial waste, RPC and Sita already have a joint subsidiary, Teris, which has not so far started to operate commercially. The takeover will result in only a small increase in capacity, and Scori has strong competitors on the market. OJC 88, 30.3.1993 ECSC Treaty, and the Commission accord\u00ad ingly authorized it. Kingfisher IDarty 1.2.36. Adopted on 22 March. The decision authorizes the acquisition of Darty SA (France) by Kingfisher (United Kingdom). Kingfisher and Darty both retail consumer electrical and electronic goods. On the retail side, the geographical market is local, so that there is no overlap in market shares. As regards relations with suppliers, the acquisition will not concentrate sufficient demand in the hands of Kingfisher and Darty to pose a threat to com\u00ad petition. OJC 87, 27.3.1993 Mannesmann Hoesch Pr\u00e4zisrohr GmbH 1.2.35. Adopted on 17 March. The decision allows Mannesr\u00f6hren-Werke AG and Hoesch AG to set up a joint venture, Mannesmann Hoesch Pr\u00e4zisrohr GmbH, which will take over the production and sale of tubes from the two parent companies. Mannesr\u00f6hren-Werke is controlled by the industrial group Mannesmann AG and is mainly active in the production, finishing and distribution of steel tubes. Hoesch AG, which was recently taken over by Krupp, controls Hoesch Stahl AG, which is one of the largest steel producers in the Community. It is also involved in the manufacture of tubes through its subsidiary Fuchs GmbH, in which Mannes\u00ad mann will take a 50% stake. The new company will produce tubes which it will distribute throughout the Community. The proposed joint venture was examined in the light of Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89; how\u00ad ever, since the semi-finished products used in the manufacture of tubes are hot-rolled strips and tube rounds, which are ECSC products, it also had to be examined under Article 66 of the ECSC Treaty. Examination showed that the joint venture complied with the criteria for safeguarding competition laid down in Article 66(2) of the Fletcher Challenge!Methanex 1.2.37. Adopted on 31 March. The decision authorizes Fletcher Challenge (New Zealand) to acquire joint control of Methanex Corpor\u00ad ation (Canada). The other shareholder exercis\u00ad ing joint control is Metallgesellschaft AG (Ger\u00ad many). Fletcher Challenge will transfer to Methanex its methanol and synthetic fuels activities (in particular, its production centres in New Zea\u00ad land and Chile). As a result, Methanex will become one of the leading producers and dis\u00ad tributors in the world and in the Community. However, since Methanex's market shares are less than 25% in the Community and in view of the structure of supply and the level of imports in the common market, the Com\u00ad mission concluded that the transaction would not result in the creation of a dominant pos\u00ad ition.

Commission decision introducing a system of standardized notifications and annual reports for State aid. Adopted on 24 March. When the Commission receives notifications of State aid, it often has to ask for additional information not included in the notification. So as to reduce as far as possible the number of such requests and thus shorten the time the Commission needs to take a decision, Member States will in future be required to complete a detailed questionnaire specifying clearly the information which the Commission deems necessary for examining aid proposals. On the other hand, Member States will no longer be required to notify amendments to already authorized aid schemes if the only change is a budget increase not exceeding 20% of the budget initially approved. The Commission will require Member States to supply standardized reports for a limited number of major aid schemes, while reports may be less detailed in other cases.

Leinfelde, Thuringia, which was recently acquired by Deggendorf, Bavaria, is investing DM 112 million in the manufacture of polyamide and polyester yarns. The Commission considers that the aid, which has an intensity of 18.3%, could have a negative effect on competition within the Com\u00ad munity that would be accentuated by the fact that Deggendorf has not completely repaid aid granted in 1981 and 1983 and declared incom\u00ad patible with the common market by the Com\u00ad mission.

The German Govern\u00ad ment had an independent valuation carried out on the land at the Postdamer Platz sold to Sony. Even though the valuation found that the value of the land was higher than the price at which it had been sold, the Commission concluded that, taking account of various other factors, notably the conditions accepted by Sony as regards urban development, the difference between the actual sale price and the valuation price, which took account of these factors, was within the normally accepted mar\u00ad gin of fluctuation.

This new decision replaces the 1988 decision annulled by the Court of Justice on the grounds that the Com\u00ad mission had failed to observe the rights of defence of the parties concerned. The Com\u00ad mission requires the UKL 44.4 million illegally paid to British Aerospace to be recovered, to\u00ad gether with interest calculated as from the date on which the principal debt had to be repaid under the national rules in force at the time. The Commission's practice on the payment of interest on aid that has to be repaid has changed since 1991. It now requires interest to be paid as from the date on which the aid was granted.

EC 2-1988, point 2.1.92 Adopted on 12 March. Parliament calls for the EC and ECSC budget resources available and Member States' budget resources to be mobilized to offset the social costs brought about by the restructuring of the steel sector. It stresses that the implementation of accompanying social assistance measures, structural improvements and aid derogations must be made strictly contingent on a firm commitment by the industry to a programme of capacity reductions. It also stresses the importance, following the completion of the Resider programme, of using the Structural Funds to finance conversion and retraining programmes. It takes the view that price adjustments for imports from Eastern Europe and the Com\u00ad monwealth of Independent States must be negotiated but that it is not necessary to impose quantitative restrictions. It also calls on the Commission to adopt a firm, consistent pos\u00ad ition in response to the decisions taken by the United States and urges it to pursue nego\u00ad tiations for a new multilateral agreement. Lastly, it calls on the Commission to specify, on the basis of the conclusions reached at the Council meeting of 25 February, the budget measures needed to cover all the social costs and the timetable for the measures which it plans to implement.

EC 11-1991, point 1.2.38 Adopted by the Commission on 16 March. The report, which is aimed at providing an over\u00ad view of the shipbuilding industry and market in the Community in 1991, emphasizes that the more favourable trend which had characterized the period 1988-90 was reversed during the year as far as demand for new ships was con\u00ad cerned even though other parameters remained favourable. Against this background, the bal\u00ad ance between supply and demand remains pre\u00ad carious and linked to the worldwide stabiliz\u00ad ation of production capacity. In the report, the Commission also describes the state of progress of multilateral nego\u00ad tiations and examines the efforts undertaken in research and development and technical harmonization in order to make the European shipbuilding industry more competitive.

        "Energy the growth initiative: Bull. EC 1/2-1993, point 1.2.41 Adopted on 12 March. This communication proposes a set of measures to enable the national administrations and Community institutions and bodies to process and exchange the information necessary for oper\u00ad ation of the internal market and implemen\u00ad tation of the common policies. These are the first measures in the field of telecommunications to implement the principle of the establishment of trans-European net\u00ad works. As such, they form part of the measures taken to implement the growth initiative. The type and scale of investment planned will make a significant contribution to the efforts to pro\u00ad mote economic recovery, which was declared the priority at the Edinburgh European Council. This communication contains two proposals for Decisions, one on a series of guidelines, the other on a multiannual Community pro\u00ad gramme on the interchange of data between administrations (IDA). The first sets out a master plan of measures to be taken by the national and Community administrations to set up trans-European data- communications networks. This defines com\u00ad mon objectives, priorities and broad lines of action and identifies projects of common interest. The second proposes the adoption of a multi- annual IDA programme as the Community's contribution to implementing the projects of common interest identified and to ensuring the interoperability of the trans-European net\u00ad works concerned. A budget of ECU 180 million, spread over five years, has been requested for the development work on the IDA programme, plus an ECU 75 million contribution over the same period for setting up the trade statistics network (Comedi) and a further ECU 85 million for various other pri\u00ad ority networks (taxation, animal and plant health data, education and training, and export monitoring). In addition, a high-level coordi\u00ad nation group is to be set up to assist the Com\u00ad mission with implementation of the multi- annual programme. Finally, the Commission proposes to begin exploratory discussions with non-Community countries, in particular the EFTA countries, to assess to what extent expanding the data- communications networks to cover their countries could facilitate management of the European Economic Area.

        "Transport In 1992 demand for hard coal in the Com\u00ad munity totalled 309.4 million tonnes, 16.5 million tonnes down on 1991, mainly because of lower consumption at power stations. Production of hard coal also fell, to 183.7 million tonnes, as a result of restructur\u00ad ing. Imports are expected to have risen by 1.1 million tonnes to 131.3 million tonnes. In 1993 hard coal deliveries are forecast to remain more or less steady, although imports could fall by 5 million tonnes. 1.2.64.

EC 11-1991, point 1.2.75 Adopted on 29 March. This report shows that the rationalization and restructuring pro\u00ad grammes continued in 1991 producing, above all, further improvements in productivity and economic performance. It confirms the trends observed in 1991, with the decrease in aid in France and the United Kingdom contrasting with the stable or even increased levels of aid in Germany and Spain. Aid totalling ECU 5 401 million was authorized in 1991. Finally, the Commission repeats that Decision No 2064/86/ECSC is a temporary measure and that more therefore needs to be done to phase out financial aid to the coal industry.

In view of the undoubted Community interest and pri\u00ad marily strategic importance of the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, now emphasized by the way the Yugoslav crisis is isolating Greece, Parliament calls on the Community institutions to turn these seas into a truly integrated shipping and port system. In connection with the plan for European ports currently being prepared, Parliament considers that a decision should be taken about which ports are to be given additional financial resources to enable them to initiate develop\u00ad ment programmes, reorganize their port infra\u00ad structure and refurbish their intermodal trans\u00ad shipment facilities.

It also recog\u00ad nized the existence of'reserved services', which could be described as a monopoly granting national postal services exclusive rights to col\u00ad lect, transport and distribute packages. The Committee did not, however, consider it desir\u00ad able to create more extensive reserved services than those defined at Community level. While stressing the social and economic importance of the postal network, particularly for sparsely populated and rural areas, the Committee drew attention to the social impli\u00ad cations of the Green Paper for the staff of postal services and private operators.

It establishes the principle that consumers are not bound by unfair terms in contracts, and makes Member States responsible for im\u00ad plementing appropriate and effective means of ensuring that professionals cease to use such terms. These means will include the right of consumer associations to ask the courts or the relevant administrative bodies to remove from contracts unfair terms drawn up for general use. The Directive focuses on non-negotiated terms and hence on contracts which are concluded on the basis of standardized general conditions. According to the text, a non-negotiated clause is to be regarded as unfair where, in spite of the requirements of good faith, it creates a significant imbalance, to the detriment of the consumer, between the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. An indicative, non-exhaustive list of terms which may be declared unfair is given in the annex to the Directive. Such is the case, for instance, for terms which allow the supplier to amend the contract unilaterally without a valid and speci\u00ad fied reason, or which restrict consumers' access to the courts or other means of redress. The Directive will contribute to the establish\u00ad ment of the single market inasmuch as it will enable consumers to avail themselves of the new opportunities offered by completion of the internal market, for example purchasing goods and services at a more advantageous price in a Member State other than the country of resi\u00ad dence.

        "Economie and social cohesion: structural measures For the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) the changes proposed are lim\u00ad ited: extension of assistance to educational and health investments in Objective 1 regions (where development is lagging behind) and greater stress on environmental constraints and trans-European networks. For the European Social Fund (ESF) substan\u00ad tial changes are proposed. A new task is assig\u00ad ned to the ESF of helping workers adapt to industrial change (new Objective 4) through the agency of vocational training in particular. Aid will be granted on the basis of an enlarged partnership taking in the private sector and also the social partners. The new Objective 3 will explicitly cover action to promote inte\u00ad gration into th\u00e9 labour market of persons exposed to social exclusion. The Commission will have a bigger role to play in defining policy priorities for improving the working of the labour market and at the same time Member States will have more flexibility in selecting the action to be assisted. The changes proposed in the EAGGF Guid\u00ad ance Regulation take account of the transfer to the EAGGF Guarantee Section of the accompanying measures adopted as part of common agricultural policy reform that have so far been financed by the Guidance Section under Objective 5a. Some measures eligible under Objectives 1 and 5b have been strength\u00ad ened or made more precise, notably those on local product promotion and investment and village renovation. Lastly, the Commission proposes the creation of a Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guid\u00ad ance (FIFG) integrating the financial resources assigned for structural action in the fisheries sector, the governing provisions of which are at the moment derived from both the common fisheries policy and the common agricultural policy, and so improving the contribution of that action to economic and social cohesion.

Approved on 17 March. To keep the public fully informed about its future plans for remedying environmental damage, the Commission has decided to open a wide-ranging discussion on the subject. This will take the form of formal consultations, in particular with experts from the Member States and with other interested parties. The succession of major industrial accidents, combined with the steady deterioration of the environment caused by the build-up of non- accidental pollution, raises the question of how to make good the damage and to cover the cost of restoring the environment. To this end, the Commission has put forward a series of ideas for discussion on the various types of liability, their limits, the definition of environ\u00ad mental damage and ways of making it good. First, the Green Paper considers the usefulness of civil liability as a means of allocating responsibility for the costs of environmental restoration. It points out that this legal prin\u00ad ciple is closely linked to the two fundamental tenets of European environment policy since the adoption of the Single Act, namely preven\u00ad tion and the 'polluter pays' principle. Then the Commission considers the advan\u00ad tages and specific problems with the two poss\u00ad ible approaches to civil liability \u2014 fault-based liability and strict (no fault) liability \u2014 and the limits of civil liability systems, notably the problem of identification of the party or parties responsible, establishment of a causal connec\u00ad tion between the wrongful act and the damage, the definition and insurability of environmen\u00ad tal damage and the possible limitation of strict liability. The Commission also identifies a number of points which the various international conven\u00ad tions on international liability for damage to the environment have in common. In particu\u00ad lar, it notes that the Council of Europe Con\u00ad vention takes a more general approach than most of the other conventions, based on the strict liability of the operator. This Convention also imposes an obligation on the contracting parties to provide for a financial security scheme. At first sight, strict liability appears well suited to the specific demands of repairing environ\u00ad mental damage, in that it applies the principle of prevention by providing incentives for better risk management. It also helps to implement the polluter-pays principle for certain types of economic activities. However, adoption of this approach would entail important decisions on the scope of the liability system, the definition of damage, the activities covered and the party considered liable. One way of settling these points would be for the Community to sign the Council of Europe Convention. Civil liability can be an effective legal and economic instrument for recovering the costs of restoring environmental damage. However, there are limits to its effectiveness. If no causal link can be established between the damage and the party responsible, the liability mechan\u00ad ism cannot operate, leaving the question of 38 Bull. EC 3-1993 ",
        "Environment who will then restore the environment and bear the costs. Other liability arrangements will therefore be needed. To this end, the Com\u00ad mission proposes joint compensation mechan\u00ad isms to cover the costs of environmental restor\u00ad ation. This would make it possible to share the costs fairly within the economic sector closest to the presumed source of the damage. This compensation system could be coordi\u00ad nated with the other Community financial instruments set up to provide greater protec\u00ad tion for the environment. Above all, this approach would derive maximum benefit from civil liability, while making up for its deficiencies by drawing on the advantages of compensation mechanisms.

'The Council D decides that the Community should support and actively work for the implementation and further development of the Basle Convention; D notes that Article 17(1) of the Convention states that: \"Any Party may propose amendments to this Bull. EC 3-1993 41 ",
        "Environment Convention ... \" and that in accordance with Article 17(2) of the Convention any amendment to the Basle Convention must be forwarded to the Contracting Parties by the Interim Secretariat of the Convention not later than six months prior to the second meeting of the Contracting Parties, which is expected to take place in February/March 1994, and accordingly \u25a1 invites the Commission to examine any circum\u00ad stances justifying the call for a total ban on exports of hazardous waste covered by the Basle Convention to developing countries and to submit appropriate proposals to it at the earliest possible date.'

The principal objective of this Directive is to set, as from 1 October 1994, a single Community\u00adwide maximum level of 0.2% for the sulphur content of the various gasoils defined in the Directive (which excludes gasoils for processing prior to final combustion). Beyond that, it also provides for a second stage in which a further reduction of the sulphur 42 Bull. EC 3\u00ad1993 ",
        "Environment content of gasoil is planned in the continuing interests of reducing pollution by sulphur diox\u00ad ide (S0 2 ) emissions and in order to meet the requirements of specific Community legis\u00ad lation, including Directive 91/542/EEC re\u00ad lating to the measures to be taken against the emission of particulate pollutants from diesel engines used in heavy goods vehicles (the 'clean lorry' Directive). To this end, the Directive sets the following limit values: \u03a0 for automotive gasoils: \u2014 0.2% by weight as from 1 October 1994; \u2014 0.05% by weight as from 1 October 1996; D for gasoils other than automotive gasoils, except aviation kerosenes: \u2014 0.2% by weight as from 1 October 1994; \u2014 in addition, the Commission will submit a proposal, on which the Council will take a decision by 31 July 1994, aiming, in the more general framework of the policy to improve air quality, at moving on to a second phase providing for a lower value by 1 October 1999 and at setting new limit values for aviation kerosenes. Finally, Member States must also phase in automotive gasoils with a sulphur content not exceeding 0.05% by weight onto the market from 1 October 1995, so that Directives 91/ 441/EEC and 91/542/EEC can be im\u00ad plemented.

As part of its policy to improve nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Commission has decided to contribute ECU 20 million from the Community's TACIS and PHARE programmes to the nuclear safety account set up by the G7 at its meeting in Munich. This multilateral account will provide grants for the prep- 44 Bull. EC 3-1993 ",
        "Agriculture aration and implementation of projects designed to make rapid improvements in operational and technical safety in nuclear reactors posing the greatest risk. These grants will cover technical assistance and the acqui\u00ad sition, installation and placing into operation of equipment. The account will come into operation when at least four contributors have donated a total of not less than ECU 60 million and will complement existing bilateral programmes, such as the Com\u00ad munity's TACIS and PHARE programmes. Including this contribution of ECU 20 million to the multilateral account, by the end of 1993 the Community will have committed ECU 300 million to enhancing nuclear safety in this region, or 60% of the target set by the G7 in Munich. This account will be placed with and managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The Commission has therefore asked the Council to authorize it to negotiate a contribution agreement with the EBRD to lay down the rules for operation and use of the account. 1.2.108. Parliament resolution on stopping nuclear tests by the nuclear powers. Adopted on 11 March. As nuclear testing is likely to be one of the central issues at the Extension Conference of the Non-proliferation Treaty in 1995, Parliament welcomed the mor\u00ad atoria on underground nuclear testing pro\u00ad claimed by France, Russia and the USA until 1 July 1993. It called upon the other nuclear powers to join these moratoria and to adopt a common approach to nuclear testing. It also urged all States, particularly the other new independent republics apart from Russia, to join the Non-proliferation Treaty. Parliament called on the signatories of the Treaty to initiate multilateral negotiations towards a comprehensive nuclear weapons test ban. Finally, Parliament asked the Member States to take appropriate steps to strengthen inter\u00ad national controls on transfers of nuclear materials.

The Commission finds that while total con\u00ad sumption of milk products has been stable over the last few years, butter consumption has dropped markedly, and accordingly proposes a 5% reduction in the butter intervention price and deferral of the proposed milk quota reduction. In view of the considerable progress made by Spain towards effective implementation of the quota system the Commission proposes that the Spanish quota be increased for 1993/94. For Greece and Italy it finds that despite the 48 Bull. EC 3\u00ad1993 ",

Given that there is no provision under Community law for specific checks on respect for human rights, Parliament urged the Commission to draw up an action programme with a view to the establishment of a consistent and coordinated human rights policy and to produce a White Paper to this end. It also called for the Community to enter rapidly into negotiations with a view to its accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Parliament drew the attention of the Com\u00ad munity institutions and the Member States to a wide range of issues including the need to combat racism, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination, including political and trade union discrimination, the abolition of the death penalty, emergency criminal laws, conditions of detention, conscientious objection, the fight against organized crime, legal guarantees for foreigners, and the acquisition and/or retention of nationality. It feels strongly that each and every individual should be able to enjoy econ\u00ad omic, social and cultural rights, which \u2014 given the indivisibility of human rights \u2014 should be afforded the same measure of protection as civil and political rights. Lastly, Parliament expressed concern at the increase in the volume of data exchanged since completion of the internal market and called for the harmonization of national legislation to prevent infringement of the right to privacy.

Stressing that the right of the child to both parents is a basic provision of family law and that the right of custody must not preclude rights of access, it advocated the establishment of family conciliation net\u00ad works to resolve disputes between parents, especially those of different nationalities. It then called on the Commission to submit a communication to it on all aspects of the inter\u00ad national abduction of children in a European area without frontiers, including the possibility of promoting a specific Community instru\u00ad ment.

Nor\u00ad way's application for membership of the Euro\u00ad pean Community is viewed favourably. Nego\u00ad tiations will be conducted under Article 0 of the Treaty on European Union subsequent to its entry into force; they cannot be concluded until the Treaty has been ratified by all Mem\u00ad ber States. In its opinion the Commission underlines that accession by Norway, which will have to accept the acquis communautaire including the pro\u00ad visions of the Treaty on European Union, does not pose any political problems. In addition, Norway is a founding member of NATO and an associate member of the WEU. Nor should it create any serious economic diffi\u00ad culties; free trade in industrial products between Norway and the Community is already well established by virtue of the 1973 Free Trade Agreements and ratification of the Agreement on the European Economic Area is evidence of Norway's readiness to adopt a substantial part of the acquis communautaire. After analysing the impact of Norway's accession in various areas, the Commission does, however, point out that problems could arise in certain of them, notably the common agricultural policy, fisheries, regional policy, energy and State monopolies (alcoholic bever\u00ad ages, in particular). Nevertheless, in the Com\u00ad mission's view, it should be possible to find satisfactory solutions to these problems in the course of the accession negotiations.

It has also been agreed that if Liechtenstein wishes to play a full part in the EEA, it will have to redefine its relations with Switzerland, given that the existence of close administrative and legal links, and more especially a customs union, between those two countries is incom\u00ad patible with Liechtenstein's participation in the EEA independently of Switzerland. 1.3.3.

Noting that the process of intro\u00ad ducing market economies in the Baltic States was beset with problems of all kinds, the Com\u00ad mittee stressed the need to make this transition 'socially acceptable', chiefly by coordinating the economic, financial and social policies. The Committee also considered the establishment of relations of cooperation to be a matter of priority, in order to eliminate the economic and social imbalances between Eastern and Western Europe, and regarded the trade and cooperation Agreements between the Com\u00ad munity and the Baltic States to be an important first step towards strengthening relations with them. It did, however, call for Europe Agree\u00ad ments to be concluded, and for their preambles to include a reference to the social dimension of the process of European integration. The Committee also emphasized the central role which should be given to political dialogue in these Agreements. 1.3.7.

The Agreement was signed by Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish Foreign Minister and President of the Council, Sir Leon Brittan and Hans van den Broek of the Com\u00ad mission, the Member States' Foreign Ministers and Mr Berov, Bulgaria's Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. The signing of this Agreement is a milestone in the develop\u00ad ment of relations between the Community and Member States and Bulgaria, and takes full account of the process of political and econ\u00ad omic reform on which the country has embar\u00ad ked. Against this background, the Agreement enshrines as essential components of the relationship of association the values of demo\u00ad cratic pluralism, the rule of law, observance of human rights and the market economy. It provides for the progressive establishment over 10 years of a Community-Bulgaria free trade area, with Bulgaria initially receiving preferen\u00ad tial treatment (the Community will eliminate all quantitative restrictions from the outset, and phase out customs duties over four years, while Bulgaria will have 10 years for this pro\u00ad cess). Provision has been made for special pro\u00ad tocols for ECSC products and textiles, and special concessions will apply to agriculture. Special emphasis is laid on political dialogue, which is to be regular and conducted at the highest political level, notably in the setting of the Association Council. A special section deals with implementation of the principle of non-discrimination for Bulgarians in employ\u00ad ment in a Member State, reciprocal national treatment in relation to the right of establish\u00ad ment and the gradual introduction of the prin\u00ad ciples of freedom to provide services and free movement of capital. The section dealing with competition, aid and intellectual property pro\u00ad vides for the phasing-in of Community rules in Bulgaria.

With regard to trade in goods and services, it observed that some sectors would be excluded from the liberaliz\u00ad ation provided for, and requested the Com\u00ad mission to draw up a report on the possible impact on production and employment if the Community were to liberalize trade in the restricted sectors, and in particular steel and textiles. It noted that the Agreements provided for progressive liberalization of trade in ser\u00ad vices. Parliament approved the general principles of economic cooperation set out in the draft Agreements, but considered that there should be greater promotion and support of environ\u00ad mental protection and that the technical assistance programme operated by the Com\u00ad munity and the new independent States should be made more efficient. It advocated giving the States access to European Invest\u00ad ment Bank resources to finance projects which were in line with the aims of the partnership Agreements.

Mr Clinton took the opportunity of the discussions on trade to reaffirm his intention to ask Congress to extend the 'fast track' procedure for approv\u00ad ing the Uruguay Round conclusions until the end of 1993, signalling his desire to reach an agreement. Mr Delors stressed the danger that trade problems between the Community and the USA could hold up the Uruguay Round talks. The two agreed on the need for speedy and effective aid for Russia, whose economic situation was still deteriorating. In talks with Mr Gore and other members of the administration, Mr Delors touched on environmental and demographic issues as well as the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Delors also held discussions with the US Trade Representative, Mr Mickey Kantor, cul\u00ad minating in a joint statement on the Uruguay Round negotiations in which the two agreed on the need to work out a significant market access package in both goods and services with a view to negotiating a balanced and compre\u00ad hensive agreement. They also agreed to recip\u00ad rocate efforts on the dispute over government procurement, pending Mr Kantor's forth\u00ad coming visit to Brussels (-> point 1.3.32). Fol\u00ad lowing Mr Delors' visit, the US authorities announced that they would postpone planned sanctions over access to public procurement contracts. The visit demonstrated the great degree of openness in US-Community relations and the need for close cooperation to find joint solu\u00ad tions to global problems.

Mr Kantor pointed out that, as President Clinton had told Mr Delors (-\u00bb point 1.3.31), US sanctions would be suspended until 20 April, the next date for negotiations. Sir Leon put forward a compromise proposal including a joint study of the statistics. In addition, he announced that the Commission was ready to begin work on suspending Article 29 of the Directive on public procurement, which provides for a Community preference of 3%. On the Uruguay Round, Mr Kantor reaffir\u00ad med that the US administration aimed to con\u00ad clude a balanced and comprehensive agree\u00ad ment as soon as possible and intended to ask Congress to extend the administration's 'fast track' authority, with a view to concluding the negotiations by the end of the year.

In view of the fact that the Assembly's recent meetings had taken place at a particularly propitious stage in the development of many ACP States towards democratic, pluralist political systems based on respect for human rights, and that these advances were a positive response to the Council resolution on human rights, democracy and development cooperation policy, Parliament felt that the Joint Assembly had specific responsibilities in relation to cases of alleged human rights violations in ACP countries and that a constant and open dialo\u00ad gue focused on the principle that democracy requires a minimum of economic and social well-being should be opened.

EC 11-1992, point 1.4.47 Adopted by the Commission on 24 March. In a follow-up to its May 1992 communication, which highlighted the lack of coordination between national and Community develop\u00ad ment cooperation policies, the Commission has identified priority areas for such policy coordi\u00ad nation. In accordance with the Council Declar\u00ad ation of November 1992, the Commission has based its analysis on a study of the Council's past resolutions and conclusions, which are currently the main source of development cooperation principles and objectives. The Commission emphasizes, however, that coordi\u00ad nation is not an end in itself and entails costs. This is why a study was needed to determine which were the areas where stepped-up coordi\u00ad nation would offer comparative advantages. The Commission's paper therefore sets out for each of the policy areas mentioned by the Council a brief description of existing texts, an assessment of their contents and present relevance, and conclusions and recommen\u00ad dations for the future, especially as regards the degree of priority for policy coordination. Priority is given to areas satisfying the follow\u00ad ing three criteria: (i) areas considered a priority in terms of the general development objectives provided Bull. EC 3-1993 69 ",
        "Humanitarian aid for in Article 130u of the Treaty on Euro\u00ad pean Union (democratic consolidation, sustainable economic and social develop\u00ad ment, the smooth integration of the developing countries into the world econ\u00ad omy, the campaign against poverty); (ii) areas where strengthened cooperation can achieve more effective results; (iii) areas dealt with inadequately by existing Council texts. The Commission identifies five areas that meet these criteria: food security, health, education and training policies, the campaign against poverty, and external financing and debt issues. It notes, however, that there are also 'horizontal' areas that are important for the major development objectives, such as employ\u00ad ment policy and the role of the private sector, which may be incorporated in a wider context.

Parliament resolution on human rights in the world and Community human rights policy for the years 1991-92. Adopted by Parliament on 12 March. Parlia\u00ad ment considered that the period under review, while characterized by major political change and a rapidly shifting world scene leading to the emergence of more governments commit\u00ad ted to democracy and auguring well in some ways for the development of human rights, had also produced horrific excesses and abuses of human rights including, on the European con\u00ad tinent, the dreadful example of the former Yugoslavia. It considered that the trend towards greater consideration of human rights, especially by countries that had always denied them, and the increase in information about violations were encouraging developments, which would, however, have to be sustained before they could be considered satisfactory. With regard to the Community's human rights policy, Parliament noted that it was in the process of significantly adapting and reshaping its external policies to reinforce its effectiveness in this sphere, both in development and other sectors. It believed that such a policy must be implemented consistently and in a coordinated fashion and that the Commission and Parlia\u00ad ment should be more closely involved in its implementation than in the past. It felt that the policy must be seen to be non-selective and that criteria, procedures and measures must, if they were to be effective, be based on a sound and objective assessment of developments in 74 Bull.

Parliament also reaffirmed the unlawful nature of the trial of Xanana Gusm\u00e3o and its refusal to accept any conviction resulting from the trial in view of the Indonesian court's complete lack of legit\u00ad imacy or competence in the matter. OJC 115,26.4.1993 Former Yugoslavia 1.3.82. Parliament resolution on the rape of women in the former Yugoslavia. Adopted by Parliament on 11 March. Parlia\u00ad ment condemned the detention and rape of women in the former Yugoslavia and called for the immediate dismantling of rape camps and the release of women held in them. It welcomed the UN Security Council's Resol\u00ad ution on the setting-up of an international tri\u00ad bunal to try cases of serious violations of human rights committed in the former Yugo\u00ad slavia and to include the rape of women among the crimes to be judged by this tribunal. It called on the Commission to coordinate and sustain financially the efforts of governmental, non-governmental and private organizations working on behalf of women on a non- nationalistic basis and on the Community to send an outreach team of counsellors and social workers with experience of dealing with rape to train local staff and support self-help groups. Lastly it called on the United Nations to establish a convention to protect women in times of emergency and armed conflict. OJC 115, 26.4.1993 76 Bull. EC 3-1993 ",

Narco-terrorism in Colombia 1.4.2. The following joint statement on com\u00ad bating narco-terrorism in Colombia was publi\u00ad shed in Copenhagen and Brussels on 2 March: 'The European Community and its Member States express their shock at and rejection of recent terror\u00ad ist attacks in Colombia, and their sympathy for the families of the victims. They wish to record their solidarity with the Colombian Government and the Colombian people in their fight against narco-ter\u00ad rorism. The European Community and its Member States condemn the illicit production, processing and traf\u00ad ficking of drugs, and the violence so often associated with it. The illicit drugs trade damages innocent individuals and undermines democracy and the rule of law.' Myanmar (Burma) 1.4.3. The following joint statement was pub\u00ad lished in Copenhagen and Brussels on 12 March: 'The Community and its Member States welcome the adoption on 10 March 1993 by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) of the consensus resolution on the human rights situation in Burma (Myanmar), which was co-spon\u00ad sored by the Community and its Member States. The Community and its Member States especially urge the Government of Burma (Myanmar) to release immediately and unconditionally the Nobel peace laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, detained without trial for the last four years, as well as other detained political leaders and all political prisoners excluded from the preparation of the new consti\u00ad tution. They urge the Government of Burma (Myanmar) to accelerate the process towards democracy by allowing all citizens to participate freely in the politi\u00ad cal process, in particular through convening the parliament elected in May 1990, and restore full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Community and its Member States attach strong importance to the international consensus shown by the adoption of the resolution and strongly urge the Government of Burma (Myanmar) as a member of the United Nations and signatory to the United Nations human rights instruments to fulfil its obligations under these instruments.' Presidential election in Madagascar 1.4.4. The following joint statement was pub\u00ad lished in Copenhagen and Brussels on 15 March: 'The Community and its Member States warmly welcome the respect for democracy shown during the presidential election by the two candidates and the Malagasy people. They hope very much that the development of democracy in Madagascar will continue in the same spirit and would urge all parties concerned to achieve this objective by peaceful Nagorno-Karabakh 1.4.5. The following joint statement was pub\u00ad lished in Copenhagen and Brussels on 15 March: 'The Community and its Member States welcome the progress made at the recent negotiations on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh carried out in Rome within the framework of the Minsk process, as a first step towards the convening of the Minsk Con\u00ad ference. They urge the parties to take the necessary steps to advance the peace process, including an early ceasefire as an essential prerequisite for estab\u00ad lishing a lasting peace in the region. Bull. EC 3-1993 77 ",
        "European political cooperation The Community and its Member States reconfirm their support for the efforts of the Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Conference, the Hon. Mario Raffaelli and consider that the CSCE peace process represents the appropriate framework to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The Community and its Member States will work with its partners in the CSCE framework in Vienna to assist the efforts at mediation currently under way.' North Korea 1.4.6. The following joint statement on the withdrawal of the Democratic People's Repub\u00ad lic of Korea from the Non-Proliferation Treaty was published in Copenhagen and Brussels on 17 March: 'The European Community and its Member States express great concern at the decision by the Demo\u00ad cratic People's Republic of Korea to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), of which prior notification was given to the United Nations Security Council on 12 March 1993. The European Community and its Member States consider nuclear proliferation to be a major threat to global security and stability and they believe that the universal accession to the NPT and the full compliance with its obligations are the best ways to guarantee nuclear non-proliferation. From a global perspective the safeguards inspec\u00ad tions carried out by the IAEA under the NPT are of crucial importance for the efficient functioning of the Treaty and therefore need to be as effective as possible. The NPT has recently made considerable progress in universality and efficiency. Withdrawal from the NPT by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and her refusal to have her entire nuclear programme inspected by the IAEA can therefore only have a detrimental effect on the non-prolifer\u00ad ation regime as a whole. The European Community and its Member States therefore strongly urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to reverse her decision and to fulfil all her obligations under the NPT and the Safeguards Agreement. Furthermore it has to be noted that these obligations remain in force for three months after an official notification of withdrawal.' Malawi 1.4.7. The following joint statement on the situation in Malawi was published in Copenhagen and Brussels on 24 March: 'The Community and its Member States welcome the recent encouraging signs of improvements in Malawi regarding political freedom and respect for human rights and urge the government to continue the democratization process. They note the decision of the President to reschedule the referendum on the maintenance or rejection of the single party system until 14 June 1993 in accordance with the recommendation of the United Nations. The Com\u00ad munity and its Member States hold the firm view that whatever political framework emerges it should safeguard all rights enshrined in international con\u00ad ventions. It is of fundamental importance that the referendum should be declared free and fair. To allow for this the referendum must be prepared and conducted properly in accordance with international standards. An important part of the preparations is the exist\u00ad ence of conditions which allow all parties, including those advocating multi-party democracy, to conduct campaigns prior to the referendum. The presence of international observers during the registration phase as well as during the referendum itself will contribute to the general acceptability of the result. The structure of the Referendum Commission and its independence will be of crucial importance. As soon as satisfactory agreement on this is reached the Community and its Member States will be pre\u00ad pared to send observers to monitor the registration process and subsequently to consider sending observers to monitor the referendum. The European Community and its Member States reiterate their continued interest in economic and political progress in Malawi and earnestly hope that the referendum, together with the pursuit of appro\u00ad priate human rights and economic policies, will lead to conditions for a resumption of a full aid partner\u00ad ship with donors.' Report of the ad hoc Commission on the Truth in El Salvador 1.4.8. The following joint statement was pub\u00ad lished in Copenhagen and Brussels on 25 March: 'The European Community and its Member States welcome the submission and publication of the report of the Commission on the Truth in El Sal\u00ad vador. They express their support for the statement on the report of the Commission on the Truth of 18 March 1993 by the President of the United Nations Security Council. 78 Bull. EC 3-1993 ",

In this context, the European Community and its Member States note with concern that the Salvador\u00ad ean parliament, upon the government's initiative, has approved an \"extensive, absolute and uncon\u00ad ditional\" amnesty before the full implementation of the ad hoc Commission's recommendations and before putting into effect the conclusions of the Commission on the Truth. They emphasize that this step, which can only contribute positively to national reconciliation if it receives broad support in Salvadorean society, should not prejudice the full implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Truth.' Bosnia-Hercegovina 1.4.9. The following joint statement was pub\u00ad lished in Copenhagen and Brussels on 26 March: 'The Community and its Member States warmly commend the decision of the Bosnian Government to sign the Vance/Owen Peace Plan. They reiterate their unequivocal support for the plan and pay tribute to the valuable efforts of the two co- chairmen. They also welcome the agreement between the Mus\u00ad lim and Croat parties on the interim arrangements which form an important part of the peace package. They hope the Security Council of the United Nations will endorse the Vance/Owen Peace Plan, and they express their readiness to contribute sub\u00ad stantially to its implementation. The Community and its Member States demand that the Serb side now accept the plan in its entirety and cooperate fully in all aspects of its implemen\u00ad tation. The Serbs must stop all aggressions at once, preparing the way for the cessation of hostilities by all sides. If the Bosnian Serbs refuse to accept the plan now, full international pressure will be brought to bear on them. The Community and its Member States will continue strengthening sanctions and will con\u00ad sider further measures leading to the total isolation of Serbia-Montenegro.' South Africa 1.4.10. The following statement was publi\u00ad shed in Copenhagen and Brussels on 30 March: 'In spite of the general downward trend of violence since the beginning of 1993 the wave of violence has continued in certain areas of Natal and Transvaal culminating in a recent series of senseless murders of children and other innocent victims. The Community and its Member States express their abhorrence and condemnation of these crimes and appeal to all parties engaged in the effort to reach a negotiated settlement for a future political dispen\u00ad sation in South Africa to do their utmost to bring the violence to an end and to renounce violence in all its forms. In this connection the Community and its Member States have taken due note inter alia of the Gold- stone Commission's report of 15 March 1993 by the Committee conducting a preliminary investigation into the activities of the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) as well as of the Commission's rec\u00ad ommendations addressed to the international com\u00ad munity. The Community and its Member States have in many ways demonstrated their support for the peace process in South Africa, in particular through the deployment of the European Community Observer Mission in South Africa (Ecomsa). Together with the missions of the United Nations, the OAU and the Commonwealth, Ecomsa has the mandate to observe the situation on the ground in areas most affected by violence and to facilitate dialogue between the relevant parties in order to defuse potential situations of conflict when needed. The Community and its Member States urge all parties to support the international observer mis\u00ad sions in fulfilling their tasks and stress the impor\u00ad tance of allowing the international observer missions free access to all parts of South Africa, including the so-called homelands. They renew their call to all parties to sign the National Peace Accord and to participate in the peace structures. They welcome the forthcoming resumption of multi-party negotiations and urge all parties who have not yet done so to commit themselves to a speedy and peaceful transition to a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa.' Iraq 1.4.11. The following joint statement on the detention of British citizens in Iraq was publi\u00ad shed in Copenhagen and Brussels on 31 March: 'The Community and its Member States deplore the continued and unjustified detention in Iraq of the Bull.

These sentences and similar ones, passed on citizens from non-European Community countries recently, are wholly out of proportion for such minor techni\u00ad cal breaches of the law. The Community and its Member States understand that the Iraqi Govern\u00ad ment has asked the British Government to release frozen assets in exchange for the liberation of the two men. The Community and its Member States note that it is not within the power of a UN member State to bypass United Nations resolutions on sanctions or the freezing of assets. These resolutions will remain in place until Iraq has complied with the terms of the ceasefire agreement. The Community and its Member States call upon Iraq to implement UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 which make provision for the Iraqi Government to sell USD 1.6 billion of oil to finance the purchase of medical supplies and food to meet the humanitarian requirements of the Iraqi people. The Community and its Member States urge the Iraqi Government to authorize the early release of the two men. This would be seen by the international community as a positive gesture.' Lesotho 1.4.12. The following joint statement was published in Copenhagen and Brussels on 31 March: 'The Community and its Member States welcome the statements of the international electoral observer teams, including observers from EC Member States, that the general elections on 27 March were, despite some administrative shortcomings, free and fair. They congratulate the people of Lesotho for the admirable patience and determination with which they exercised their right to vote, and recognize the role the military government and all the political parties have played in bringing Lesotho peacefully to democratic elections. The elections represent a major step towards the restoration of democratic, accountable government in Lesotho. The Community and its Member States urge all parties to work together to ensure a speedy and peaceful transfer of power, and call on the winning party to govern in a spirit of reconciliation and tolerance towards the people of Lesotho of all politi\u00ad cal persuasions.' 80 Bull.

Parliament resolution on the closure of Parliament's accounts for the 1992 financial year (administrative expenditure). Adopted on 12 March. OJC 115,26.4.1993 1993 financial year 1.5.2. Preliminary draft supplementary and amending budget No 1/93. References: General budget of the European Commu\u00ad nities for the 1993 financial year: OJ L31, 8.2.1993; Bull. EC 12-1992, point 1.6.3 Proposal for an addition to the Protocol on the Statute of the European Investment Bank empowering the Board of Governors of the EIB to establish the European Investment Fund; proposal for a Council Decision on Community membership of the European Investment Fund: point 1.2.20 of this Bulletin Adopted by the Commission on 17 March. Pre\u00ad liminary draft supplementary and amending budget No 1/93 is intended to cover the increase in EAGGF-Guarantee expenditure and the Community's contribution to the cap\u00ad ital of the European Investment Fund and to adjust the amount of own resources provided for in the 1993 budget. The increase in EAGGF-Guarantee expendi\u00ad ture (ECU 1 884 million) reflects the budgetary impact of the monetary realignments of Sep\u00ad tember 1992, November 1992 and January 1993 and the measures endorsed by the Council in December 1992, in particular measures to help drought-hit Portuguese agriculture, the market organization for bananas, the premium paid to goat and sheep farmers in less-favoured regions and measures to adjust the transitional arrangements for Spain's accession. Even after this increase, a margin of ECU 721 million remains available beneath the expenditure ceil\u00ad ing (agricultural guideline). The Commission also intends to make arrange\u00ad ments for the budgetary consequences of the establishment of the European Investment Fund and therefore proposes that the Com\u00ad munity contribution of ECU 30 million be entered in the general budget. Finally, as regards own resources, the Com\u00ad mission proposes that the VAT base be reduced from ECU 2 898.41 billion to ECU 2 829.55 billion and the GNP base from ECU 5 841.08 billion to ECU 5 694.84 billion to take account of changes in exchange rates since these bases were fixed. 1994 financial year References: Conclusions of the Edinburgh European Council: Bull.

Parliament resolution on guidelines for the 1994 budget, Section III \u2014 Commission. Adopted on 10 March. As 1994 will be the first year in which the Treaty on European Union and the Agreement establishing the European Economic Area are reflected in the budget, Parliament believes that it will be difficult to meet the Community's essential requirements with the funds agreed at the Edinburgh Euro\u00ad pean Council, particularly in view of the low growth rate expected for Community GNP. It is prepared to establish the 1994 budget within the framework of an interinstitutional agree- Bull. EC 3-1993 81 ",
        "Budgets ment which is balanced and equitable and already proposes a number of guidelines for the main categories of expenditure. Parliament considers that the Commission must present measures which guarantee that agricultural expenditure will remain within the agricultural guideline and that the impact of the switch\u00ad over mechanism must also be limited. It also calls for proposals for reforms to stabilize agri\u00ad cultural expenditure in those sectors not yet covered by CAP reform. Parliament accepts the level of expenditure fixed by the Edinburgh European Council for economic and social cohesion but believes that at least 10% of total structural expenditure should be allocated to Community initiatives and that sufficient financial resources will have to be granted to regions affected by the process of adjustment and reduction in the Community fleet. As regards internal policies, Parliament considers that the importance of the Community contri\u00ad bution in the field of research and technology as the driving force of the economy should not be underestimated and calls for continued efforts by all the institutions to find an accept\u00ad able solution to the problem of funding with\u00ad out, however, any reduction in the allocations for other internal priorities such as the environ\u00ad ment, consumer protection, social policy and education. Education should be given a specific priority in the 1994 budget in anticipation of ratification of the Treaty on European Union. Parliament also calls for a broad equilibrium to be maintained between expenditure on internal policies and on external action, with priority here being given to economic assistance to the developing countries, in particular those affec\u00ad ted by economic decline, famine and natural disasters. It also considers it important to improve the utilization of the appropriations for PHARE and TACIS. As regards adminis\u00ad trative expenditure, Parliament considers that the funds proposed by the European Council are unrealistic, particularly in view of the new institutions set up by the Treaty on European Union and the added burdens arising from the decisions taken in Edinburgh. OJC 115, 26.4.1993 1.5.4.

Adopted on 10 March. Parliament considers that administrative expenditure in 1994 will be considerably affected by the provisions of the Treaty on European Union, which change the status and powers of the Court of Auditors and the Economic and Social Committee, set up new bodies such as the Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman, provide for the use of new parliamentary instruments such as the right of inquiry and introduce cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs and the common foreign and security policy. It also takes the view that the budgetary discipline for administrative expenditure agreed upon in Edinburgh must go hand in hand with the principle of transparency. Parliament also repeated its wish for the multi- annual planning of administrative expenditure and more rational management of the expendi\u00ad ture of the various institutions, in particular through the Interinstitutional Office. It instructed its Secretary-General to present a detailed report on the subject, based on a cost- benefit analysis, before the first reading of the draft budget for 1994.

In view of the need to make substantial modifications to the existing interinstitutional agreements in readiness for entry into force of the Treaty on European Union and to conclude new ones to take account of the provisions it contains, Parlia\u00ad ment called on the Council and the Com\u00ad mission to negotiate and conclude agreements in the following areas: economic and monetary union, the common foreign and security policy, international agreements and the Community legislative process. In the case of economic and monetary union, Parliament proposed that the Council and the Commission undertake to work in agreement with Parliament when formulating the broad guidelines of economic policy at Member State and at Community level, assessing the conver\u00ad gence programmes of the Member States, put\u00ad ting forward recommendations concerning excessive deficits and the use of sanctions, and drafting secondary legislation regarding econ\u00ad omic and monetary union. In the case of the common foreign and security policy, Parliament called for its views to be taken into consideration on fundamental choices by means of a consultation and follow- up mechanism and for more information in respect of accession negotiations and the con\u00ad clusion of association agreements. In the case of international agreements, Parlia\u00ad ment believes that it should participate in the framing of directives and the monitoring of negotiations on the same footing as the Council. Lastly, as regards the legislative process, Par\u00ad liament considers that its role in consultation and cooperation procedures needs to be clearly spelled out. OJC 115,26.4.1993 Parliament Election procedure 1.6.2. Resolution on the draft uniform elec\u00ad toral procedure for the election of Members of the European Parliament. Adopted on 10 March. Parliament reiterated its wish to see the introduction of a uniform electoral procedure based on proportional rep\u00ad resentation with at least a third of its Members elected on this basis, and called on Member States to set a minimum threshold for the dis\u00ad tribution of seats at between 3 and 5% of the votes cast. OJC 115,26.4.1993 Part-session, Strasbourg, 8 to 12 March 1.6.3. For the first time in its history, Parlia\u00ad ment debated the annual legislative pro\u00ad gramme at a plenary sitting. Mr Pinheiro, for the Commission, pointed out that this year's programme had been drawn up in a climate of uncertainty, principally because of the delays in ratifying the Treaty on European Union, and emphasized the need for the Commission to take decisive action in five areas to satisfy public expectations: working for economic recovery and combating unemployment, strengthening the internal market, preparing for economic and monetary union, cooper- 84 Bull.

During the debate, Parliament devoted par\u00ad ticular attention to environmental policy, the Structural Funds, employment, the social dimension and completion of the internal mar\u00ad ket. With regard to the environment, Parlia\u00ad ment debated the need for an industrial policy based on sustainable development, the effects of certain structural operations on the environ\u00ad ment, and civil liability for radioactive waste. Members also made statements on combating unemployment and social exclusion and on measures to implement the Social Charter and, in the field of energy, expressed support for renewable energy sources and the coal indus\u00ad try. Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, Mr Millan, Mr Ruberti, Mr Christophersen and Mr Paleo- krassas, for the Commission, made statements. Parliament then adopted a resolution in which it instructed its enlarged Bureau to negotiate an interinstitutional legislative programme incorporating measures it would like to see adopted in 1993 (-> point 1.6.11). Still on the institutional front, there was a long debate on the uniform electoral procedure for European elections, at the end of which a resolution was adopted calling for a procedure based on the principle of proportional rep\u00ad resentation (-> point 1.6.2). Parliament also gave its opinion on an addition to the Protocol on the Statute of the European Investment Bank (-> point 1.2.20). The House also adopted a resolution in which it called for the conclusion of interinstitutional agreements, in particular in the fields of economic and monet\u00ad ary union, the common foreign and security policy, international agreements and the legis\u00ad lative process (-\u00bb point 1.6.1), as well as two resolutions on European union (-> points 1.1.1 and 1.1.2). On the external relations front, Parliament was unable to obtain the absolute majority required to give its assent to the conclusion of the fourth protocol on financial and technical cooper\u00ad ation between the Community and the Syrian Arab Republic (-\u00bb point 1.3.26). However, it adopted resolutions on the situation in the Russian Federation (-> point 1.3.23), on future agreements between the Community and the Commonwealth of Independent States, with which it called for the setting-up of a free trade zone (-> point 1.3.20), and on the construction of a power station at Gabcikovo (-> point 1.3.14). It also gave its opinion on the outcome of the meetings of the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly in 1992 in Santa Domingo and Lux\u00ad embourg, in which it stressed the importance and the political nature of this Assembly (-> point 1.3.44). Parliament also adopted res\u00ad olutions on the situation in South Africa (-\u25ba point 1.3.76) and Cambodia (-\u00bb point 1.3.34) and on rearmament in Iran (\u00ad>\u25a0 point 1.3.30). On the budgetary front, Parliament had no difficulty adopting the budgetary guidelines for 1994 (\u00ad\u00bb points 1.5.3 and 1.5.4); it emphasized the priority it gives to certain key areas such as social expenditure and compliance with the agricultural guideline. It also adopted a resolu\u00ad tion on the closure of its accounts for 1992 (\u00ad> point 1.5.1). After an animated debate, Parliament adopted two important resolutions on respect for human rights in the European Community (\u00ad> point 1.2.155) and in the world (\u00ad> point 1.3.74). In the first, which constitutes its annual report on human rights, Parliament emphas\u00ad ized the implications of the new control pro\u00ad cedures for judicial processes in the Member States. It also made a series of proposals on economic and social rights, called for a Com\u00ad munity policy on human rights, and called on the Commission to produce a White Paper to this end. In the second, Parliament confined itself to an analysis of Community policy in this area in 1991 and 1992 and called on the Commission to take action to increase coordi\u00ad nation in this field. The House also adopted resolutions on the rape of women in the former Yugoslavia, on human rights in Rwanda, Cuba, Iraq and East Timor, and on the escape of the murderers of Chico Mendes in Brazil (\u00ad* points 1.3.77 to 1.3.82). On the legislative front, under the cooperation procedure, Parliament gave its opinion at first reading on four proposals concerning the incin\u00ad eration of hazardous waste (\u00ad> point 1.2.99), deposit\u00adguarantee schemes (\u00ad> point 1.2.16), the application of open network provision to voice telephony (\u00ad> point 1.2.75) and colour\u00ad Bull.

Under the consultation procedure, Parliament gave a favourable opinion on five proposals for Regulations in the field of agriculture relating respectively to a special import quota for beef, the common organization of the market in eggs and poultrymeat (-\u00bb point 1.2.125), the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (-\u00bb point 1.2.118), a special sys\u00ad tem of assistance to ACP suppliers of bananas (-\u00bb point 1.3.42) and the granting of pro\u00ad duction aid for processed tomato products (-> point 1.2.119). It also gave its opinion on a proposal for a Directive on protective measures against the introduction of organisms harmful to plants (-> point 1.2.10) and on a proposal for a Decision on reference laboratories for the monitoring of marine biotoxins (-> point 1.2.9).

Judgment of 19 January, Case C\u00ad361/ 90 Commission \u03bd Portugal \u2014 Progressive adjustment of monopolies \u2014 Conditions of Portugal's accession (see also judgment of same date in Case C\u00ad76/91 Caves Neto Costa \u03bd Minis\u00ad ter for Commerce and Tourism and Secretary of State for Foreign Trade). The Court dismissed the Commission's appli\u00ad cation for a declaration that Portugal had com\u00ad mitted an infringement by failing to adjust progressively the monopoly in ethyl alcohol of agricultural and non\u00adagricultural origin and the monopoly in the acquisition and supply of wine spirits for use in the making of port wine. Although Article 208(1) of the Act of Accession required Portugal to adjust its State monopolies during the transitional period (expiring on 1 January 1993) so as to end all discrimination, it allowed Portugal consider\u00ad able discretion in determining how this should be done. The Court noted that, by the date set in the reasoned opinion, specific measures had been taken by the Portuguese Government and that the Commission had been unable to produce evidence to the contrary. The fact that the 92 Bull. EC 3\u00ad1993 ",

Judgment of 26 January, Case C-112/ 91 Werner \u03bd Finanzamt Aachen-Innenstadt \u2014 Taxation \u2014 Residence of taxpayer. The Court was asked whether Articles 52 and 7 of the EEC Treaty precluded a Member State from imposing on its nationals who carry on their professional activities within its territory and who there earn all or almost all of their income or there possess all or almost all of their assets a heavier tax burden in the case where they do not reside in that State than in the case where they do. The Court ruled that Member States were not precluded from doing so. The only aspect of the case in issue which was other than purely national was that Mr Werner did not reside in his country of origin, although he did work there. This fact was not in itself sufficient for Article 52 to be relied upon. Having pointed out that Article 52 prohibits, in respect of the right of establishment, any discrimination on grounds of nationality as referred to in Article 7 of the EEC Treaty, the Court concluded that, since the national legislation in question was compatible with Article 52, it must also be compatible with Article 7. 1.6.17. Judgment of 3 February, Case C-148/ 91 Vereniging Veronica Omroep Organisatie \u03bd Commissariaat voor de Media \u2014 Freedom to provide services and free movement of capital \u2014 National legislation designed to preserve a pluralist and non-commercial broadcasting system. The Court held that the legislation of a Mem\u00ad ber State (in this case the Netherlands) pro\u00ad hibiting a national broadcasting organization from helping to establish in another Member State commercial radio and television com\u00ad panies intending to broadcast to the territory of the first Member State was not contrary to the provisions of the EEC Treaty on the free movement of capital and the freedom to pro\u00ad vide services, since the prohibition in question was necessary 'to ensure the pluralist and non\u00ad commercial nature' of the audiovisual system set up by the legislation. The Court held: D that such cultural objectives were in the public interest and a Member State might law\u00ad fully pursue them by framing the rules govern\u00ad ing its broadcasting organizations appropri\u00ad ately (see also the Mediawet cases \u2014 C-288/89 [1991] ECR 1-4007 and C-353/89 [1991] ECR 1-4069); and \u03a0 that a Member State might not be denied the right to take measures designed to prevent the freedom guaranteed by the EEC Treaty from being used by a supplier of services whose operations were entirely or principally directed towards his Member State in order to circum\u00ad vent the rules which would apply to that sup\u00ad plier (cultural rules in this case) if he were established in the territory of that State (see also Case 33/74 van Binsbergen [1974] ECR 1299). 1.6.18.

These conditions discriminated between differ\u00ad ent categories of beneficiaries in Luxembourg, presenting an obstacle to the free movement of persons and constituting an infringement of various provisions of Community law, namely Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 on the freedom of movement for workers within the Community, which provides for equal treatment in respect of welfare benefits, Bull.

Judgment of 30 March, Case C\u00ad168/ 91 Konstantinidis \u03bd Stadt Altensteig and Others \u2014 Discrimination \u2014 International agreement \u2014 Transliteration of Greek. The Court was asked whether national rules concerning the transliteration into Latin characters of the name of a Greek national, for the purposes of the registers of civil status in his host country, were likely to place him at a disadvantage, de jure or defacto, as compared with a national of the host country in the same situation. The Court ruled that, while such transliteration was not contrary to any provisions of the EEC Treaty, the application of the relevant national rules or international agreements could be found to be incompatible with Article 52 of the EEC Treaty if they caused a Greek national such inconvenience that they did in fact consti\u00ad tute an interference with the freedom of estab\u00ad lishment guaranteed by Article 52. This would be the case if the legislation of the host country obliged a Greek national to use, in the exercise of his trade or profession, the spelling of his name as transliterated for the registers of civil status, if this spelling distorted the pronunciation of his name and if such distortion could cause his potential customers to confuse him with other persons.

Judgment of 17 February, Joined Cases C\u00ad159/91 and C\u00ad160/91 Poucet \u03bd AGF and Camulrac and Pistre \u03bd Concava \u2014 Concept of'undertaking' within the meaning of Articles 85 and 86 of the EEC Treaty \u2014 Bodies respon\u00ad sible for the management of a special social security scheme. The Court was asked whether the concept of 'undertaking' within the meaning of Articles 85 and 86 of the EEC Treaty included bodies responsible for the management of social secur\u00ad ity schemes. In an important judgment the Court clearly ruled, for the first time, that social security bodies could not be described as 'undertakings' within the meaning of Articles 85 and 86 of the EEC Treaty and were not therefore subject to the EEC Treaty's competition rules (it had been contended before the national court that the insurance funds in question were in a domi\u00ad nant position, so that individuals were not free to approach any Community\u00adbased insurance company of their choice). The Court noted that, in the context of compe\u00ad tition law, the concept of 'undertaking' included any body which carried on a commer\u00ad cial activity, irrespective of its legal status or the way in which it is financed (see also Case C\u00ad41/90 H\u00f6fner and Eiser [1991] ECR 1\u00ad1979), and held that the activities of the body in question were non\u00adcommercial. Sickness insurance schemes or bodies entrusted with the management of a social security scheme as a public service fulfilled an exclus\u00ad ively social function. That activity was based on the principle of national solidarity and was not profit\u00admaking. The benefits paid out were statutory benefits and were independent of the amount of the contributions. The essential factor in the Court's analysis of the case would appear to be the principle of solidarity on which all social security schemes are based and which cannot operate without a system of compulsory membership, this being essential to the financial balance and, conse\u00ad quently, the survival of the scheme. 1.6.21. Judgment of 24 March, Case C\u00ad313/ 90 CIRFS and Others \u03bd Commission \u2014 State aid \u2014 Duty to give prior notice. The Court declared void the decision whereby the Commission had stated that aid need not be notified in advance under Article 93(2) of the EEC Treaty if it was granted under a scheme already approved. The aid in question was a grant made by France to help Allied Signal set up a plant 94 Bull. EC 3\u00ad1993 ",

The aid was granted under a French regional planning grants scheme which the Commission had authorized in 1984, subject to the specific rules applicable to certain indus\u00ad tries at that time or subsequently. The Court noted that under the rules laid down for the synthetic fibres industry in 1977 Mem\u00ad ber States had agreed to refrain from granting any aid designed to expand production capacity, even under regional development programmes, and were in any case obliged to give prior notice of any aid to this industry, irrespective of whether industrial or textile fibres were involved. The Court thus asserted the binding effect of rules or arrangements adopted by the Com\u00ad mission with the agreement of the Member States. 1.6.22.

The Court was asked to examine, in the light of Articles 92 and 117 of the EEC Treaty, the system established by a Member State whereby contracts of employment with seamen who were nationals of non-member countries and had no permanent abode in that Member State could provide for conditions of employment and rates of pay less favourable than those enjoyed by seamen who were nationals of that Member State. The Court held that the system in question was neither a State aid within the meaning of Article 92 nor in breach of Article 117. Only benefits granted directly or indirectly out of State resources were to be regarded as aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) (see Case 82/77 van Tiggde [1978] ECR 25). In that respect, by virtue of its object and general structure, the system in question did not seek to create an advantage amounting to an additional burden for the State but only to alter for the benefit of shipping companies the framework of contractual relations between them and their employees. The resulting conse\u00ad quences relating both to the different basis of calculation for social security contributions and any loss in tax revenue attributable to low rates of pay were inherent in the system and did not constitute a means of affording the businesses concerned a specific advantage. Thus, disregarding the loss of State revenue since it could not be shown that the aim was to confer a specific advantage on the businesses concerned, the Court concluded that the sys\u00ad tem in question did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1). As regards Article 117, the Court reaffirmed an earlier ruling to the effect that the provisions of this article were essentially in the nature of a programme (Case 126/86 Gim\u00e9nez Zaera [1987] ECR 3697). The Court stressed, however, that the social objectives referred to in Article 117 were important, particularly for the interpretation of other provisions of the EEC Treaty and secondary Community law in the social sphere. Common agricultural policy and fisheries 1.6.23. Judgment of 20 January, Joined Cases C-106/90, C-317/90 and C-129/91 Emerald Meats v Commission \u2014 Community tariff quo\u00ad tas for frozen beef \u2014 Management by the Commission. This judgment is interesting in that it defines the extent of the Commission's responsibilities in areas where Community management is decentralized (e.g. tariff quotas) and where duties and powers are shared between the Commission and the Member States. The applicant complained that the Com\u00ad mission had not verified the lists and infor\u00ad mation provided by the Irish authorities and had used them as a basis for its own implementing measures. The Court observed that Community manage\u00ad ment did not necessarily mean that the Com\u00ad mission was empowered, in specific cases, to correct any wrong decisions taken by national Bull. EC 3-1993 95 ",
        "Community lawcourts authorities in the course of such management, since observance of the common rules and their uniform application in all Member States could be enforced either by means of the procedure laid down in Article 169 of the EEC Treaty or by bringing an action in the national courts, to which the procedure described in Article 177 was also available. The Court's ruling confirmed the legitimacy of the Commission's approach in applying the subsidiarity principle to checks and inspec\u00ad tions. Physical checks could be left to the Mem\u00ad ber States (decentralized management) since legal checks (to ensure that all transactions were handled in accordance with the same rules) remained a matter for the Commission and the Court. External relations 1.6.24. Opinion 2/91 of 19 March \u2014 ILO Convention No 170 concerning safety in the use of chemicals at work. In response to a request submitted by the Com\u00ad mission pursuant to Article 228(1) of the EEC Treaty, the Court delivered the following opin\u00ad ion: 'The conclusion of ILO Convention No 170 is a matter which falls within the joint competence of the Member States and the Community'. While disagreeing with the Commission's view that the conclusion of the Convention was a matter solely for the Community, the Court provided significant clarification as to the scope of the Community's external powers and the approach which Member States and the Community should adopt in the exercise of any joint powers. The Court made the following main points: \u25a1 the authority of its AETR judgment could not be restricted to instances where the Com\u00ad munity had adopted Community rules within the framework of a common policy but was applicable in all areas corresponding to the objectives of the EEC Treaty; D since the EEC Treaty, and in particular Article 118a(3), provides for the adoption of minimum requirements to apply within the Community, there is nothing to prevent Mem\u00ad ber States from adopting more stringent measures either unilaterally or under inter\u00ad national agreements; thus, joint competence in external matters would seem to result from the setting of minimum requirements within the Community; D on the other hand, a number of barriers are erected by the Court against national measures in areas where powers are shared with the Community: measures must be 'common', must involve close cooperation 'both in the process of negotiation and conclusion and in the fulfilment of the obligations entered into', and must ensure 'unity in the international representation of the Community'. Institutional and budgetary matters 1.6.25. Judgment of 21 January, Case C\u00ad188/ 91 Deutsche Shell \u03bd HZA Hambur g\u00adHarbur g \u2014 Transit \u2014 International Convention. The Court held that it had jurisdiction to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of the Arrangements which had been adopted by the Joint Committee established by the EEC\u00ad EFTA Convention of 1987 on a common tran\u00ad sit procedure; the Arrangements were to be regarded as recommendations with no binding effect. Recalling its judgment in an earlier case (Case C\u00ad192/89 Sevince [1990] ECR 1\u00ad3461), the Court found that the Arrangements in question formed part of Community law by virtue of their direct connection with the agreement which they were implementing. It accordingly went on to hold that its jurisdiction to review recommendations made by the institutions (see Case C\u00ad322/88 Grimaldi [1989] ECR 4407) also encompassed those made by external bodies. The Court held that, although the Joint Com\u00ad mittee's recommendations could not confer rights enforceable in the national courts, those courts were none the less bound to take them into consideration in order to decide disputes submitted to them, in particular when they were, as in the main proceedings, useful for interpreting the provisions of the Convention. 1.6.26. Judgment of 17 March, Case C\u00ad155/ 91 Commission \u03bd Council \u2014 Directive on waste \u2014 Legal basis. 96 Bull. EC 3\u00ad1993 ",
        "European Investment Bank Reference: Council Directive 91/156/EEC of 18 March 1991: OJ L 78, 26.3.1991 This judgment clarified the criteria which should govern the choice of the legal basis for legislation. The Court pointed out that, as it had consist\u00ad ently held, this choice must be based on objec\u00ad tive factors which were amenable to judicial review and that those factors included in par\u00ad ticular the purpose and content of the measure (Case C-295/90 Parliament v Council [1992] ECR 1-4193). Difficulties arose if the measure in question pursued several aims for which different legal bases could be selected. In that event, the prin\u00ad cipal aim of the measure should determine the choice of legal basis. In this particular case, the Court found that the chief purpose of the harmonization pro\u00ad vided for in Directive 91/156/EEC was to safe\u00ad guard the environment by the efficient manage\u00ad ment of waste within the Community, what\u00ad ever the origin of the waste, and that consequently Article 130s was the appropriate legal basis for this measure and not Article 100a as the Commission contended. Although certain provisions of the Directive had an effect on conditions of competition and trade, this was not a determining factor. Council endorsement: Bull.

The Bank also continued its operations to sup\u00ad port small and medium-sized businesses (since the beginning of the year, around ECU 293.6 million has been granted from current global loans).

        "Economie and Social Committee Economic and Social Committee 304th plenary session 1.6.40. The Economic and Social Committee held its 304th plenary session on 24 and 25 March, chaired in turn by Mrs Tiemann and Mr Stecher Navarra and attended by Mr Paleokrassas, Member of the Commission. 1.6.41. Mr Paleokrassas briefed the Com\u00ad mittee on the outcome of the recent Council meeting on the environment. The ensuing debate provided members with the opportunity to express concern on a number of issues, in particular the Community strategy to reduce C0 2 emissions. The Committee agreed with the Council on objectives but not on the way of achieving them. The debate focused on the impact of environment policy on industrial competitiveness, cost\u00adsharing between rich and poor countries, possible financing from the new Cohesion Fund, and the application of subsidiarity. Subjects discussed included the need to increase cooperation with non\u00admember countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, and the absence of coordination between Com\u00ad munity policies for the environment and trans\u00ad port. In reply, Mr Paleokrassas stressed that indus\u00ad trial competitiveness and environmental pro\u00ad tection were not necessarily mutually exclusive, making it clear that the C0 2 tax would not be allowed to have a detrimental effect on indus\u00ad try and that there would be a gradual shift to investment in cleaner forms of energy. He announced that the Cohesion Fund would be used to help finance major environmental pro\u00ad jects and pointed out that the principle of subsi\u00ad diarity required the Community to do no more than establish minimum standards. 1.6.42. The Committee debated and adopted: \u25a1 opinions on the following: \u2014 continuing vocational training (\u00ad> point 1.2.59); \u2014 the Green Paper on the market for postal services (\u00ad\u00bb point 1.2.74); \u2014 packaging and packaging waste (\u00ad\u00bb point 1.2.98); \u2014 1993/94 farm prices (\u00ad> point 1.2.116); D an own\u00adinitiative opinion on relations between the Community and the Baltic States. 1.6.43.

        "Eastern Europe and the USSR THE CHALLENGE OF FREEDOM GILES MERRITT The sparks of unrest that leapt from Berlin in November 1989 to Moscow's Red Square in August 1991 are firing an explosion of political and economic change. Out of the ashes of Communism is emerging the shape of a vast new European market-place stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In his fascinating account of Europe's fast-changing East-West relationships, Giles Merritt argues that a massive rescue operation must be mounted to ensure the success of these changes. The upheaval of Com\u00ad munism's collapse is 'The challenge of freedom'. Written with the cooperation and support of the European Commis\u00ad sion, this book sets out to identify the key policy areas where a new part\u00ad nership is being forged between the countries of Eastern and Western Europe. It offers a privileged insight into the current thinking of European Community officials, poli\u00ad ticians and industrial leaders, and analyses the factors that will determine whether the emerging market econ\u00ad omies of Eastern Europe can truly be absorbed into a single European economy. Immensely readable and often disturbing, this important book contains much up-to-date and hith\u00ad erto unpublished information on such major East-West problem areas as energy, environmental control, immigration, trade relations, agricul\u00ad ture and investment. It also examines the arguments surrounding a 'Mar\u00ad shall Plan' for Eastern Europe that would emulate the famous US aid programme that helped relaunch the economies of Western Europe in the aftermath of World War II. For anyone concerned about the future of Eastern Europe and the USSR, whether from a political, social or economic standpoint, this book is essential reading. 256 pp. \u2014 Price: ECU 14.30 (excluding VAT) CM-71-91-655-EN-C ",

INF092 is really a simple market scoreboard, recording the state of play on the stage-by-stage progress of Commission proposals up to their adoption by the Council, summarizing each notable development and placing it in context, and keeping track of the transposition of directives into Member States' national legislation. Using INF092 is simplicity itself. It can be consulted on-screen by means of a wide range of everyday equipment connected to specialized data-relay networks. Fast transmission, the virtually instant updating facility (several times a day, if necessary) and dialogue procedures requiring no prior training make INF092 ideal for the general public as well as for business circles and the professions. The system offers easy access to information thanks to the choice of menus available and to the logical presentation modelled on the structure of the White Paper, the Social Charter and the decision-making process within the institutions.

        "Official Journal of the European Communities DIRECTORY OF COMMUNITY LEGISLATION IN FORCE and other acts of the Community institutions The Community's legal system is of direct concern to the individual citizen as much as to the Member States themselves. Both lawyers and non-lawyers, then, need to be familiar not just with national law, but also with Community legislation, which is implemented, applied or interpreted by national law and in some cases takes precedence over it. To make Community legislation more accessible to the public, the Commission of the European Communities publishes a Directory, updated twice a year, covering: - binding instruments of secondary legislation arising out of the Treaties establishing the three Communities (regulations, decisions, directives, etc.); - other legislation (internal agreements, etc.); - agreements between the Communities and non- member countries. Each entry in the Directory gives the number and title of the instrument, together with a reference to the Official Journal in which it is to be found. Any amending instruments are also indicated, with the appropriate references in each case. The legislation is classified by subject matter. Instruments classifiable in more than one subject area appear under each of the headings concerned. Official Journal of the European Communities DIRECTORY OF COMMUNITY LEGISLATION IN FORCE and other acts of the Community institutions The Directory proper (Vol. I) is accompanied by two indexes (Vol. II), one chronological by document number and the other alphabetical by keyword.

        "ENERGY A CHALLENGE FOR EUROPE AND THE WORLD Since it first appeared in 1985 Energy in Europe has become recognized as an invaluable source of information on both the policy-making and the operational aspects of European Community energy policy. Subscribers include leaders of energy-consuming and energy-producing industries and other decision-makers in the private and public sectors, as well as major consultancies and research institutes in and outside the Community. In the present situation within the Community, itself at the eve of the single market, and vis-\u00e0-vis the huge energy problems, as well as the potential, of our neighbours in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the energy sector is of the greatest strategic importance. An understanding of it is indispensable in many areas of economic activity. It also constitutes a crucial factor within a debate of truly global importance, namely the protection of the environ\u00ad ment, including the global warming issue. Energy in Europe continues to keep its readers abreast of the ongoing situation as regards overall policy, markets, energy planning, and the constant quest for cleaner and more efficient energy technology. Market trends and perspectives are covered in two regular issues each year, and also in a Short-term energy outlook appearing in the first half of the year and an Annual energy review at the end of the year which includes the world energy situation by region including EC Member States, the short-term energy outlook for the Community, and a review of trends in main indicators over 10 years. Further Special Issues are also produced in connection with major developments or events, including international conferences on or relevant to the energy sector.
