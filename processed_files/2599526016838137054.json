        "1 I n n o v a t i o n U n i o n p r o g r e s s a t c o u n t r y l e v e l : N e t h e r l a n d s Summary: Performance in research and innovation The indicators in the table below present a synthesis of research and innovation (R&I) performance in the Netherlands. They relate knowledge investment and input to performance and economic output throughout the innovation cycle. They show thematic strengths in key technologies and also the high-tech and medium-tech contribution to the trade balance. The indicator on excellence in science and technology takes into consideration the quality of scientific production as well as technological development. The Innovation Output Indicator covers technological innovation, skills in knowledge-intensive activities, the competitiveness of knowledge-intensive goods and services, and the innovativeness of fast-growing enterprises, focusing on innovation output. The indicator on knowledge-intensity of the economy focuses on the economy\u2019s sectoral composition and specialisation and shows the evolution of the weight of knowledge-intensive sectors and products. Netherlands Towards enhanced cooperation between research institutions, businesses and public authorities In terms of GERD (Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D), the Netherlands is performing above the EU-28 average (2.16 % of GDP in 2012 of which 1.22 % came from the private sector) including the GBAORD (Government Budget Appropriations or Outlays on R&D) with 0.78 % of GDP. The R&D intensity in the business sector (BERD) is relatively low (1.22 % in 2012), but increasing. According to the Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014, the Netherlands ranks second amongst the \u2018innovation followers\u2019. However, the Netherlands is a \u2018moderate grower\u2019 maintaining its level of the 2011 Innovation Union Scoreboard with relative strengths in \u2018Open, excellent and attractive research systems\u2019 and for \u2018Linkages and entrepreneurship\u2019 and relative weaknesses in \u2018Firm investments\u2019 and \u2018Innovators\u2019. Further to the main policy response (\u2018To the Top\u2019) to the national challenges launched in 2011, the next target for the Netherlands is to restore confidence and harness growth while simultaneously stabilising public finances and supporting the continued balance sheet adjustment at a measured pace. These challenges concern fiscal policy, the pension system, labour market regulation and the housing market. Efforts within fiscal constraints to promote innovation and safeguard growth-enhancing expenditure are key to achieving a balanced adjustment. Gradually improving the housing market at a sustainable pace is a defining element of the strategy. Moreover, additional efforts to reduce regulatory disincentives on labour would make work more attractive. Despite the overall good performance of the Dutch school system, there is a need to address quality and excellence across educational levels, in particular, engineering and technology-related professions that should be addressed. The current government is continuing with its enterprise policy, including its \u2018top-sector\u2019 approach, and Strategic Agenda for Higher Education and Research (including joint roadmaps, Human Capital Agenda and the Technology Pact).

        "2 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Investing in knowledge Over the period 2000-2008, Dutch R&D intensity fell from 1.94 % to 1.77 %, largely reflecting a parallel drop in business expenditure on R&D. In contrast, since 2008, the R&D intensity rapidly increased to reach 2.16 % in 2012, initially driven by public expenditure and, since 2011, by business expenditure, too. In spite of this rebound, the Dutch R&I system is still characterised by a relatively low R&D intensity in the business sector against a relatively high R&D intensity within the public sector. In 2012, business R&D intensity (1.22 %) was below the EU average (1.31 %) while public R&D intensity (0.93 %) was higher than the EU average of 0.74 %. Tax incentives comprise WBSO 3 , tax credit for private R&D wage costs, RDA 4 tax allowance for private non-wage R&D investment, and the Innovation Box offering a low tax rate for R&D-related profits. To address capital market shortcomings related to innovative projects and enterprises, the Netherlands has expanded those instruments to increase the availability of risk capital, especially through the Innovation Fund SME+ (innovation credit, seed capital and Fund of Funds) together with the European Investment Fund. The Netherlands\u2019 participation in the EU\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme has been successful with an EC contribution of EUR 3.145 billion up to the end of 2013, representing 7.3 % of total EC funding, ranking fifth among the Member States. The success rate was 22.56 %, which is the second highest among participating countries. the private sector are being promoted through generic instruments such as tax incentives and financing innovative entrepreneurship through risk capital. The Dutch R&I system has succeeded in maintaining its innovative capacity during the financial crisis, with high efficiency and effectiveness of public R&D investment, improved S&T excellence from an already high level and the development of hot spots in key technologies, and greater R&D intensity. These efforts are reflected in the competitiveness of the Dutch economy, which is benefiting from a positive contribution by high-tech and medium-tech products to the trade balance. The Dutch economy is very knowledge-intensive and Dutch enterprises \u2013 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular \u2013 are more innovative in product or process innovation than the EU average.

In addition to these challenges, the government announced its National Technology Pact 2020 which involves commitments from both public and private stakeholders. Their representatives from various horizons will ensure this strategy\u2019s implementation and foster the innovative capacity of Dutch companies.

        "4 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U The Netherlands is performing better than the EU average on most S&T indicators and currently ranks first for the number of scientific publications within the 10 % most-cited scientific publications worldwide, a clear sign of the quality of its scientific output. Other areas of marked performance include public-private cooperation, intellectual property, attractiveness for foreign doctoral students, and international cooperation. Furthermore, strong dynamics are visible in the business funding of public research, business innovation expenditure (non-R&D), innovating SMEs, new doctorate holders, and international scientific co-publications. The Netherlands\u2019 scientific and technological strengths The graph below illustrates the areas, based on the Framework Programme thematic priorities, where the Netherlands shows scientific and technological specialisations. Both the specialisation index (SI, based on the number of publications) and the revealed technological advantage (RTA, based on the number of patents) measure the country\u2019s scientific (SI) and technological (RTA) capacity compared to that at the world level. Each specialisation field provides information on the growth rate in the number of publications and patents. In contrast, the two main weaknesses of the Dutch innovation system are the relatively weak business R&D intensity and a low level of science and engineering graduates amongst 25-34-year-olds. However, the latest European Patent Organisation (EPO) figures show an increase in patenting activities of 17.2 % in 2013, placing the Netherlands in eighth position worldwide. For the country\u2019s future innovation capacity, the government recognises that increasing the number of S&T graduates is an important goal, for which the \u2018Techniekpact\u2019 is instrumental. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 1 Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Science-Metrix Canada; Bocconi University, Italy Notes: ( 1 ) Values over 1 show specialisation; values under 1 show a lack of specialisation.

        "5 The Netherlands has a relative specialisation \u2013 either scientific or technological \u2013 in most of the selected thematic priorities shown above, in particular in health, socio-economics sciences, food, agriculture and fisheries, ICT, and construction and construction technologies, some of which coincide with the top sectors in the Dutch enterprise policy \u2018To-the-Top\u2019. The only exceptions are automobiles, energy, and new production technologies. However, a comparison of the Dutch scientific and technological specialisations in these priorities shows a mixed situation with some co-specialisations as well as some mismatches. Technology production is strongly specialised in food, agriculture and fisheries, and ICT, but also holds strong positions in the environment, nanosciences and nanotechnologies, biotechnology, security, and other transport technologies. In contrast, the main fields of scientific specialisation are construction and construction technologies, health, socio-economic sciences, and humanities and, to a lesser extent, in aeronautics and the environment. The best matches between science and technology specialisations are in environment, and construction and construction technologies, while partial matching can also be seen in nanosciences and nanotechnologies, food, agriculture and fisheries, biotechnology, ICT, and security. The graph below illustrates the positional analysis of Dutch publications showing the country\u2019s situation in terms of scientific specialisation and scientific impact over the period 2000-2010. The scientific production of the country is reflected by the size of bubbles, which corresponds to the share of scientific publications from a science field in the country\u2019s total publications. \u0017 Netherlands \u2013 Positional analysis of publications in Scopus (specialisation versus impact), 2000\u20132010 Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Science-Metrix Canada, based on Scopus Note: Scientific specialisation includes 2000\u20132010 data; the impact is calculated for publications of 2000\u20132006, citation window 2007\u20132009.

These PPPs are served through 19 top consortia for TKI aimed at societal and business needs. To stimulate private contributions, the government grants TKI allowances (25 % of private contributions), and to encourage involvement from SMEs, the MIT 7 scheme provides several instruments, such as innovation vouchers, targetting SMEs\u2019 needs. Through the signed \u2018innovation contracts\u2019 for 2014/2015, top sector stakeholders promised an annual research investment of almost EUR 2 billion (of which about EUR 970 million is provided by the private partners (enterprises) and EUR 1.06 billion by public investments). These innovation contracts \u2013 a mixed balance between fundamental research, applied research and valorisation \u2013 were tailored to the market needs and aligned to most thematic topics in the EU\u2019s Framework Programmes and Horizon 2020. For the period 2014-2017, an annual budget of EUR 50 million (JTI, Eurostars) and EUR 36 million for other programmes (e.g. ERA- net) has been agreed. The TKIs have a goal of EUR 500 million in public-private research in 2015 with at least 40 % financed by private partners. This means a significant increase compared to the 10 to 35 % of private contributions to PPP programmes before 2012. From 2013 onwards, the cabinet will raise the TKI-allowance budget from EUR 56 million to EUR 130 million in 2017. The limited cooperation between enterprises and research institutions is addressed by part of the programmes for fundamental research in line with top-sector topics, while maintaining research excellence. To this end, NWO (The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research) will allocate an increasing amount (up to EUR 275 million in 2015) to those topics from various NWO instruments, while the Dutch ministries will contribute EUR 59.1 million to relevant TKI programmes to provide solutions to societal challenges. Emerging skill shortages and mismatches, especially in engineering and technology, have been identified and represent a bottleneck for growth. Therefore, and in view of the European 2020 objectives, a \u2018Technology Pact\u2019 was signed in 2013 to complement the top sector\u2019s \u2018Human Capital Agendas\u2019. For education and academic quality achievements, the budget will be raised to EUR 245 million in 2016, in addition to EUR 100 million to reward best universities\u2019 and colleges\u2019 performances. The \u2018Policy on Science\u2019 and the \u2018Science in Transition\u2019 programmes were also set up to leverage the shortage of skilled workers, but it would be premature to monitor their impacts at present. In 2013, the Netherlands faced the challenge of widening its innovation capacity and maintaining levels of funding for fundamental research, by providing suitable incentives through its enterprise policies, high-added-value production and services, and an increase in private investments in the R&I system. Despite a slight growth in business R&D intensity, the numbers of new graduates in science and engineering and doctorates have declined in recent years. The reform undertaken in education should be closely linked to the top-sector strategy and should align the education system to the needs identified by businesses. Several programmes \u2013 \u2018Training for Teachers\u2019, Science Acquisition, Technology Pact and Human Capital Agendas, etc. \u2013 were set up to meet the needs, but it is too early to assess their results. In 2014, the government adapted its fiscal innovation instruments to support R&D in order to encourage SMEs and offer more opportunities for growth among the innovative ones. The first of these lies with the WBSO (R&D salary costs) where the ceiling of the top layer is extended from EUR 200 000 to EUR 250 000 (with 50 % off for start-ups) and its tariff reduced from 38 % to 35 %. The other instrument relates to an increase in the percentage of RDA (reduction in R&D costs and investments) to 60 % (compared to 54 % in 2013 and 40 % in 2012). Together with the Innovation Funds (MKB) and other measures (WBSO, Innovation Box), the budget outlays for generic measures will reach more than EUR 2 billion in 2015. So far, approximately 1800 enterprises have signed up for one or more knowledge and innovation (TKI 6 programmes, of which 70 % are SMEs. The enterprise policy will shift significantly from direct funding by the government to fiscal incentives for R&D. Total R&D funds allocated by the central government will reach EUR 6.400 billion in 2016, of which 52.62 % (as against 48.29 % in 2013) has been allocated to fundamental research and 26 % to fiscal R&D measures. The reduced budget for applied research to 10.72 % reflects the government\u2019s choice to provide better incentives to applied research institutes to earn more private funding through public private partnerships. In addition to the generic instruments, the enterprise policy also uses specific policies delivered through the nine top sectors: chemicals, creative industry, logistics, health, high-tech, agro- food, water, energy, and horticulture. Primarily, these sectors serve as a coordination mechanism for public private partnerships (PPPs), linking 6 TKI \u2013 Topconsortia voor Kennis en Innovatie 7 MIT \u2013 MKB-Innovatiestimulering Topsectoren ",
        "7 Innovation Output Indicator The Innovation Output Indicator, launched by the European Commission in 2013, was developed at the request of the European Council to benchmark national innovation policies and to monitor the EU\u2019s performance against its main trading partners. It measures the extent to which ideas stemming from innovative sectors are capable of reaching the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. The indicator focuses on four policy axes: growth via technology (patents); jobs (knowledge- intensive employment); long-term global competitiveness (trade in mid/high-tech commodities); and future business opportunities (jobs in fast-growing firms in innovative sectors). The graph below enables a comparison of the Dutch position regarding the indicator\u2019s different components. 8 The Netherlands also performs well in Community trademarks and designs. 2012 2010 EU EU EU EU EU EU EU 0.0 0.0 0.1 5.0 2.5 0.2 10.0 75.0 100.0 25.0 50.0 0.0 0.0 2.5 7.5 5.0 7.5 KIA PCT COMP DYN GOOD 0.0 20.0 Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Eurostat, OECD, Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014, DG JRC Notes: All data refer to 2012 except PCT data, which refer to 2010.

The relatively good performance in patents is partially explained by the strong electric products and electronics sector, with the Dutch companies Philips, NXP and ASML ranking among the largest patent producers in Europe 8 . The share of medium-high and high-tech goods in total goods exports is below the EU average, partly due to the relatively high exports of agricultural products and of natural gas, not listed as high- and medium-tech products. The relatively low performance in knowledge- intensive service exports can be explained by the very high level of licence fees and royalties, which are not classified as KIS, although they employ highly skilled labour. The Netherlands performs below the EU average in terms of the innovativeness of its fast-growing companies, which results from a high share of wholesale and retail trades, and administrative and support service activities among fast-growing enterprises.

        "8 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Upgrading the manufacturing sector through research and technologies The graph below illustrates the upgrading of knowledge in different manufacturing industries. The position on the horizontal axis illustrates the changing weight of each industry sector in value added over the period. The general trend to the left-hand side reflects the decline in manufacturing in the overall economy. The sectors above the x-axis are those where research intensity has increased over time. The size of the bubble represents the sector share (in value added) in manufacturing (for all sectors presented on the graph). The red sectors are high-tech (HT) or medium-high-tech (MHT) sectors. Most manufacturing sectors contracted during the initial phase of the crisis (2008-2010), with the exception of food products, beverages and tobacco and of three HT and MHT sectors (pharmaceuticals; machinery and equipment, and computer, electronic and optical products). In comparison with the 1995-2007 period, during which all HT and MHT sectors had become more R&D intensive, the BERD intensity of pharmaceuticals and of chemicals and chemical products decreased between 2008 and 2010. Conversely, other sectors, in particular construction, substantially increased their R&D intensity. Overall, total BERD over GDP remained constant during 2008-2010 but the manufacturing sector as a whole became slightly more R&D intensive. -25 -10 -5 -20 -15 5 0 10 90 20 40 -25 50 60 70 80 0 10 30 -10 -30 Share of value added in total value added - average annual growth (%), 2008\u20132010 ( 1 ) B E R D i n t e n s i t y - a v e r a g e a n n u a l g r o w t h ( % ) , 2 0 0 8 \u2013 2 0 1 0 ( 1 ) Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Eurostat Notes: ( 1 ) \u2018Furniture and other manufacturing\u2019: 2008\u20132011.
