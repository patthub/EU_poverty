        "Views of the Committee of the Regions The Committee of the Regions 1. welcomes the Commission's proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings; 2. recognises that energy efficiency makes a key contribution to the requirement of climate protection and to meeting the Union's reduction obligations as agreed in Kyoto, and recommends that the Commission continues to strive to increase its commitment to achieving its Kyoto obligation; 3. welcomes the Commission's determination, to improve energy efficiency in buildings, which will lead to a more sustainable energy policy and enhanced security of supply, and will provide a key step towards reducing greenhouse gas emission to protect the climate, as agreed in Kyoto; 4. stresses that the Directive is designed to complement and reinforce Member State activity as required under the subsidiarity principle; 5. underlines the unique position which local and municipal authorities have at the consumer level, regarding spatial planning regulation, building regulation, enforcement, and other policies; 6. emphasises the employment creating potential that the proposed Directive presents; 7. welcomes the degree of flexibility in the proposal for existing buildings especially with regard to heritage and other sensitive locations where energy efficiency measures in the building envelope may not be appropriate or feasible; 8. welcomes the specific targeting of the building envelope but would urge the Commission to strengthen the labelling scheme, and promote legislation that would urge companies to produce more energy efficient appliances; 9. welcomes the fact that public buildings and those frequented by the public will be prioritised in this Directive and emphasise how well placed local and regional authorities are in this regard; 10. welcomes initiatives to harmonise Member State activities in energy efficiency, and recognises that this is one step to make their activities more coherent in the broader European context; CdR 202/2001 finEN/o ",
        "- 3- Recommendations of the Committee of the Regions The Committee of the Regions 11. urges the Commission to ensure that pre-accession countries would adopt energy efficiency legislation, in parallel with the existing Member States; 12. stresses the need for incremental measures, whilst recognising the need for speedy implementation of legislation - it is important that measures be adopted over a phased period, but not to the detriment of deadline already proposed; 13. stresses the need to link health and safety with energy certification of public buildings, and in so doing emphasise the necessity for the Directive to contribute to the integration of energy and environmental objectives into other policy areas; 14. emphasises the need for increased energy efficiency in publicly owned dwellings particularly since the occupants of these properties may often be more affected by fuel poverty; 15. requests that the Commission expand the Directive to ensure that life cycle analysis of the building envelope would be included in order to illustrate its impact on the carbon cycle. Thereby ensuring that consumers and regulators would see more clearly the carbon implications of products within the envelope of buildings; 16. urges the Commission to continue to promote and exploit indigenous energy sources with particular emphasis on renewables; 17. welcomes the proposal of the Commission to establish a common methodology for integrated energy performance standards, and seeks the speedy introduction of the application of these standards to new buildings and to certain existing buildings when they are being renovated; 18. welcomes a proposal to certify schemes for new and existing buildings on the basis of these new standards, and asks that not only single buildings be included, but also buildings that are within the same development where the combined floor area is greater than 1,000 m ; 19. encourages Member States and where relevant local and municipal authorities to bring forward legislation that would associate energy usage in a building with a financial incentive for the owner of that building, and also that would reward the owners of buildings that incorporate passive solar design; 20. urges the Commission to expand programmes such as the SAVE programme to include concrete measures, such as retro-fitting of buildings, in order to provide the necessary kick-start that the Directive may require; CdR 202/2001 finEN/o .../... ",
        "- 4- 21. points out that programmes should be introduced to include an area of activity specific to local and regional authorities, considering the implications that the Directive will have for buildings frequented by the public, as well as for local authority housing; 22. stresses the need to expand pre-accession activities especially in the areas of energy audits, and the establishment of regional and local energy offices, as well as in concrete measures; 23. points out to the Commission the central role of local and regional authorities in energy management, and in particular would highlight the potential of the SAVE energy management agencies in assisting in the implementation of this Directive in cities, regions, and islands throughout the EU and in pre-accession countries; 24. stresses the need to ensure that, in the absence of harmonisation, where some Member States apply legislation in advance of another, trade between the Member States would not be adversely affected.
