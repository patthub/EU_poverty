        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM In November 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate individual Framework Agreements on Partnership and Cooperation (PCA) with Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Negotiations with the Philippines started in February 2009 and were concluded in June 2010. Following endorsement by Coreper, both sides initialled the PCA on 25 June 2010. The PCA with the Philippines is the second of its kind in South East Asia, following the PCA with Indonesia, which was signed in November 2009. It is the first-ever bilateral agreement with the Philippines and supersedes the current legal framework of the 1980 Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The PCA contains legally binding commitments which are central to the EU\u2019s foreign policy, including provisions on human rights, non- proliferation, counter-terrorism, the International Criminal Court, migration and taxation. It also includes areas of current interest such as the peace process and disaster risk management. The PCA broadens considerably the scope for mutual engagement in the economic and trade domain as well as justice and home affairs. It provides opportunities for cooperation in areas such as the environment and climate change, energy, and science and technology, as well as maritime and air transport. The Agreement also addresses money laundering and terrorist financing, illicit drugs, organised crime and corruption. It has an important development component, including, for the first time, strict provisions for the protection of the EU\u2019s financial interests. The PCA also has an important trade cooperation section, which should facilitate free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations in accordance with EU policy to conclude FTAs with ASEAN countries. Politically, the PCA with the Philippines marks an important step towards strengthening the EU\u2019s role in South-East Asia, based on shared universal values such as democracy and human rights. It paves the way for enhancing political, regional and global cooperation between two like-minded partners. The implementation of the PCA will entail practical benefits for both sides, forming a basis for the promotion of the EU\u2019s broader political and economic interests. This is particularly important in a region that is traditionally oriented towards China and the United States. ",
