        "Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union Eurostat publishes official, harmonised statistics on the European Union (EU) and the euro area which offer an objective portrayal of social and economic trends. These statistics are available for EU Member States, and are sometimes broken down by region. Furthermore, some of the indicators are published for candidate countries and other non-member countries. Eurostat collects data from national statistical institutes; the statistics are harmonised according to Europe-wide methodologies. Data are, therefore, genuinely comparable across the whole of the EU. Website Eurostat\u2019s website: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat provides free access to EU statistics, and is also available in German and French. Statistics Explained is a wiki-based system that presents statistical topics in an easy to understand way. Together, the articles make up an encyclopaedia of European statistics and can be accessed at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained. There one can also access continuously updated virtual publications http://bit.ly/ Eurostat_yearbook and http://bit.ly/Eurostat_regional _yearbook. Eurostat releases a range of publications, all of which are free of charge on its website in PDF format; some of these are also available in German and French. Among these, the pocketbook Key figures on Europe \u2014 2011 edition provides a comprehensive set of information introducing readers to most statistical themes that are covered by Eurostat.

The euro area (EA-17) is composed of: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland. The EU (EU-27) includes the EA-17 countries and also: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The three EFTA countries covered are: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. The information presented in this short guide is generally based on fixed EU and euro area aggregates for 27 and 17 Member States respectively \u2013 however, the data for inflation is based on moving aggregates that reflect the membership of the EU and euro area over time. Quarterly growth rates are expressed in relation to the previous quarter. Quarterly rates are generally calculated using seasonally adjusted data, although rates for the public balance, government debt and long-term unemployment are based on non seasonally adjusted data. Furthermore, annual rates of change for inflation are also based on non seasonally adjusted data.
