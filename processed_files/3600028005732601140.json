        "RECOMMENDATIONS COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 20 February 2013 Investing in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage (2013/112/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 292 thereof, Whereas: (1) Respect for human dignity is a founding value of the European Union, whose aims include promoting the well-being of its people; the Union must protect the rights of the child, combat social exclusion and discrimi\u00ad nation, promote social justice and protection; (2) Children ( 1 ) are more at risk of poverty or social exclusion than the overall population in a large majority of EU countries; children growing up in poverty or social exclusion are less likely than their better-off peers to do well in school, enjoy good health and realise their full potential later in life; (3) Preventing the transmission of disadvantage across gener\u00ad ations is a crucial investment in Europe\u2019s future, as well as a direct contribution to the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, with long-term benefits for children, the economy and society as a whole; (4) Early intervention and prevention are essential for developing more effective and efficient policies, as public expenditure addressing the consequences of child poverty and social exclusion tends to be greater than that needed for intervening at an early age; (5) Tackling disadvantage in early years is an important means of stepping up efforts to address poverty and social exclusion in general. Prevention is most effectively achieved through integrated strategies that combine support to parents to access the labour market with adequate income support and access to services that are essential to children\u2019s outcomes, such as quality (pre-school) education, health, housing and social services, as well as opportunities to participate and use their rights, which help children live up to their full potential and contribute to their resilience; (6) The most successful strategies in addressing child poverty have proved to be those underpinned by policies improving the well-being of all children, whilst giving careful consideration to children in particularly vulnerable situations; (7) The promotion of gender equality, gender mainstreaming and equal opportunities, as well as the fight against discrimination faced by children and their families on all grounds (particularly those related to sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation) should underpin any efforts to address child poverty and social exclusion; (8) The current financial and economic crisis is having a serious impact on children and families, with a rise in the proportion of those living in poverty and social exclusion in a number of countries; (9) Budget consolidation efforts due to growing fiscal constraints in a number of countries present significant challenges to ensure that social policies remain adequate and effective in the short as well as the long run; (10) More than a decade of cooperation at EU level has led to a common understanding of the determinants of child poverty through substantial work on developing appro\u00ad priate monitoring indicators, identifying common chal\u00ad lenges and successful policy approaches, which has given political momentum to the issue; subsequently, the Commission has announced the adoption of a Recommendation on Child Poverty in the Communi\u00ad cation on \u2018the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion\u2019 ( 2 ); (11) The Europe 2020 Strategy has given new impetus to efforts to address poverty and social exclusion in the EU, by setting a common European target to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion by at least 20 million by 2020, as well as EN 2.3.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 59/5 ( 1 ) In line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, children are understood in this context as persons under the age of 18.

        "stepping up efforts to address early school leaving. Tackling and preventing child poverty are an essential part of the EU and Member States\u2019 efforts in this respect, and form part of the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion; (12) The current governance under the European Semester serves to ensure implementation of the relevant Country-Specific Recommendations to combat child poverty and improve children\u2019s well-being; (13) All EU Member States have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The standards and principles of the UNCRC must continue to guide EU policies and actions that have an impact on the rights of the child; (14) By way of the June 2012 Social Protection Committee advisory report ( 1 ) and key messages, as well as the October 2012 EPSCO Council Conclusions \u2018Preventing and tackling child poverty and social exclusion and promoting children\u2019s well-being\u2019 ( 2 ), Member States reaf\u00ad firmed their commitment and welcomed the Commis\u00ad sion\u2019s initiative to adopt a Recommendation on the issue; (15) Various EU policies have addressed issues linked to child poverty and the inter-generational transmission of disadvantage, in particular in the fields of education and training, health, children\u2019s rights and gender equal\u00ad ity ( 3 ); (16) While policies addressing child poverty are primarily the competence of Member States, a common European framework can strengthen synergies across relevant policy areas, help Member States review their policies and learn from each other\u2019s experiences in improving policy efficiency and effectiveness through innovative approaches, whilst taking into account the different situ\u00ad ations and needs at local, regional and national level; (17) In the context of the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework, such guidance can also provide a basis for further cooperation and a focus for using relevant financial instruments, particularly the Structural Funds, to deliver on the proposed objective of \u2018Promoting social inclusion and combating poverty\u2019. RECOMMENDS THAT MEMBER STATES: Organise and implement policies to address child poverty and social exclusion, promoting children\u2019s well-being, through multi-dimensional strategies, in accordance with the following guidelines: 1. BE GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING HORIZONTAL PRIN\u00ad CIPLES \u2014 Tackle child poverty and social exclusion through inte\u00ad grated strategies that go beyond ensuring children\u2019s material security and promote equal opportunities so that all children can realise their full potential; \u2014 Address child poverty and social exclusion from a children\u2019s rights approach, in particular by referring to the relevant provisions of the Treaty on the European Union, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, making sure that these rights are respected, protected and fulfilled; \u2014 Always take the child\u2019s best interests as a primary consideration and recognise children as independent rights-holders, whilst fully acknowledging the importance of supporting families as primary carers; \u2014 Maintain an appropriate balance between universal policies, aimed at promoting the well-being of all children, and targeted approaches, aimed at supporting the most disadvantaged; \u2014 Ensure a focus on children who face an increased risk due to multiple disadvantage such as Roma children, some migrant or ethnic minority children, children with special needs or disabilities, children in alternative care and street children, children of imprisoned parents, as well as children within households at particular risk of poverty, such as single parent or large families; \u2014 Sustain investment in children and families, allowing for policy continuity and long-term planning; assess how policy reforms affect the most disadvantaged and take steps to mitigate any adverse effects.
