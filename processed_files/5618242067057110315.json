        "Foreword \"The European Commission's Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (\"EaSI\") is a clear expression of our firm commitment to create jobs and growth and improve social conditions across Europe. This report showcases close to 50 successful and inspiring projects financed by the EaSI Programme and its predecessors, EURES and PROGRESS. A special focus is brought on the European added value, with a real effort to show where and how EU funding mostly contributes and can make a difference in people's lives. I hope that this report will inspire many public, private and civil society actors to apply for EU funding and build their own projects in the area of employment and social innovation.\u201d Marianne Thyssen Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility ",

        "8 Abstract The European Commission co-finances actions of public, private and civil society actors enabling them to deliver new services, assess existing policies or develop new ones, and exchange good practices in the fields of employment, working conditions, social protection and social inclusion. To facilitate the dissemination of achieved results, this report presents examples of 30 projects and 19 organisations supported by the Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) as well as its predecessor programmes EURES and PROGRESS. In the first part of this report, the reader will find examples and analysis of projects funded by PROGRESS and EURES in 2013- 2016. The aims of the projects supported by the predecessor PROGRESS programme ranged from developing innovative policy interventions (social policy experimentation) and supporting the reform of national pensions systems to building partnerships between employment services and setting up European Sectoral Skills Councils. The overviewed EURES projects aimed at placing young people into quality jobs and supporting partnerships between employment services working in cross-border areas. The second part of the report presents EaSI-supported activities implemented in 2015 by major EU-level organisations active in the promotion of social inclusion, poverty reduction and access to finance. The overviewed organisations aimed in particular to support the Commission\u2019s social investment approach at national and local levels and the implementation of the Social Investment Package, the Social Business Initiative and the Europe 2020 Strategy. The report also includes a description of the methodology used to collect information on the presented actions and to analyse their results. Among other things, the report seeks to shed light on the European added value of the described actions and to single out potential good practices. We believe that this report will be beneficial in two key ways. First, it will serve as guidance for public, private and civil society actors wishing to apply for EU funding in the future. Second, it will provide policy-makers with food for thought in order to design and implement new policy interventions in the respective policy areas. ",

Pour faciliter la diffusion des r\u00e9sultats obtenus, le pr\u00e9sent rapport pr\u00e9sente des exemples tir\u00e9s de 30 projets et 19 organisations financ\u00e9s par le programme pour l\u2019emploi et l\u2019innovation sociale (EaSI) ainsi que par les programmes EURES et PROGRESS qui l\u2019ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Le lecteur trouvera dans la premi\u00e8re partie du rapport des exemples et analyses de projets financ\u00e9s par PROGRESS et EURES sur la p\u00e9riode 2013-2016. Les objectifs des projets soutenus par le programme pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent PROGRESS vont du d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019interventions politiques innovantes (exp\u00e9rimentation de politique sociale) et du soutien aux syst\u00e8mes nationaux de retraite jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la construction de partenariat entre des services de l\u2019emploi et la cr\u00e9ation du Conseil sectoriel europ\u00e9en des comp\u00e9tences. Les projets EURES examin\u00e9s visaient \u00e0 placer les jeunes dans des emplois de qualit\u00e9 et \u00e0 soutenir les partenariats entre services de l\u2019emploi travaillant dans des zones transfrontali\u00e8res. La deuxi\u00e8me partie du rapport pr\u00e9sente les activit\u00e9s financ\u00e9es par EaSI et mises en \u0153uvre en 2015 par les principales organisations europ\u00e9ennes actives dans le domaine de la promotion de l\u2019inclusion sociale, de la r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 et de l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux financements. Les organisations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ont notamment pour objectifs de soutenir l\u2019approche d\u2019investissement social de la Commission aux niveaux nationaux et locaux et de soutenir la mise en \u0153uvre du paquet d\u2019investissements sociaux, de l\u2019initiative entreprises sociales et de la strat\u00e9gie Europe 2020. Le rapport inclut \u00e9galement une description de la m\u00e9thodologie utilis\u00e9e pour collecter des informations sur les actions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, et pour analyser leurs r\u00e9sultats.

Um die Verbreitung der dabei erzielten Ergebnisse zu verbessern, stellt dieser Bericht beispielhaft 30 Projekte und 19 Organisationen vor, die im Rahmen des Programms f\u00fcr Besch\u00e4ftigung und soziale Innovation (EaSI) und von dessen Vorg\u00e4ngerprogrammen EURES und PROGRESS gef\u00f6rdert wurden. Im ersten Teil des Berichts findet der Leser Fallbeispiele und Analysen zu Projekten, die von 2013 bis 2016 durch die Programme PROGRESS und EURES mitfinanziert wurden. Das Vorg\u00e4ngerprogramm PROGRESS f\u00f6rderte zum Beispiel Projekte, die innovative politische Ans\u00e4tze (sozialpolitische Modellprojekte) erarbeiten, die Reform nationaler Rentensysteme begleiten oder zum Aufbau von Partnerschaften zwischen Arbeitsvermittlungsstellen oder zur Schaffung sektoraler Kompetenzr\u00e4ten beitragen. Die untersuchten EURES-Projekte hatten das Ziel, jungen Menschen in hochwertige Arbeitspl\u00e4tze zu vermitteln und Partnerschaften von Arbeitsvermittlungsstellen in Grenzregionen aufzubauen. Der zweite Teil des Berichts stellt die Ma\u00dfnahmen wichtiger europaweit t\u00e4tiger Organisationen vor, die im Jahr 2015 im Rahmen von EaSI gef\u00f6rdert wurden und sich f\u00fcr soziale Eingliederung, den Kampf gegen Armut und einen besseren Zugang zu Finanzdienstleistungen einsetzten. Die beteiligten Organisationen hatten insbesondere das Ziel, die Strategie der Kommission f\u00fcr mehr Sozialinvestitionen auf nationaler und lokaler Ebene sowie die Umsetzung des Sozialinvestitionspakets, der Initiative f\u00fcr soziales Unternehmertum und der Strategie Europa 2020 zu unterst\u00fctzen. Au\u00dferdem enth\u00e4lt der Bericht eine Beschreibung der Methoden, die verwendet wurden, um Daten \u00fcber die vorgestellten Ma\u00dfnahmen zu erfassen und deren Ergebnisse zu analysieren. Unter anderem m\u00f6chte der Bericht den europ\u00e4ischen Mehrwert der untersuchten Ma\u00dfnahmen erfassen und bew\u00e4hrte Verfahren hervorheben. Wir glauben, dass dieser Bericht in zweierlei Hinsicht Nutzen bringt. Erstens kann er \u00f6ffentlichen, privaten und zivilgesellschaftlichen Akteure, die k\u00fcnftig F\u00f6rdermittel der EU beantragen m\u00f6chten, als Leitfaden dienen. Und zweitens bietet er politischen Entscheidungstr\u00e4gern wertvolle Denkanst\u00f6\u00dfe zur Entwicklung und Umsetzung neuer politischer Ma\u00dfnahmen in den behandelten Politikbereichen. ",
        "11 Introduction Analysing and disseminating information about the results of supported projects and organisations are part of the performance monitoring of the EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) ( 1 ) 2014-2020. The programme\u2019s monitoring approach foresees biannual reports presenting examples of projects and organisations supported by EaSI and its predecessor programmes EURES and PROGRESS. This is the fifth such report, which follows the first four issued in 2014-2016. This report reviews projects that were funded by the predecessor instruments PROGRESS and EURES as well as activities of the EaSI-supported major EU-level organisations (networks of NGOs) promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and access to finance for vulnerable groups of society as well as social entrepreneurs. The report consists mainly of fiches that present in concise and uniform format the results of a given project or organisation. The report provides an overall description of successful projects and organisations, focusing in particular on the results and European added value as well as potential good practices among these actions. In addition, project/organisation fiches were developed with the aim of making them easily accessible as stand-alone documents and useful to all informed stakeholders (decision-makers, social partners, NGOs, academia, media and civil society at large). The purpose of this report is to improve learning among the public authorities of Member States, civil society organisations and private actors working in the field, in order to support future policy developments. We believe that the report will be beneficial to the above-mentioned actors in at least two ways. First, it will serve as guidance for public, private and civil society actors wishing to apply for EU funding in the future. Second, it will provide policy-makers with ideas that can inform the design and implementation of new policy interventions in the respective policy areas. Along with this introduction, the report has four other parts. The first part features a description of the methodology applied to collect information on the presented actions and to analyse their results. The second part presents examples and analysis of projects funded by PROGRESS and EURES in 2013-2016. In the third part of the report, the reader will find overviews and assessment of the EaSI-funded activities implemented in 2015 by major EU-level organisations active in the promotion of social inclusion, poverty reduction and access to finance. Finally, the report concludes with a short afterword inter alia explaining the next steps in monitoring EaSI-supported projects and organisations as well as the overall programme. Key facts about the presented projects This report presents examples of 30 projects funded by the programmes PROGRESS and EURES. As the projects usually last between two and three years, in this report the reader will find examples and analysis of actions implemented in 2013-2016. In the policy area of social protection and social inclusion , the Commission funded projects to support the development of innovative policy interventions (social policy experimentation) and reforms of national pensions systems. Table 1 provides a list of calls for proposals that led to funding nine projects in the area of social protection and social inclusion analysed in this report.

They should rather be seen as distinct actions. Key facts about the presented organisations The report also presents EaSI-funded activities implemented by 19 key EU-level organisations working in the fields of social inclusion, poverty reduction and promotion of access to finance for vulnerable persons and social entrepreneurs (see Table 4) ( 2 ). Since the presented organisations report on their activities annually, we provide analysis of the results delivered in 2015.

        "14 1. Methodology The key components of this report are fiches that present the results of projects and organisations funded by the Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) as well as its predecessor programmes PROGRESS and EURES. These project/ organisation fiches are structured according to policy areas as well as themes of respective calls for proposals. The report presents all EU-funded projects and organisations that were funded under these instruments and successfully completed. In addition to an overview of activities carried out by the selected projects and organisations, the report aims to identify and describe \u2018potential good practices.\u2019 In order to select such practices, we followed a broad definition of the term \u2018practice\u2019 encompassing both policy and implementation. In our view, a \u2018good practice\u2019 is a process or methodology that has been proven to work well and produce good results, and is therefore recommended as a model or useful example. What constitutes a \u2018potential good practice\u2019 can thus include initiatives as diverse as legislation (at the national, sub-national and local levels), regulation, policies, strategies, institutional frameworks, planning and coordination procedures, various interventions (programmes, projects, campaigns, subsidies, financing mechanisms, tariff structures and similar), among many others. When carrying out analysis of EaSI-funded projects and organisations, the report team aimed to include all information instrumental to distinguishing the most successful projects and organisations, so that only effective calls are continued in the future. To collect an exhaustive amount of information on the presented action and operating grants, we relied on three data collection strategies: 1. The major sources of information were the final technical implementation reports completed by grant beneficiaries. 2. In order to develop as detailed a presentation of projects as possible, the report team also used all available additional information about the presented projects and organisations provided to them by the European Commission. Such information included various reports and briefings, agendas of organised events, participant lists, financial information, detailed description of deliverables and external/internal evaluations of specific projects and organisations. 3. Data collection was also carried out via openly accessible sources, such as project/organisation websites. The report team then analysed the content of the collected material according to a pre-developed toolkit in order to produce fiches for each project/organisation. The toolkit included a project/organisation fiche template (covering pre-defined criteria for analysis), a list of criteria for classifying analysed projects and organisations, and a reference grid for assessing potential good practices. The resulting 49 project/organisation fiches each consist of two parts. The first part (a table) presents the general administrative data on a given project/organisation as well as policy areas and sub-areas as per the pre-established classification. In the second part, we overview the projects/organisations, their aims and results, effectiveness, transferability/up-scalability, sustainability, innovativeness, impact and EU value added. These criteria were also used to assess which of the project activities could be regarded as potential good practices. As the reports on EaSI-funded projects will be inter alia used by the project/organisation auditors, the aspect of effectiveness (i.e. the extent to which projects/organisations achieved their results) was given particular emphasis. The list below provides the complete list of criteria applied to analyse projects and organisations. List of criteria for analysing projects and organisations \u2022 Socioeconomic context . This part describes why the action was implemented and the policy-related motives behind it. It also describes how the analysed project/organisation fits into local/national/EU policy, social and economic context. \u2022 Aims of the project/organisation . Under this heading, we summarise what the action aimed to achieve. \u2022 Project results, measured impacts, achievements, lessons learned . This part discusses the results, medium-to-long-term impacts of the action (both current and expected), achievements and lessons learned. \u2022 Identification of potential good practices . This section identifies processes/methodologies applied by the project that could be suggested as good practice examples to other similar projects/organisations. \u2022 Transferability element(s) of the project/activities (if any) . This section discusses the potential for the action or its individual parts to be applied in other contexts/at other levels (these do not necessarily have to be good practices). \u2022 Innovativeness of the project/activities (if any) . In this section, we present project/organisation activities that could be considered novel, in terms of standing out in the context of similar actions and settings, and elaborate how. ",
        "15 \u2022 Policy evidence generated by the project/organisation (if any) . Under this heading we overview studies, reports, databases or other evidence produced by the project/organisation to inform policy developments in a respective field. \u2022 Transnational dimension (if any) . The research team, in overviewing this section, focused on activities that were implemented in more than one country, at the EU or international level. In the fiches featuring transnational networks or projects that by design are transnational, this section was often not singled out and instead the transnational element was emphasised as a horizontal theme throughout the project description under other criteria. \u2022 New partnerships created (if any) . Under this heading, the project team elaborates on actions that lead to participating organisations finding new partners because of their involvement in a given project/network. \u2022 Dissemination strategy (if any) . This section provides an overview on how the project/organisation communicated the results of their action to their internal networks, stakeholders and the general public, including relevant intermediary and ultimate target groups. \u2022 European added value (if assessed). In this section, the report comments on whether the action: \u00b0 could have been implemented without EU funding (where exactly did EU funding mostly contribut e?); \u00b0 contributed to the implementation of EU legislation or ensuring that EU legislation is correctly applied; \u00b0 led to economies of scale, ensuring more efficient use of money and better services for citizens; \u00b0 promoted best practice examples learned from the previous EU/national actions; \u00b0 promoted benchmarking for decision-making (e.g. through peer reviews, mutual learning, producing evidence for policy-makers, etc.); \u00b0 due to its transnational character, allowed cross-border risks to be reduced and their consequences mitigated; \u00b0 contributed to the free movement of persons; \u00b0 contributed to networking activities (especially between organisations from different countries). \u2022 Sustainability measures . In this part, the project team explains what measures were taken in order to ensure that the results and impacts of the action are sustainable. Is there any evidence that activities will continue in the absence of EU funding? The reader should note that even though selected projects/organisations were funded under the same programme and many have similar aims, each implemented a unique set of actions, and in overviewing them the research team focused on the most relevant information for each, instead of including a uniform list of criteria in every fiche. This, in essence, is to say that project fiches feature different combinations of headings, and more emphasis in specific fiches is given to some of the criteria over others, with respect to the nature of the actions themselves.

Social protection and social inclusion Section 2.1. of this report provides examples of projects funded in the area of social protection and social inclusion. The following issues were addressed by the projects presented in this section: \u2022 developing policy innovations by using social policy experimentation methods; \u2022 setting up and improving modelling tools for pension systems and supporting mutual learning in national pension reform processes; \u2022 developing pension tracking services; \u2022 designing reform strategies for more cost-effective social protection systems. Social policy experimentation projects The EaSI programme builds on the experience of the predecessor PROGRESS programme in providing financial support to test social and labour market policy innovations . These innovations are often tested by using innovative social research methods usually referred to as social policy experimentation methods. While a social policy innovation can be described as a change in social policy that \u2018simultaneously meets social needs and creates new social relationships or collaborations, thereby benefiting society and boosting its capacity to act\u2019 ( 3 ), social policy experimentation is a method to test social policy interventions on a smaller scale, making it possible to determine the impact of changes in the social policy. This allows policy-makers and other relevant actors to gather robust evidence on the effects of a given policy or programme, and to determine what works and what does not. Producing objective empirical evidence on the impact/outcomes of a policy or programme is important when making decisions on whether or not to pursue or scale-up these policies. Therefore, social policy experimentation is a means to test and develop social policy innovations. Below the report describes two projects funded by the predecessor PROGRESS programme as a result of the calls for proposals ( 4 ) supporting social policy experimentation.

        "17 \u2018The project represents a value added to Europe by exploring and expanding the evidence base on the nature of school exclusion and its impact on children.\u2019 This project was the research component of a collaborative initiative between the Greater London Authority (GLA) and the University of Cambridge. It designed and implemented a cluster-randomised controlled field trial (RCT) carried out in 36 schools across London. The RCT was designed to evaluate a 12-week-long intervention \u2018Engage in Education London (EiE-L)\u2019. Socioeconomic context In 2010/11, about 6.5 % of pupils in England who were in the last two years of compulsory education (years 10 and 11) experienced one or more fixed-period school exclusions for disciplinary reasons. These pupils were at a greatly increased risk of failing General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations, not being in employment, education or training (NEET) at ages 16-24, and having criminal convictions as adolescents or young adults. The RCT analysis was meant to address this issue by evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention for Year 10 and 11 pupils who were subject to fixed-term exclusion (\u2018suspension\u2019) from school during the 2012/13 academic year in Greater London. The planned intervention targeted young people in secondary school who are at most risk of school exclusion, and aimed to : \u2022 reduce behavioural problems and hence the likelihood of further school exclusions up to the end of compulsory school; \u2022 improve academic outcomes including GCSE results at the end of compulsory school (age 16); \u2022 reduce the risk of becoming NEET in the years after compulsory school; \u2022 reduce the risk of arrests and criminal convictions in the years after compulsory school. Project results The results of the main effect (intent-to-treat) analyses revealed no significant positive effects of the EiE-L intervention on the primary outcome of exclusion or any of the measured behavioural and socio-emotional outcomes. The project team organised 12 mutual learning events drawing over 200 participants to share findings and implications for future research on interventions aimed at reducing incidence of school exclusion. Policy evidence generated by the project The initiative documented the process and results of the RCT, producing various reports and publications including: \u2022 a specific report of the academic component of the study findings; \u2022 a protocol published before beginning the study; \u2022 three papers: one outlining the main effects of the evaluation; another on sub-group analyses and a final paper structured around wider issues affecting the education system and the young people subject to exclusion, drawing on the study data to allow a systematic and evidence-based assessment. Dissemination of project results The project team disseminated the results and outputs of the project activities widely, including through presentations to a wide array of stakeholders at the European Society of Criminology, the Institute of Education at University College London, and the European Society for Prevention Research Evaluating an Intervention for Pupils Excluded from School Call identification number: VP/2011/009 Project duration: 1 May 2013-31 April 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2012/0345 EU contribution in euros: 426 406.87 Policy area: Social Protection and Social Inclusion (SPSI) Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Social partners; Non-governmental organisations; Higher education institutions and research institutes.

        "18 (EUSPR). Moreover, the action organised its own specialised conference \u2018Keeping Teens in School \u2014 Alternatives to Exclusion\u2019 that drew 90 participants including policy-makers, practitioners, UK-based and international academics. The 13 reports produced during this action were disseminated through the respective networks of project partners to implicated institutions, as well as via the Education Endowment Foundation website where it forms part of its evidence base for educational research. Finally, project partners have produced three academic publications and one more was under way in 2015. Sustainability of project results The researchers behind this action continue to work on outputs from the project beyond its timeframe, including through developing publications, appearing at conferences and engaging in wider dissemination. The team pointed to the need to study long-term effects of exclusion, which remains an understudied area with important potential benefits for a vulnerable group of young people. Future funding permitting, the team would conduct follow-up with its trial cohort to study this issue. European added value The project represents a value added to Europe by exploring and expanding the evidence base on the nature of school exclusion and its impact on children. The finding that the intervention tested in the RCT did not have the intended positive effects takes further the discussion of how to address the issue of children\u2019s exclusion, potential ways to address it and the alternative costs of doing nothing about it. Moreover, through the wide-reaching dissemination of the project findings, the initiative contributed to networking activities: the conference organised as part of this study included international as well as British experts/academics, UK practitioners, and government officials, providing opportunities for multidisciplinary and EU- wide debate and discussion. Activities implemented \u2022 Designed, planned and implemented a cluster randomised controlled trial, including: \u00b0 Recruiting core staff; \u00b0 Identifying intervention; \u00b0 Collecting and analysing data at baseline and post-intervention). \u2022 Organised international conference, prepared and disseminated three papers.

        "19 \u2018The action promoted benchmarking for decision-making by testing, documenting and showcasing widely the process and results of an intergenerational entrepreneurship model as a means of addressing unemployment among young and senior individuals.\u2019 The project, branded as United at Work (UAW) and implemented by organisations in Spain, Portugal and United Kingdom, launched an Entrepreneurship Programme targeting young people under 30 and senior citizens between the ages of 50 and 64. The project aimed to simultaneously integrate young people and senior citizens in the labour market and create employment through the entrepreneurship activity. As both target groups represent a qualified population, either through academic preparation (youths) or professional experience (senior citizens), the model of intergenerational entrepreneurship intended to activate the specific skills and abilities of each generation and stimulate intergenerational learning. Socioeconomic context The problem of qualified unemployment in general, and of qualified unemployment of young people and senior citizens in particular, is an emergent issue in Portuguese society. The unemployment of qualified senior citizens and young people exacerbates the economic, social and personal consequences of this condition. Qualified unemployment also contributed to increasing mismatch of skills and emigration of talented workers (brain drain), especially youths, reducing the country\u2019s economic competitiveness. The project sought to address the issue for both target groups simultaneously by engaging them in working together in the development of business projects thus also exploring the potential of intergenerational entrepreneurship models. Results and impacts Some 40 participants (31 senior and nine young individuals) and 19 projects reached the end of the Incubation sub-phase, thus concluding the Intergenerational Entrepreneurship Programme. The project, including through 35 training and mutual learning sessions with over 300 participants, contributed to discussing the problem and the consequences of qualified unemployment of senior and young people and to stimulating interest in intergenerational entrepreneurship models. As a result of completing the programme, target groups benefited by, among other things, acquiring personal and professional skills and establishing a network of intergenerational relations. Policy evidence generated by the project The project targeted two areas of public policies: active employment measures and measures for promoting active ageing, associated with intergenerational learning. The action tested the potential of an intergenerational entrepreneurship model that was designed collaboratively with stakeholders during the public debate phase. The action contributed to the discourse on potential responses to addressing unemployment of senior citizens and young people, including across countries, via conferences in Spain and the United Kingdom. The generated evidence is documented in various reports, as listed in the dissemination section below, providing recommendations for public policy related to the effects of intergenerationality in entrepreneurship and the evolution of legal and formal establishment of business and tax benefit schemes to facilitate entrepreneurship.

        "20 Dissemination of project results The action had considerable focus on dissemination and engaging stakeholders, starting from the conception of the action itself by kicking off the project with a 2-month phase surrounding public debate, which succeeded in engaging 1 942 participants in discussing the issue of unemployment among young and senior people, the idea of intergenerational entrepreneurship, and the way to go about designing the Intergenerational Entrepreneurship Programme. The various channels for disseminating information included: \u2022 the project website (Discussion Forum; Ideas Factory; and Ideas Bank for sharing and co-creation of business ideas); social media (Facebook) and media coverage; \u2022 international conferences in Lisbon, Belfast and Barcelona for a variety of stakeholders including policy-makers, academics, social partners, etc.; \u2022 six specialised publications including a report on good practices, evaluation and conference reports; \u2022 project documentary and public presentations of developed business projects. Sustainability of project results The methodology tested and lessons learned will remain relevant for future actions addressing unemployment of senior and young people. Meanwhile, companies set up as a direct result of the programme will continue to function. European added value The action promoted benchmarking for decision-making by testing, documenting and showcasing widely the process and results of an intergenerational entrepreneurship model as a means of addressing unemployment among young and senior individuals. Moreover, it also contributed to networking activities, including transnationally, by involving partners in Spain and the United Kingdom in different phases of project implementation.

        "21 Projects to support pension modelling and pension reform processes In the period under review, the European Commission also supported Member States\u2019 actions related to: \u2022 development of pension modelling tools and methodologies; as well as \u2022 mutual learning on national pension reform processes ( 5 ). These actions were co-funded (up to 80 % of total costs) with the aim of supporting Member State authorities in developing their capacity for monitoring and modelling trends in their pension systems as well as for designing and modelling reforms aimed at strengthening adequacy, sustainability and safety of pension systems. By funding such actions, the European Commission aimed at responding to challenges related to an ageing population . Pensions are the main income source for around a quarter of the EU\u2019s population; younger Europeans will also come to rely on pensions later in their lives. Unless European countries deliver on decent pensions, millions will face poverty in old age. But as Europe is ageing, pensions are putting increased financial pressure on national budgets, especially with the added strain of the recent financial and economic crisis ( 6 ). The EU-funded projects presented below were required to focus on one of the following activities: \u2022 development of administrative datasets and models to enhance the capacity of national authorities in analysing the likely outcomes of pension systems; \u2022 organisation of national debates and preparatory work on reforms of public pension schemes; \u2022 development of policies (especially through access to the experience of other countries) to enhance the contribution of complementary savings to adequate pensions.

        "22 \u2018The improved model will lead to more informed analysis and deliberations of changes to pension policy in the Czech Republic.\u2019 The project was implemented in order to improve the predictive capacity of the Czech dynamic pension microsimulation model \u2014 a mathematical technique for simulating the actions and impact of decisions on micro-units \u2014 individuals in a system. The action had two main objectives: 1. to update the underlying database (including by analysing data sources, their structure and the methodology behind gathering it; and by preparing a database with information about insurers and pensioners and the need for a dynamic microsimulation model); 2. to introduce individual decision-making processes into the model. Results and impacts The project identified the main areas where individual decision- making can be introduced into the pension microsimulation model and assessed the potential contribution of specific actions to the model results. In doing so, the project improved the predictive potential of the model and prepared the ground for its further development. The improved model will lead to more informed analysis and deliberations of changes to pension policy in the Czech Republic. The outcomes of the project will, furthermore, allow for better insight into the inner workings of the Czech pension scheme, which will be beneficial to other stakeholder groups such as universities, the media and think tanks, and, ultimately, to improving the situation of pensioners and the labour market population that will become subject to the pension scheme, thus increasing the overall well-being of the Czech population as a whole. Policy evidence generated by the project Under the action partners prepared a total of seven reports, among them conducting a \u2018Feasibility Study: Implementation of Decision-Making Processes into the Dynamic Microsimulation Model of the Pension System\u2019 in order to identify the main areas in the model where the researchers can introduce individual decision-making processes into the model, and assess how such variables contribute to the quality of model results. In addition, the project team assessed the experience of other countries with such modelling. As an additional process-related document, the team prepared a preliminary list of potential data sources and requirements for the necessary data. The feasibility study led to two follow-up outputs. First, the researchers derived a new wage formula based on individual parameters from an extensive labour market dataset. As a result, the team completed an individualised wage profile depending on individual career developments and other factors that can be introduced into the dynamic microsimulation model. Second, the dynamic microsimulation model was interconnected with another tool \u2014 the Economic Scenario Generator \u2014 that made it possible to model changes in asset allocation in third-pillar pension funds based on the relative performance of different asset classes. Partnerships The project benefited from the cooperation of several partners. The involvement of the ERUDICIO non-profit endowment fund was especially important for the data gathering, implementation of the microsimulation model and project management.

        "23 Czech Social Security Administration and the Czech Statistical Office were responsible for data management. Sustainability of project results As part of the action, the researchers identified specific parts of the model that could be further improved and expanded. The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of the Czech Republic continues to use and expand the microsimulation model facilitated by other financial resources. Dissemination The project team presented project results via study trips, workshops (including those aimed at discussing results with academia and experts in pension and mathematical modelling) and in a final open conference, which facilitated the discussion of results with 43 participants including high-level policy-makers and other stakeholders. In addition, the two communication events organised under this project attracted over 70 participants. In addition to this, the promoters of this project provided the intermediate and partial results to national experts. Potential good practice stemming from the innovativeness of the project results A module simulating the decision-making of pension fund portfolio managers was developed as part of this project and incorporated into the dynamic pension microsimulation model. This constitutes a novel approach to modelling that has been scarcely (if ever) used previously by the pension modelling community. The adopted approach builds on microsimulation of pension fund assets with dynamic portfolio changes based on rate-of-return dependence and predetermined strategies. It is promising in its potential utility for assessing the effects of privately-funded pension schemes on the income received by pensioners. European added value Although the project specifically concerned improvements to pension modelling in the Czech Republic, it also contributed to networking activities and transfer of good practices between organisations from Belgium, the Czech Republic and Sweden. A number of Czech Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs employees participated in study trips to Belgium and Sweden, countries where pension modelling is considered to be at an advanced stage. The study visit to Belgium focused on consultations concerning partial outputs of the project as well as further actions to incorporate decision-making processes into the system. The study visit to Sweden focused on the country\u2019s experience with the use of a dynamic microsimulation model in practice. Activities implemented \u2022 extensive research into available data sources to be used as an input into a pension microsimulation model applied in the Czech Republic; \u2022 Assessment of available data sources with on data quality and completeness of the indicated databases; \u2022 Preparation of the database, which contains information about insurers and pensioners; \u2022 Preparation of a feasibility study on the implementation of individual decision-making processes into the dynamic microsimulation model of the pension system; \u2022 Development of a methodology for implementation of new model factors into the model; \u2022 Study visits in Belgium and Sweden, a workshop for the wider expert public and a closing conference to present the results of the project and its benefits.

        "24 \u2018Analytical reports produced by the project contributed to amending the Serbian Law on Pension and Disability Insurance Act.\u2019 This was the first project in Serbia in the framework of the PROGRESS programme that dealt with the pension reform. The overall objective of the action was to prepare for the next phase of the pension reform in Serbia, based on a comparative analysis and transfer of existing knowledge and practices from other countries. With this action, the Serbian Ministry of Labour wanted to set up the basis for the design of the strategic development direction and future pension system structure in Serbia as well as to define a sustainable and adequate method to secure income for the elderly population. Results The project only partially reached its intended results, as only one part of the project was successfully implemented. The project implementation faced various administrative obstacles. There were delays in approving the project and starting the actual work because of administrative and financial problems in the Ministry. Due to these issues and political circumstances (early elections, a change in government), the project was also terminated earlier than planned. However, even the partially implemented project provided a relevant contribution to the continuation of the reform process through legislative changes in 2014. Analytical outputs of the project, namely three reports, improved the relevant officials\u2019 understanding of modern tendencies in the development of pension systems and contributed to a better understanding of the scope and severity of the problems facing the pension system in Serbia and facilitated the process of defining solutions for the new phase of the reform process. The project also contributed to improving administrative capacity of the Serbian Ministry of Labour through the creation of a database containing information about pension reforms in other countries. Policy evidence generated by the project Various drafts of analytical documents were prepared, including the \u2018Study of the Early Old-Age Retirement and the Realisation of the Right to Old-Age Pension Before Reaching the General Retirement Age,\u2019 as well as an analysis of insurance with reduced service years for retirement, and specific categories of insured people. The topics of these studies were influenced by the programme of the newly-elected Serbian government, which prioritised initiating a new phase of pension reform and changing pension law by the end of 2014. Dissemination The project team disseminated their findings to decision- makers in the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Issues and the Ministry of Finance. Due to the early interruption of the project, the potential was not reached in familiarising the social partners and other stakeholders with the findings of the project\u2019s analytical outputs. This led to the public not being fully informed about the project.

        "25 Transnational dimension The project team organised a four-day study visit to Austria in February 2014; this led to the identification of several potential good practices employed in the Austrian pension system that could be implemented in the Serbian system in the future: \u2022 development of partnerships between social partners during the period reforms implementation; \u2022 developing a comprehensive database containing data on payments for pensions and disability insurance, which could be directly used for determining the amount of pension insurance rights; \u2022 employment of strict tax policy measures, ensuring compliance with the obligation to pay contributions for pension and disability insurance; \u2022 establishment of a preventive measures system in order to extend the service life or preserve working capacity to enable the insured to stay in the insurance system for as long as possible. Sustainability The results of the project will have limited relevance for further debates on pensions systems. Activities implemented \u2022 Review of the historical progress of the Serbian pension system; \u2022 Preparation of a study covering the structure of the pension system in Serbia and reform process; \u2022 Analysis of insurance with the reduced service years of retirement; \u2022 Analysis of insurance of specific categories of insured people; \u2022 Analysis of the individual elements of the pension systems of other countries: France, Croatia, Austria and Slovenia; \u2022 Preparation of the study \u2018Early old-age pension, exercising the right to old-age pension before reaching the general retirement age\u2019; \u2022 Study visit to Austria.

        "26 \u2018The project as a whole could be seen as a good practice example, since it demonstrated how high-quality pensions modelling and research can lead to analytical insights with strong added value to real-life policy-making.\u2019 The project \u2018Wealth at Retirement and Savings Adequacy (WeRSA)\u2019 was mainly a research project centred on implementing a two-year study on the medium- and long-term adequacy of the Italian pension system taking into account changes in the population structure, increased life expectancy, social dynamics and macroeconomic volatility. The project had a number of specific objectives : 1. to explore the effects of the most recent pension reform in Italy from different perspectives: adequacy, distributive impact, effects on consumer spending and saving behaviour; 2. to identify forces behind pension advice demand; 3. to analyse whether financial knowledge helps to reduce early retirement; 4. to identify groups that may have insufficient pension income at retirement (focusing on qualifications, gender and cohort); 5. to investigate how Italy fares so far in the development of funded, supplementary, private pensions and the reasons behind low participation rates, especially for more vulnerable groups such as the young, females, and residents in the south of Italy; 6. to consider the prospects and the conditions for further development of private pensions. The key result of the action was the release of two microsimulation models: CeRPSIM3, which was the third release of an existing model updated to the most recent normative and socio-demographic evolution, and Italissimo, a structural overlapping-generations model simulating the circumstances of a population cross-section through time matched with contemporary survey data for Italy. The focus of the ITALISSIMO model was the analysis of saving and labour supply decisions in the context of uncertainty over the life cycle. Along with other, more specific findings, the research team identified some cross-cutting emerging themes ( lessons learned ): \u2022 The understanding of pension benefits has changed over the years . These are increasingly no longer seen as a \u2018right\u2019 or a \u2018reward\u2019 in recognition of service at the end of a long career, but rather as an individual investment that one actively saves and plans for. \u2022 Having time to prepare for a policy allows for quantitatively and qualitatively different responses . Allowing a minimum lag period between announcement and implementation may mitigate the adverse effects of reforms. \u2022 On the development of policies to enhance the contribution of complementary savings to adequate pensions, the project team\u2019s assessment of international comparison suggested that in Italy a crowding-out effect is in place, with public pensions being too large to allow private pensions to develop significantly further than the present stage. Policy evidence generated The key purpose of this project was to generate policy evidence, such as microsimulation models and studies to be used for policy-making. All analytical outputs, including 11 reports produced are of an especially high quality with direct relevance to (and already used by) Italian policy-makers. For example, the study \u2018Enhancing the Role of Funded Schemes in the Italian Pension System\u2019, which included among other Wealth at Retirement and Savings Adequacy Call identification number: VP/2012/010 Participating country (-ies): The United Kingdom Grant identification number: VS/2013/0208 Project duration: 1 September 2013-31 August 2015 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion EU contribution in euros: 260 241.15 Policy sub-area: Pensions Target groups: Officials of the Italian institutions working with pensions Implementation country: Italy ",
        "27 methods for data gathering, a survey with 800 retirement- age respondents, was produced as a final deliverable of the project. The aim of this study was to assess Italy\u2018s progress with the development and diffusion of funded, supplementary, private pensions and the prospects and conditions for further development. One of the key findings of the two microsimulation models produced in the framework of this project was that the 2011 pension reform in Italy increased the average retirement age by two-three years for all the cohorts considered, with younger cohorts and retirement-age women facing a higher increase. A comparison of the situation in Italy with a representative sample of OECD countries moreover revealed that: \u2022 Some population groups, particularly low-income workers, women and the self-employed show greater vulnerability being more likely to (i) receive lower pensions than current retirees and (ii) be below the poverty threshold. \u2022 Future generations in Italy will be at risk of not reaching the country-specific replacement rate after retiring (similar to other OECD countries), but also receive lower pensions than current retirees (different from control countries). \u2022 Even with all private-sector employees and self-employed workers signing up for pension funds, the role of the 2nd pillar in determining the total pension income would be limited to 12 %. Taking into account vulnerable groups Welfare of the elderly was a particularly important input into the simulation models developed by the project, as older people are more vulnerable than other adults, having fewer strategies to cope with negative shocks. Older people cannot resort to additional labour given their age and inevitably diminishing health over time. The project measured the reduction in vulnerability if housing wealth were used as a \u2018cash machine\u2019 through a reverse mortgage. The implications for welfare of such an instrument show large potential. The availability of reverse mortgage products in Italy could help up to 20 % of vulnerable households make it out of the poverty threshold line. Moreover, gender equality was the pivot of all the project\u2019s activities, e.g. by taking into account the gender dimension in all analyses (where this was possible). Dissemination All of the project deliverables and results were presented at the project\u2019s final conference in Rome, Italy, drawing 115 participants. Some results have also been covered in various other events, where the project beneficiaries have participated, e.g. Workshop on Financial Inclusion (October 2015, The Dutch Central Bank); 13th International Workshop on Pensions, Insurance and Savings (28-29 May 2015, Paris). Partnerships and transnational dimension The project is a result of collaboration between CeRP-Collagio Carlo Alberto, University of Bologna, and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) who worked on the development of the models, as well as public institutions such as the National Social Security Institute (INPS) and the Italian Pension Funds Supervisory Commission (COVIP), which provided data and details about a normative network. Moreover, by means of the comparative analysis with a sample of six representative OECD countries from the body\u2019s Pension Outlook (2013), the project benefited from collaboration with the OECD team in charge of publishing the outlook. The research included an international comparison among OECD countries in which pension systems have been compared in terms of their balancing between PAYG (pay as you go) and a funded component, as well as of the conditions under which a development of funded schemes may take place. Discussion of opting-out policies was also presented in relation to the EU Stability and Growth Pact and to similar initiatives in other EU Member States. Potential good practice The project as a whole could be seen as a good practice example, since it demonstrated how high-quality pensions modelling and research can lead to analytical insights with strong added value to real-life policy-making. In addition, this work represented a unique occasion, with few precedents in Italy, of knowledge exchange among different research teams developing complementary microsimulation models and of close interaction between modellers and data suppliers. Activities implemented \u2022 Evaluation of Italian pension system using microsimulation tools; \u2022 Literature review on best practices in pension policy area; \u2022 Analysis of drivers of retirement; \u2022 Analysis of potential demand for pension advice services in Italy; \u2022 Identification of reasons behind the current levels of pension fund participation combining information from administrative and survey data.

The theme of advice at retirement (particularly with a gender dimension) will be proposed in any related initiative. In addition, in order to discuss follow-up on the project results and impact, the project team held a conference at project conclusion in September 2015 on planning ahead for retirement. The landscape of participation in pension plans is going to be regularly updated and transposed in the Annual Reports of the Italian pension funds regulator (COVIP), as well as periodic hearings of COVIP Representatives before the Italian Parliament. Updates of opting-out scenarios and related estimations will be conducted upon request from the Italian Government on the possible implementation of these policies. ",
        "29 \u2018All deliverables of the project will serve as a high-quality policy evidence and will help to steer the pensions policy both in Luxembourg and, through dissemination of this good practice, in other EU Member States and beyond.\u2019 The main objective of the project was to develop a pension modelling system in Luxembourg which would help answer policy-related questions concerning pensions and social transfers in the longer term. In this framework, the project sought to integrate separate administrative datasets and models that were previously working on different levels of aggregation. A second key objective of the MiDLAS project was to identify difficulties that stakeholders might have to modelling approaches and their expectations on the expertise developed in the course of and by means of this action. At the methodological level, the built model sought to pay special attention to the questions of immigration and cross- border workers. These questions are particularly important in Luxembourg when it comes to assessing sustainability of the pension system. Key results The project delivered three key results: \u2022 First, grant beneficiaries have successfully built on past experiences (a partial model based on survey data) in elaborating the first operational dynamic microsimulation model for Luxembourg (called LuDMi) taking into account population ageing . This required a switch from survey data to administrative data as an input in order to know more about past careers of individuals and (in the future) to be in a position to incorporate cross-border workers who are known to play an important role in the Luxembourg economy. The model was also designed to facilitate arriving at standard adequacy and sustainability indicators as developed by the Working Group on Ageing Populations (AWG) and the Social Protection Committee\u2019s Indicator Sub-Group (ISG) in the context of the Open Method of Coordination (OMC): at-risk-of-poverty rate, aggregate replacement ratios, inequality of income distribution, benefit ratio and others. The adequacy and sustainability of these indicators were also analysed during the project. \u2022 Second, the project implemented a comparative descriptive analysis of modelling tools available in Luxembourg . The organisations involved also assessed potential for all existing models to interact. \u2022 Finally, the project promoters conducted interviews with trade unions and employers\u2019 representatives in Luxembourg and analysed the data in order to prepare recommendations for model developers at large emphasising the necessity of transparency, better access to data and underlying hypotheses as well as the need for a clearer expression of the limits of the instruments developed. The project also delivered several important by-products. The involved partners organised: \u2022 The World Congress of the International Microsimulation Association (IMA), including a round-table discussion on \u2018Boosting dialogue between microsimulation modellers and policy-makers at national and international levels\u2019, drawing 160 participants; and \u2022 The 4th general conference of the International Microsimulation Association, which included 150 participants; \u2022 The International Workshop on Dynamic Microsi- Towards a Dynamic Microsimulation Model, Administrative Data for Microsimulation in LU, the Comparative Analysis of Tools Pertaining to the Economics of Ageing and a Better Understanding of Stakeholders\u2019 Perception \u2014 the MiDLAS Project Call identification number: VP/2012/010 Participating country: Belgium Grant identification number: VS/2013/0138 Project duration: 1 June 2013-31 May 2015 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion EU contribution in euros: 218 413.55 Policy sub-area: Pensions Target groups: Officials of the Luxembourg institutions working with pensions Implementation country: Luxembourg ",
        "30 mulation with 30 participants, which was enabled by developing an actual operating model in Luxembourg described above. All deliverables of the project will serve as high-quality policy evidence and will help to steer pensions policy both in Luxembourg and, through dissemination of this good practice, in other EU Member States and beyond. Equality considerations Gender played a significant role in the simulation, presentation and discussion of the simulation results. All measures of (pension) adequacy are specific to gender. In fact, surfacing differences of pension adequacy between men and women is a key element for any microsimulation model. Transnational dimension and partnerships By means of implementing a project mainly targeting Luxembourg and its policy-makers\u2019 needs, MiDLAS has certainly had a serious international impulse with regard to project coordinator LISER\u2019s legitimacy, expertise and visibility in the domain of modelling and simulation. As a result of frequent exchanges with experts abroad (mainly in the Federal Planning Bureau in Brussels, an institution partner in MiDLAS) and several participations in international conferences, the developed model can be seen as a benchmark of excellence in the present domain of modelling expertise at the European level and beyond. Dissemination In order to disseminate the findings to policy-makers, the project team foresaw a separate work package. The key objective of the dissemination mechanisms (mainly direct contact with trade unions and employers\u2019 organisations) was to underline hypotheses and clearly communicate the limits of the developed instruments. The need for transparency in modelling exercises and for better access to data sources were also emphasised. Potential good practice The precision and high-quality expertise with which the LuDMi model was developed makes the model itself (together with other research conducted under the project) a good practice worth transferring to other countries. Activities aimed at bridging the perceptions/discourse gap between the modelling community and the policy-makers were a particularly valuable part of the project. Ultimately, this line of research should result in a better mutual understanding of the information provided by modelling exercises among \u2018producers\u2019 and \u2018consumers\u2019. European added value According to grant beneficiaries, a number of activities implemented under this project would not have happened without funding from EaSI (for example, the International Workshop on Dynamic Microsimulation would not have been organised in absence of EU funding). In addition, the project organised a number of events (including the mentioned workshop and the World Congress of the International Microsimulation Association) that facilitated sharing best practice examples (including the model developed under this project) with persons from other EU countries and beyond. Sustainability The main lesson learned from this action is the necessity of long-term and secured perspectives when building-up analytical platforms such as the one addressed in MiDLAS. Abandoning tools or not investing enough in their development or even their maintenance should be avoided. It is also absolutely necessary to cooperate with partners from other countries in a continuous and durable way since the teams are limited in size and capacities both in Luxembourg and elsewhere. Moreover, the models and modellers must talk to each other in order to concentrate on the relevant questions (to be raised or heard from the right actors) and to find answers through the best possible tools available. Activities implemented \u2022 Development of a dataset containing information of past career information for computation of future pension rights; \u2022 Development of a dynamic microsimulation model taking into account the ageing population; \u2022 Comparative analysis of modelling tools already existing in Luxembourg; \u2022 semi-structured interviews conducted with the representatives of trade unions and employers\u2019 organisations; \u2022 Dissemination of findings to a wider public.

        "31 \u2018The developed model provided additional arguments for convincing policy- makers to introduce an automatic mechanism for increasing pensions, without the influence of political decision and without a link to an election cycle.\u2019 The main objective of the action was to create a robust tool to model the Romanian pension system. The project therefore aimed to develop a model for long-term projections of public pension expenditures (old age, early and partial early retirement, disability and survivors) and expenditures for social insurance benefits (sickness, maternity, unemployment etc.). Such a model was expected to significantly increase the capacity of the National House of Public Pensions to monitor trends in the Romanian pension system and provide a solid evidence base for policy decisions in the area of pensions. Results The main output of the project was an improvement in modelling capabilities of the Romanian National House of Public Pensions and a newly built microsimulation model. The model captured the following features of the Romanian pension system: \u2022 unification of the system for different pension groups (implemented in 2011); \u2022 the level of social solidarity redistribution in the system; \u2022 the impact of stricter rules for early and disability retirement; \u2022 increasing enrolment penalties imposed for partial early retirement; Statistical analysis was carried out on the extent to which different pillars of the Romanian pension system are sustainable taking into account the replacement rates. The developed model helps to better understand the impact of pension valorisation on system debt. The model is also able to use various scenarios to assess the advantages of indexing public pensions to consumer prices instead of linking pensions to wages. Furthermore, it provided additional arguments for convincing policy-makers to introduce an automatic mechanism for increasing pensions, without the influence of political decisions and without a link to an election cycle. Dissemination The action results were disseminated via seven reports, including some with a methodological focus and others with an orientation towards policy, and through two workshops gathering between them 108 participants. Participants from various Romanian institutions, especially the Ministry of Labour, the National Institute of Statistics, the National Commission for Forecast and the Romanian Academy, received materials on model presentation and main forecasts on the public pensions for the period 2015-2075. The final report and other analytical outputs were published on the National House of Public Pensions website. Partnerships and transnational dimension There were 11 international study visits and peer learning events involving 48 participants; these enabled project beneficiaries to gain suitable experience from countries with more developed modelling environments, such as the Czech Republic and Poland. Based on a report on types of modelling solutions of the pension model delivered by an external consultant, project beneficiaries identified and Development of a National Pension Model for Policy-making Purposes Call identification number: VP/2012/010 Participating countries: Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland Grant identification number: VS/2013/0275 Project duration: 1 November 2013-31 May 2015 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion EU contribution in euros: 215 224.43 Policy sub-area: Pensions Target groups: Officials of the Romanian institutions working with pensions Implementation country: Romania ",
        "32 learned from other up-to-date modelling solutions applied in other EU countries. The experience gained from across the EU helped the National House of Public Pensions to set clearer requirements for data selection and implementation of other phases of the model (e.g. inputting data, modelling features, model validation and reporting). Furthermore, the action successfully established permanent contact with colleagues from the ONYF (Central Administration of National Pension Insurance) in Hungary, which has experience in using pension microsimulation models. Equality considerations The project team was selected with respect to the principle of equality between women and men (for example, of 11 members of the project team, seven were women). Innovativeness Before this project there was no model in Romania supporting simulations of the pension system. European added value The model would not have been developed without EU funding as no such funding was planned for in the Romanian budget. In addition, this project contributes to the learning of good modelling practices by Romanian officials from their peers in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Sustainability The National House of Public Pensions will use the developed model daily even after the EU funding has come to an end. The team responsible for further use and development of the model was brought together i n the National House of Public Pensions. Their daily activities will include: \u2022 regular modelling of the public pension system and assessment of its performance; \u2022 projections/simulations as an input for discussions/ analysis to support public policy; \u2022 evaluation of potential reforms in the pension system; \u2022 creation of external reporting templates for national and international bodies; \u2022 model maintenance activities. In the next period, the above-mentioned team will focus on legislative changes so that it will be possible to bring together data collected by different public institutions as an input into the model. In addition, the National House of Public Pensions will aim to: \u2022 set up a specialised department for actuarial calculations, with at least three persons; \u2022 attract qualified staff that have advanced knowledge of programming and processing statistical data, but that also have a deep understanding of the pension system; \u2022 train staff involved in simulations and participate in seminars/workshops in the field of modelling; \u2022 further develop the model, either using own financial resources or external funds. Activities implemented \u2022 Study visits in the Czech Republic and Poland; \u2022 Specification of pension data requirements and identification of alternative data sources; \u2022 Selecting Monte Carlo simulations through Prophet actuarial software as a simulation approach; \u2022 Technical description of model approach and outputs; \u2022 Preparation of a final report summarising the assumptions, model point creation and final results.

        "33 Project to support the development of a tracking service for private pension entitlements The project described below was funded as a result of the call for proposals aimed at developing an EU-wide pension tracking service ( 7 ). Only one grant was awarded under this call. The purpose of the call was to support private pension stakeholders from several Member States in developing a tracking service for supplementary pension rights. With EU employees being more mobile often with short periods of mobility and with an increasing reliance on private pension provision for adequate retirement incomes, it becomes increasingly important to move towards the better protection of occupational pension rights of people who change jobs and move across borders. The action described below was invited to address the challenge faced by mobile workers: how to keep track of pension entitlements with different schemes to which they were affiliated during their career while working in different countries. ( 7 ) Call for Proposals VP/2012/011, Support for the development of a tracking service for private pension entitlements. \u2018At the final Expert Meeting of the project, a round-table discussion was held with 11 out of 14 existing EU tracking services. This was the very first time all tracking services shared the same room and elaborated together on pension tracking services in the EU.\u2019 Socioeconomic context An increasing number of European employees are changing jobs not only within their countries, but also travelling to other European countries to find employment. An important aspect of moving between jobs is that this should not lead to a loss of information on state and occupational pension entitlements. In several European countries, tracking systems for pensions are already in place. However, a European tracking system for pension rights is yet to be developed. Such a tracking system would (1) give employees information on the pension entitlements built up during their career and (2) ensure that pension providers keep track of their members. The main objective of this action was to investigate the existing pension tracking systems in Europe and draw comparisons between them. The project had several key results : \u2022 development of a feasible high-level design for a European Tracking Service (ETS); \u2022 establishment of a business model to maintain the ETS; \u2022 expansion of the support base for the ETS. In particular, the project investigated methods for user identification in the tracking systems. User identification is considered to be one of the crucial elements for a successful European pension tracking system. European Tracking System for Pensions (TTYPE Project \u2014 Track and Trace Your Pension in Europe) Call identification number: VP/2012/011 Project duration: 1 June 2013-1 January 2016 Grant identification number: VS/2013/0143 EU contribution in euros: 658 266.23 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion Target groups: Pension data providers (National Pension Tracking Services); European Commission; European Parliament; Member States and their governmental bodies; National pension federations; End users (mobile workers currently working or that have worked abroad). Policy sub-area: Pensions Implementation country: Netherlands Participating countries: Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Finland, United Kingdom ",
        "34 The final report of the project included implications and recommendations for relevant stakeholders in order to make the ETS operational: 1. national tracking services need to be connected in order to get the relevant data into the service; 2. the European Commission will need to be involved during the development of the service, at least form the funding perspective; 3. pension providers, governments, and National Tracking Services will need to be involved in meetings on a continuous basis to improve sharing of experiences and expertise. Potential impacts In the long term, development of an EU-level pensions system might also stimulate national tracking services or more digital pension services in the Member States with no tracking service in place. In addition, European citizens will benefit from a transparent overview of the pension entitlements across Europe and better awareness of what their financial situation will be when they are of pension age. Potential good practice/innovativeness The whole project is a potential good practice example. This project is unquestionably innovative, as it aimed to assess the feasibility of creating an EU-wide tracking system for pensions, which is as of yet non-existent. The action was based on rigorous working methods and involved world-class expertise, especially in looking for IT solutions to make the future pension tracking service operational. In September 2014, four IT suppliers (IBM, CGI, Accenture and Capgemini) reviewed the design proposed by the project. They all concluded that the design was feasible, but all also mentioned that the actual implementation of the system would be very challenging. According to IBM, creating a system with a simple, solid and elegant design will be a true challenge given the complexity of the context of the European pension system (ETS), especially without the availability of a European identification system. The consultants\u2019 remarks on the design of the system were discussed during the project and resulted in a more elaborate and better design as well as an implementation strategy. At the final Expert Meeting of the project, a round-table discussion was held with 11 out of 14 existing EU tracking services. This was the very first time all tracking services shared the same room and elaborated together on pension tracking services in the EU. This round-table conference could very well be the start of bilateral meetings between national tracking services. Dissemination The project team disseminated the results of the web survey on pensions in a report, which was presented in an event involving all relevant stakeholders (EU Commission, EU umbrella organisations, EU pension providers). Besides this report, the project team developed 41 other reports distributing them widely in over 1 100 copies. Periodic meetings in Brussels were also organised. The project team regularly disseminated newsletters containing relevant information about the action to anyone interested in TTYPE and its activities. TTYPE representatives also presented the project at various events implemented by other organisations such as the EU Commission, the European Association of Paritarian Institutions (AEIP), Pensions Europe and the World Pension Summit. In total, over the course of the project, the team organised 20 training and peer-learning sessions for over 750 participant experts. European added value The project contributed to constructing an architecture of a mechanism, which (when functional) will be able to track pension records at the EU level. Therefore, the project added value at the EU level in particular. It was necessary to involve all parties from different European countries in the course of the project. This was carried out through two channels: organisation of European level stakeholders\u2019 survey Activities implemented \u2022 Identification of existing pension tracking systems in Europe; \u2022 Gathering of information on legislative context of national pension systems, their structure and business models they use; \u2022 Definition of a basic setup for two or three alternatives for European tracking service, based on the gathered information; \u2022 Development of recommendations for a European tracking system for pensions.

In addition, the project facilitated sharing of best practices in pension tracking that are already implemented in different EU Member States. On the basis of these good practices, three alternative models for the ETS were defined during the project. Finally, the ETS (if and when implemented) might also have an impact on the free movement of persons in the EU. The fact that an EU-level pension tracking service does not exist at the moment is seen as an obstacle by EU citizens moving to work in other countries. Abolishing this obstacle should lead to more people considering finding a job abroad. Sustainability The action has provided recommendations that the development of a European pension tracking service should continue. It is planned that EU funding will be made available in 2016 to launch a pilot project on a European tracking system for pensions. ",
        "36 Project to support the development of a cost-effective social protection system Social protection systems in the EU differ significantly in the level, composition and type of spending, their sources of financing and the outcomes they achieve. The wide range of existing social protection spending and financing arrangements is associated with uneven social and economic outcomes across Member States. This diversity also represents an important source for knowledge sharing and mutual learning. The project described below was funded under a call for proposals ( 8 ) aimed at helping Member States review various aspects of their social protection systems to identify potentials for improved cost-effectiveness, including by strengthening the systems\u2019 social investment orientation.

Retrieved from: http://www.kent.ac.uk/tizard/About/about.htm \u2018The international round-table discussion on regional experiences of deinstitutionalisation was attended by representatives from national governments, institutes of social protection and other related institutions from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and various stakeholders from Serbia.\u2019 The project \u2018Social Protection Assessment for Values and Effectiveness \u2014 SAVE\u2019 aimed to encourage and improve social reforms in Serbia by reviewing the deinstitutionalisation (DI) process in the country ( 9 ). Socioeconomic context Over the past decades, many countries across Europe have developed strategies to support community-based services in an attempt to replace traditional models of care, particularly those that led to lifelong isolation within segregated institutions, which deny affected individuals fundamental human rights as recognised by the EU Charter of Fundamental rights including respect for human dignity, the right to not be subjected to degrading treatment, the right to liberty and security, education, work, health and equality and non- discrimination. The number of places in residential facilities has been reduced and many institutions closed, but the trend is uneven and progress is slow. Approximately 1.2 million people still live in residential institutions in Europe \u2014 over a quarter of them suffering from intellectual disabilities and 150 000 of whom are children ( 10 ). Results and impacts The project impacted various stakeholders and levels including the social system in general, national and local institutions, service providers and their staff, and ultimately the final target Social Protection Assessment for Values and Effectiveness \u2014 SAVE Call identification number: VP/2013/013 Project duration: 2014-2016 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0173 EU contribution in euros: 128 453.58 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Non-governmental organisations; Social partners; Higher education institutions and research institutes; Media.

        "37 groups including the elderly and children in Serbia. The key results included: \u2022 a policy review of the deinstitutionalisation process in Serbia (effectiveness and sustainability status quo); \u2022 identification of the main constraints in the DI process; \u2022 identification of the most important unwanted effects of DI; \u2022 proposal of the new measures for further improvement of the DI process; \u2022 knowledge sharing and mutual learning through comparative analysis of DI experiences across the EU and among neighbouring countries. Policy evidence generated by the project The project produced the following strategic and analytical documents: \u2022 economic analysis of social welfare services affecting the DI process, analysis of the status quo with DI in Serbia; and \u2022 synthetic policy paper on good practices and lessons learned in DI, based on the review of European protection systems in the areas of long-term care and childcare. The recommendations and findings from the situation analysis of the progress of the DI, the expert workshop, study tour to Austria, final conference are meant to be fed into the policymaking and legislative processes, and support further legislative developments in the area of cost-effectiveness in Serbian social welfare. Dissemination of project results Project partners disseminated information on activities and results extensively (over 1 500 copies) through various channels including diverse promotional materials such as video, electronic (including via its website), printed materials (leaflets and brochures, reports) and events targeting different audiences, including policy-makers, social partners, academia, NGOs and the ultimate target groups \u2014 service providers for individuals with disabilities. Sustainability The capacity building element of the project in particular will remain impactful beyond the project timeframe. The Serbian officials trained through the project by means of the study tours and workshops, as well as other stakeholders (service providers, municipality, and government representatives) will continue supporting the DI process in Serbia. The documents produced in the framework of the project and policy recommendations could be used in the legislative processes on further DI reform in the country. The findings underline that despite improvements in DI, Serbia stands to improve what the situation analysis found to be underdeveloped childcare services, particularly those that aim to maintain children in their families, as well as the lack of progress particularly in the area of long-term care for adults and ensuring continuity of quality care. European added value The project represents an added value for Europe through mutual learning. The international study tour and visit aimed to familiarise Serbian social welfare professionals with the EU best practices in their respective fields. Likewise, the international round-table discussion on regional experiences of deinstitutionalisation was attended by representatives from national governments, institutes of social protection and other related institutions from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and various stakeholders from Serbia. Activities implemented \u2022 Economic analysis of social welfare services affecting the deinstitutionalisation (DI) process; \u2022 Analysis of policies and processes of DI in Serbia; \u2022 Review of long-term and childcare protection systems in Europe and preparation of good practices policy paper; \u2022 Development of policy proposals to improve deinstitutionalisation process and cost-effectiveness; \u2022 Organisation of events (round-table; conference) for cross-country mutual learning and dissemination.

        "38 2.2. Employment Section 2.2. of this report provides examples of projects funded in the policy area of employment. Projects described below fall into one of two categories: \u2022 supporting partnerships between employment services (the so-called PARES projects); \u2022 encouraging collaboration between public and private actors of the labour market to address persistent skills shortages and mismatches. Projects supporting partnerships between employment services The two projects presented below were funded as a result of the call for proposals ( 11 ) which aimed at encouraging new forms of collaboration between employment services at national and EU level for the delivery of complementary services with a high standard of quality and efficiency. The supported projects had to involve at least two different types of partners from public, private or third sector employment services, also eligible education and training providers, NGOs and welfare institutions, to work together by relying on the specific strengths and expertise of each employment service. Projects supported by this call were also strongly encouraged to target the \u2018green economy\u2019 by focusing on how to improve, revamp and re-orient skills of jobseekers and job changers to ensure their smooth transition towards emerging \u2018green jobs.\u2019 ( 11 ) Call for Proposals VP/2012/013: PARES: Partnerships between Employment Services. \u2018The partnership provided 46 unemployed individuals with an integrated service package combining training, evaluation of skills, information on vacancies abroad and in the home market, as well as ongoing career guidance.\u2019 The MOBIESP project aimed to find new approaches to improve the state of PES services in Spain for job mobility with a special focus on youth and low-skilled groups. More specifically, it sought to create a Public-Private Partnership of two organisations: Sepepa Regional Employment Authority in Asturias, and private employment service provider Adecco. By facilitating the exchange of their know-how and complementary methodologies towards the same objective, the project sought to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a collaborative PPP designed to effectively manage services promoting international job mobility via the EURES network among other sources. The specific aims were to: \u2022 introduce and develop the idea of designing a Labour Mobility Plan; \u2022 customise job mobility paths based on individual needs of candidates; \u2022 promote user autonomy when seeking employment Strengthening Mobility with Innovative Employment Services Partnerships in Europe \u2014 MOBIESP Call identification number: VP/2012/013 Project duration: 1 January 2014-30 June 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2013/0578 EU contribution in euros: 212 500.00 Policy area: Employment and Free Movement of Workers Target groups: Unemployed individuals; National, regional and local level policy-makers; Social, economic/ business partners; Employers; Media.

        "39 outside of Spain by providing them with necessary tools; \u2022 take advantage of both partners in the PPP in their respective area of specialisation; \u2022 activate users for employment outside of Spain, as a result they would be more employable in the country as well. Results of the project The created PPP was successfully piloted by providing PES staff with training on international professional orientation to candidates. In addition, the partnership provided 46 unemployed individuals with an integrated service package combining training, evaluation of skills, information on vacancies abroad and in the home market, as well as ongoing career guidance. Finally, even though the results of participating in the training and orientation are expected to be seen in the longer-term, during the project itself, some 20 % of the participants were hired, having received support and counselling in this process from the collaborative partnership of employment service providers. Transferability The work methodology developed can be replicated in different times and circumstances. Similarly, the use of tools developed for field activities and for the diagnosis and assessment of skills can be widely used to provide similar employment services. Dissemination The project, in large part due to its role to inform unemployed individuals about available possibilities, disseminated widely its results using a variety of channels including a designated website, social media, a newsletter circulated to stakeholders during the implementation phase, in an Annual Stakeholder Conference and Strategic Dialogues, two workshops and a press conference. In addition, project promoters have also shared the intermediate and partial results with relevant national experts. Transnational dimension Though the target group and project activities were limited to Spain, the longer-term outcome of the employment services provided, as per its design, is employment throughout the EU. Partnerships This project developed a new partnership between a public player (Sepepa) and a private one (Adecco), which led to the piloting of a collaborative service to help unemployed individuals in two regions of Spain increase their prospects for finding employment in the EU. Sustainability of project results As is the case with capacity building in general, and increasing employability specifically, after the funding period the impact will not halt, meaning that the participants will be better positioned to find employment, ideally both in the home and EU markets. Potential good practice The methodology created for the career training and orientation of the target group, if proven successful in the longer term by means of helping participants to increase their employability and, in turn, secure employment abroad or in the home market, could be treated as a good practice and merit exploration of its replicability in other settings, particularly countries or regions with high cyclical unemployment. European added value Notably, and also because of the transnational nature of the longer-term impact this project aimed to achieve, it contributed to the free movement of persons within the bloc, making better use of opportunities in other markets in the face of barriers to successful employment in the home market. Activities implemented \u2022 Introduction and development of the idea to design a Labour Mobility Plan that is customised and structured for every user; \u2022 Analysis of the requirements for providing job mobility services by a Public-Private Partnership Model; \u2022 Setting up a pilot partnership for mobility services to: \u00b0 prepare and support programme participants for effective market integration abroad by training PES staff and candidates; \u00b0 provide added value to the candidates and employers thus reducing the risks associated with labour mobility; \u2022 Dissemination of results and promotion of project activities via web, social networks, newsletter, Annual Stakeholder Conference and Strategic Dialogues, two workshops and a press conference.

        "40 \u2018The value added of this project at the European level was the improvement of existing services for unemployed youths by adding the necessary ingredient of specialised support after they complete VET training.\u2019 The project aimed to \u2022 Provide experience-based findings and lessons learned to create a model that fights unemployment and enables the efficient, cost-effective transition from a vocational school to the labour market; \u2022 Establish a Public-Private Employment Services partnership to deliver complementary services with a high standard of quality and efficiency, in line with the Partnership between Employment Services (PARES) initiative, within the Europe 2020 Strategy. \u2022 Break traditional barriers and stereotypes concerning different competing roles between PES, PrES and the third sector (beside PES and PrES project partners included an NGO focused on NEETs as well as an evaluation partner), so that they can fight unemployment together. In addition to its main aims, the project also sought to improve the image of apprenticeship vocational schools (EPAS) and provide evidence to further improve the EPAS curricula to better meet labour market demand and the Greek PES Apprenticeship Portal by providing info on relevant activities related to the apprenticeship system to stakeholders. Finally, additional objectives after the success of the first six months of implementation included the creation of a cluster of employers (large companies and SMEs); establishment and validation of an operational model for the collaboration of PES and PrES by decreasing the total placement cost; and contribution to increased capacity of PES to elaborate and adapt this model. Socioeconomic context The project aimed to alleviate the consequences for the hardest-hit group by the longest labour crisis in recent history in Greece. The project targeted unemployed EPAS graduates because of the (1) high rates of youth unemployment (61.7 % in the 15-24 age group); (2) an evident skills gap and mismatch between employer needs, current and forthcoming, and skill levels of youths (decreasing EPAS graduation rates); and (3) a documented need to increase the efficiency of transition from EPAS to the labour market. Results of the project The project achieved numerous results, in some cases surpassing its targets, which were revisited with the Commission after the success of the first 6 months of implementation. Beside successfully piloting a model for collaborative public- private-third sector action against unemployment in Greece and achieving its aims as outlined above, the project: \u2022 assessed and profiled 523 graduates of EPAS (initial target: 200); \u2022 achieved approval (assessment, interviews and positive employment prospects) of 495 candidates; \u2022 achieved 19 job placements; \u2022 achieved 47.36 % sustained employment 6 months\u2019 post placement (initial target 30 %). Dissemination Project partners communicated the results via their own channels and various platforms including online (programme website; Greek PES portal; social media incl. Facebook and Twitter); press; events for stakeholders including programme Pilot Programme for the Transition from Apprenticeship School to the Labour Market Call identification number: VP/2012/013 Project duration: 23 December 2013-23 November 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2013/0576 EU contribution in euros: 261 480.88 Policy area: Employment Target groups: PES; Apprenticeship Schools (EPAS) and trainers; Unemployed graduates of EPAS; Unemployed youths (18-35) in Attica and Thessaloniki regions; Unemployed graduates of VET schools (EPAS).

Partnerships This project facilitated the piloting of a new partnership spanning the public (PES), private (PrES) and third sector (NGO) to tackle unemployment among youths, including graduates of VET training. Sustainability of project results Project results are sustained on multiple levels. Firstly, the PrES\u2013ManpowerGroup continues to assist candidates contacted through the project in getting jobs and traineeship placements, and holds interviews with candidates already placed in employment via the programme to assess and document their experience. Secondly, the creation of this model to fight unemployment, the proactiveness of the partners involved and the engagement of their respective networks has fostered discussion on the issue of youth unemployment and new ways to address it. Potential good practice The project piloted a model that both achieved and exceeded its aims, and moreover planned to conduct evaluation post- implementation (e.g. via interviews with participants placed with employers, 6 months\u2019 post-placement). The documented evidence can be compared against other models to tackle unemployment and considered for replicability in other settings. The methodology created in the process of setting up the partnership, including materials used (guides for employers, candidates and EPAS trainers on graduates\u2019 transition to the labour market) can be reused in part or in full in other programmes with similar aims on the programme-level, or by candidates, trainers or employers on the institution and individual levels. Moreover, the model itself, given its success, could serve as a good practice with potential transferability to different regions and countries experiencing similar challenges. European added value The value added of this project at the European level was the improvement of existing services for unemployed youths by adding the necessary ingredient of specialised support after they complete VET training thus ensuring that the training is more effective and leading to better employment outcomes for the hardest-hit group by the economic crisis. In the process, the piloted model built capacity among PES providers and EPAS trainers.

        "42 Projects encouraging collaboration between public and private actors of the labour market to address persistent skills shortages and mismatches Below the report describes the results of five projects funded under the call for proposals entitled \u2018Delivering on skills for growth and jobs\u2019 ( ). Overall, this call aimed to encourage new forms of collaboration through partnerships between public and private actors of the labour market (such as public and private employment services, companies, including SMEs, chambers of commerce, training and education providers, social partners, and labour market intelligence entities) to address persistent skills shortages and mismatches and thus to help fill the gap between labour supply and demand in the EU. Four types of actions could be funded: \u2022 joint initiatives aimed at (1) anticipating green skills needs to facilitate matching process between labour supply and demand; and (b) supporting structural and sectoral adaptation through improving worker adaptability and mobility; \u2022 identification of effective implementation measures, good practices and innovative approaches with a special emphasis on the employment potential of ICTs and the Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs; \u2022 identification of effective implementation measures, good practices and innovative approaches with a special emphasis on personal and household services; \u2022 consolidation of European Sector Skills Councils that are beyond the feasibility phase. The supported actions were required to deliver the following outputs: \u2022 specific employment services to the end users; \u2022 evidence-based analysis of the implemented activities; \u2022 concrete labour market intelligence tools. \u2018The Skills Council was able to identify the drivers of change, collect data on current and future skills needs and map the impact of structural change on different job profiles.\u2019 The European Sector Skills Council for the Automotive Industry, consisting of 13 member organisations from 14 EU Member States, aimed to establish and pilot a networking platform to facilitate exchange of best practices, on the EU level, on skills issues in the automotive sector, particularly in anticipating and managing skills requirements, identifying and highlighting issues to be tackled by policy-makers and stakeholders, and enabling transfer of relevant knowledge and data to the providers of training and education to facilitate peer learning nationally.

        "43 employment to 12 million workers. The EU economy has been recovering from the recession of 2008, but unemployment has continued to rise. However, still in 2013, four out of 10 European employers reported difficulties in finding employees with the right skills due to a skills mismatch between the available workforce and jobs in the EU labour market. Education, training and lifelong learning are among the most important instruments to improve the competitiveness of the automotive industry. Project results Project partners, by means of organising a number of networking meetings of representatives from the industry sector (stakeholders from automotive supplies and vehicle manufacturers, industry associations etc.), trade unions, academia, EU and national governments succeeded in launching the European Automotive Skills Council (EASC) platform, at the moment including stakeholders from 15 European countries. New partnerships created The EASC represents a new partnership both on the management and implementation levels. Project partners set up the Skills Council bringing together a broad range of stakeholders, such as industry representatives (employers\u2019 organisations and trade unions), research institutes, automotive clusters, public authorities and training providers. Policy evidence generated The EASC, by means of bringing together different interested parties through the platform, contributed to exchanging information, including on challenges and good practices. The results of the platform\u2019s piloting made possible by this project are documented in four reports including the EASC Skills Report that summarises findings of a survey on the employment situation in the European automotive sector and evolution of occupations as well as associated skills. Among other issues relevant for maintaining a high level of skilled workforce in the automotive sector, project partners and stakeholders have emphasised the lack of workplace attractiveness for women, Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) graduates and basic-level VET participants. Integration of horizontal issues Although the automotive sector is traditionally dominated by male employment, the situation has started to change during the last decade, with more women employed throughout the automotive supply chain. The EASC repeatedly discussed the gender dimension, the fact that women are not always present in representative functions, and the sector\u2019s overall attractiveness for women. Moreover, the EASC Final Report discussed the demographic factor and the integration of several generations (intergenerational learning) of skilled workers into the automotive working environment. Dissemination of project results The EASC serves as a dissemination tool in its own right. Moreover, its activities and findings are available online in the EASC Skills Report, and were presented in the EASC Final Conference. Finally, project partners also distributed hard copies of the report through their respective networks. The Council organised its meetings in 2-7 languages to ensure accessibility to a wide array of international participants. Four communication events organised in the framework of the project attracted 160 participants. Sustainability measures After the piloting phase made possible by EC funding, the EASC platform will continue to serve as a hub for the exchange of information and best practices, linking regional and national representatives and stakeholders with activities and projects Activities implemented \u2022 Discussion on current employment and skills situation in different EU countries with input from national experts and trade unions; \u2022 Collection and exchange of good practices across the sector, particularly on trade union initiatives and social partner actions on issues such as change of skills in the sector, comparison of regional and corporate approaches and resulting needs assessment; \u2022 Preparation of comparative study and execution of Automotive Skills Survey; \u2022 Creation of the European Automotive Skills Council (EASC) and the Industry Core Group (of automobile industry reps) and collection of inputs; \u2022 Organisation of the Final European Conference with presentation of the results to European policy-makers, members of EASC, representatives of the industry and civil society as well as debate with stakeholders and open public.

Transferability By liaising with other initiatives such as the High-Level Group for the automotive industry (Gear2030) and ESCO, the project gained insight into skills issues (skills gaps, skills mismatches) that can be transferred and used in related policy contexts. European added value The EASC provided added value on the EU level in various ways, including identification and promotion of best practice examples in addressing skills mismatch among other industry issues; encouraging the removal of obstacles to the free movement of graduates and skilled workers across the EU, by supporting convergence of qualification standards in the EU labour market; and enabling networking between organisations previously unconnected on this scale across the bloc.

        "45 \u2018IndustriALL Europe and SEA Europe took the lead on creating the Skills Council to effectively anticipate the need for skills in the maritime technology sector and achieve a better match between skills and labour market needs.\u2019 This project was a joint effort of the Ships and Maritime Equipment Association of Europe (SEA Europe) and IndustriAll European Trade Union Association. It was a continuation of a previous phase of SEA Europe\u2019s development which identified and mapped around 200 training and education providers for shipbuilding and repair sectors. The aim was to establish a European Skills Council as a platform for maritime technology sector stakeholders in order to encourage cooperation and identify common challenges as well as good practices for overcoming gaps and mismatches. Another goal was to analyse labour market intelligence in the sector and cover skills/occupations evolution in the sector, challenges related to technological development, employment trends, demand and supply of skills and innovative tools and strategies for policy- makers. Project results The key outcomes of the project were the published Report \u2018Evolution of Supply, Employment and Skills in the European Maritime Technology Sector\u2019 and policy recommendations stemming from the Skills Council\u2019s work. The resulting recommendations to bridge the skills gaps in the maritime sector call for: \u2022 a holistic European industrial strategy for the maritime sector; \u2022 promotion of environmentally sustainable legislation; \u2022 planning security to allow the industry to maintain market share; \u2022 fair competition and attraction of skilled talent; \u2022 education and lifelong learning, namely: timely anticipation of skills and employment needs; promotion of lifelong learning; establishment of transfer systems between education and industry and extension of dual education systems; establishment of common European standards and extension of the competencies of the European Globalisation Fund. Socioeconomic context The creation of a European Skills Council for the Maritime Technology Sector is one of the recommendations of the LeaderSHIP 2020 Strategy, adopted by the European Commission and industry stakeholders in February 2013 and endorsed by the European Competitiveness Council in May 2013. In the context of the Sectoral Social Dialogue for Shipbuilding, IndustriALL Europe and SEA Europe took the lead on creating the Skills Council to effectively anticipate the need for skills in the maritime technology sector and achieve a better match between skills and labour market needs. Dissemination of project results Project partners disseminated information on the project, its results and the main output \u2014 \u2018Evolution of supply, employment and skills in the maritime technology sector\u2019 via their own respective dissemination channels including websites (of partners and their networks) and social media and in designated events.

The Council in effect created a forum for relevant stakeholders to exchange information on, and look for common challenges and solutions to the skills matching issue. Policy evidence generated by the project The report on the \u2018Evolution of the skills supply and demand in the maritime technology sector\u2019 reflected the outcomes of the network\u2019s discussions and exchanges to date, including with education providers, workers, companies and public authorities representing all the segments within the sector and almost all the maritime countries in Europe. The project counted on the regular participation of EU institutional representatives (Directorate-General for Employment, Directorate-General for Growth, European Defence Agency \u2014 EDA, Joint Programming Initiative \u2014 JPI Oceans and Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries), who had the opportunity to connect with a wide range of stakeholders in the sector, from all over Europe. Through the project, the sector has also been able to compile labour information, draw up a picture of the current employment structures in Europe and the occupations and skills needs. Council representatives agreed several policy recommendations and will work to get them implemented in the near future, and issued a joint position paper to EC and EP representatives on the implementation of LeaderSHIP2020. Sustainability The Skills Council will continue to function as a platform for the exchange of good practices among stakeholders and to identify specific skills deficiencies as well as solutions to solve skills-related issues in the future. Based on the results of the current project, the Council identified the following areas as market drivers where skills need to be improved and thus its future areas of focus: digitalisation, 3D printing, environmentally friendly technologies for green shipping and the manufacturing processes within the shipyards. European added value The project represents a value added for the EU by: \u2022 creating a network with the participation of experts representing a wide variety of relevant stakeholders in the sector; \u2022 generating and communicating evidence to policy-makers by bringing sector stakeholders together with public authorities on local, regional and EU level (EC and EP, particularly the Intergroup on Seas, Rivers, Islands and Coastal Areas Searica) to exchange views and speak face- to-face about possible actions to solve the challenge of the skills mismatch in the sector and practices to address it.

The project was launched to promote improvement in the working methods for cooperation, particularly in filling the skills gaps related to initiating and running green business (specifically, recycling), while encouraging the development of the green skills of Roma people in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Slovenia. The initiative, led by the only Roma municipality in Europe, encouraged the sharing of good practices between Macedonian Roma entrepreneurs and counterparts from neighbouring countries, with the main goal of improving the skills of the local Roma populations by encouraging informal green businesses to become formal. Project results By means of increased knowledge and capabilities of stakeholders, the project has improved the chances of employment and skills of local Roma populations in three cities and enabled people to work with waste collection, recycling and to independently run their businesses. Moreover, all participating countries exchanged and documented the status quo with green business in a situation analysis. Finally, the project succeeded in establishing a network of Green Business Incubators and support for future green business start-ups. Policy evidence generated by the project Activities under the project included assessing the current state of affairs of the target group (Roma) with a view to preparing them to further develop their green skills and to support organisations working with this target group to better meet their needs. Project implementers collected data using the participative approach and by engaging Roma persons and organisations, among other things thus ensuring ownership in project implementation. The results are overviewed in a comprehensive publication \u2018Situation Analysis for being a (Roma) Green Entrepreneur.\u2019 The publication includes evidence from participating countries, including the policy framework on green sectors from renewable energy to energy efficiency to waste and water management; air quality; restoring and preserving biodiversity; and developing green infrastructure. Moreover, the project prepared another publication assessing funding opportunities and support measures for green businesses in the target countries as well as toolkits for business development. Dissemination of project results Project results were disseminated through the respective networks of implementing partners; a designated project website (including reports, documentary film and other online tools); publications including five reports of which over 9 000 copies were distributed to stakeholders, and various events, including the Initial Conference in Prague and Final Regional Conference in Skopje, held to share ideas for green business and social entrepreneurship as a form of running green businesses. Moreover, four Steering Committee meetings were dedicated to sharing experience in the following areas: Roma employment, government policies, activities by other actors, conditions for start-ups and green business development.

Sustainability Green Business Incubators launched in the framework of the project in Bulgaria, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Slovenia will continue to function and focus on Roma employment issues in the area of green business. The incubators also had an extensive capacity building component, both for facilitators of the incubators and organisations working with Roma communities, as well as Roma individuals working in different green sectors. Moreover, the situation analysis in four languages serves as a tool that any interested party could use to do the background research for, start and develop their green business idea, making project outcomes beneficial to wider audiences and beyond the timeframe of project implementation. The project created added value for Europe by: \u2022 promoting benchmarking for decision-making by generating evidence and facilitating mutual learning of involved stakeholders and providing advocacy to decision- makers; \u2022 a particular focus during the second phase of the project was on shared know-how and policy effects in the area of social entrepreneurship on plastic recycling between EU members and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as well as green companies started by Roma people; \u2022 contributing to networking activities across countries with sizeable Roma populations facing similar challenges and facilitating exchange of good practices across communities and borders, including through the network of Green Business Incubators, leading to better representation of Roma communities in practice and the policy-making of each country individually as well.

The general and specific green competences related to the project will function as a core to improve green occupational standards (OS) in each country while the action plan elaborated at the level of each participating Member State will help to take next steps needed for the approval of the respective OS, according to its national legislation. The action results point to the need to look further into several inter-related aspects, such as: the characteristics of green jobs \u2014 sometimes marked by a seasonal character and a certain volatility (e.g. in the field of solar panels); the interdependence between various sectors such as economic, environmental, employment and training policies, as well as the possible state support/subsidies provided, as green products and services are more expensive than ordinary products. European added value Project implementers translated workshop experiences into integrated, common knowledge which can be further replicated at the EU level, and presented them as a study on the publicly accessible e-learning platform. The recommendations stemming from policy evidence generated in the framework of the project focus on: \u2022 economic, environmental and employment policies: for example, links between policies regulating these sectors and training; appropriate legislative and regulatory framework); \u2022 vocational training policies: involving social partners, third sector, academia, and business in identification of \u2018green\u2019 needs of the industry and support for quality instruction.

Actions described below fall into one of two categories: \u2022 projects aiming to place young people into quality and sustainable employment (\u2018Your first EURES Job\u2019 initiative); \u2022 funding to support activities of cross-border partnerships between employment services and other stakeholders relevant in the cross-border labour markets. \u2018Your first EURES job\u2019 projects YFEJ preparatory action/Budget years 2011-2013 For intra-EU labour mobility, the Commission tested a mobility scheme called \u2018\u2018Your first EURES job\u2019\u2019 during three consecutive budget years (2011-2013) with an overall budget of ca. EUR 12 million, which aimed to help young EU citizens aged 18-30 to find a job, traineeship or apprenticeship in another EU-28 Member State (remunerated, minimum 6 months\u2019 contract). It also supported employers to find workers in another EU country for their hard to fill vacancies. YFEJ was implemented as a preparatory action in the framework of the \u2018\u2018Youth on the Move\u2019\u2019 flagship initiative and the Youth Opportunities Initiative with an EU budget of around EUR 12 million. Activities were funded by calls for proposals and implemented by EU public and private (for-profit and not-for-profit) employment services. Between 2011 and 2014, a total of 15 projects were selected through three calls for proposals. All projects together resulted in 4 251 job placements . Other relevant indicators on support given are the following: 1 733 job interviews in another Member State, 607 language trainings and 405 integration trainings by SMEs. An interim evaluation (2014) highlighted the YFEJ relevance (it addresses labour market needs), added value (it provides an enhanced Europe-wide service package) and complementarity to EURES and other EU mobility schemes. A 12-month ex-post evaluation of the YFEJ preparatory action is ongoing until the third quarter of 2016 to ascertain the findings of the interim evaluation and to also examine the costs, benefits and impacts of different options for future development of the scheme.

        "52 \u2018Young people who participated in the project\u2019s activities will become active ambassadors of youth mobility and will keep spreading positive views that will have an impact on tackling barriers and misconceptions about transnational youth mobility in their countries.\u2019 The project aimed to place at least 200 young people into sustainable, quality employment or traineeship positions in an EU country other than that of their residence. It intended to achieve this goal by means of tackling barriers to youth mobility, such as skill gaps, cultural differences and lack of knowledge/resources through providing employment services, consulting, preparatory training, integration support and direct funding to young people and SMEs. There were two additional objectives. First, to create a reusable \u2018Relocation Toolkit,\u2019 including various tools and methodologies aimed at helping other similar projects and organisations to support young people in finding employment across Europe. Second, the project aimed to raise awareness of young people and businesses (with the focus on SMEs) on the opportunities offered by the European job market. The project involved providing services in six EU countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal). It targeted sectors where the lack of talent has been identified: tourism in Spain, Italy and Portugal and the high-tech industry in the Netherlands. Results and impacts Although the project fell short of achieving its quantitative targets in job placements (10 placements out of the 200 target) and SME involvement, it generated other outputs of value. For example, the project through social media and dissemination events, including launch events in Bulgaria, Greece and Italy, raised awareness about possibilities for youth mobility to target groups, including young people and employers, particularly SMEs. Also, the project team created a Relocation Toolkit to facilitate youth mobility, both for youths seeking jobs abroad and for SMEs looking to integrate foreign workforce. Finally, some 23 training sessions were organised in the framework of the project involving 303 youth and employer representatives. Lessons learned The project revealed that young jobseekers need more encouragement concerning mobility around Europe so that they are willing to leave their home country. On employers, the project made clear that companies (especially SMEs) need complex incentives in order to hire young people and remunerate them appropriately so that they want to work in that job and remain there. No SMEs were finally engaged in the project. Due to the broader socioeconomic uncertainty that prevailed at the time in many southern European countries, along with the seasonality phenomenon that characterises employment in the tourism industry, many difficulties were encountered in trying to get employers engaged in the project.

Dissemination of project results Project results were communicated to target groups and broader audiences throughout the project duration via the website, social media platforms and press releases. A final dissemination event for stakeholders (project partners, involved employers, experts and business consultants) took place in Athens. Sustainability The project promoters expect that young people who participated in the project\u2019s activities will become active ambassadors of the youth mobility and will keep spreading positive views that will have an impact on tackling barriers and misconceptions about transnational youth mobility in their countries. In addition, it is expected that a number of employers, who were contacted and became aware or more familiar with the EURES youth mobility initiative, will potentially boost the promotion of future EU mobility initiatives. European added value The project contributed to networking activities between organisations providing employment services in Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal. This might lead to further cooperation between the organisations involved and thus add value at the European level in increased geographical labour mobility. Activities implemented \u2022 Development of a \u2018support ecosystem\u2019 for stakeholders (employment experts and career offices of higher education institutions) to help them get more young people into employment; \u2022 Identification of talent pools; \u2022 Development of awareness campaign materials (website, online talent management platform, guides for employers and other stakeholders, guides for young jobseekers); \u2022 Communication and networking events for stakeholders; \u2022 Setting up help desks to service jobseekers and employers; \u2022 Awareness-raising-activities: direct emails, face- to-face communication, social media activities (Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter accounts created), dissemination events; \u2022 Identification of actual placement or traineeship opportunities and obtaining commitment from employers; \u2022 Matching of young jobseekers\u2019 applications and employers\u2019 needs as well as relocation of selected young people to quality jobs/traineeships in another country; \u2022 Mentoring services for young jobseekers; \u2022 Evaluation of project activities.

        "54 \u2018The project contributed to the free movement of persons: specifically, it supported young people from Spain and Greece who found employment in Germany.\u2019 Context and transnational dimension At the beginning of the project, Europe\u2019s employment market (especially for young people) was highly imbalanced: almost 60 % of persons under 25 were unemployed in Greece and Spain, whereas countries like Germany and Austria were facing serious bottlenecks in many industries. In order to address this issue, the project sought to recruit young people from EU countries with high youth unemployment rates (Greece and Spain) for apprenticeships in countries with a more favourable youth employment market situation (in particular, Germany). There have been similar initiatives in the past, but they have faced certain difficulties in integrating young people into their new environment: too high but unspecific expectations on both sides (jobseekers and employers), language and cultural barriers, as well as young people feeling lonely in the new environment, which often caused early returns. The overall aim of the project was to develop and realise a comprehensive approach offering both employers from Germany and young jobseekers from Greece and Spain optimised pre-conditions for a long-term and successful employment relationship. The main focus was on the matching and placing of apprentices, but skilled workers were also considered. The main operational objective of the project was to place 150 young people into employment in Germany. Results and impacts At the end of the project, 1 507 applications were received, 328 applicants were tested, 220 applicants took part in language courses and preparation trainings in Greece and Spain, 59 candidates attended intensive language courses and preparation trainings in Germany, 73 young people took part in interviews and a total number of 53 young people were placed into quality employment or apprenticeships . This translates into a 35 % achievement of the initial placements target (150). All young people participating in the project received employment contracts for at least 6 months. As many as 14 young people received certificates recognising their academic and/or professional qualifications. In addition, there is evidence that more than 10 participating young people received an apprenticeship pledge and job engagement after the end of the project. Lessons learned and transferability of the project activities: As regards employers and jobseekers: \u2022 expectations of companies and profiles of participants often do not meet; \u2022 language skills and work experience of jobseekers were often lower than demanded; this sometimes caused security problems, especially in logistics and construction; \u2022 often companies signal interest, but do not hire; \u2022 participants expected a job right away, but were reluctant to accept offers. As regards advice for the European Commission: \u2022 the initial project duration of 12 months is too short for setting up innovative pilot projects; \u2022 joining as an independent organisation an ongoing EURES Your First EURES Job Implemented in Germany, Greece and Spain Call identification number: VP/2013/014 Implementing/participating countries: Germany, Greece and Spain Grant identification number: VS/2014/0284 Policy area: Free movement of workers/Employment Project duration: 1 June 2014-30 September 2015 Policy sub-area: EURES/Youth employment EU contribution in euros: 562,946.31 Target groups: Young jobseekers and businesses ",
        "55 initiative needs more support from existing networks, especially in the set up phase of new projects. An external evaluation provided the following suggestions for future projects: \u2022 The preparatory courses in the countries of origin, as well as the application and language training in Germany, represented a solid success for the implementation of the project. First, they served as an effective platform for communicating general and logistical information, and second, they were viewed by participants as useful tools for establishing social contacts with other applicants. The structure and content of these preparatory courses should remain, therefore, as they have thus far been implemented; \u2022 The key factor determining the success of application efforts and the integration of foreign job applicants into German firms was unquestionably the language skills of the participants; \u2022 There remains room for improvement with respect to the communication between the job applicants and EURES advisers, particularly on the clear exchange of expectations and possibilities for work placement. Policy evidence generated by the project: One of the project\u2019s work packages was devoted to monitoring and evaluating the implemented activities. The following outputs for future evidence-based policy-making were developed: \u2022 reports on critical success factors on (1) competences of apprentices from other countries and (2) social skills for incoming employees; \u2022 guide on the integration of apprentices from other countries; \u2022 customised marketing plans for the focus labour markets (Greece and Spain); \u2022 action plans for SMEs as potential employers; \u2022 requirement profiles based on professional skills. Partnerships A network of language schools was created in Greece and Spain; it helped to (1) find suitable candidates and (2) to deliver comprehensive language courses and preparation trainings. The project promoters also contacted and activated existing EURES partners and local employment services in Germany, such as VIJ Stuttgart, Stadtwerke D\u00fcren, STRABAG, Hammer, several chambers and associations like Deutsch Hellenische Wirtschaftsvereinigung, IQ Network and Employment Agencies in Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf, Dortmund, N\u00fcrnberg, Frechen and D\u00fcren. Equality considerations 12 of 53 young people, who were employed, were female. Due to the nature of the targeted professions (construction branch, logistics, metal branch etc.), more than 80 % were male candidates. The project team started with 87.5 % males and changed it to 75 % with a female project leader starting in October 2014. Sustainability The involved employment services will support all candidates who joined the project and have not found a job opportunity yet by actively introducing them to employers in Germany even after the end of this project. Several partners under this project have also participated in another EU-funded project (MobiPro) with similar objectives. The latter project has also dealt with jobseekers from Greece, therefore experience from the project described here could have been applied. Dissemination The information on project results was presented to partners and experts working in the field of vocational education in a number of events held in Cologne, Bilbao and Brussels. The project also received unforeseen attention from the press. Several articles were published in newspapers such as K\u00f6lner Stadt Anzeiger about the project\u2019s activities. Activities implemented \u2022 \u2018Integration readiness\u2019 assessment of the companies offering vacancies in Germany in order to create action plans and to set up appropriate requirement profiles; \u2022 Development of a set of marketing measures in order to address potential candidates (jobseekers) in their home countries (Greece and Spain); \u2022 Matching young people applying for jobs and apprenticeships with the vacancies published by the employers; \u2022 Preparation courses for candidates in their home countries; \u2022 Welcoming the future apprentices: helping and assisting the future apprentices during their first visit in the incoming country; \u2022 Integration of young jobseekers into the employer\u2019s working environment; \u2022 Monitoring and evaluation of the project activities.

        "56 Potential good practice Cooperation between EURES Advisers at ZAV (German labour market institutions) and chambers/associations such as the German Hellenic Association and also the Spanish General Consulate in D\u00fcsseldorf, was the key success factor. It helped to place 48 young people in employment in the extension phase (4 months) of the project. The key lesson learned during the project is that strong cooperation between the relevant partners must be achieved as early as possible. European added value The project contributed to the free movement of persons: specifically, it supported young people from Greece and Spain who found employment in Germany. Due to its transnational character, the project also allowed for reducing cross-border risks and mitigating their consequences. ",
        "57 \u2018At the end of the project, 76 young professionals had been placed in quality employment through the intervention.\u2019 The main objective of the project was to implement 200 placements for healthcare professionals from Greece, Portugal and later Spain and Romania in regular jobs in a strictly regulated field of elderly care in Germany, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Socioeconomic context The action gave priority to recruits from Greece and Portugal, since the first generation of migrant workers to the industrial production sites in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg was recruited from these two countries. Thus, large Portuguese and Greek diaspora communities have developed in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg since the 1960s. These migrant groups are ageing and increasingly needing care. Healthcare is also a bottleneck profession in Germany, and therefore young professionals from European countries are in high demand to fill the available vacancies. Results At the end of the project, 76 young professionals had been placed in quality employment through the intervention (38 % of the initial quantitative target). All young professionals received contracts for at least 12 months in a full-time job. In addition: \u2022 the project raised awareness about employment opportunities in Germany among jobseekers in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Romania; \u2022 the selected jobseekers gained language and intercultural skills as well as self-confidence; \u2022 qualification, training and support measures in the country of residence (access to language courses and other supporting activities) for suitable candidates were effectively provided; \u2022 additional qualifications were provided to young jobseekers by the employers and VIJ through on-the-job training and language courses; \u2022 innovative approach \u2018Virtual language course\u2019 was successfully implemented. Lessons learned The project promoters planned to conduct recruitment fairs in Greece and Portugal to introduce candidates and employers at the beginning of the placement procedure. The intention was to link candidates with healthcare companies from Germany in order to sign a declaration of intent between the two before they started the language courses. A further aim of the fairs was to group the candidates to facilitate the language courses and other procedures. This approach was not successful, since it was not suitable for SMEs, which were supposed to be the main target group within the employers. SMEs were not in a position to send someone to another country for several days at a time to attend recruitment procedures. As a result, the project lost a lot of candidates \u2014 the fairs had already been announced and did not take place. In this phase, the candidates lost confidence in the reliability and capability of the project, so the whole candidate attraction needed to be restarted again. Due to the failure of the job fairs, the project promoters changed the recruitment plan and started recruiting jobseekers via internet, flyers and face-to-face marketing. In addition, insufficient German language skills of employees were a major source of distrust from employers.

        "58 Finally, at the beginning of the project there was also a problem with the recognition of qualifications. VIJ staff members had to provide support to a number of candidates whose qualifications were only partly recognised in Germany. In-depth background checks were necessary to understand the training qualifications of every applicant in every country of origin in order to manage the gap between the given qualifications and the requirements of German legislation. It was concluded that differences in the \u2018cultures and professional approaches to elderly realised care\u2019 in different countries are a strong deterrent to transnational labour mobility. The project promoters the large gap between the expectations of the employers in Germany and the reality of the professional training of the employees in Greece and Portugal. Transnational dimension VIJ had offices in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Romania with qualified bilingual staff from these countries. Furthermore, the team in Stuttgart consisted of bilingual employees with migrant background. Equality considerations Due to the nature of the targeted professions in elderly care, VIJ dealt with more than 80 % female candidates. The VIJ project team was also 90 % female. Sustainability After the end of the project, VIJ further supported all candidates, who had joined the project, but who could not find a job opportunity during the actual project, by actively introducing them to employers in Germany. Lessons learned during the project resulted in an adapted approach of VIJ for managing labour mobility by (1) building networks of employers and making them pay for services and (2) building-up small groups of up to 10 employees, who are trained and fully qualified in the countries of origin. Potential good practices In order to speed-up the language training, a virtual language course was initiated. It became part of the pre-departure preparation so that candidates would be better able to present themselves in the German labour market of elderly care. This option allowed VIJ to reach candidates in rural areas and smaller cities and to offer more flexibility to the candidates. Candidates who availed of the online courses achieved the same level as candidates who had personal training. The use of virtual classes was limited by insufficient internet access, but offered flexibility and strong economies of scale. VIJ also built a network of language schools in the countries of origin, which helped to find suitable candidates and to deliver a comprehensive language course. Another potential good practice is that, in order to overcome stereotypes referring especially to language skills, VIJ introduced job shadowing as part of the selection process. This helped to improve the expectation management on both sides. Employers learned about the personality of the applicant and her/his abilities, whereas employees understood better the challenges of their new job. As a result, both sides were enabled to make an informed decision. Dissemination VIJ presented the results of the project at an expert workshop organised by the Commission and actively took part at the YfEj 3.0 meeting in Athens where the project promoters shared insights with other teams working on similar actions. European added value The project has contributed to the free movement of persons in Europe through enabling young jobseekers from Greece,Spain, Portugal and Romania to find employment in healthcare and elderly care sectors in Germany. Activities implemented \u2022 Assessment of employers\u2019 needs with focus on SMEs in the area of elderly care; \u2022 Targeting suitable candidates in Greece and Portugal (later also Spain and Romania); \u2022 Coverage of the whole process of recruitment, matching and integration of jobseekers; \u2022 Pre-departure preparation by language training, intercultural training and complete relocation management; \u2022 In-firm and social integration of the jobseekers in Germany.

        "59 Cross-border partnerships In the framework of EURES, in 2015 the European Commission also supported partnerships among organisations providing employment services in the cross-border areas and their cooperation with the social partners ( 13 ) . These partnerships brought together public employment and vocational training services, employers and trade union organisations, local authorities and other institutions dealing with employment and vocational training in cross-border regions. EURES cross-border partnerships served (and will continue to work) as valuable points of contact among employment administrations, both regional and national and the social partners. They are also important means for monitoring these cross- border employment areas, constituting a key element in the development of a genuine European labour market. Actions described below fell into one of three strands: \u2022 the first strand supported activities of cross-border partnerships ; \u2022 the second strand sought to support closer cooperation of EURES members (EU public employment services) with social partners ; \u2022 the third strand facilitated labour mobility between the European Union and the EEA countries and also supported the operation of the EURES network in the EEA countries . Below the report presents activities of the EURES cross-border partnerships in 2015. \u2018The long-term objective is to promote the development of a common labour market, in compliance with the existing employment and social standards of Czech Republic, Germany and Poland.\u2019 The cross-border partnership EURES TriRegio consists of representatives of employment services, trade unions and employers\u2019 organisations from Saxony, Bohemia and Lower Silesia. This partnership was agreed on in 2004 in order to prepare for the integration of the Czech Republic and Poland into the European Union and first set up with the signing of the Framework Agreement in October of 2007. Integration of the labour and training markets of the border areas of participating countries is considered the main task of the partnership. Its long-term objective is to promote the development of a common labour market, in compliance with the existing employment and social standards of Czech Republic, Germany and Poland. The partnership provides information, advice and placement services for jobseekers, workers and employers in the region. In the funding period of 2015, EURES TriRegio developed activities that are particularly aimed at young people and recent graduates.

        "60 Key results Activities implemented in 2015 include 142 information and advisory days with a total of 2 247 participants and five job fairs with over 2 000 participants. In addition, 20 other transnational events were organised, with the participation of more than 600 persons. The events included information sessions on taking-up a job in Germany, training for vocational guidance for pupils from final school years, a high-level conference \u2018Towards fair mobility and good-quality work in the triangle region\u2019, a training course on the minimum wage in Germany for Czech employers, as well as meetings of the partners involved in TriRegio and other relevant labour market actors. Inclusion of vulnerable groups Targeted measures were implemented for groups with special counselling needs, such as long-term unemployed and older jobseekers. For these groups, EURES advisers organised special interviews/coaching and counselling sessions. Ex-post analysis has revealed that 25 of 130 participants in these measures received an employment offer after attending. Another targeted vulnerable group were teenagers, particularly those in the last years of schooling. They were invited to participate in information days for career guidance and job application training. Gender equality considerations EURES advisers involved in the work of TriRegio have noted that women contacted them with claims about the discrimination more frequently than other participants. Deeper analysis revealed that female employees with inadequate knowledge of German language were particularly exposed to various forms of abuse from employers. Specific services, such as advice from multilingual lawyers, were therefore provided for women in Germany. Dissemination Three newspaper articles were published that dealt with topics such as unemployment benefits for mobile workers, pensions and child support. A video on these topics was also developed, in particular for use in the internet and on social media. It explained in an accessible way the first steps for finding and taking-up employment in Germany. A brochure with information on labour law in the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland was also developed. Potential good practice To strengthen the advisory skills of EURES TriRegio, a single point of contact was created for the partnership. After this, both job seekers interested in working in the geographical area or employers seeking for workers could use the same email/ phone number in order to request services. European added value The EURES TriRegio cross-border partnership contributes significantly to the free movement of persons across the border regions of Saxony (Germany), Bohemia (Czech Republic) and Lower Silesia (Poland). Figures from the beginning of the partnership until mid-2015 show that the number of Polish people working in Saxony (Germany) increased by 36.6 %, while the number of Czechs increased by 48.2 %. Sustainability Activities of the EURES TriRegio will be continued and further developed. In the coming years, the key organisations implementing EURES TriRegio partnership will aim to bring in partners from other fields, such as tax authorities and health insurance funds. In addition, TriRegio will consider the use of new communication methods, e.g. social media, online job boards, internet telephony and others. Activities implemented \u2022 Information and advice days for jobseekers and employers; \u2022 Job fairs; \u2022 Job exchanges; \u2022 Workshops and other events for employers and jobseekers; \u2022 Coaching programmes; \u2022 Information video/film for mobile workers; \u2022 Brochures about the legal minimum wage and minimum labour and social insurance standards in Germany; \u2022 Contacts by EURES advisers with jobseekers and employers; \u2022 Communication activities, such as the elaborate TriRegio website, websites of the involved organisations, articles in the newspapers; \u2022 Measures for professional orientation of recent graduates; \u2022 Setting up a single contact point of the partnership.

        "61 \u2018\u2018In 2015, the cross-border partnership had around 10 500 direct contacts with employers and jobseekers and organised approximately 100 meetings with involved partners in order to enhance cooperation and the network architecture.\u2019 Euregio Maas-Rhein-Waal (EMRW) is a cross-border partnership of employment offices, trade unions, Chambers of Industry and Trade, employers\u2019 associations and Chambers of Craft Trades in the context of EURES. It covers a number of geographical areas on the border regions between Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. It is constituted of three organisations representing different regions, but working together under EURES: Euregio Rhein-Waal, Euregio Rhein-Maas-Nord and Euregio Maas-Rhein. The key objective of this cross-border partnership is to improve the transparency of the cross-border labour market, to increase the chances for jobseekers to get a quality job, and to support employers in their recruitment strategies. The grant analysed here funded all activities of EMRW in 2015. On operational objectives , in 2015 the EMRW cross-border partnership sought to: \u2022 provide services for the involved partners with respect to the cross-border matching of jobseekers and available vacancies, information and advice for mobile jobseekers, commuters and businesses in the relevant regions; \u2022 cooperate with other organisations on labour market optimisation, also such topics as social insurance, taxes and labour law in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands; \u2022 inform target groups about the services offered by the partners; \u2022 enhance human resources and the network of EURES advisers. Key results The major result for the year 2015 was a merger of several large organisations from separate regions working on cross-border employment issues into one EURES cross-border partnership. It is considered that organisations, which previously worked separately in the regions of Rhein-Waal, Rhein-Maas-Nord and Meuse-Rhine, were enabled to create synergies and achieve better impact through coordinating their efforts. In 2015, the cross-border partnership had around 10 500 direct contacts with employers and jobseekers and organised approximately 100 meetings with involved partners in order to enhance cooperation and the network architecture. Many exchanges of staff working in different national, regional and local authorities of the involved countries were organised throughout the year. In addition, many job fairs and speed dating events were organised and information materials about work and life in the neighbouring countries were published. The partnership also started to develop a common website of the joined EMRW cross-border partnership, which is still under construction and will go live soon. Developing partnerships Throughout 2015, EMRW organised many events (including meetings, workshops, job fairs) and other activities involving all or most of the key partners of the cross-border partnership in order to improve and develop new services for jobseekers and employees in the Rhein-Waal, Rheine-Maas-Nord and EURES in Grenzregionen Rhein-Waal (ERW), Euregio-rhein-maasnord (Ermn), Euregio Maas-Rhein (EMR) 2015 Call identification number: VP/2014/011 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2015/0084 EU contribution in euros: 525 406.38 Policy area: Free movement of workers Target groups: Businesses and jobseekers; Students; Pensioners; National, regional and local authorities; Employment offices; Bodies specialising in the EU law; Social partners; NGOs; Higher education and research institutions; Experts; National statistical offices; Media.

For example, a number of meetings between EURES advisers working in different regions were organised on such topics as \u2018mediating unemployed healthcare sector workers from the Netherlands in the German labour market\u2019, \u2018helping businesses from different countries cooperate\u2019 and others. Dissemination Information about the services delivered under the cross- border partnership was disseminated via websites of the involved partners, many brochures and other publications. Social media were also successfully employed to widen the audience reached. European added value The partnership contributed significantly to the free movement of persons in the cross-border regions connecting Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Also, as suggested by the grant beneficiaries, the role of EU funding was crucial for forming the partnership and to improve the functioning of the labour market in the cross- border regions. Before the EURES funding, the institutions were cooperating on a much smaller scale. Sustainability In the future, the EMRW cross-border partnership will seek to continue enhancing partnerships between the involved organisations from different regions even further. In the coming years, the partnership is planning to create a single point of contact for all the involved regions. Activities implemented \u2022 Various services to jobseekers and employers facilitating the matching of supply and demand of labour in the cross-border regions; \u2022 Development of EURES advisers network in the area; \u2022 Development of innovative and efficient mechanisms to provide services to jobseekers and employers; \u2022 Monitoring mobility in the border region and reporting on it; \u2022 Development and implementation of a more integrated cooperation between the partners involved in the cross-border partnership and responsible for taxation, social security and labour law, as well as the regional authorities; \u2022 Coordination and contribution to development of projects focused on improving the functioning of the labour market in the border region.

        "63 \u2018The EURES-T partnership implemented a number of successful actions to fight youth unemployment. For example, the education fair in Passau (Germany) attracted around 10 000 young visitors from Austria, Bavaria and the Czech Republic.\u2019 The EURES-T was the first EURES cross-border partnership between a new and an old EU Member State: the Czech Republic and Germany. It comprises the German employment agency districts of Hof, Weiden, Schwandorf, Deggendorf and Passau and the Czech districts (kraje) of Plzen and Karlovy Vary. The partnership was first founded in 2005. Since then, it has aimed to increase mobility in the border region, to break down obstacles to mobility and to provide important information on living and working conditions of the involved countries. More specific objectives for 2015 were to contribute to a fight against youth unemployment and to strengthen the partnerships between the involved actors. Key results First and foremost, the EURES-T partnership managed to contribute to a substantial increase in cross-border mobility between the relevant regions in 2014-2015. In the middle of 2014, there were 18 878 insured employees from the Czech Republic working in the Bavarian region in Germany. This number grew to 22 153 by June 2015. This means an increase of 3 275 workers per year. The partnership expects to place 6 000 more cross-border employees in quality employment by the end of the current programming period. The EURES-T partnership also implemented a number of successful actions to fight youth unemployment. For example, the education fair in Passau (Germany) attracted around 10 000 young visitors from Austria, Bavaria and Czech Republic. In addition, internships were offered to young people from Czech Republic working in the area of food and beverage production in order to achieve recognition of their qualifications in Germany. As many as 3 280 young people were targeted by this measure. In 2015, the EURES-T partnership focused a lot on analysing health insurance systems in the countries involved. For example, an employment agency of the Czech Republic in Karlovy Vary organised four seminars for their officials about health insurance legislation in Germany. Partnerships The human resources network involving staff of partners working under this cross-border partnership was created in 2015. It was greatly appreciated by the participating EURES advisers and other staff. The participating officials received training in providing services to young jobseekers, which is expected to have an impact on the capacity of the EURES-T to tackle youth unemployment issues. In addition, 23 Czech EURES advisers participated in job shadowing internships in a German employment agency in Weiden. This helped them to learn about the workflow of colleagues in another country and therefore to enhance effectiveness of the EURES-T network.

        "64 workshops, consultation days and other activities. The aims were twofold. First, there were a number of activities targeted at the officials working in German and Czech employment agencies in the border regions. For example, a collaborative workshop was organised for EURES advisers from both countries about social laws and tax issues. Second, the campaign also aimed to inform the public about opportunities delivered by the EURES-T partnership. A rather high visibility was achieved through articles in the newspapers and various brochures. The website of the partnership was also a very useful tool for reaching both practitioners and the public. Potential good practice A Welcome Centre was set up in Bavaria to work full-time with jobseekers and employers interested in cross-border mobility opportunities. The centre deals with such issues as health insurance, housing in another country, kindergarten placements and procedures for the recognition of vocational qualifications. European added value The added value of the EURES-T was achieved mainly through the above-mentioned measured increase in the cross-border mobility and therefore a contribution to the free movement of persons in the EU. Sustainability In the coming years, the EURES-T partnership will aim to focus on additional measures that could improve labour market integration of the Czech and German border regions, for example, networking of the public transport in border areas and language courses in schools. The Czech Republic is also planning to introduce a dual vocational training system, similar to that in Germany. This will also contribute to further cross-border labour market harmonisation. Finally, it is planned to harmonise the workflow of the partners involved in the EURES-T partnership to improve the effectiveness of collaboration. Activities implemented \u2022 Collecting comparable statistical data on the labour market and the labour force on both sides of the border; \u2022 Removing bottlenecks for particular professions; \u2022 Conducting a dialogue with employers and potential entrepreneurs in the region; \u2022 Widening access to the EURES services; \u2022 Providing information on the labour market aspects on both sides of the border to employers, jobseekers and students; \u2022 Exchanging vacancy notices and providing support to anyone seeking work on the other side of the border; \u2022 Supporting employers engaged in cross-border recruitment; \u2022 Providing information and support to potentially mobile employees about job vacancies and living and working conditions in the border region.

        "65 \u2018The grant financed an online salary calculator, providing (potential) cross- border workers with a tool to calculate their salary when taking on a job on the other side of the region.\u2019 The partnership aimed to promote a common labour market in the cross-border \u00d8resund region, to enhance INTERREGional and European mobility of the labour force, and to ultimately contribute to satisfying the need for qualified labour in the mentioned region. There were several more specific objectives. First, the project aimed to combat youth unemployment by facilitating matching and placement of jobseekers with an employer on the other side of the region. Second, the action aimed to attract Life Sciences and ICT specialists from various parts of \u00d8resund and Europe in general to the companies of the region, thus promoting European and regional mobility flows. Third, another partnership supported matching and placement of craftspeople and engineers with construction sector companies across the region and provided a platform (trade councils) for regional stakeholders to discuss trends and challenges in the sector. Results and impacts Most of the project\u2019s planned activities were successfully implemented. Various events as well as information and dissemination activities contributed to placing the regional labour market on the agenda. The social partners have been active in advocating the importance of the free movement of cross-border workers, as well as the economic importance of a common regional labour market. The cross-border partnership activities paid special attention to vulnerable groups in the labour market, such as the youth and recent graduates. Among other achievements, the project organised three training sessions for over 130 legal and policy practitioners, held five conferences and seminars drawing between them 193 participants, and facilitated the provision of information, counselling and other career services 1 750 times online. The project activities had a positive impact on young jobseekers\u2019 willingness to commute across the border for jobs and job search. It was revealed that a considerable number of young people try to avoid commuting to the other side of the region due to possible language problems and general lack of knowledge, but the project activities contributed to changing this situation. Danish and Swedish young people learned about the living and working conditions in the neighbouring country, received CV counselling and took on an organised job matching tour to the other side of the region. Also, the Job \u00d8resund Day event was organised, where stakeholders (national and regional PES, social partners) were introduced to regional best practice experiences related to combating youth unemployment. The involved EURES advisers also participated in numerous job fairs in the region and around Europe to promote ICT and Life Science companies operating in \u00d8resund, thus making their job openings available to a European audience. In addition, three trade councils were organised for discussing challenges and trends in the region\u2019s construction sector between regional stakeholders. Finally, the grant financed an online salary calculator, providing (potential) cross-border workers with a tool to calculate their salary when taking on a job on the other side of the region.

Potential good practices The use of the LinkedIn social network for worker-employer matching proved to be a very useful and innovative tool in making the search for appropriate candidates more effective and targeted. Its use, therefore, should be extended and may be transferred to other contexts. Transnational dimension A transnational dimension was inherent to all project activities as they addressed regional and European cooperation, mobility and cross-border workers. The project strengthened the collaboration between the organisations providing employment services in the \u00d8resund region (more precisely, Hovedstaden region in Denmark and Sk\u00e5ne l\u00e4n in Sweden), especially on issues related to the effective provision of information and advice on cross-border mobility. New partnerships created Building and strengthening the cross-border partnerships was one of the objectives of the project. The existing cross- border partnerships between Danish and Swedish employment services were strengthened, and new contacts between regional stakeholders (including PES and social partners) were established for further cooperation, especially concerning youth-targeted interventions and activities. Apart from that, contacts were initiated with the Romanian EURES for cooperation in ICT and Life Sciences sector recruitment across Europe. Dissemination of the project results The follow-up reports on the most important events (e.g. the Job \u00d8resund Day) were disseminated to all relevant stakeholders, including national and regional PESs in Denmark and Sweden, social partners and the \u00d8resund region\u2019s contact point. Further, guides and informational materials produced for the project were disseminated at the contact point for cross- border workers, as well as at the numerous job fairs in the region and around Europe. Other information related to the partnership was disseminated by means of oral presentations, personal counselling and printed materials. Sustainability Activities of the cross-border partnership at \u00d8resund are continuing. The established partnerships are expected to continue to be active in the relevant fora, where issues related to obstacles to the free movement of cross-border workers in the region are being debated. Whenever possible, they will seek to strengthen this work by engaging in new networks and contexts. Moreover, the partners are expected to include more job-seeking young people in their future projects and activities. European added value One of the results of the project activities is the better preparation of job advisers to advise their job-seeking clients about jobs in the \u00d8resund region. These actions create European added value by supporting the mobility of frontier workers between two EU countries: Denmark and Sweden. From a broader perspective, the project promoted high quality job openings in the \u00d8resund region in various conferences across Europe (including the partnership countries, Greece, Portugal, Romania, Finland, Spain and the United Kingdom) thus generating added value for job-seeking EU citizens. Similarly, the LinkedIn groups strongly contributed to the EU added value element as they facilitated access to job openings and communication between jobseekers and employers on the European level. Activities implemented \u2022 Organisation of living and working seminars, CV counselling activities and job fairs for young jobseekers; \u2022 Organisation of conferences on the cross-border construction sector for social partners and public employment services (PES) of the region; \u2022 Job-matching services for unemployed construction sector workers; \u2022 Production of branding materials for various job fairs in order to promote employment opportunities in ICT and Life Sciences sectors of the region, and the creation of \u00d8resund LinkedIn group; \u2022 Participation in job fairs and recruitment events across Europe, and promotion of employment in ICT and Life Sciences sector in \u00d8resund; \u2022 Building of networks between EURES advisers in the participating countries and Romania, and regional ICT sector companies in \u00d8resund; \u2022 Organisation of seminars, events and meeting for regional EURES and PES advisers, and representatives of regional unemployment insurance agencies.

By sharing information in a fast and user-friendly manner, the partnership attempted to demolish bureaucratic barriers, to make it easier to find jobs, and to simplify the channels connecting employers and employees. The project programmes were oriented specifically towards more vulnerable groups, such as the youth, female workers and people with low qualifications. Results and impacts Most of the partnership\u2019s planned activities were successfully implemented. To begin with, it provided customer-oriented services to employees and employers in the cross-border region by publishing information brochures, organising campaign spots and personal consulting. Second, the project contributed to developing more innovative T\u00e4tigkeitsplan der grenz\u00fcberschreitenden \u00f6sterreich-ungarischen EURES-T Pannonia Partnerschaft f\u00fcr 2015 and efficient mechanisms of service provision to employers and employees, including through various information events, a job search database, and the establishment of a new \u2018EURES Window\u2019 one-stop-shop information offices. The project dealt with 10 492 queries for information and career services for its target groups. Third, partnerships with tax, social security and labour law authorities of both participating countries were developed. In the framework of this project the team organised some six training sessions for over 120 legal practitioners. Finally, the project assisted the renewal of cooperation with local, regional, national and European programmes, networks and organisations. However, this implementation was only partial, because meetings between decision-makers could not be arranged by the deadline in all cases, and due to other organisational reasons. Transnational dimension A transnational dimension was inherent to all project activities as they addressed regional and European cooperation, mobility and cross-border workers. The project strengthened collaboration between the organisations providing employment services in the Pannonia Austro- Hungarian border region, especially on the issues related to the effective provision of information for the employers and advice on cross-border mobility for the youth. New partnerships created As a result of one of the main activities of the project, the initial number of Pannonia cross-border partnership members was increased by extending the cooperation to tax, social security and labour law authorities in the participating countries.

        "68 First, as one of the activities of the project, a database was created containing data about jobseekers in the cross-border region, including their CVs and other data. It was made available online for employers registered in the Partnership\u2019s website, the EURES consultants of the AMS (Austrian Labour Service) and the National Public Employment Service of Hungary. Second, a number of events was organised to share the project experiences and practices among the main stakeholders, including professional workshops, conferences and meetings for PES representatives. Third, most important information of the project was published on the EURES-T Pannonia website. Finally, several events for the youth and jobseekers were organised, including the EURES Road Show for young people in Hungary, an information day on working in Austria, and a Citizen\u2019s Forum for Hungarian and Austrian professionals. The number of conferences organised in the framework of the project totalled nine and engaged over 1 000 participants. Sustainability The project activities were continued throughout the following budgeting year. The project partners expressed a willingness to continue not only the partnership itself, but also specific initiatives, including the operation and development of a one- stop-shop customer services; the jobseekers\u2019 database; the \u2018Business development and employee advisory programme\u2019 for SMEs and workers; and awareness-raising activities. European added value In line with the EU employment policy, the activities of the project promoted geographic mobility and job incentives by creating an open and transparent cross-border labour market. Addressing young people was paramount, because their situation on the labour market is much more vulnerable and unemployment is higher among them. Under sub-projects, the partnership provided information for career orientation of the youth, therefore preparing them for successful operation on the single European labour market and supporting fair labour mobility. Moreover, on the basis of the information collected under the particular advisory services, the partnership supported the development of adequate social protection systems and labour market policies of participating countries in order to be consistent with the European standards . Activities implemented \u2022 Activities for raising awareness of the partnership, including coordination of media presence, external communication, website development, creation of a jobseekers\u2019 database, social media presence and a media campaign for safe employment; \u2022 Development of innovative and efficient mechanisms for providing services for jobseekers and employers: user-friendly and target-oriented information and advisory events, development of jobseeker database, and adaptation of a one-stop-shop customer service; \u2022 Development of partnerships with tax, social security and labour law authorities in order to develop more efficient services for customers, in line with EURES reform; \u2022 Development of a cooperation platform for partner organisations and employment service network.

        "69 EURES Cross-border Galicia-Northern Portugal \u2018As a result of one of the project\u2019s activities, greater cooperation was established between the cross-border partnership and the authorities responsible for taxation, social security and labour organisation.\u2019 The EURES North Portugal\u2013Galicia cross-border service, with presence in 25 job centres in the region, was established in late 1997, quickly becoming a reference structure in the cross-border region with respect to knowledge of rights and obligations relative to the cross-border mobility of workers and entrepreneurs. This particular partnership aimed to support the common objective and commitment of the partner bodies towards improving the situation of the labour market of Galicia and Northern Portugal, creating a transparent labour market and developing a system of cooperation and collaboration between the PES and all other economic and social agents representing the Euro-region with potential ability to facilitate and boost the cross-border mobility of workers and employers. Results and impacts All of the partnership\u2019s planned activities in 2015 were successfully implemented. The project has significantly contributed to raising awareness of cross-border mobility and the EURES partnership among various types of potential users of the services it offers (by placement, guidance, advice and information on jobs and cross-border mobility). Further, the network of collaborators in employment offices, employers\u2019 associations, trade unions\u2019 offices and other agencies and institutions, was extended. The access of employers, workers and jobseekers to the network was improved, hence fostering cross-border mobility. The partnership made significant efforts in collaborating with trade unions of the participating regions to promote the EURES services directly. It also managed to achieve significant stakeholder engagement in order to identify obstacles to cross-border mobility and to propose solutions. Nonetheless, the crisis and the subsequent closure of numerous companies and businesses on both sides of the border in significant sectors, those which granted work to mostly cross-border workers, was an obstacle to reaching the objectives originally set. New partnerships created As a result of one of the project\u2019s activities, greater cooperation was established between the cross-border partnership and the authorities responsible for taxation, social security and labour organisation. The project team organised two training sessions for a total of over 40 practitioners. Also, cooperation opportunities with new partners were explored in the area of cross-border vocational training. Some five mutual learning events organised in the framework of the project drew 185 participants. Innovativeness of the project\u2019s activities One of the project\u2019s main planned activities was the development of mechanisms for more innovative and efficient services for job seekers and employers. These included, first, a one-stop-shop in the application of the \u2018Not Wrong Door\u2019 concept, which combines different services for customers in each of the participating countries. Second, a specialised contracting services to employers and job seekers \u2018from the beginning to the end\u2019, with a view to meeting their specific needs, were designed.

Finally, the partnership has prepared a consistent plan for the monitoring and evaluation of activities, including data compilation and analysis of information obtained in all the activities performed and the customer services carried out by EURES advisers. Potential good practice The EURES-T G-NP bulletin (newsletter) is considered to be a potential good practice. In its preparation, a special focus was set on the analysis of supply and demand of labour force in order to determine the most dynamic and productive sectors that could accelerate job creation in the cross-border region, as well as occupations with increased demand both in Galicia and Northern Portugal. Dissemination of project results EURES cross-border Galicia-Northern Portugal has its own website, where it provides up-to-date info on the performance of each of the activities such as working groups, seminars, training sessions, dissemination events, sectoral meetings, etc. The results of the activities are documented in an activity form in which the work programme, objectives and outcomes are collected. In addition, each of the partner organisations publishes the agenda, the programme and results in their own web page. Some partner agencies have their own dissemination channels such as periodical magazines or internal TV channels; some activities are broadcast live for internal circuit and posted on youtube.com. Further, a Bulletin EURES-T G-NP is published every six months in digital and paper format on the websites of EURES-T and of the partner organisations and distributed to all partner organisations in all meetings and sessions; as well as being sent to 1 000 employers in the cross-border region. Periodically, the partner institutions also publish \u2018news EUREST\u2019, and send it to their target audience through newsletters digitally. Facebook and Twitter are also used as a means of information and disclosure. Finally, local and regional media generally publish some news about cross-border events organised by EURES-T G-NP. A total of 11 dissemination events including conferences and seminars organised during the project duration engaged over 640 participants. Other events included seven networking meetings with 84 participants, four working groups for monitoring implementation of Union law drew 235 participants and 2 capacity-building events impacted 42 stakeholders among others. Sustainability Activities of the EURES Northern Portugal\u2013Galicia are continuing. Further needed and planned activities include; first, efforts to identify more sectors and susceptible companies to offer employment opportunities through the PES and the EURES cross-border partnership, as the current use of PES services in the region is very limited. Second, the partnership is going to develop mechanisms and tools that enhance the \u2018market share\u2019 (understood as the relationship between the percentage of placements managed by the PES in relation to total placements) of the PES and the EURES partnership. Third, as realised during job fora at universities and vocational training centres, there is a need to promote ",
        "71 EURES is an integrated part of the Public Employment Service in Norway. EURES Norway consists of a national EURES Coordination Office situated in the Directorate of Labour and Welfare. The EURES service is accessible in all 19 counties in Norway and through the NAV Service Centre EURES (National Single Point of Contact). In 2015, there were 26 593 registered persons from EU/ EEA, except the Nordic countries, working in Norway. This is a decrease from the 34 244 registered in 2014. The workers came from Germany, Spain, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. Also, there has always been labour mobility between geographically and linguistically proximate Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Applicants for jobs in Norway are expected to have a good command of Norwegian and an understanding of cultural characteristics. Objectives To begin with, the partnership aimed to facilitate job matching and placement from and to EEA countries by raising awareness of employers and jobseekers. Secondly, the project attempted to provide and exchange information and advice between jobseekers, employers and other organisations on job vacancies, job applications, living and working conditions and other relevant matters related to the labour market in the EU and EEA countries, such as social security, taxation and labour law. Thirdly, the project aimed to improve the visibility and awareness of EURES in the EEA countries. Fourth, it also aimed to contribute to and develop projects in cooperation with local industry, in particular SMEs, with focus on employment and growth. There was also an objective to increase the visibility of EURES and awareness of EURES reform. Results and impacts Due to changes in the national Norwegian labour market (especially in the oil and gas sectors), domestic labour mobility increased as the crisis affected different regions of Norway to a varying degree. This, in turn, drastically decreased the demand for labour from outside of Norway. Therefore, a number of planned activities were cancelled, and there were also fewer results from the project than anticipated. The lack of labour demand led to lower participation in job fairs and meetings, and also reduced the demand for placement and post-placement activities. Also, a number of planned activities were not implemented due to lack of funding. Nonetheless, through its different activities, EURES Norway managed to reach a number of the project\u2019s goals. This could be demonstrated by the number of contacts made with jobseekers and employers, as well as internal and external audiences and stakeholders reached. More specifically, the project supported a successful operation of the Single Contact Point of EURES Norway, which is available via a shared email address, chat and a dedicated helpline for employers and jobseekers. Further, EURES advisers were in contact with over 5 600 employers, and helped to recruit over 900 workers from outside of Norway. Finally, EURES advisers were active in awareness raising about the EURES service by participating in information and recruitment events.

        "73 Due to its historical and geo-economical features, the Italy- Slovenia-Croatia border area \u2014 Euradria region \u2014 has always been characterised by significant rates of cross-border labour mobility. Unfortunately, this mobility has been accompanied by various obstacles. The latter include the lack of cross- border agreements between the states involved on the subject; adequate political and legislative acknowledgement of the cross-border worker\u2019s conditions; fiscal coordination between the relevant agencies. These obstacles do not seem to be overcome by the common EU legislative framework. The partnership therefore aimed to improve the job matching process in the area, by identifying and removing the persisting cross-border mobility obstacles, and by providing workers and employers with qualified counselling, assistance, support and targeted actions. Euradria\u2019s ultimate goal was to contribute to the establishment of an integrated and fair cross-border labour market in the area. Its specific aims included the following: \u2022 strengthening cooperation between the Italian, Croatian and Slovene PES, EURES advisers involved in the actions, and the local institutions; \u2022 development of an online one-stop-shop where all the stakeholders of the cross-border labour market can find contacts, operative information and support; \u2022 proceeding to map the demand of skills and professionals in the rapidly growing high-tech cluster in the Italy- Slovenia border region; and the mobility of workers in the cross-border area thanks to cooperation between the relevant authorities and the Regione FVG observatory on the labour market; \u2022 providing jobseekers, commuters and workers across the Italian-Slovene border with an operative \u2018Guide to Cross- Border Workers\u2019 in order to support them in their daily life; \u2022 enhancing the communication and dissemination of EURES and Euradria tools and opportunities among the regional SMEs in order to involve this \u2018economic backbone\u2019 as much as possible. Results and impacts Most of the grant\u2019s planned activities were successfully implemented. The assets generated for the project are both tangible and intangible. During its five Steering Committee Meetings and various public events, Euradria has produced three tangible deliverables: the Guide for Cross-Border Workers across Italy and Slovenia, jointly drafted by Regione FVG and Slovene PES; a report on the needs of professionals and skills in the cross-border area, prepared by the Municipality of Trieste in cooperation with the University of Trieste; and a tentative mapping of cross-border worker-flows in the area. On the intangible results, firstly, Euradria has set up an effective and operative institutional network composed of all the major public and private actors of the cross-border job market. Secondly, Euradria\u2019s target groups can count on an effective partnership and a wide range of tools which enables the partnership to be a convenient one-stop-shop for cross- border workers, resulting in attending to over 660 queries for information and career services. The partnership also organised five networking events for specialists at EU level drawing 61 participants. Euradria 2015 \u2018By operating in the EURES framework of activities, Euradria contributes to expanding EURES services in an area where opportunities provided by the network are still not sufficiently known by jobseekers, workers and employers.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/011 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2015/0062 EU contribution in euros: 139 738.82 Policy area: Free movement of workers Target groups: Cross-border workers and jobseekers; SMEs and employer associations, seeking for personnel and skills in the cross-border area; Social partners and NGOs; National, local and regional authorities; Employment services; Higher education institutions and research institutes; National statistical offices; Media.

        "74 Lessons learned Several policy lessons were obtained from the Euradria\u2019s activities and experience. First, the operative networking of PES of the participating countries proved to be an essential asset for efficient cross-border mobility and needs to be strengthened in the future. Second, a legislative/policy action is needed in order to strengthen the link between cross- border and national institutions in horizontal and vertical actions, towards the final beneficiaries of the project. Third, as the European labour markets are developing in difficult to predict patterns, Euradria needs to be prepared to offer new and tailored services to its target groups. It therefore needs to increase the involvement of SMEs and productive sectors in the project actions with the double aim of: increasing the dissemination of EURES opportunities and projects among entrepreneurs and identifying the growing economic sectors and competences on demand. Sustainability Activities of the cross-border partnership are continuing. The partners recognise that there is still a lot to do in the Italy-Slovenia-Croatia border area, as the political, legislative and cultural obstacles to fair mobility show resilience. Therefore, the partnership is strongly committed to giving maximum sustainability to the Euradria project. The main asset that will ensure continuous impact of the project is the partnership itself. In the future, the partnership needs to be re-balanced by increasing the role and representation of Croatian and Slovene partners and improving the internal working methods. Further, cooperation between the PES of participating countries will be reinforced. Finally, it is planned to add a legislative/policy level to Euradria\u2019s deliverables. Dissemination Euradria aimed at being a paper-free project. Ad hoc press releases, social media posts and press articles were the main means of dissemination . The tangible project deliverables were presented at public events and later disseminated through the project website to the main stakeholders. Paper versions of \u2018The Guide for Cross-Border Workers\u2019 were made available through the PES network. Also, a number of networking and cooperation meeting were organised for EURES advisers, staff of the PES, civil servants and employers. European added value By operating in the EURES framework of activities, Euradria contributes to expanding EURES services in an area where opportunities provided by the network are still not sufficiently known by jobseekers, workers and employers: in this way, EU added value is assured, as EURES is the link to local target groups. Activities implemented \u2022 Organisation of meetings, trainings and other events for the PES from the participating countries, EURES advisers and other stakeholders; information, counselling, assistance and placement services for workers, jobseekers and employers; \u2022 Development of an online one-stop-shop for cross- border workers, jobseekers and employers; \u2022 Preparation of an analytical report on the cross- border labour market; \u2022 Monitoring of the cross-border mobility flows; \u2022 Preparation of a Guide for Cross-Border Workers; \u2022 Awareness raising about EURES and Euradria.

        "75 The Ireland-Northern Ireland border region has had many challenges in recent decades including civil conflict, divided communities and high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people. Even though it has moved on from its recent history of conflict, and both communities engage and work together in practical ways to achieve a flow of opportunity and trade in both directions across the border, this remains a work in progress. It was therefore important to continue advancing areas of practical cooperation in the field of employment, and to improve the often fragile links and relationships which can make a real difference to the lives of people residing and working in this region. The partnership therefore aimed to continue raising awareness of the benefits of mobility, encouraging cross- border employment opportunities and helping capitalise on employers\u2019 access to a cross-border labour market in the Ireland-Northern Ireland border region. More specifically, the main priorities of the project included: \u2022 promotion of PES as the recruitment agency of choice through providing enhanced supports to employers at national, transnational, cross-border and local levels; \u2022 promotion of the recruitment of people from the Live Register and those currently not in employment, education or training, with a particular focus on young people, those who are experiencing long-term unemployment, and those living in jobless households; \u2022 addressing skills mismatches and employment bottlenecks; \u2022 Information counselling, placement and recruitment services for workers and jobseekers; \u2022 continuous development and modernisation of information and communication activities to raise awareness of labour mobility opportunities, and promotion of the services of PES and EURES; \u2022 continuous mainstreaming of EURES activity in the PES. Results and impacts Most of the project objectives were reached and planned activities were implemented. As the project successfully built on previous activities, the role of the cross-border partnership was evolving at a fast pace. Generally, it played a role in fostering cohesion and SOLIDARity in the region. Employment in the region is crucial for growth and is a key support for political stability and the EURES cross-border partnership played an important role in this regard. The Partnership continued to provide support to jobseekers, job changers and employers by facilitating information exchange, publications, job fairs and employer-focused events. Introducing online jobs fairs has provided an additional tool which could help address skills shortages for many large companies in the region. The publication of the new FAQ booklet for cross-border workers and employers was also an especially welcome additional tool in addressing some of the issues encountered by citizens in the region. Transnational dimension A transnational dimension was inherent to all project activities as they addressed cross-border mobility and cooperation, involving PES for both Northern Ireland and Ireland. The cross- border EURES advisers from both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were also transnational EURES advisers and brought a transnational dimension to all the project\u2019s activities, particularly in their contacts with employers. EURES Cross-Border Partnership Ireland/Northern Ireland \u2018The partnership aimed to continue raising awareness of the benefits of mobility, encouraging cross-border employment opportunities and helping capitalise on employers\u2019 access to a cross-border labour market in the Ireland- Northern Ireland border region.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/011 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2015/0096 EU contribution in euros: 179 871.19 Policy area: Free movement of workers Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; employment services; Social partners and NGOs; Higher education institutions and research institutes; National statistical offices; Media.

        "76 Dissemination of results Evaluations and surveys were carried out and shared with the Steering Committee and the Advisers group through feedback discussions held and shared with partners. Feedback informed future actions and plans. It was also planned to make all the reports available in a private shared online forum, on the newly developed website. Lessons learned and the policy follow-up The Ireland-Northern Ireland cross-border activities are continuing. Based on the experience gained during the project, the Partnership provided policy follow-up and recommendations to develop and act upon in the following period. First, the work of the EURES Cross-Border Partnership could be further enhanced by mainstreaming: the Partnership sought to develop structures to mainstream cross-border activity and integrate in the PES. Second, the development of PES job matching exercises could further support cross-border jobseekers and employers. The Partnership was therefore going to work closely with the PES in both jurisdictions to examine job matching plans in line with and with the support of new systems under EURES reform and including officer exchange. Third, taking into account the developments under EURES reform, the Partnership was going to re-examine its mission statement to take account of those changes. European added value The development of the online job fair in this region has increased the capacity of the cross-border partnership to add value to the European dimension. Activities implemented \u2022 Awareness-raising activities on the benefits of Ireland-Northern Ireland cross-border mobility in general and the EURES activities specifically, including the production of informational publications and various promotional materials; \u2022 Development of the EURES website; \u2022 organisation of jobs and advice fairs, speed networking events, business breakfasts, as well as other events for workers, jobseekers and employers in the border region; \u2022 Development of work placement initiatives; \u2022 Development of EURES advisers network, including training, salary contributions, and a meeting of the EURES cross-border Steering Committee; \u2022 Organisation of PES seminar to improve coordination between PES staff and managers.

        "77 The partnership aimed to help the PES in the Flanders\u2013 Netherlands border region to join forces with EURES and non-EURES actors in providing services and the development of a coherent approach towards the specific needs of the cross-border labour market. Specific objectives included the following: \u2022 Information and advice for cross-border workers, jobseekers and employers via traditional and online media; \u2022 maintenance of a platform for regular employment brokerage services and other activities aimed at linking supply and demand based on the needs of the labour market; \u2022 building partnerships and networks with stakeholders in the field of cross-border work, and developing an integrated service; \u2022 improving the monitoring and transparency of employment in the cross-border context. Results and impacts Most of the planned activities of the project were successfully implemented. The EURES advisers contributed to the strengthening of the labour market position of cross-border workers, the improvement of the cross-border labour market based on the principle of \u2018fair mobility,\u2019 and the improvement of cooperation in the cross-border region. The cornerstone activities of the EURES Scheldemond is the matching, placement and recruitment support services, including front and back office and online information and advice. The job fairs organised during the project duration were widely attended: the six small-to-medium-scale fairs were attended by over 4 500 people, whereas the two major events organised by the project team drew as many as 15 000 interested attendees. The cross-border partnership established by the project helps workers to overcome obstacles related to different labour and taxation laws, social security and pension schemes, as well as the procedures of qualifications recognition. Some four training sessions were organised during the project for over 100 practitioners. Generally, the project has increased opportunities for workers and employers in the extended labour market. Lessons learned The project revealed that directing employers and jobseekers towards self-service e-modules is not effective for attaining objective results of activities. The tracking of matching and placements in a cross-border context remains a challenge. Moreover, the partnership allowed its partners to strengthen their expertise in cross-border provision of job-related information for employers and jobseekers, placement and recruitment. Transnational dimension The project strengthened the collaboration between the organisations providing employment services in the Flanders\u2013 Netherlands border region, especially on issues related to the effective provision of information and advice on cross-border mobility. Partnerships Building cross-border partnerships was one of the objectives of the project. It managed to develop a wide-ranging network of partners and partner organisations from both participating EURES Scheldemond 2015 \u2018One of the partnership\u2019s activities was the development of innovative service delivery mechanisms for jobseekers and employers, such as online speed-dates, where employers and employees from across the border can have a first acquaintance without the hassle of travelling.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/011 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2015/0082 EU contribution in euros: 152 091.73 Policy area: Free movement of workers Target groups: Jobseekers, workers, employers and public employment services (PES).

        "78 countries. Integrated cooperation between the partners was developed by the establishment of the EURES Round-Table platform, and organisation of training sessions, seminars and conferences. Sustainability of results EURES Scheldemond activities are continuing: cross-border employment information is provided online, job fairs, info sessions and workshops are being organised. Also, the project has identified specific activities which would improve the platform of cross-border employment brokerage services and the policy evidence that the project aimed to generate. Dissemination of project results Project results and the knowledge generated were communicated to PES and the related labour market initiatives in the participating Member States, mostly in round-table meetings, seminars and two conferences which attracted 97 participants. Some of the project\u2019s partners were also involved in the preparatory consultations with the Steering Committee of Ministers of Social Affairs of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Moreover, continually updated information about the network, events and cross-border work in general is provided online on the project\u2019s website. Innovativeness One of the partnership\u2019s activities was the development of innovative service delivery mechanisms for jobseekers and employers, such as online speed-dates, where employers and employees from across the border can meet first without the hassle of travelling. Policy evidence generated The project\u2019s activities involved monitoring labour mobility and exchanging this information between partners. More precisely, statistical labour market data were compiled and harmonised, and analyses of shortages and excesses within the cross-border regional labour markets were conducted, feeding into the prognosis of labour market developments. European added value The project significantly contributed to networking activities between organisations providing employment services in Belgium and the Netherlands. It led to further cooperation between organisations involved and thus value added at the European level in increased geographical labour mobility. Activities implemented \u2022 Information and advice for actual and potential cross- border workers and employers; \u2022 Establishment of contacts with cross-border workers, jobseekers, employers and other relevant service providers in the cross-border region; \u2022 Development of a platform for job matching and placement activities, for EURES and regular recruitment advisers of the involved PES; \u2022 Development and implementation of integrated cross-border services with the authorities responsible for taxation and social security; \u2022 Promotion of the visibility of EURES services via traditional and online media; \u2022 Compilation of statistical data, regional labour market analysis, analysis of shortages and excesses within the cross-border labour market and forecasting labour market developments.

        "79 The \u2018EURES Grande R\u00e9gion 2015\u2019 is a joint effort of Franco- German-Belgian-Luxembourgish Public Employment Services (PES), employers, trade unions and regional political authorities, catering to jobseekers, employers and individuals living in the Greater Region (area between Rhin, Moselle, Sarre and Meuse, totalling 65 401 km\u00b2) and working across the border from their country. The project aimed to respond to the needs of cross-border inhabitants, the business community and public service providers and authorities by providing a range of innovative services thus ensuring transparency of the cross-border employment market and increasingly integrated intermediation between supply and demand of labour in the region. The partnership also sought to strengthen cooperation between its members, its network of counsellors and the complementarity of its activities with those of other market participants in cross-border employment in the region. Project results On the basis of territorial statistics shared between the partners, the EURES Greater Region in 2015 used the EaSI programme as a leverage to develop new activities in addition to those already integrated, linking them to a comprehensive range of complementary services for the target groups. The action in 2015 completed 29 different activities facilitating cross-border employment in the Greater Region, including support services to: \u2022 Over 1 850 jobseekers \u2014 including six EURES job dating events with prior screening for 516 jobseekers with a 63 % rate of return to employment within 3 months; also 11 coaching services for 122 applicants; 151 workshops by EURES advisers; and information and advice on cross- border mobility-related queries for 31 200 requests among others; \u2022 Over 238 businesses, including through information meetings and other means. Socioeconomic context Cross-border mobility is a strong component of the employment market of the Grande R\u00e9gion, which is marked by the highest cross-border work mobility in Europe. The significant and steady increase in border flow for over 20 years is the result of the combined action of all involved stakeholders in employment, public or private, with EURES in the lead. The difficult economic climate has highlighted the importance of the mission of the EURES network. Two EURES cross-border partnerships created under a discontinued EC instrument, namely the P\u00f4le Europ\u00e9en de D\u00e9veloppement (European Centre for Development) and EURES SLLRP (Saarland- Lorraine-Luxembourg-Rhineland-Palatinate) joined forces to launch this action. Having continued pooling efforts and synergies in their respective missions, the two networks in 2015 decided to integrate further and continue providing services designed under previous financing mechanisms to cross-border jobseekers, workers and employers. Dissemination of partnership\u2019s results The project partners disseminated information on their services widely through the specially designated web portal, the distribution of over 50 000 printed brochures, as well as workshops, meetings and fairs put on by the project partners in the affected regions. The action also utilised the media to spread their message and has had dozens of mentions in the press, radio and TV, mostly through their two governance EURES Grande R\u00e9gion 2015 \u2018The action in 2015 completed 29 different activities facilitating cross-border employment in the Greater Region, including support services to over 1 850 jobseekers and more than 238 businesses.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/011 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2015/0101 EU contribution in euros: 599 998.83 Policy area: Employment Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Employment services; Specialist bodies provided for under Union law; Social partners; Non-governmental organisations; Higher education institutions and research institutes; Media.

Sustainability of project results With the view to creating one place for the delivery of unique EURES services to promote cross-border mobility, the action created the EURES Greater Region web portal that hosts up- to-date relevant information on the employment situation in the region. The creation of a One-Stop-Shop via this portal in 2016 will mark the next step in this partnership. It will moreover ensure sustainability of the impact already generated by the EURES mobility actions under the earlier financing mechanism and this action. Furthermore, providing information and advice on living and working conditions, labour law, social and fiscal environments in the neighbouring countries ensures successful investments in the long-term. European added value The EURES Greater Region action constitutes a considerable value added for Europe by contributing to the implementation of EU legislation. This is particularly seen in the provision of effective employment-related services, specifically to the affected border region populations, matching the demand and supply side in the region, including across borders and promoting greater transparency of existing possibilities for both employers and jobseekers. Moreover, by leveraging the good practice of Greater Region employment services already established by earlier funding mechanisms, namely the long-standing experience of EURES, the action complements existing cooperation mechanisms and activities with additional support services to maximise impact, with the view of even further improved employment services for border inhabitants via the planned One-Stop-Shop for Greater Region employers, employees and jobseekers. Finally, the action contributed to the Europe 2020 strategy by supporting jobseekers in the border region and contributing to the promotion of cross-border labour mobility and free movement of persons. As such, the border regions serve as laboratories of Europe, with the European funding used to develop innovative measures contributing to the emergence of a European employment market. Activities implemented \u2022 Providing services to workers and employers of the region: \u00b0 Pre-recruitment: screening, providing information based on related queries; workshops and informational materials for jobseekers and informational meetings for employers; \u00b0 Matching: translation and information on job vacancies and EURES job-dating events; \u00b0 Post-recruitment: coaching personalised support services.

The partnership aimed to encourage cross-border mobility and support a single European labour market, building on experience accumulated since 1999, by increasing investment in the labour market and learning and increasing visibility of the supply of services and transparency on labour market trends among many other related specific objectives. The 17 activities proposed in 2015 for jobseekers, workers, apprentices and employers were based on three key areas: information, advice and placement. Results The network recorded a total of 635 cross-border placements and provided support to 784 jobseekers. For employers, some 187 cross-border region vacancies were successfully filled by the German employment agency and another 158 by the French labour exchange. The action in 2015 managed a total of 15 274 instances of individual contact with 13 632 jobseekers and 1 642 employers. The different target groups recognised and appreciated the work of the EURES advisers, as evidenced by interviews and focus groups. The various activities implemented included: \u2022 237 job search workshops to over 2 000 French and German jobseekers with a placement rate of 55 %; \u2022 the creation of a One-Stop-Shop, optimising data processing and facilitating instant information provision (phone, email, live) or referrals to relevant experts; \u2022 as part of its work targeted at reducing youth unemployment, the facilitation of 79 cross-border apprenticeships, marking an increase of 40 % compared to 2014; \u2022 the creation of a EURES-T Business Club for German and Swiss SMEs to provide information on the legal aspects of hiring cross-border staff; \u2022 regular contact of the President and Secretary General of the action with MEPs and Consuls General to increase visibility of the network and inform policymaking. Socioeconomic context The Upper Rhine currently experiences large variations of unemployment on both sides of the border. Data reflect that some labour markets in the area experience labour shortages, whereas others have high unemployment. The cross-border labour market services therefore have a vital role to play in matching jobseekers and vacancies on both sides of the border. Dissemination of project results The EURES network in general and EURES-T\u2013EURES cross- border partnership specifically disseminate information both internally within their own structure and externally through their respective networks, including through economic actors (businesses, chambers of commerce and industry associations) and political ones (MEPs, ministers, regional authorities, etc.). The President of the EURES-T Upper Rhine action is regularly asked to present the network, its services and results. Specific dissemination activities in 2015 included: EURES-T Oberrhein-Rhin Sup\u00e9rieur 2015 \u2018The action constitutes a value added by promoting and supporting the free movement of persons both by providing direct services to mobile workers and their employers and by engaging policy-makers and informing them of the trends in the border regions.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/011 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2015/0072 EU contribution in euros: 363 615.61 Policy area: Employment Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Employment services; Social partners; Higher education institutions and research institutes; Experts in evaluation and in impact assessment; National statistical offices; Media.

Learning materials produced in the framework of the action including brochures, studies and reports are available in German and French on the designated action website. Sustainability The network will continue its work over the next few years, with an innovation planned on online information in 2016, with a reconfiguration of the website and integration with social networks to further increase visibility and reach broader audiences. To maintain consistency and avoid duplication of efforts, the action has engaged all relevant players in the region (Infobest networks, the Franco-German-Swiss Upper Rhine Conference, Chambers of Commerce, etc.) in designing its services. European added value The action constitutes a value added for Europe in many ways, for example by promoting and supporting the free movement of persons both by providing direct services to mobile workers and their employers, but also by engaging policy-makers, local, regional, national and EU-level and informing them of the trends in the border regions. The action contributed to the design and implementation of EU policy by means of involvement in the planning of the INTERREG V programme to ensure better coordination of activities related to the regional labour market. Moreover, by monitoring and reporting on the regional labour market, the action builds evidence relevant to policy-makers.

Maps indicating the geographical coverage of actions are not provided in the project fiches of organisations, since most of these organisations cover the whole of Europe and beyond. 3. Examples of EaSI-supported key EU-level organisations The EaSI programme has a crucial role to play in promoting the involvement of civil society, in particular through financial support for the key EU-level NGO networks. The programme supports these networks with the aim of boosting their capacity to participate in and influence decision-making and policy implementation at both EU and national levels. Furthermore, such involvement fosters accountability and transparency of authorities and increases relevance of policy responses.

        "85 Caritas Europa (CE) through the \u2018CARES \u2014 Caritas Actions Reinforce the European Social Dimension 2015\u2019 work programme had a general aim to optimise the participation of its 49 members \u2014 present and active in all 28 EU Member States and beyond \u2014 in the social dimension of the European project by (1) reinforcing the understanding of the key processes of the EU 2020 strategy and stressing the importance of the CE member countries for a more inclusive EU; and (2) bringing the reality of the most vulnerable to the attention of the stakeholders and decision-makers at the European and national level through research and analysis. Participation and contributions have been sought from the grass-roots level that provide first-hand evidence of the realities that will underpin Caritas Europe\u2019s future advocacy and lobby action. The main policy themes of the Work Programme were: \u2022 child poverty, including the implementation of the Commission\u2019s Recommendation on investing in children and the child related country-specific recommendations (CSRs) produced within the European Semester process; \u2022 social exclusion among young people, including the implementation of the Youth Employment Package, Youth Guarantee and youth related CSRs; \u2022 legal, employment and inclusion conditions of migrants, including the CSRs addressing social exclusion and legal conditions and unemployment among migrants; \u2022 any other policy area that may affect the objective of poverty reduction and social inclusion in Europe. Socioeconomic context Based on the evidence provided by CE members, it is clear that the financial and economic crisis has indeed impacted poverty in Europe. The number of poor people increased from 120 to 125 million between 2008 and 2015, although this figure has subsequently decreased to 124 million. Certain countries were hit much harder than others, and austerity measures to address the crisis have done as much harm as the crisis itself. Most problems have been identified and policy-makers are aware of them, yet the EU focus continues to be mainly on jobs and growth. But jobs alone will not remove poverty and address the concerns of the millions unable to work, or who continue to be underpaid, working in precarious jobs, with salaries too low to cover their and their family\u2019s cost of living. Policy evidence generated by the organisation EU level and national level decision- makers received relevant input from CE and its member organisations concerning (1) the development and implementation of social policies; (2) their impacts, risks, and gaps identified (using the European Semester and Economic Adjustment Programmes as a benchmark); and (3) constructive proposals concerning the development of the European social model(s) in the future, with a special focus on family. Based also on its work in 2015, Caritas in 2016 published the \u2018Caritas CARES report,\u2019 which, based on evidence collected by Caritas organisations across Europe, identifies concrete causes of poverty, inequality and exclusion rampant in European societies and formulates recommendations to address them. Dissemination Both Caritas Europe and the member organisations engaged in disseminating information about the activities implemented. Some centralised dissemination activities in 2015 included media (32 press releases yielding at least 151 dedicated articles in the media); social media (1 288 Twitter posts; 550 Facebook posts); intra-network email communication (69 email alerts with newsletters) as well as events of diverse levels, including at the highest EU levels. Sustainability of project results Caritas Europe worked towards sustainably empowering its members for them to contribute with their expertise and to make a difference in the key areas of CE activity at the national level through advocacy, stakeholder engagement data collection to inform decision-making. Moreover, the Caritas Europa \u2018Leveraging its impressive network of 49 member organisations in 46 countries, Caritas Europe added considerably to strengthening the evidence base to inform the development of social models in European countries.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Implementing/Participating countries: CE members in 46 countries Grant identification number: VS/2014/0499 Policy area: Social Protection and Social Inclusion Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Policy sub-area: Active inclusion; Child and Youth poverty EU contribution in euros: 742 676.21 and social exclusion; Mainstreaming SPSI; Social OMC.

        "86 sustainability of its results rests with the decision-makers themselves \u2014 through the EC-financed activities, CE has generated diverse policy recommendations to promote the development of the European social model with respect to the weakest sections of society and particularly families, youths, children and migrants. Potential good practice CE on 19 November, 2015 presented in the European Parliament its Crisis Monitoring Report with the view to raising awareness among European decision-makers of Caritas\u2019 analysis of the current social and employment developments in the EU, and introduced some findings from its \u2018Shadow Report on Europe 2020.\u2019 This presentation and the resulting advocacy successes can be treated as a good practice in the third sector informing the policy debate on social issues. Moreover, the CE network\u2019s response to developments around the EU migration crisis by means of hosting an \u2018EU- SOLIDARity Sharing meeting on migration and asylum\u2019, holding advocacy meetings with the Council of Europe on the economic situation and response to refugees and migrants in Cyprus; and organising an Emergency Migration and Refugee Crisis in Vienna to, among other things, collect promising practices for migrant integration and social inclusion, all serve as examples of good practice of mobilising around the most relevant issues while implementing the planned Work Programme. European added value Leveraging its impressive network of 49 member organisations in 46 countries to reinforce the European Social Dimension, their capacity to engage stakeholders in considering social policies and their impacts, and its rapport on the EU level built through years of advocacy, CE added considerably to strengthening the evidence base to inform the development of social models in European countries. Activities implemented \u2022 Providing inputs to EU and national level decision- makers on the development of social policies, their impacts and recommendations on development of the European social model; \u2022 Advocacy and lobbying actions by CE members to promote EU initiatives supporting the development of conditions for more inclusive societies and for inclusive growth; \u2022 Capacity building of CE members in relation to Advocacy and networking, organisational development and financial sustainability; \u2022 Providing evidence-based data to support analysis of impacts of social policies and recommendations for their development.

        "87 EUROCITIES is the network of major European cities. Its members are the elected local and municipal governments of these cities. The goals to reach under the operating grant 2015 were to: \u2022 Support the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of initiatives undertaken to support the policy objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy and in particular the Social Investment Package through the main EU-driven processes such as the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) on social protection and social inclusion and the European Semester. \u2022 Support stakeholder involvement in the policy process: activities should in particular directly relate to the support of national member organisations in their involvement in the implementation of the main political EU-driven processes. In addition, EU-level networks should encourage cooperation with other civil society and social partner organisations at EU, national, regional and local levels. \u2022 Strengthen the capacity of EU-level NGO networks and their national members, to support implementation of EU priorities including their knowledge of relevant EU matters; \u2022 Provide data and strong evidence base on policy developments and trends, as well as collect relevant information about citizens\u2019 concerns and good practices (using the knowledge bank) in the social policy field in the Member States, so as to contribute to better policymaking. Socioeconomic context The diversity of themes covered through EUROCITIES working groups touch upon various social issues. For example, long- term unemployment, which affects 4.9 % of the active EU population given the increasing unemployment across European cities since 2010 due to the economic crisis, has negative social and economic consequences for individuals and society, and the groups most affected need comprehensive support and investment. Unfortunately, the downsizing of the public sector in some Member States has had an impact on the capacity of local authorities to offer the support required. Policy evidence generated by the organisation Generating policy evidence underpins several of the EUROCITIES goals described above. Examples of this line of work in 2015 included the EUROCITIES statement on asylum in cities released on 13 May 2015, which was informed by the debate on the situation of asylum seekers, refugees and migrants at the local level held in the framework of the Social Affairs Forum in Osmangazi (11-13/03) and Brussels (20-21/10). Dissemination To make local, national and European stakeholders aware of the evidence gathered, EUROCITIES in 2015 engaged in wide- reaching dissemination of its data and good practice-driven publications, including via specific and external events (such as the Social Affairs Forum in Osmangazi and Brussels). The operating grant facilitated the organisation of three mutual learning events with 103 participants, six conferences with around 400 participants and 16 networking events with over 300 participants, among other events, which overall numbered around 50. Some of its reports, including the \u2018Green jobs for social inclusion\u2019 report and the publication promoting an inclusive labour market was picked up and featured in high-level EU and multilateral events. EUROCITIES shares all publications prepared courtesy of the EC-funded operational grant for 2015 in a designated section of its website and a YouTube channel. Sustainability of project results As part of its policy follow-up work, EUROCITIES will continue to work on capacity building and mutual learning among city administrations in the field of social inclusion. The network EUROCITIES \u2018The network will continue to raise awareness among cities of the EU social inclusion policies with the view of improving the implementation at the local level as well as providing policy inputs into EU policymaking.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0498 EU contribution in euros: 874 473.11 Policy area: Social Protection and Social Inclusion Target groups: City practitioners/politicians; EU institutions/ EU-level organisations and stakeholders; National and regional governments; EU and local media.

        "88 will continue to raise awareness among cities of the EU social inclusion policies with a view to improving implementation at the local level as well as providing policy inputs into EU policymaking. Potential good practice As part of its ongoing work, EUROCITIES collects data on and publishes designated reports (e.g. \u2018Cities and Migrants Report 2015\u2019) on the best approaches and innovative practices to address social inclusion, poverty reduction and active inclusion at city level as well as good practice on the implementation of the Social Investment Package, with the latter contributing to the EU knowledge bank. European added value The EaSI operational grant enabled EUROCITIES to provide dedicated resources and efforts to social inclusion on the EU level. Achievements enabled by this grant include: \u2022 providing the necessary tools, assistance and support for cities to provide meaningful inputs to EU policymaking and governance, such as the National Roma Integration Strategies, Social Investment Package and active inclusion; \u2022 engaging city representatives to bring the voice of local authorities to key EU events; \u2022 building a body of evidence on local implementation of EU social policies, such as good practices on inclusive labour market; \u2022 demonstrating the importance of addressing social inclusion issues in the European Urban agenda (urban poverty, migration integration and affordable housing), a key policy outcome for cities to be able to mainstream this dimension into local and EU policies, as well as through multi-level governance. Activities implemented In 2015, the EC grant supported EUROCITIES work which is developed in the framework of the social affairs forum and its working groups. The priorities defined by the members of the organisation\u2019s social affairs forum were to promote social cohesion and diversity, inclusion and employment of young people and tackle deep-seated poverty and joblessness. These priorities were addressed by the work in 2015 also through the following working groups: \u2022 Active and healthy ageing; \u2022 Social inclusion through education; \u2022 Employment; \u2022 Homelessness; \u2022 Affordable housing; \u2022 Migration and integration; \u2022 Roma inclusion; \u2022 Smart social inclusion.

        "89 PICUM is a network of individuals and organisations working to ensure social justice and human rights for undocumented migrants. In 2015, PICUM led its membership network, as well as strategic partnerships and allies in monitoring, evaluating and influencing the impacts of EU policies, transnational social developments and policy challenges on the social inclusion of undocumented migrants in the following priority areas: \u2022 the disproportionate impacts of health inequalities on women, young people and children; \u2022 undeclared work and in-work poverty and social exclusion; \u2022 well-being of children and young people; \u2022 discrimination in the justice system; and \u2022 policies resulting in loss of status and prolonged periods of irregularity and social exclusion. Socioeconomic context PICUM\u2019s objectives respond to the reality of millions of migrants with an insecure or irregular migration, living and working in the EU in situations of extreme poverty and social exclusion. Facing a key set of challenges to engage in EU policy processes, these migrants represent a significant share of overall European poverty, especially among women and children. Policy evidence generated by the organisation To promote better policymaking in line with the EU2020 objectives, PICUM in 2015 monitored progress in the areas of employment, social affairs and inclusion. The monitoring information worked as vital evidence on the challenges to policy-makers. For example, in the area of undeclared work and in-work poverty and social exclusion, PICUM improved the evaluation of the Employer Sanctions Directive. As regards the well-being of children and young people, the network undertook an evaluation of reporting duties and practices and enforcement practices on the well-being of children and youths in an irregular migration situation. In 2015 PICUM concluded that to effectively engage policy- makers at EU and national levels, the network must increase its focus on monitoring and reporting and provide the relevant EU bodies with more collated, standardised data on instruments most directly impacting the living and working conditions of undocumented migrants. To achieve this, PICUM supported the capacity of its national members to collect and report such data, particularly on the direct impacts on individuals of non- or misapplication of rights and safeguards. Dissemination Given its overall focus on generating evidence on the impacts of policies on undocumented migrants and raising awareness and advocating for better conditions for this target group, PICUM actively engaged in various dissemination activities. In 2015, they were present at 276 conferences and meetings; spoke at an additional 100 events; held 18 conferences, workshops and working groups; produced eight position papers and provided input to 50 joint letters, statements, submissions and consultations. Sustainability of project results The 2016 work plan developed transnational and multi-level joint initiatives to continue supporting EU2020 objectives and EU-driven policy processes in the areas of health and impacts of health inequalities on women, youths and children; workplace exploitation of undocumented migrants; impacts of immigration control measures on various aspects of migrant well-being; combating gender-based violence, extreme poverty, social exclusion and homelessness and breaking the cycle of long-term social exclusion.

Activities implemented In 2015, PICUM coordinated actions, alliances, and evidence-building at both EU and national level to advance policy reforms which address undocumented migrants experience of poverty and social exclusion. To make the best use of its members\u2019 expertise and insight on undocumented migrants\u2019 realities, PICUM\u2019s actions focused on the following areas: \u2022 Monitoring and reporting; \u2022 Capacity building; \u2022 Advocacy; \u2022 Awareness raising; \u2022 Global actors on international migration; \u2022 Developing strategic alliances with new constituencies.

        "91 The European Social Network (ESN) unites over 120 member organisations engaged in planning, financing, researching, managing, regulating and delivering local public social services, including health, social welfare, employment, education and housing. ESN\u2019s strategic objectives for 2015 were divided in four main areas: \u2022 supporting EU policy priority in the field of social investment throughout the life course; \u2022 promoting the sustainability, adequacy, effectiveness and efficiency of social services; \u2022 promoting the engagement of ESN members in the EU social policy cycle; \u2022 improving ESN\u2019s capacity, communications and activities impact. Policy evidence generated by the organisation Generating policy evidence via its network and established processes such as monitoring in order to inform policy and ultimately positively impact the well-being of its key target groups is at the heart of ESN\u2019s work. In 2015, it had much to show in this area. For example, in line with its aim to support the EU in social investment throughout the life course ESN has organised (1) peer review seminars on children\u2019s services; (2) a workshop focused on examples of how local authorities support different vulnerable groups of young adults; (3) working groups on the policies and practices in different countries of supporting individuals with disability; and (4) meetings of a standing working group on ageing and care, all with a transnational dimension. To inform policymaking on its other objectives, ESN has also conducted studies, engaged other networks and stakeholders in monitoring national reform processes, launching a Reference Group on the European Semester, and produced various reports such as: the \u2018Looking ahead: Local public services priorities for the European Semester 2016\u2019 report co-authored with the European Social Observatory and the \u2018Evidence-based social services: toolkit for planning and evaluating social services.\u2019 The latter was produced as a result of a detailed review of international databases in the social work field, to determine their value to social services practitioners when developing services. Dissemination In line with the switch from knowledge/policymaking to effective and efficient knowledge/policymaking in the EU, ESN has put in place a strong programme to continue to further strengthen its capacity in membership, country coverage, communications, alliances and activities\u2019 impact through a detailed communication strategy and activities linking research, policy and practice. ESN in 2015 saw a growth by 19 new members, including a new country \u2014 Ukraine. In its peer learning programme for members alone, dissemination included events from small working groups (8-23 people) to a peer review (children\u2019s services) attended by 57 and a seminar (integrated services) by 93 individuals. ESN in 2015 also organised its 23rdflagship European Social Services Conference that drew over 400 participants from 32 countries. Sustainability of project results ESN\u2019s future work will take account of the EC political priorities on jobs and modernising social protection throughout the life course and will include meetings of the working groups on ageing and care and disability; a second workshop on youth; continuation of the work on evidence; a seminar on social services workforce; and the launch of the report on children\u2019s services among others. The network will continue ongoing efforts in its separate areas of focus, marking the completion of projects with publications and events, and planning its future activities to include respective policy follow-up on uncovered issues. Moreover, in line with a fairer and more social economic union, members of the ESN\u2019s Reference Group on the European Semester will continue analysing their national government\u2019s reform programmes and EC\u2019s country specific recommendations (CSR) and provide input for their annual report. Aligned with the modernisation of social protection systems and services, the Secretariat and ESN\u2019s external expert Ann Buchanan will work with members, who wish to do so, to implement the 2015 toolkit for planning and evaluating services in some of their services. Finally, in connection with a renewed focus on jobs at EU level, ESN will organise a seminar European Social Network (ESN) \u2018The knowledge sharing between ESN members facilitated by the network has revealed numerous good practice-worthy and transferrable practices.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0501 EU contribution in euros: 922 332.12 Policy area: Social Protection and Social Inclusion Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Employment services; Social partners; Non-governmental organisations; Higher education institutions and research institutes; Experts in evaluation and in impact assessment.

Potential good practice The knowledge sharing between ESN members facilitated by the network has revealed numerous good practice-worthy and transferrable practices. For example, learning from a peer learning visit on the Youth Guarantee in Finland by the German Association of Local Employment Policy and local social services in Lithuania inspired both institutions to develop integrated services/one-stop shops for youth. European added value Overall, 2015 was a productive and successful year during which ESN fulfilled the various tasks set out in its work programme and also responded to events that arose during the year such as the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Council Recommendation on long-term unemployment. Quality inputs into EU social policy priorities were developed and there was extensive engagement on external initiatives (e.g. European Semester, European Joint Action on Mental Health and Well-being, the European Expert Group on the Transition from Institutional to Community-based Care). Activities implemented In 2015, ESN implemented activities including conducting research and integrating evidence into its activities and coordinating working groups and events to, among other things, support public services and generate policy evidence in the following six areas: \u2022 Children and youth; \u2022 Disability; \u2022 Older people; \u2022 Services integration; \u2022 Research and evidence; \u2022 Engagement in the EU social policy process.

Eurodiaconia provides its members with political and advocacy support in the field of social inclusion and social services. It offers information materials, training and seminars designed to inform members about European policy issues, thus equipping them to participate in the policy process themselves at Member State and European level. In addition, Eurodiaconia engages directly with the European institutions, basing the network\u2019s policy contributions on members\u2019 experience. In 2015, Eurodiaconia aimed (1) to promote the development, adoption and implementation of social policies; and (2) provide training and knowledge transfer among members both on the architecture of European social policy development, adoption and implementation but also on content and orientation, thus empowering members to be effective advocates and implementers of effective and, where necessary, innovative social policies. Policy evidence generated by the organisation As an organisation focused on promoting social justice at the policy level, Eurodiaconia made considerable efforts in 2015 to generate policy evidence by: \u2022 issuing policy papers, including one on the implementation of Adequate Minimum Income schemes; \u2022 preparing guidelines \u2014 for example the guide for \u2018Diaconal work with Roma among Eurodiaconia members\u2019; \u2022 hosting training seminars and working group meetings; (such as the Working Group Meeting on Research and Practice in Diaconia) participating in thematic network meetings; (e.g. the marginalisation and exclusion network meeting to discuss over indebtedness) and making contributions to public consultations; \u2022 addressing decision-makers through cross-party meetings, for example to discuss how the EP can fight poverty, and official calls, such as the call on the European Council to consider children in migration policies and the call on the Commission to take child well-being, including specific indicators on children at risk of poverty, back on the agenda. Dissemination Among the activities implemented in 2015, Eurodiaconia updated its communication tools and work, and launched a new website. Throughout the year, the organisation oversaw regular internal (newsletters in three languages; member visits) and external (annual report, press releases) communication. The organisation held 13 events, two of which took place in the EP, gathering 505 participants and held targeted knowledge exchange through 12 study visits and issuing 15 briefings and reports. The network is active on social media (Twitter and Facebook). Finally, in 2015 Eurodiaconia launched its Annual Award that will go each year to integrated projects and services promoting social inclusion by offering holistic support to vulnerable individuals. Sustainability of results Eurodiaconia will continue to work on issues relating to long- term unemployment in 2016, with particular reference to projects and services that assist people in their return to work. In addition to other key areas of Eurodiaconia\u2019s work, work will continue on social enterprises and services, EU mobility and social inclusion of migrants. The organisation will also continue to work on the European Semester but also seek to further link economic and social policies together through instruments such as the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP) and Alert Mechanism Report.

        "95 COFACE brings together a large number of civil society organisations with the aim of giving a voice to all families and representing the issues most important to them at the European level. Its many aims for 2015 included: \u2022 supporting the wider recognition of the Social Investment approach, the Inclusive Growth priority under EU2020, and promoting family-friendly policies; \u2022 Fostering information exchange, capacity building and mutual learning between COFACE members, in cooperation with social partners and EU-level alliances, universities, EU and multilateral bodies on what works best for families in the social and employment policy context and making specific recommendations to national governments and policy-makers; \u2022 coordinating the Alliance (for investing in children) to work on joint recommendations about reconciling work and family life and to propose and implement the European Reconciliation Package and participate actively in European alliances to implement the child poverty recommendation; \u2022 monitoring of data and available research on demographic changes in Europe and globally (ILO, Eurostat, Euro barometer, OECD, Eurofound, EIGE, EU- SILC) as well as that on the development and work on the SDGs in preparation of COFACE\u2019s 2016 conference; \u2022 Examining and understanding what contributes to an improved quality of life for families (housing, reconciling work and family life, employment, health, social inclusion, availability of social services, migration). Policy evidence generated by the organisation COFACE in line with its mission focuses much of its effort on building evidence for policy-makers in its area of expertise. Its flagship publication in 2015, the European Reconciliation Package , which was the main policy outcome of the 2014 \u2018Year of Reconciling Work and Family Life,\u2019 applied a systemic approach to the complex issue of work-life balance, to both its related challenges and possible solutions. It analysed four main areas including: reconciling for carers; women at work; reconciling the workplace and childcare, education and parenting. For each area, a legislative and policy background outlines the current situation and some recommendations are put forward as well as a number of existing practices in Europe. Beside this key policy document, COFACE prepared various targeted inputs on specific policy areas including responses to public consultations and written statements (the Consultation on the Audiovisual Media Services Directive; statements on the role of family policies addressed to the UN); lobbying campaigns (input on the review of the EU Air Policy); and conferences (the European Conference Families Beyond Borders). Dissemination COFACE actively engages its members, stakeholders and target groups, and the wider research and policy community via internal newsletters; (1 000 new contacts in 2015) the media; (11 press releases in 2015 yielding 60 mentions in press, national radio and TV) social media; (Twitter, Facebook and Flickr) and by participating in 145 meetings and hosting events, in 2015 gathering 430 participants.

        "96 Potential good practice A potential process-related good practice is the importance of agility for organisations focused on social realities that are constantly in flux. In 2015, the organisation made some changes to its work plan; for example, it introduced new elements which it had previously not planned to respond to, particularly the European Semester capacity-building seminar, the round-table on the 2-generation programmes and the \u2018Families beyond borders\u2019 conference. The events were much needed and appreciated, and finally even better- linked to the policy environment at these times. European added value COFACE\u2019s activities, which were in large part financed by the EC, contribute to adding value for the EU in many ways, including by contributing to EU policymaking and analysing its impacts, particularly in its main area of focus \u2014 representing the interests of all families. Moreover, it contributed to the free movement of persons and mitigated related risks by working on transnational families and how economic migration impacts families and their outcomes. Finally, much of COFACE\u2019s work promotes benchmarking for decision-making through peer reviews at the EC (e.g. piloting local consultation platforms on child poverty; conditional cash transfers \u2014 CCTs \u2014 and their impact on children) and building an evidence base for policy-makers through the many activities and outputs described in the respective section of this fiche. Activities implemented \u2022 European Reconciliation Package: publication, translation, launch and dissemination; \u2022 Alliance 2014 \u2014 follow-up (meetings with the EU alliance for investing in children led by Eurochild to discuss content and advocacy strategy); \u2022 Conference in on Families beyond borders; \u2022 Capacity building on the European Semester process; \u2022 Conference on Financial Inclusion; \u2022 Round-table Two-generation Early Childhood Education and Care programmes; \u2022 Launch of Toys and Diversity campaign.

        "97 SOLIDAR is a European network of NGOs working to advance social justice in Europe and worldwide. The main objectives in 2015 were to: \u2022 contribute to the improvement of the adequacy, efficacy and sustainability of Member States\u2019 performances in undertaking initiatives to implement EU policies aiming at achieving the policy objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy and at implementing the Social Investment Package (SIP); \u2022 strengthen information and knowledge sharing within the SOLIDAR network (including members and strategic partners) on the Europe 2020 strategy and the Social Investment Package; \u2022 strengthen the capacity-building and training opportunities of member and partner organisations and their local branches; \u2022 gather strong evidence on the social impact of activities undertaken by members to help Member States make progress towards the achievement of objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the implementation of the SIP. Socioeconomic context European societies are undergoing severe demographic and structural changes, with direct impact on welfare systems and social policies. Despite strides in reducing unemployment, huge inequalities continue to exist between and within Member States, with young people, migrants and other vulnerable groups being the hardest hit. In 2015, the impact of the increased flow of migrants and refugees into the EU added up to other structural changes such as the ageing population, technological advancements as well as rising levels of inequality. To meet new emerging needs and overcome old and new challenges, Member States and the EU need to promote alternative structural reforms which are urgently needed to reduce inequalities and promote jobs, growth and social investment. Therefore, in 2015, SOLIDAR concentrated its activities on promoting innovative policy solutions and alternative structural reforms to reduce inequalities, with a focus on young people and migrants. Policy evidence generated by the organisation Informing policymaking on issues related to its core areas of focus drives much of SOLIDAR\u2019s activities. Among the many ways it contributed to generating evidence, the network published the edited volume Progressive structural reforms: Proposals for European reforms to fight inequalities and promote jobs, growth and social investment . The book reflects the results of the SOLIDAR Social Progress Lab, a space for academics, policy-makers and civil society actors to think about necessary strategies and policies to achieve a more social and inclusive Europe. Moreover, the results of its monitoring and evaluation work of the national EU strategy groups are reflected in the Social Progress Watch 2015 country reports and in the general comparative report. Finally, SOLIDAR in 2015 published numerous case studies, fact sheets and statements on various social justice- related issues and held, as well as contributed to, the preparation and facilitation of various round-table discussions, including the one on \u2018Migration and fundamental rights: Will the EU live up to its values.\u2019 Dissemination SOLIDAR has established a comprehensive database of targeted contacts at European and national level to reach decision-makers and stakeholders and to disseminate all publications, case studies, fact sheets, updates and information developed within this action. It distributes outcomes internally through its electronic newsletters (reaching about 2 500 interested parties) and externally via the SOLIDAR Online Knowledge Hub and social media (Twitter, Facebook). Besides electronic copies of its outputs SOLIDAR also publishes paper copies of the main outcomes of this action, such as the Social Progress Watch Report , a book on progressive structural reports, Country Studies, etc. Moreover, SOLIDAR representatives actively promote and showcase the network\u2019s outputs, for example the book SOLIDAR \u2018By implementing the activities of its 2015 \u2018Together for Social Europe\u2019 work programme, the SOLIDAR network has had the opportunity to develop consolidated policy messages and recommendations on the most relevant developments of social and employment policies in the EU.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Implementing/Participating countries: SOLIDAR member organisations in 27 countries (22 EU) Grant identification number: VS/2014/0484 Policy area: Social Protection and Social Inclusion Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Policy sub-area: Active inclusion; Child and youth poverty and social exclusion.

        "98 was presented to members of the European Parliament, Commission and other stakeholders during SOLIDAR\u2019s final conference in December. Sustainability of project results SOLIDAR\u2019s advocacy capacity was substantially reinforced in 2015 thanks to the further implementation of this action, ensuring continuity of its impact. The outcomes of the 2015 work programme on the theme of social safeguards will be used for SOLIDAR\u2019s advocacy work in 2016 around the upcoming policy proposals such as the European Pillar of Social Rights or the Labour Mobility Package. Potential good practice The edited volume progressive structural reforms: Proposals for European reforms to fight inequalities and promote jobs, growth and social investment is a substantial result after the first year of SOLIDAR\u2019s Social Progress Lab and serves as a potential good practice. The Lab allowed the organisation to build-up a comprehensive network of progressive academics who are feeding into the process of developing new ideas and strategies to actively support proposals from progressive civil society and trade unions for a more progressive and social Europe, and produced enough evidence for the book. European added value By implementing the activities of its 2015 \u2018Together for Social Europe\u2019 work programme, the SOLIDAR network has had the opportunity to develop consolidated policy messages and recommendations on the most relevant developments of social and employment policies in the EU. In particular, SOLIDAR developed innovative and progressive policy proposals to put an end to social dumping, precarious working conditions, and growing informal economy and to restore SOLIDARity and a human rights-based approach to the heart of EU migration, asylum and integration policies. Furthermore, together with its members and partners, the network continued its advocacy action to promote the social economy and the recognition of the specific characteristics of not-for-profit social service providers throughout the bloc. Activities implemented In 2015, SOLIDAR \u2014 with a focus on the most vulnerable groups such as young people, migrants, persons with disabilities \u2014 implemented various activities among which it: \u2022 strengthened the 12 national EU strategy groups created in 2014 and set up two new ones (HU, SK); \u2022 exchanged knowledge and information on the state of play in 14 countries and progress towards EU 2020 and the Social Investment Package (SIP) and produced respective reports; \u2022 organised the Training Academy 2015 on the topic of labour market integration and held study visits (ES, UK).

        "99 Stichting ERGO Network (European Roma Grass-roots Organisations) has over 15 years of unique experience in Roma issues. The Network encompasses over 25 (pro) Roma organisations from different European countries working together towards Roma equal citizenship and empowerment and to fight anti-gypsyism. As part of the Annual Work Plan supported by Directorate-General for Employment, ERGO Network and its members focused on Roma participation in the local, national and European context, with a particular eye for the European Structural and Investment Funds. Its objectives for 2015 cantered on: \u2022 Monitoring the first phase of implementation of the operational programmes with particular attention to \u2018Community-Led Local Development\u2019 (CLLD) while highlighting the importance of Roma involvement in the development and implementation of local development strategies. This work consisted of capacity building of Roma organisations, advocacy at local, national and European level and the development of a CLLD Quality Audit tool. \u2022 Strengthening the National Roma Civil Society Working Groups in several countries aiming to gather Roma and pro-Roma organisations into coalitions to join forces for common action and advocacy (through the European Semester and Country Specific Recommendations CSRs). Socioeconomic context The effectiveness of EU cohesion, social and regional policies for Roma inclusion remains weak despite much work observed over the past several years to identify factors that inhibit successful policies to address the disadvantaged position of Roma. The lack of active involvement of target communities in project design and implementation remains one of the biggest obstacles to successful outcomes. To point out the shortcomings of policies targeted at Roma, ERGO has explored the outreach of the Youth Guarantee programme to Roma and found that this mainstream programme has difficulties serving Roma youngsters. The National Roma Integration Strategies (NRIS) have so far not been able to address these issues and propose inadequate links with EU funding and national policy plans, also in the new programming period. Moreover, they focus strongly on the service delivery side of the problem, and do not really do justice to the need to address underlying inequality and discrimination and the necessity to support an independent civil society. As a result, the strategies have in most countries unfortunately gradually become detached from both realities on the ground and policy debates. New partnerships created To get involved in the policy process described above, (CEU) ERGO, together with the Central European University, created a coalition to opt for the tender for Shadow Reporting. The coalition\u2019s proposal was selected and ERGO was contracted to perform the shadow reporting and the necessary capacity building of Roma NGOs for 2016-2018. Policy evidence generated by the organisation By gathering data at local level and carrying out field research, ERGO collected evidence to support its advocacy claims. In 2015, the network illustrated the need for specific measures to reach out to Roma within Youth Guarantee schemes, as well as the lack of strategical interventions against Roma discrimination by equality bodies. In 2015 ERGO developed 30 different reports, including studies and monitoring and assessment reports. Dissemination Throughout 2015, ERGO continuously communicated with and supported its members and Roma organisations on the ground through a variety of channels and activities. In addition, the network developed several tools to gather comparable data through research and coached and supported organisations in applying them. As part of its knowledge generating work, ERGO widely disseminated the policy papers, reports, synthesis notes and articles produced by its network. The European Roma Grass-roots Organisations Network (ERGO) \u2018Throughout its work in 2015, ERGO aimed and succeeded in strengthening relations with Roma grass-roots organisations and increasing their understanding of and involvement in EU-level processes.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Implementing/Participating countries: ERGO member organisations in 20 European countries Grant identification number: VS/2014/0482 Policy area: Social Protection and Social Inclusion and Diversity and Anti-Discrimination Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 EU contribution in euros: 403,181.00 Policy sub-area: Active inclusion; Non-discrimination/ equality mainstreaming; Positive action.

Moreover, ERGO in 2015 put on over 40 capacity-building-focused actions engaging as many as 230 relevant stakeholders. Sustainability of project results ERGO will continue representing and advocating for the consideration of the Roma perspective in EU policies. The ERGO network and its members will channel the information and knowledge gathered throughout 2015 in several processes at European level, both Roma-specific and not: from the European Semester 2016 to the mid-term review of the Youth Guarantee, from the shadow reporting of NRIS to the implementation of Community Led Local Development (CLLD). Finally, the new coalition with the CEU foresees shadow reporting and capacity building of Roma NGOs in 2016\u20132018. European added value ERGO\u2019s activities add value to the EU by strengthening the bridge between Roma grass-roots\u2019 organisations and the bloc. Throughout its work in 2015 ERGO aimed and succeeded in strengthening relations with Roma grass-roots\u2019 organisations and increasing their understanding of and involvement in EU- level processes. This was achieved through several activities, from dissemination of information to visits to the members, from capacity-building on EU-level processes (European Social Investment Fund \u2014 ESIF, CLLD, Youth Guarantee, European Semester/ Country Specific Recommendations \u2014 CSRs) to online consultations. In addition, through the National Roma Civil Society Working Groups, ERGO provides and receives information and inputs by more organisations than its direct members. Activities implemented In 2015, beside its ongoing activities, ERGO put a special focus on supporting Directorate-General for Employment with COM/2008/420 Non-discrimination and equal opportunities: a renewed commitment of the Council Directive 2000/43/EC by becoming a familiar and active player in ESF and Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) funding: \u2022 preparatory phase : launching Agreement on Annual Working Plan and feedback of Y1 activities; and holding a meeting of Roma Civil Society Working Group together with partner Fundacion Secretariato Gitanos (FSG); \u2022 implementation phase : capacity-building activities for six focus ERGO member countries: BG, CZ, FR, LT, HU, RO, SK (new member); and local Advocacy work and events; issuing policy papers, mapping, research and holding awareness raising events; \u2022 dissemination and communication phase : publication of Final report, fact sheets, updated website communication.

        "101 ENSIE, an organisation joining 28 national and regional networks, representing 21 countries of the European Union sees to the representation, maintenance and development within the European Union of networks and federations for Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs). All these networks pursue, by adapting to local constraints, objectives of social integration of disadvantaged groups. Together, they represent more than 2 500 Social Integration Enterprises, and about 400 000 salaried persons. The common general objective of ENSIE\u2019s 2015 activities was to support, represent and promote the development of WISEs \u2014 real enterprises that try to contribute to social inclusion and target disadvantaged groups. Added to that there were some specific objectives linked to: \u2022 Network life : increasing ENSIE\u2019s recognition and expansion, increasing synergies with other EU networks, dialogue with social partners, and promoting the SIP and its implementation; \u2022 Members : working closer with the network and sustaining the national advocacy work of individual members to help them become recognised as strategic stakeholders, develop ties with national civil society organisations and social partners, be involved in the European Structural and Investment Funds and European Semester processes; \u2022 WISEs and their workers : raising the knowledge and recognition of WISEs and working to create favourable environments, at European and national levels, to provide relevant data to WISEs concerning their role in active labour market measures, social and economic impact measurement, integration of homeless people and support to disadvantaged workers. Socioeconomic context 2015 was characterised by post-election changes within European institutions, and one of the challenges identified at the end of last year was to make sure of a renewed interest on the topics of social economy and social enterprises, in particular WISEs. Today, Europe is still facing important challenges especially concerning job creation and the issue of long-term unemployment. In this context, WISEs remain a key solution for the most vulnerable groups. Policy evidence generated by the organisation ENSIE provides evidence about WISEs in Europe through a database gathering info on such organisations from 41 European countries. The European measurement tool on social and economic impact created by the network yielded the first results on WISEs in 2015 from nine member organisations. This year, ENSIE conducted analysis on various topics (CSRs in member countries; good practice on tackling in-work poverty, etc.); released five position papers; contributed to three relevant European consultations; and had 17 meetings with EC bodies and EP groups (Intergroups, Committees EMPL, Internal Market and Consumer Protection \u2014 IMCO and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy ITRE, etc.). Dissemination ENSIE in 2015 implemented various internal dissemination activities, for example through internal events \u2014 its General Assembly, which drew participants from 18 countries and Directorate-General for Employment representatives and its board meeting, which took place together with a transnational meeting of the European project \u2018Old challenges, new pathways: social enterprises fostering improvement and social innovation on social inclusion.\u2019 External events included the \u2018Social Innovation between policy and development\u2019 seminar. The network was represented at 26 conferences and representatives gave speeches at seven of them. Moreover, ENSIE in 2015 launched its new website, actively engaged traditional and social media and circulated a monthly newsletter. Sustainability of project results In the years to come ENSIE will continue working towards its objectives. One area for continued development, given evidence gathered in 2015 about the little progress made by Member States in implementing the new Public Procurement Directive, will be to continue raising awareness about the new possibilities it offers WISEs and to make sure it is taken into European Network of Social Integration Enterprises (ENSIE) \u2018ENSIE provides evidence about Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs) in Europe through a database gathering info on such organisations from 41 European countries.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Implementing/Participating countries: ENSIE members in 21 EU countries Grant identification number: VS/2014/0480 Policy area: Social Protection and Social Inclusion, Employment and Social Economy Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 EU contribution in euros: 124 880.00 Policy sub-area: Active inclusion; Housing exclusion and homelessness; Local development (employment); Legal and regulatory framework for social economy.

        "102 account at national level. Likewise, due to slow uptake among members to get involved in the EU Semester process, ENSIE in 2016 will hold training to raise interest and active involvement. Potential good practice A potential good practice on the process level is a novelty in ENSIE\u2019s business model in 2015. Given that considerable resources go into developing proposals for activities, the network introduced a requirement for members to contribute financially for the first time, by pitching in for 4 or more hours with project writing or organising and facilitating specific activities for its members. This new way of working was positively welcomed by the members of the General Assembly, particularly because of the need for equity to manage the network. European added value ENSIE\u2019s activities contributed to EU processes on various levels. It contributed to EU legislation, both on policymaking by providing evidence and engaging policy-makers, and on implementation by engaging its members and facilitating their involvement at the national level on relevant topics linked to the EU framework such as the European Semester, the Structural and Investment Funds processes as well as the implementation of the Public Procurement Directive. Moreover, through its research and analysis, ENSIE identified and promoted best practice examples particularly in areas supporting disadvantaged groups and the working poor. Activities implemented \u2022 Raised awareness on and promoted Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs); \u2022 Reinforced members and their networks through dissemination; \u2022 capacity-building activities, particularly concerning the implementation of the 2014/24/EU Public Procurement Directive; \u2022 Studied themes relevant to ENSIE\u2019s mission, particularly labour market measures, social and economic impact measurement, integration of homeless people and in-work poverty.

        "103 The EASPD represents over 10 000 service providers for persons with disabilities from across Europe and across disability. This action supports the implementation of EASPD\u2019s strategy for the coming years which is to \u2018reach out\u2019 and proactively and horizontally connect with different stakeholders and cooperate on the ground, with extended focus from the disability sector to the social sector and to mainstream actors in employment, education and independent living. In order to do so, the action was structured around the following three interlinked pillars: \u2022 Impact : activities designed to give service providers a voice in Europe; \u2022 Innovation : activities addressed to facilitate the modernisation and development of services via evidence- based practice; \u2022 Information : activities that make it possible to update the membership on relevant policy developments and cooperation opportunities at EU level and Europe wide, but also to communicate the key issues of grass-roots organisations to the EU level. Results The work performed by EASPD in 2015 has seen four main achievements: \u2022 the work carried out around the European Semester as a tool to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the role of service providers has seen incredibly good results both at quantitative and qualitative levels; \u2022 EASPD\u2019s research in 2015 has been focused on how the sector can access important funding mechanisms including European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), which can help to improve the delivery of support services; \u2022 EASPD is fully embarked in the \u2018co- production process,\u2019 i.e. user-led support services, by means of commitment to raising awareness by promoting the exchange of information on the UN CRPD, exchanging and sharing models of good practice, informing its members of new developments in the disability field and raising awareness at European and national levels; \u2022 the capacity of EASPD has been increased in 2015 with 21 extra members, meaning it represents 12 000 support service providers in 33 European countries. Policy evidence generated by the organisation In 2015, the EASPD Secretariat underwent restructuring into three departments, including the Policy Department as one, equipped with a Policy Manager and tasked with further increasing EASPD presence in all relevant decision- making process structures at European level, particularly in three main areas: European social policy; Education and Employment; Disability and Community-Based Services. EASPD has continued its intensive cooperation with the EC, has qualitatively improved its relationship with the EP and maintained fruitful cooperation with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), the Council of Europe and many different EU-wide networks (on the European Semester, the Youth Guarantee, Tackling Long-Term Unemployment, EFSI and ESIF among others). Overall, the network\u2019s communication, dissemination and promotional activities increased significantly, with an evident impact on the coverage of EASPD activities and publications. As a highlight, in 2015 EASPD launched a new special newsflash \u2018AGORA EUROPE\u2019 addressed to policy-makers. Dissemination EASPD devotes particular attention to dissemination, as evidenced by its release of a designated report for communications activity performance alongside the annual general performance reports.

        "105 The EAPN is the largest European network of national, regional and local organisations, including anti-poverty NGOs and grass-roots groups, as well as European organisations active in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The network spans 31 European countries. Socioeconomic context: According to the EAPN, as many as 122.3 million people in the European Union are at risk of poverty and social exclusion, inter alia due to the recent austerity approach and imbalanced economic recovery. In the period under review, EAPN aimed to work towards the following objectives : \u2022 to promote and enhance the effectiveness of actions against poverty and social exclusion; \u2022 to disseminate information and to raise awareness of issues relevant to fighting poverty and social exclusion; \u2022 to help shape appropriate social policies and action programmes at EU and national levels; \u2022 to work for and with people and groups experiencing poverty and social exclusion. Policy evidence generated One of the key strands of action of EAPN in 2015 was to produce various reports and policy briefs in order to influence policy. For example, EAPN produced commentaries on the Europe 2020 process, monitoring reports on the implementation of NRPs and CSRs, and communicated the key findings to EU and national policy-makers. In the year under review, EAPN also delivered numerous other analytical outputs, including a Barometer Report to monitor the extent to which ESF is invested in fighting against poverty, response to the Annual Growth Survey 2016, proposals for CSRs, assessment of NRPs and other inputs into policymaking. The network in 2015 organised 14 mutual learning events aimed at experts, engaging as many as 207, reached another 458 stakeholders who participated in its six conferences, and organised over 20 other type of communication actions. Key messages promoted In 2015, EAPN aimed to draw the attention of policy and decision-makers to the following key messages: \u2022 Do not discard commitment made \u2014 deliver on Europe 2020\u2019s poverty reduction target. Europe 2020 goals and targets must be restored to the heart of the European Semester, with specific sections in the National Reform Programmes linked to delivery of the Europe 2020 poverty and other social targets, CSRs on poverty for all countries, and a renewed commitment to spending 20% of ESF on poverty reduction. EAPN, through its timely and detailed monitoring of the Europe 2020 process, tried to hold EU and national leaders accountable for the commitments they have made. \u2022 Europe needs a fresh start with an integrated strategy to fight poverty and social exclusion. EAPN has campaigned for a fresh start in the fight against poverty exclusion and inequalities and for the delivery of integrated strategies to fight poverty and social exclusion. This work has contributed to the high profile given by the President of the Commission to social issues and has resulted in the proposal to have an EU Pillar of Social Rights. \u2022 Participation of people experiencing poverty and their civil society organisations is key. The work of EAPN contributed to maintaining annual European meetings of people experiencing poverty as a contribution in its own right and as a catalyst for national participation process. Lessons learned In 2015, EAPN identified the following key areas for policy follow-up: \u2022 macroeconomic policies need to be put on a par with social objectives and at the service of social inclusion and cohesion; European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) \u2018The key added value of EAPN was that they brought the voice from people experiencing poverty and persons working at the ground level into the policy debate and the implementation of EU policies at EU, national, regional and local levels.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Implementing/Participating countries: The Member States of the EU, Norway, Iceland, Serbia and the former Yogoslav Republic of Macedonia Grant identification number: VS/2014/0509 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion Policy sub-area: Financial exclusion; Active inclusion; Housing exclusion and homelessness; Child and youth poverty and social exclusion.

        "106 \u2022 social policy must be seen as an investment, not a cost; and as a prerequisite for high quality growth and social inclusion; \u2022 the improved presence of social concerns in the CSRs must be translated into real commitments and actions to address poverty, exclusion and inequalities; \u2022 integrated anti-poverty strategies should be developed to tackle the multidimensionality of poverty for all groups, based on personalised, integrated Active Inclusion (inclusive labour markets, adequate income support, access to quality services), linked to thematic strategies for at-risk groups; \u2022 translate the Social Pillar into an integrated EU rights- based anti-poverty strategy, including progress on EU social standards, starting with adoption of a Minimum Income Directive; \u2022 launch a process to develop common guidelines and indicators to measure the effectiveness of stakeholder dialogue, monitored and reviewed annually through the European Semester; \u2022 support the organisation of annual European Meetings of People Experiencing Poverty, as a key moment to involve beneficiaries and obtain their direct feedback on policy processes, to ensure the legitimacy, ownership, credibility and effectiveness of social policies. Partnerships The EAPN continued building partnerships with organisations active in the area of poverty reduction through actively participating in the Social Platform, engaging in the Alliance for Investing in Children and European Semester Alliance, as well as participating in the European Minimum Income Network. The EAPN also fostered partnerships between its member organisations through various capacity building activities, which in 2015 numbered 20 and impacted 362 participants. Dissemination Various communication activities were implemented in order to disseminate information about EAPN work, such as EAPN Flash (electronic newsletter), a number of awareness raising campaigns, maintenance of social media instruments, etc. Potential good practice The EAPN organised the annual European meeting of people experiencing poverty. This meeting could be seen as a good practice of involving the actual persons affected by EU policies into the policy debate. European added value The key added value of EAPN was that they brought the voice from people experiencing poverty and persons working at the ground level into the policy debate and the implementation of EU policies at EU, national, regional and local levels. EAPN input was based on the experience of how the policies and programmes are delivered and felt by people at ground level. The advocacy work of EAPN gave real-time feedback on the daily realities experienced by people and communities who carry the burden of economic failures. EAPN sought to contribute to distributing the resources available in European societies so that everybody has access to adequate income and essential goods and services. Activities implemented \u2022 Work to support the Europe 2020 Strategy towards the realisation of the poverty target and promotion of social inclusion; \u2022 Actions to disseminate information about EU policies and strategies in the area of poverty reduction; \u2022 Contributing to key alliances advocating a more social Europe; \u2022 Actions to support the functioning of EAPN as a representative network of anti-poverty organisations, operating in 31 European countries and engaging 18 European Organisations; \u2022 Actions to support the capacity building of EAPN members to engage with key EU processes; \u2022 Actions to support the direct participation of people experiencing poverty in EU debates and strategies; \u2022 Actions to ensure bottom-up input into key EAPN strategies and programmes.

        "107 The EVPA is a membership association established in 2004 and made up of organisations interested in or practising venture philanthropy and social investment across Europe. The EVPA defines venture philanthropy as an approach to build stronger investee organisations with a societal purpose by providing them with both financial and non-financial support in order to increase their societal impact. Objectives In 2015, the EVPA focused on four priorities defined together with the European Commission. The association: 1. supported the Commission in its outreach activities at EU, national and local level with an aim of ensuring the implementation of European policies in the area of social investment; 2. reinforced the capacity of the network\u2019s members , including through offering a platform for the exchange of good practices in the social investment field and raising awareness on relevant EU policies; 3. Voiced concerns and expectations of organisations facilitating access to finance to (potential) entrepreneurs from disadvantaged and under-represented groups and social enterprises; 4. Provided data and research on developments in the social investment field and on priority topics. Summary of key results In order to support the Commission in its policy outreach activities, in 2015 EVPA organised various events and online activities. For example, a policy session entitled \u2018EVPA and European Public Affairs \u2014 How to be more pro-active?\u2019 was delivered during EVPA\u2019s Gathering of Leaders in Venice in April 2015. During the meeting, EVPA\u2019s members were brought up to date on EVPA\u2019s current policy activities and given the chance to provide input to shape the key messages of EVPA\u2019s policy advocacy. In addition, four \u2018SBI Index Cards\u2019 were developed and shared on EVPA\u2019s website in 2015 to further increase the awareness about Social Business Initiative in the sector. They dealt with the topics related to EuSEF, EaSI Financial Instruments, mapping of financial opportunities and public procurement. To reinforce the capacity of EVPA\u2019s members, the association organised exchanges of experiences between practitioners and various other events, offered structured training courses as well as published and disseminated good practice guides and brochures to its members. Among other things, EVPA aimed to allow access to learning possibilities for resource-strapped members e.g. start-ups, members from CEE Region with limited resources, to enable a more equal access to the opportunities promoted at the EU level. The EVPA Training Academy course \u2018Venture Philanthropy in practice: the fundamental toolkit\u2019 was a two-module training in Barcelona and Brussels. In order to ensure that the Training Academy remains accessible to all, the EVPA financed the travel and registration fees for interested members in under-represented member nations. To voice concerns and expectation of organisations facilitating access to finance for vulnerable groups, EVPA implemented and took action on their members\u2019 satisfaction survey and created a possibility for members to write about their concerns on the EVPA blog. Furthermore, in 2015 EVPA\u2019s staff engaged in 23 conferences and workshops in 15 countries, which helped them understand the current views and concerns of practitioners and experts in the field. The concerns of relevant organisations were regularly forwarded to the EU Commission through EVPA\u2019s Public Affairs Manager. Finally, EVPA invested many resources to provide policy evidence \u2014 data and research \u2014 on the relevant developments in the fields of venture philanthropy and social investment. For the year 2015, the EVPA Knowledge Centre launched an updated edition of \u2018A practical guide to measuring and managing impact of social investment\u2019 and produced three research reports: \u2018A practical guide to adding value through non-financial support,\u2019 \u2018Impact measurement case studies\u2019 and an updated version of \u2018A practical guide to venture philanthropy and social investment.\u2019 European Venture Philanthropy Association \u2014 EVPA \u2018The EU financial support allowed the EVPA to expand its services for the social investment sector and incentivised the association to invest in better planning and reporting.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0512 EU contribution in euros: 460 728.40 Policy area: Social economy Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Non-governmental organisations; Higher education institutions and research institutes; Experts in evaluation and impact assessment; Media. Policy sub-area: Social investment; Venture philanthropy. Implementing/Participating countries: Currently the association has over 210 members from 29 countries, mainly based in Europe, but also outside Europe, including the United States, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Asia ",
        "108 Innovativeness In 2015, EVPA continued the \u2018EU Webinar Series\u2019 that was initiated in 2014. The EU Webinar Series was open to all (not only EVPA members); presentations and recordings of each session were made available shortly after the webinar was run on the dedicated page created on the EVPA website. During 2015, EVPA\u2019s Webinars dealt with such topics as Social Impact Bonds, EU Funding and Public Procurement. Sustainability Thanks to the support of the European Commission, in the future EVPA is planning to offer an even more diverse set of support services to ensure the value added of the association\u2019s activities to practitioners and stakeholders. In addition, the increasing sophistication of social investment practitioners will receive specific attention in upcoming EVPA activities. The association is planning to invest in a broader offer of networking and information-sharing possibilities through stronger local presence and a state-of-the-art digital presence. They will also diversify their approach to policy advocacy work. Finally, over the next few years, the EVPA will aim to answer to an increased demand for policy evidence in the field of social investment. As such, the organisation will invest in an industry survey, which will allow more detailed specificities of the growth of the sector to be captured, and will focus more on the development of good practice case studies. Fostering gender equality To discuss the subject of gender, EVPA held a workshop in Berlin as a follow-up event on last year\u2019s launch of the thematic group on gender. The thematic group on gender brings together EVPA members interested in learning about or mastering a gender-sensitive approach to investments and grant-making and resulted in the launch of a dedicated online group for EVPA members interested in the topic. Building partnerships To strengthen the EVPA community of venture philanthropy and social investment practitioners, the association organised country meetings \u2014 local events aimed at fostering the feeling of being part of a community. In 2015, EVPA organised national events in countries where the EU Commission\u2019s work offers high potential for the sector: Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. These events included a session entitled \u2018EVPA Policy Dimension: Building bridges with policy-makers and across EU countries.\u2019 Dissemination A notable instrument to disseminate the results of the association\u2019s activities was the EVPA\u2019s newsletter, where nine articles on EU issues and four articles on social investment in EU specific countries (Greece, Croatia, Poland and Portugal) were published. In addition to this, results were disseminated via numerous other instruments, including the website, events and workshops, EVPA blog, various brochures and posters etc. Potential good practice EVPA\u2019s survey on access to finance concerns and expectations of the association\u2019s members was a very effective way to understand concerns and expectations of its members and could be implemented by other similar organisations at the EU level. The survey was launched in October 2015 and reached 210 members (full, associate, honorary and EVPA\u2019s founders). To increase the participation rate, the association offered prizes to incentivise members to complete the survey: travel/accommodation and free entrance to the EVPA annual conference in Madrid for one of the investees/grantees of as the first prize and three opportunities for one of the investees/grantees of the other winners to be profiled in a special section in EVPA\u2019s newsletter. After having analysed all the results and made a complete report, the EVPA secretariat produced an infographic to demonstrate the results and distributed it during the annual conference. European added value The EU financial support allowed EVPA to expand its services for the social investment sector and incentivised the association to invest in better planning and reporting. In addition, the Commission\u2019s support (not only financial, but also the demonstrated interest in the field) contributed to the increased credibility of the EVPA and therefore growth of its membership as well as better awareness of various relevant actors of the social investment market. Activities implemented \u2022 Assisting the EU in its outreach to social investment practitioners through a combination of webinars, digital instruments and communication material for wide reach, and national events in some highly relevant countries; \u2022 Reinforcing the capacity of EVPA\u2019s members creating connections to share, learn and develop partnerships across borders; bringing in new experiences from a larger group of countries; offering facilities for resource-strapped practitioners to join; enhancing access to insights on EU policies; \u2022 Voicing the concerns and expectations of EVPA\u2019s members by developing a structured approach to collect those concerns and expectations; voicing them through empowerment of its members and through external communication towards a larger audience, including institutional actors (the European Commission, national authorities, etc.); \u2022 Providing data and research on developments and priority topics by ensuring access to data, producing research on key topics related to venture philanthropy and social investment as well as investing in intensive communication in the sector and best practices.

        "109 FEANTSA was established in 1989 as a European non- governmental organisation to prevent and alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of people threatened by or living in homelessness. It is the only major European network that focuses exclusively on homelessness. Most of FEANTSA\u2019s members are national or regional umbrella organisations of service providers that support homeless people with a wide range of services, including housing, health, employment and social support. Objectives In 2015, FEANTSA used the European Commission\u2019s funding to support progress in confronting homelessness in the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Social Investment Package (SIP). First, it aimed to strengthen the efforts required to achieve the Europe 2020 poverty target. Second, the federation addressed the following dimensions of the SIP: implementation of policy guidance on homelessness; strengthening homeless people\u2019s capacities to participate in society and the labour market; effective and efficient use of social budgets; ensuring adequate social protection; developing integrated approaches to achieve lasting positive outcomes; prevention of youth and child exclusion. Key results in 2015 FEANTSA\u2019s impact was most visible in the area of policy advocacy. Last year, the federation made many important contributions to promoting the SIP guidance on homelessness as a tool for policymaking at the EU level and in the Member States. The most important result of FEANTSA\u2019s work in 2015 were the promising connections made with relevant directorate-generals of the European Commission (other than Directorate-General for Employment) and securing of their interest in parts of the SIP related to homelessness. FEANTSA also advanced substantially in their cooperation with Eurostat in order to include a question on homelessness in the revised EU SILC survey. In addition, FEANTSA managed to get homelessness referred to as the key issue in the Luxembourg EU Presidency report on common EU social values, which was adopted by the Social Policy Committee. In the framework of the Social OMC, FEANTSA secured a peer review on homelessness to take place in 2016. When it comes to supporting the implementation of Europe 2020, FEANTSA issued several statements on the EU poverty target and helped to finalise and promote the paper of the Friends of Europe on future social inclusion policies with strong references to homelessness. This report aimed to have an impact on the review of the Europe 2020 Strategy. Policy evidence generated by FEANTSA In 2015, the federation contributed to a number of very important reports produced by EU policy bodies. For example, it contributed to the main reports of the SPC Indicators\u2019 sub- group and Directorate-General for Employment by providing robust data on the scale and nature of homelessness and the changes in homelessness policies across Europe. In addition, FEANTSA secured references to homelessness in a handful of NRPs 2015 and country reports 2016. They published country fiches on homelessness for almost all EU Member States with up-to-date information on the scale and nature of homelessness and changes in homelessness policies in specific countries. To support organisations working with homeless people, in 2015 FEANTSA published a Participation Toolkit with the aim of informing the mentioned organisations on how to involve homeless persons in the development of services. It contained 25 suggested tools (presented as easy to use fact sheets) to facilitate participation of the targeted homeless people in the services provided by the relevant organisation. Dissemination EU support allowed FEANTSA to redesign their website (attracting several thousand unique visitors per month) as the most important European online resource on homelessness. European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless \u2014 FEANTSA \u2018FEANTSA successfully promoted Housing First as an innovative policy to address chronic/complex homelessness and started preparing for the launch of a European platform of exchange on Housing First.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0508 EU contribution in euros: 966 340.74 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Non-governmental organisations; Higher education institutions and research institutes; Media.

",
        "110 In addition, they published several issues of general and thematic newsletters: Magazine \u2018Homeless in Europe\u2019, Housing Rights Watch newsletter, news brief of the European Network of Homeless Health Workers, Habitact Bulletin and LINK. In 2015, FEANTSA further developed their social media strategy with daily updates and more than 6 000 followers on Twitter and 2 500 Likes on Facebook. European added value The key value added of FEANTSA was that it strengthened engagement of its members and other key stakeholders in the fight against homelessness in EU processes as well as networking between the relevant organisations from different countries. In this area, FEANTSA continued to coordinate some satellite networks to reach out to the key partners involved in the fight against homelessness, that are not members of FEANTSA. For example, the federation organised a training seminar with Housing Rights Watch for young professionals from the homelessness sector on the effective protection of human rights (including litigation). Potential good practice FEANTSA successfully promoted Housing First as an innovative policy to address chronic/complex homelessness and started preparing for the launch of a European platform of exchange on Housing First (HousingFirst Europe HUB). Housing First is an approach that focuses on providing homeless people with housing quickly and only then providing other services as needed. Sustainability As a result of the above, FEANTSA submitted a proposal related to the implementation of a Housing First approach together with the city of Westminster under the DG EMPL social innovation call. Activities implemented \u2022 Enabling ongoing dialogue between all relevant actors (members, EU institutions and agencies, EU organisations, research community, local, regional and national authorities, and neighbouring sectors) to promote the development and implementation of effective measures to fight homelessness. FEANTSA maintained, built and strengthened partnerships at multiple levels of governance; \u2022 Promoting and facilitating the exchange of information, experience and practices. This aimed to improve policies and services in line with both EU social investment approach and the needs and aspirations of homeless people; \u2022 Conducting research, monitoring homelessness, building capacity for data collection and sharing knowledge so as to inform evidence-based policy at EU level and in Member States; \u2022 Promoting and contributing to the use of relevant policy instruments and processes to better support progress on homelessness in the context of Europe 2020 and the SIP (most relevant include the European Semester, European Platform Against Poverty and Social Exclusion, European Structural and Investment Funds, Social OMC and EaSI programme); \u2022 Lobbying for an optimal EU framework that supports Member States\u2019 policies (national/regional/local) to address homelessness.

        "111 EuroHealthNet is a not-for-profit partnership of organisations, agencies and statutory bodies working to contribute to a healthier Europe by promoting health and health equity between and within European countries. EuroHealthNet achieves this through its partnership framework by supporting members\u2019 work in the EU and associated states through policy and project development, networking and communications. Its members are national and regional institutes, academic and research centres, national and regional authorities and government departments. Socioeconomic context Social inequalities in health are not only unfair, they also have a huge economic and social cost. Estimates suggest that inequality-related losses to health amount to more than 700 000 deaths per year and 33 million prevalent cases of ill health in the EU as a whole. These losses account for 20 % of the total costs of healthcare and 15 % of the total costs of social security benefits. Health promotion and disease prevention alone cannot reduce health inequalities as these stem from wider social, economic and environmental factors. Investments in early childhood, education, better employment conditions and inclusive social protection systems can all contribute to health equity. Exploring, documenting, providing recommendations and acting upon the underlying causes of health inequalities therefore makes economic sense as well as being socially just and contribute to better performing societies and states. Objectives Through the EaSI Work Programme, EuroHealthNet aimed to support integrated ways to bring public health and social priorities together. The organisation generated, identified and promoted approaches against health and social inequalities that negatively influence the well-being of European citizens and their ability to contribute to a more sustainable Europe. EuroHealthNet also continued to promote the use of EU Structural and Investment Funds towards improving health, equity and well-being objectives. The organisation\u2019s activities were structured according to four priorities: 1. supporting the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of initiatives undertaken towards the policy objectives of Europe 2020 Strategy and in particular the SIP, including contribution to the main EU- driven processes such as the OMC on social protection and social inclusion and the European Semester; 2. supporting stakeholders\u2019 involvement in the EU and national policy processes; 3. strengthening the capacity of EuroHealthNet members to support the implementation of EU priorities; 4. providing data and strong evidence base on policy developments and trends as well as collecting relevant information about citizens\u2019 concerns and good practices in the social policy field in the Member States, so as to contribute to better policymaking. Key results in 2015 In the period under review, EuroHealthNet\u2019s work resulted in the further development of healthy ageing strategies in Slovenia and in Italian regions; a widely appreciated analysis of CSRs with a health equity focus on retirement, children and families and health systems; successful efforts of evidence being brought into policy environments at EU and national level; contributions to discussions on the social and health aspects of the European Semester; increased capacity and awareness on relevant EU processes by health authorities; and many strengthened partnerships to tackle health inequalities from different policy angles. Policy evidence As many as 27 examples of evidence-based good practices were captured for an entry into the database on www.health-inequalities.eu, two of which were considered for more detailed case studies. One of these was the 61 Health Promoting Offices initiative in Hungary. This was highlighted EuroHealthNet \u2018The organisation generated, identified and promoted approaches against health and social inequalities that negatively influence the well-being of European citizens and their ability to contribute to a more sustainable Europe.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0503 EU contribution in euros: 496 676.52 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Social partners; Non-governmental organisations; Higher education institutions and research institutes; National statistical offices; Media.

        "112 in the network\u2019s online magazine and in the Hungarian study visit. The second was the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act, explored in both an online magazine and a conference held in Cardiff in the summer of 2015. In addition, EuroHealthNet drew the attention of EU institutions to the growing volume of evidence from OECD, WHO, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, and shared their findings at meetings with the Commission. Dissemination EuroHealthNet made use of the www.eurohealthnet.eu portal to disseminate policy information to members, and policy briefs, recommendations and reports to a wider range of stakeholders. As many as 1 066 updates were uploaded to the website in 2015. In addition, approximately 6 000 people from relevant sectors have been contacted through briefings and factsheets, and as a result received information about health and social equity actions of the organisation. Partnerships EuroHealthNet worked with AGE Platform Europe to take forward active ageing, health literacy and age-friendly environment policies and practices, whereas their special website www.healthyageing.eu has been praised by WHO as a unique perspective. On mental health and well-being, EuroHealthNet helped to build alliances of mental health in all policies and links with the EU Compass and joint actions from an equity perspective. On health and safety at work, engagement with the OSHA campaigns was productive and inter alia contributed to the organisation\u2019s internal training as well as that of their stakeholders. Potential good practice EuroHealthNet began work on setting up a help desk for members and partners of the network to access information on SF and ESIF. Work included the further development of a special online tool and ad hoc information on the use of SF for health equity. To this end, preparation for tailored mailing on the use of Structural Funds to the members was started in 2015. In the same year, the network started working on a Structural Funds Guide for the members. EuroHealthNet\u2019s online tool on the use of SF was kept up to date and information on ESIF was given during country visits. European added value In 2015, EuroHealthNet promoted good practice examples learned from previous EU and national actions and also communicated policy evidence to EU and national authorities with an impact on their decisions. Stakeholders working on public health issues (including ministries) have been directly confronted with evidence on the need to re-orient towards integrated health-promoting systems through Health Promotion Europe (HPE). This was carried out in various countries, for example, by: \u2022 informing actors involved in reforming health and social services in Finland about EU Semester and SIP tools; \u2022 Linking the EU Joint Action on chronic diseases with a country visit to Lithuania. Sustainability EuroHealthNet is anticipating many policy follow-ups in 2016- 2017. Among them, emphasis will be on a new engagement with the proposed EU Pillar of Social Rights. The organisation will moreover work more closely on the social and health dimensions of the EU Semester processes, particularly helping stakeholders to implements CSRs and renew links with the revised strategic objectives of Europe 2020, particularly in favour of well-being, equity and sustainability. EuroHealthNet will also actively follow and support the newly adopted programmes of ESIF and other EU and national funding instruments that may be brought to bear to achieve policy objectives related to health and equity. EuroHealthNet is also planning to renew their involvement with EC strategic priorities, including health systems performance assessments, equity and access measures and the contribution of health and social systems to tackle unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. The interest and participation in demographic priorities, notably increased migration, ageing populations and gender equity, will be widened. Activities implemented \u2022 Development, monitoring and evaluation of initiatives undertaken towards the policy objectives of Europe 2020 Strategy and in particular the Social Investment Package (SIP), including contribution to the main EU-driven processes such as the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) on social protection and social inclusion and the European Semester; \u2022 Supporting stakeholders\u2019 involvement in the EU and national policy processes through information sharing and learning activities; \u2022 Strengthening the capacity of EuroHealthNet members to support the implementation of EU priorities; \u2022 Providing data and strong evidence base on policy developments and trends as well as collecting relevant information about citizens\u2019 concerns and good practices in the social policy field in the Member States, so as to contribute to better policymaking.

        "113 Eurochild is a network of organisations working with and for children throughout Europe, striving for a society that respects the rights of children. It advocates for children\u2019s rights and well-being to be at the heart of EU and national policymaking. The network influences policies, builds internal capacities, facilitates mutual learning and exchanges practice and research. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is the foundation of all Eurochild\u2019s work. Objectives The operating grant from the EaSI programme enabled Eurochild to deliver its strategic plan in 2015, which had five overarching goals: \u2022 putting the rights and well-being of children at the heart of policymaking; \u2022 building a community of professionals who integrate children\u2019s rights into their daily work; \u2022 giving a voice to children and young people; \u2022 changing the way society views and treats its children; and \u2022 building the network to be a powerful force for change. Overview of the key results In 2015, funding from the EaSI programme enabled Eurochild to support, influence and monitor EU-driven processes to improve outcomes for children at national and sub-national levels. The network has built the capacity of its members to fully exploit the opportunities offered through EU processes, including the Social OMC, the Recommendation on Investing in Children, the European Semester and the European Structural and Investment Funds at national level. During the period under review, Eurochild has strengthened internal governance and taken steps towards securing the long- term sustainability and independence of the network. The network has also harnessed the knowledge and expertise of its membership, facilitating exchange and learning. They have contributed to a stronger evidence base both on trends and the situation of children and their families in Europe, and what works in relation to improving children\u2019s well- being. In numbers, the network developed as many as 22 different reports and studies, organised two peer-learning events with 87 participants, 6 capacity-building actions with 155 participants and six conferences with 886 relevant stakeholders among over 45 other events. Policy evidence generated Key activities in 2015 in this area included Eurochild\u2019s work on the General Comment on better public spending by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; publishing the implementation handbook for the \u2018Investing in Children Alliance\u2019s Recommendation;\u2019 co-organising the Galway Winter School on \u2018realising children\u2019s rights through empowering parents, families and c ommunities\u2019 ; co-hosting with the Alliance for Childhood two meetings on Children Well- being indicators in the European Parliament; and the work Eurochild is undertaking with the OAK Foundation on building an economic case for investing in prevention and alternative care of children. One of the key message promoted by Eurochild during the year was that despite some encouraging developments \u2014 such as a very broad political support \u2014 overall children\u2019s rights did not progress very well on the EU agenda. There was no sign of preparing a successor to the EU agenda on the rights of the child, the CSRs were rather weak from the perspective of children\u2019s rights, and there seemed to be a tendency to narrow the focus to employment while neglecting social inclusion (including inclusion of children). At European Union level, Eurochild welcomed President Juncker\u2019s proposal on establishing a \u2018European Pillar of Social Rights.\u2019 Partnerships The strategic partnership of Eurochild with Directorate- Eurochild \u2018The strategic partnership of Eurochild with Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion proved to be a crucial enabler for European civil society engaged in promoting and protecting children\u2019s rights to better understand and engage in EU policy processes.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0483 EU contribution in euros: 874 754.48 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Non-governmental organisations; Higher education institutions and research institutes; Media; Children and young people; EU institutions.

        "114 General for Employment , Social Affairs and Inclusion proved to be a crucial enabler for European civil society engaged in promoting and protecting children\u2019s rights to better understand and engage in the EU policy processes. The Eurochild network made contributions to the EU policy debates by bringing the perspective of children. All EU policies, and in particular economic and employment policies, have a direct impact on the lives of families and children. The Eurochild network was able to translate the relevance of these policies to organisations working on the ground, and was able to bring evidence of what works to the EU policy and decision- makers. The European Commission\u2019s investment in Eurochild provided the network with a necessary degree of autonomy to establish internal ways of working that foster membership engagement and ownership. Eurochild appreciated the regular dialogue with colleagues in the European Commission, both through informal contacts and the strategic dialogue. Eurochild also aimed to make the link with EU processes led by other directorate-generals such as Directorate-General for Education, Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Affairs and Directorate-General for Justice. Potential good practice In 2015, Eurochild organised a Galway School on Child Rights in Practice and Research. This first edition of the Galway School, co-organised also by Unesco Chairs Global Network, the Council of Europe and Unicef Office of Research Innocenti, focused on family and parenting support in the context of realising children\u2019s rights, improving child well- being, alleviating child poverty and protecting children from violence including corporal punishment. Workshops and trainings during this three-day school revolved around four core themes: 1. Public investment: How to make the economic case for child-centred family and parenting support? 2. Integrated practice: How to get the best outcomes for children through integrating transfers and services in family and parenting support? 3. Evaluation methods: How to implement a pluralistic and rights-based approach in evaluating family and parenting support and make use of evaluations for advocacy purposes? 4. Best interest of the child: How to ensure respect for children\u2019s rights in family and parenting interventions targeted at children and families at risk? European added value The key added value of Eurochild\u2019s activities supported by the EU in the period under review came from its contribution to networking between organisations working in the field of children well-being in different countries (first and foremost its members). In 2015, Eurochild organised two meetings of Eurochild National Partner Networks and facilitated links between them and EC desk officers. In addition, the network co-organised 3 member- led events addressing links between national and EU policies. In addition, Eurochild contributed to three EU-level peer reviews relevant to child poverty and well-being. Sustainability Eurochild welcomed the European Pillar of Social Rights, a new initiative aimed to act as a framework to screen employment and social performance in the EU. The network acknowledged the positive impacts that sound social policies and social protection systems can have on making EU society and economy more resilient. In order to ensure that the Pillar will effectively protect and promote children\u2019s rights, Eurochild will work in the future to ensure that the Pillar: is underpinned by a child-rights approach; will be reference for all EU policy, legislative and funding activities; reinforces implementation of existing EU social policy instruments; supports efforts of EU Member States to develop inclusive and comprehensive policy responses; and puts a stronger emphasis on citizen and civil society engagement. In addition to this, over the next few years Eurochild will: \u2022 follow-up the Written Declaration on Investing in Children to translate this political commitment into concrete results for children; \u2022 Under the \u2018New Start\u2019 initiative aiming to address women\u2019s labour market participation and enable working families to better balance their caring and work responsibilities, Eurochild will advocate for a children\u2019s perspective, ensuring the initiative helps address child poverty and well-being; \u2022 under the new skills agenda for Europe, Eurochild will continue promoting investment in education and in particular high quality, inclusive early education and care services. Activities implemented \u2022 Advocacy and communications: Eurochild strengthened their communication capacities and reached out with key messages e.g. info graphics, scorecards on the EU presidencies, working with the intergroup on children\u2019s rights; \u2022 Policy development: Eurochild prepared policy positions and written contributions to consultations and peer reviews; \u2022 Members\u2019 engagement: Eurochild supported network members\u2019 engagement and built their capacity to engage in EU processes; \u2022 Knowledge building and exchange; \u2022 Strengthening partnerships: Eurochild engaged with several broader alliances to further collective advocacy towards common goals, e.g. Semester Alliance, EEG, the Social Platform.

        "115 The Microfinance Centre is a regional microfinance resource centre and network. It brings together 101 organisations (including 77 microfinance intermediaries \u2014 MFIs) in 31 countries of Central Europe and Asia, who serve over 1 million low-income clients. The Centre\u2019s mission is to contribute to poverty reduction and the development of human potential by promoting a socially-oriented and sustainable microfinance sector that provides adequate financial and non-financial services to a large number of poor families and micro- entrepreneurs. Objectives Made possible by EaSI co-funding, MFC\u2019s collaboration with the European Commission was designed to galvanise EU practitioners and policy-makers into action to ensure wider and deeper financial inclusion of all EU citizens. In particular, the idea was to increase awareness of the current policies and programmes existing in the EU that support improvements in providing finance to various excluded groups as well as encourage necessary amendments in legal and regulatory frameworks for inclusive finance. Another important aspect of the MFC\u2019s work in 2015 was to develop the capacity of MFC members and non-members active in overcoming barriers of access to finance and providing finance to micro-entrepreneurs and social enterprises. Finally, the MFC aimed to improve understanding of access to finance issues in the EU via development of special toolkits such as Access to Finance Ambassador toolkit and the EU Access to Finance Barometer. Key results The following can be mentioned among the key achievements of the MFC in 2015: \u2022 the establishment of cooperation with three organisations/international networks (EVPA, EFIN and CYFI) and continuing close collaboration with EMN on topics related to access to finance and over indebtedness; \u2022 representatives of 23 microfinance institutions in Bulgaria and Poland were able to learn in depth about EU Code of Good Conduct for Microcredit Provision. \u2022 important research and new hypotheses concerning job creation with implications for EU-level employment and job creation policy; \u2022 high-level and high-impact event organised in Brussels by MFC and EMN: the first European Microfinance Day attended by highest level EU officials with follow-up events in almost 20 EU countries. Policy evidence generated In 2015, MFC published various analytical outputs. For example, MFC conducted research on over-indebtedness and enterprise development in the EU that resulted in the publishing of two policy papers, which may influence EU enterprise development policy: \u2018Of Mice and Unemployed: Rethinking Micro-Enterprise and Small Business Policies in the EU\u2019 and \u2018Too Little or Too Much Credit: Small Business Indebtedness in the EU.\u2019 In addition, the topic of youth unemployment was addressed through a special workshop organised during the MFC annual conference on 5-6 November 2015. The panel explored the business case for youth and microfinance. Two microfinance institutions presented their practical experience in working with youth. Key messages promoted by the MFC through the evidence base generated in 2015 are as follows: \u2022 Job creation policy may require different tools rather than en masse support for enterprise creation. Job destructions should also be considered when deciding on the right mix of support tools. Support to non- entrepreneurial self-employment is questionable. \u2022 Over-indebtedness of micro, small and medium enterprise should be monitored. \u2022 Microfinance should be more pro-active in promoting and supporting social enterprises. \u2022 The role of microfinance in supporting immigrants should be discussed in particular in the broader context of good practices in creating job opportunities for refugees; Microfinance Centre (MFC) \u2018Made possible by EaSI co-funding, MFC\u2019s collaboration with the European Commission was designed to galvanise EU practitioners and policy-makers into action to ensure wider and deeper financial inclusion of all EU citizens.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0514 EU contribution in euros: 179 628.69 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Non-governmental organisations; Media; Microfinance institutions and financial cooperatives.

        "116 \u2022 Cooperative principles in microfinance should be promoted. Partnerships In 2015, The MFC significantly increased collaboration with other international organisations and networks. The Microfinance Centre and the European Microfinance Network (EMN) kicked off the implementation of a joint programme envisaged by the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2014. As a result, the first Microfinance Day in Brussels was organised jointly in October 2015. Both networks prepared a policy note \u2018Feedback on the implementation of the EaSI technical assistance programme,\u2019 which was distributed to Commission and European Investment Bank (EIB) representatives in January 2016. The policy note \u2018Microfinance response to refugees\u2019 crises\u2019 was also developed as a result and submitted to EIB. The MFC has also signed an MOU with Child and Youth Finance International, which provides for sharing information, promoting each other\u2019s activities and collaboration on several activities. In addition, the MFC initiated cooperation with the European Venture Philanthropy Association (EVPA). MFC\u2019s representatives participated in an EVPA-led workshop on social entrepreneurship at the MFC conference in Prague. MFC\u2019s cooperation with the EMN and EVPA is also a potential good practice example of how EaSI support can help build strong alliances between key organisations in specific policy areas (in this case, microfinance and social investment). European added value The EU value added was achieved by the MFC in two main ways. First, the MFC represents an added value for the EU through fostering networking and exchange of good practices among organisations from different EU countries. Second, it adds value by promoting and supporting the implementation of EU-level instruments and policies in the area of microfinance. The MFC facilitated the organisation of workshops in Sofia and Warsaw for representatives of Bulgarian and Polish microfinance practitioners to discuss the implications and requirements of the European Code of Conduct for Microcredit Provision. Workshop participants\u2019 understanding of the Code of Conduct requirements has increased although capacity building is still needed to ensure compliance with the Code. Off-site support was also provided to three microfinance institutions to help them better understand the EU Code of Conduct and improve their practices. Sustainability: The following activities are planned for the future to sustain the achieved results and to build on them: \u2022 coming-up with a more specific proposal for the EU definition of microcredit and discussing it with EU officials, in particular highlighting the possible negative consequences of expanding the microcredit definition to include so-called personal loans; \u2022 discussing with the Commission the MFC and EMN recommendations concerning involvement of the industry stakeholders in the design, implementation and management of the access to finance support programmes; \u2022 discussing with the Commission how to strengthen microcredit promotions in specific EU countries so that new linkages emerge among government SME support programmes and microfinance institutions; \u2022 recommending to the Commission the provision of subsidy for the non-financial services offered to microfinance beneficiaries; \u2022 as far as EU job creation policy is concerned, presenting the results of the MFC research on the right type of enterprises to support and discuss the findings and ramifications with the Commission; \u2022 discussing the usefulness of separating the financial inclusion services from enterprise development services; \u2022 discussing with other stakeholders the creation of a good practices database in support of immigrants; \u2022 continue discussions about improving the legal and regulatory framework for microfinance in Greece and other EU countries; \u2022 initiating a discussion with the Commission on the further evolution of the EU Code of Conduct. Activities implemented \u2022 Supporting the Commission in its outreach activities at EU, national and local level with the aim of ensuring the implementation of European policies in the relevant area (e.g. Programme for Employment and Social Innovation, European Social Fund, Social Business Initiative etc.); \u2022 Reinforcing the capacity of the network\u2019s members, including through offering a platform for the exchange of good practices in the relevant field, and raising awareness on relevant EU policies; \u2022 Voicing the concerns and expectations of organisations facilitating access to finance to (potential) entrepreneurs from disadvantaged and under-represented groups/social enterprises; \u2022 Providing data/research on developments in the field and on priority topics.

        "117 The European Microfinance Network (EMN) promotes microfinance in the European Union, and thus contributes to the fight against social and financial exclusion in Europe. The EMN has been active since 2003 in supporting microenterprises and self-employment in a number of ways: through activities of its members, lobbying activities at EU level and raising awareness of the need to build European legislative and regulatory frameworks that foster a sound microfinance market. Socioeconomic context The impacts of the social and economic crisis in Europe and the long-term EU objectives for micro-enterprise development and for reducing poverty make microfinance a key tool for the future. The European Union has understood the potential of microfinance in relation to the Social Investment Package (SIP) and the implementation of the Europe 2020 agenda, and has started to translate this recognition into crucial financial and regulatory initiatives. Nevertheless, coverage of microfinance in Europe is uneven; in addition, it is provided by institutions that are very diverse and mostly very small. Objectives In the context described above, in 2015 the EMN aimed at strengthening the entire EU microfinance sector in order to increase the number of European citizens with access to adequate financial instruments, so that they are able to create, develop and sustain their economic activities as well as better respond to future shocks. To contribute to the above, the key specific objectives of EMN in 2015 were to: \u2022 activate networking opportunities linked to EU microfinance, financial and social inclusion and social entrepreneurship; \u2022 influence key policies supporting microfinance at EU and national levels; \u2022 support the implementation of EU programmes contributing to the development of sustainable microcredit providers active in the EU; \u2022 reinforce the role of EMN as the leading network of the microfinance sector in the EU, increase the involvement of its members and strengthen their capacities; \u2022 widen the sector\u2019s perspective and boost the European microfinance marketplace; \u2022 raise awareness on the social and environmental impact of microfinance; \u2022 enable sharing of knowledge on the potential of microfinance to address the multiple financial needs of underserved and vulnerable groups. Key results in 2015: In the year under review, the EMN approved its new organisational strategy, which included a new EMN mission and vision, membership definition, organisation activities and impact. The document was approved on the occasion of the EMN General Assembly. The EMN held its 12th annual conference on 18-19 June in Dublin on the topic \u2018Microfinance and banks: Are we the right partners?\u2019. As many as 250 participants from 18 countries took part in the event. The conference offered a wide range of innovative sessions, workshops and interactive debates. The first European Microfinance Day was celebrated on 20 October 2015 with the title \u2018What if we turn jobseekers into job creators?\u2019 The event aimed to increase the visibility of the sector at European and national level. In Brussels, more than 200 participants attended the opening session and the workshop on Regulations for Microfinance in the EU. In parallel, 20 local actions in the form of events, workshops and debates took place in 16 European countries organised by 27 EMN members. Producing policy evidence The previous EMN Working Groups, which for many years enhanced the knowledge transfer and collaboration process among the network\u2019s members, were developed into more flexible and practical groups. Two think tanks and four idea- European Microfinance Network (EMN) \u2018A strong aspect of the added value of the EMN\u2019s work was that the network promoted among its members and other stakeholders best practice examples learned from previous EU/national actions.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0516 EU contribution in euros: 413 708.62 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion Target groups: Microfinance Providers: non-banking financial institutions and banks; National, regional and local authorities; Social partners; Non-governmental organisations; Higher education institutions and research institutes; Experts in evaluation and in impact assessment; Media.

        "118 labs actively worked in 2015 on topics such as: International Cooperation, Social Performance Management, Credit Scoring, Research, Advocacy at national level and the preparation of the EMN annual conference. The research paper on \u2018Microfinance Institutions and Banks in Europe: The story to date\u2019 was published during the year and served to frame the discussions within the annual conference. Partnerships In 2015, the EMN actively promoted partnerships between members of the network, for example, through organising exchange visits. An exchange visit was organised in February 2015 in the Netherlands around the experience of Qredits and focused on online business tools, outreach, mentoring of volunteers and credit risk. Altogether 19 EMN members actively participated in the event. In addition, peer-to-peer visits between members were supported. Partnership between EMN and EU institutions was consolidated thanks to continuous communication with the main directorate-generals from the Commission related to the action. European added value A strong aspect of the added value of the EMN\u2019s work was that the network promoted among its members and other stakeholders best practice examples learned from previous EU/national actions. EMN organised a number of workshops in 2015, which allowed for sharing best practices enabled by the previous or current EU funding programmes. For example, a workshop on the new EaSI Guarantee instrument was implemented in collaboration with the Microfinance Centre in Brussels on 21 April 2015. The aim of the workshop was to offer a technical session about the procedures for application to the new EaSI Guarantee. Presentations from the Commission and EIF on the new instrument (its characteristics, eligibility pre-conditions, timeline, etc.) were followed by an exchange of best practices from microStart and Qredits, who shared their extensive experience on applying for previous guarantee products. A webinar on \u2018Good Practice in Social Performance Management\u2019 was set up in collaboration with EMN member Mi-Bospo from Bosnia and Herzegovina, who was identified as a Champion/Good Practice in Social Performance Management by the EMN Working Paper \u2018European microfinance and social performance: where do we stand?\u2019 published in 2014. In addition, 15 good practices have been collected and disseminated via the EMN website, newsletter and social media. Finally, in partnership with Fondazione Giordano Dell\u2019Amore, EMN organised the Good Practices Award during the annual conference of the network (Dublin, 18-19 June). Three videos from the different experiences of the three selected MFIs were presented. These videos, made by FGDA in collaboration with EMN, were screened to promote and disseminate the good practices among the participants of the EMN annual conference. Activities implemented \u2022 Regular meetings with EU institutions; \u2022 Active participation in EU events and on microfinance, financial and social inclusion and social entrepreneurship; \u2022 Implementing joint actions with peer networks and members of the network; \u2022 Publishing regular updates on related EU initiatives and policies in the field of microfinance; \u2022 Supporting the implementation of EU programmes to enhance sustainable microcredit providers active in the EU; \u2022 Organising workshops to build the technical capacities of the European MFIs and raise awareness on key EU initiatives; \u2022 Building capacities of members, extending membership; \u2022 Raising awareness on the social and environmental impact of microfinance; \u2022 Producing and disseminating evidence.

        "119 EPR is a network of service providers to people with disabilities committed to achieving impact through mutual learning exchanges. The ultimate goal of the network is to assist its member organisations to achieve continuous professional improvement, best practice and sustainable growth in every aspect of service delivery to people with disabilities and other disadvantages. Objectives In 2015, EPR encouraged active involvement of its members in the formulation and implementation of the National Reform Programmes by training their staff on the European Semester mechanism, fostering participation in national consultations and data gathering, and helping them to pilot innovative services in response to policy recommendations. EPR also supported collaboration between stakeholders in the processes of policy definition and implementation at EU and national level. Meanwhile, externally, EPR sought new members in non-covered countries, especially in new EU countries. Transferability In 2015, EPR organised numerous events that contributed to transferring practices among the stakeholders in the field. For example, EPR organised a number of benchmarking/bench- learning activities for its members. A benchmarking group on vocational rehabilitation focused on the implementation of a methodology to measure service outcomes. The group met online on 11 June 2015 to report on the work carried out since 2014 by their own organisations and, in some cases, at national level. The group met again in Brussels on 18 November 2015 to review the benchmarks of the group and draw conclusions on successes and areas for improvement in service delivery. The work was sustained beyond 2015. Policy evidence generated Among other analytical outputs, EPR drafted a comparative study on the theme of mainstreamed services. The European Platform for Rehabilitation (EPR) \u2018In 2015, EPR further enhanced its e-learning platform, which consists of compiled information and learning materials, thematic communities with moderated fora, e-seminars and modules.\u2019 comparative study was a process which started with the setting up of a central expert team, for which notably external experts from the Academic Network of European Disability experts (ANED) were asked to contribute. 13 EPR members completed templates that were then compiled and analysed by the central research team. This study presented evidence on trends and good practices in service provision, and provided a number of clear policy and practice recommendations. It is a useful resource for service providers, for disability communities and for policy-makers, supporting the dissemination of good practice, providing comparable data and evidence for policy developments. Dissemination All analytical outputs have been widely disseminated to authorities through EPR communication channels at three different levels: organisational, national and European level. A broader audience was reached through the publication of all analytical outputs on the EPR website, LinkedIn page and on partners\u2019 newsletters or websites (e.g. Social Services Europe and Social Platform). The seven conferences organised in 2015 drew over 450 participants. Partnerships In 2015, the secretariat of EPR enhanced its structural collaboration with other European providers of social services within the Social Services Europe network, by continuing to run the established four \u2018thematic stakeholder committees\u2019 and wide cooperation in public affairs activities and at the annual public affairs event. Innovativeness Three EPR member organisations (two from Ireland and one from Spain) met online on 16 July 2015 to identify an innovative practice of common interest to be piloted. They agreed to focus on the development of \u2018peer support\u2019 training programmes for users in mental health services, based on the experience of Intras (EPR member from Spain) in Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0487 EU contribution in euros: 100 000.00 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Employment services; Non-governmental organisations; Higher education institutions and research institutes; Service users and advocates; Professionals from NGO and public service providers; Employers/Companies.

        "120 the framework of an EU-funded project called \u2018Peer2peer\u2019. Members met for the second time in Dublin on 5 November 2015 in the margins of the national awareness raising and training event, where they reviewed progress in the implementation of such peer support training programmes. Users trained to be peer support workers obtained a formal qualification. Potential good practice In 2015, EPR further enhanced its e-learning platform, which consists of compiled information and learning materials, thematic communities with moderated fora, e-seminars and modules. It is structured around several key thematic expertise areas. The e-learning module created in 2015 dealt with \u2018Positive mental health\u2019 and aimed at providing basic understanding to the general public about the definition and importance of mental health, the basic mechanisms, personal and environmental factors that influence mental health, and its relation with mental illness. The video lecture was produced as the first part of a series of online resources on the theme of mental health, with the view to build sustainable and comprehensive capacity in EPR membership and awareness of related issues beyond EPR membership. Results are easily accessible material for anyone to improve their understanding of the topic. European added value EPR delivered training and services to its members on relevant EU policy issues to increase their capacity to inform and influence policymaking, as well as on relevant EU funding opportunities. The capacity and knowledge of the network was enhanced through EPR\u2019s e-knowledge and e-learning platform. These instruments will be improved with new learning materials, and the new learning methodologies initiated in 2013 will be strengthened. EPR also encouraged active involvement of its members in the formulation and implementation of NRPs and offered them (and the general public) an online information platform. A comprehensive briefing paper was also developed on EU employment policy and an online webinar introduced the paper for discussion as well as a briefing note on EU initiatives on VET. Finally, the action resulted in a better identification of the needs of different target groups, and more effective responses to the diverse needs that already exist, the exchange of best practices across Europe and strategies to allow for an up- scaling and continued transnational transfer of effective approaches. Sustainability The recommendations on policy and practice from the study on mainstreamed services (see above) and the European Semester work will feed into EPR\u2019s response to the review of the EU Disability Strategy, as well as meetings with the European Commission. The recommendations on mainstreaming will also feature in the e-module to be developed in 2016 on the topic. Issues raised regarding mainstreamed services will be explored with EU-level stakeholders working on community- based services and de-institutionalisation, specifically through contacts with the European Expert Group and setting up a stakeholder Committee with key partners in 2016. EPR will continue to engage members in the EU employment- related initiatives and their implementation at national level, and advocate for the role of services providers in VET and labour market integration to be recognised and their perspectives to be taken into account. EPR will feed findings from its European Semester work into joint positions with Social Services Europe. Activities implemented \u2022 Encouraging active involvement of EPR members in the European Semester and other social policy initiatives by training their staff; \u2022 Involving stakeholders in the process of policy definition and implementation at European and national level; \u2022 Drafting a comparative study on the theme of mainstreamed services; \u2022 Promoting mutual learning and transferring best practices within the EPR network.

        "121 Socioeconomic context Europe\u2019s overall increase in life expectancy and the ageing population generate a growing incidence of age-related diseases and demand for care. In Europe, 80 % of all care is provided by informal carers \u2014 i.e. people who provide unpaid care to someone with a chronic illness, disability or other long-lasting health or care need, outside of a professional or formal framework. The contribution of these carers constitutes a great resource for society but their role is not always recognised. Delivering a wide range of support services such as personal care, housekeeping, transportation, care and financial management as well as emotional support, carers often offer the most comprehensive and desirable option for people in need of care. Eurocarers is the European network representing informal carers and their organisations, irrespective of the particular age or health need of the person they are caring for. In 2015, the network aimed to advance the following objectives : \u2022 to promote the societal integration and recognition of informal carers throughout the European Union; \u2022 to contribute towards better, evidence-based policymaking in regard to carers throughout the European Union; \u2022 to promote the adoption of a comprehensive EU Carers Strategy; \u2022 to support stakeholder involvement in issues affecting informal carers throughout the EU policy process; \u2022 to cooperate with other civil society and social partnership organisations around issues affecting informal carers; \u2022 to support informal carers in their daily role by helping to implement EU-driven initiatives into practice at national/ local level; and \u2022 to develop Eurocarers as an effective EU-level NGO network based on a federal organisational structure anchored in the principle of subsidiarity. Key results In 2015, Eurocarers implemented a number of actions to strengthen the operations of the organisation itself. New Standard Operating Procedures were developed including: a new procurement and purchasing policy, revisited ethical guidelines, new sponsorship/partnership options with the Eurocarers network, screening templates for Eurocarers\u2019 participation in project proposals, new financial guidelines for participants of Eurocarers activities (including procedure for expense claims), approval of a completely new membership fee policy and network development strategy at the Annual General Assembly 2015, which was held in Gothenburg on 3 September 2015. In addition, in the period under review, Eurocarers focused considerable efforts on organising various workshops and events for their members. For example, the International Carers Conference was co-hosted by Eurocarers and held in Gothenburg together with the General Assembly from 3-6 September 2015 on the topic \u2018Care and Caring: Future proofing the new demographics\u2019. In addition, a briefing seminar was organised with a focus on the EU Semester and the Social Investment Package (SIP), the SPC report on adequate protection for long-term care needs in an ageing society, the EIPAHA and Horizon 2020. Producing policy evidence In 2015, the Eurocarers Research Working Group (ERWG) was formed as a result of the mapping exercise on the research activities and expertise of Eurocarers members. In addition, the Eurocarers produced briefings on the EU Semester and the SIP as well as the annual report for 2015, among a total of 16 reports developed during the year. The key messages followed from the Eurocarers analytical work in 2015: \u2022 There are economic opportunity costs for both carers and society. Informal carers, and especially women, have Eurocarers \u2014 European Association Working for Carers \u2018Eurocarers will keep supporting the European Commission in its efforts to create a political environment that is favourable for sustainable, equitable and quality long-term care services and where carers are recognised and supported.\u2019 Call identification number: VP/2014/009 Project duration: 1 January 2015\u201331 December 2015 Grant identification number: VS/2014/0500 EU contribution in euros: 288 595.00 Policy area: Social protection and social inclusion Target groups: National, regional and local authorities; Specialist bodies provided for under Union law; Non- governmental organisations; Higher education institutions and research institutes; Media; Informal carers themselves.

        "122 been found to be at higher risk of poverty, reflecting a weaker attachment to the labour force and hence the accrual of lower pension entitlements. Young carers may (have to) miss out on education and training as a consequence of providing care to a parent or sibling. \u2022 There can be costs to the health and well-being of family carers themselves. Informal carers can be under considerable stress as they try to balance work and family duties, and most have received no training in caring for the elderly. \u2022 Countries which rely predominantly on informal carers are likely to find it significantly more difficult to guarantee equality of access to care, because not all needy people have family members able or willing to be carers. Innovativeness In 2015, the organisation launched two online platforms providing practical toolkits on caring, information about carers\u2019 rights and ICT-based solutions for caregivers. Dissemination Eurocarers\u2019 communication strategy was implemented through their main website (www.eurocarers.org), bi- monthly newsletter and position papers. They can also rely on a database of more than 3 000 relevant contacts to disseminate relevant information about carers\u2019 added value and needs. The network organised 10 peer learning events in 2015 for 313 participants, and 10 conferences and seminars attracting over 300 stakeholders. Moreover, Eurocarers in this year put on nine capacity-building events impacting 150 relevant stakeholders and 10 networking meetings drawing over 300 experts. European added value EaSI is the main funding source of Eurocarers. Therefore, a clear European value added comes from the fact that, in the absence of the EU funding, Eurocarers\u2019 activities would have to be strongly limited. The EaSI funding ensures economies of scale and efficient use of money, leading to better services for citizens due to the work of Eurocarers.

        "123 Afterword This report provided a review of projects funded by the predecessor instruments PROGRESS and EURES as well as activities of the EaSI-supported major EU-level organisations (networks of NGOs) promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and access to finance for vulnerable groups of society and social entrepreneurs. A total of 49 project/organisation fiches, which can be read as stand-alone documents, were produced by the research team and are presented in the report. Analysing and disseminating information about the results of supported projects and organisations forms part of the performance monitoring of the EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation 2014-2020. The programme\u2019s monitoring approach foresees biannual reports presenting examples of projects and organisations supported by EaSI and its predecessor programmes EURES and PROGRESS. This is the fifth such report. It follows the first four issued in 2014-2016. At least three more such reports are planned for by 2017. It is expected that this report will be beneficial to public authorities of the Member States, civil society organisations and private actors in at least two ways. First, it will serve as guidance for public, private and civil society actors wishing to apply for EU funding in the future. Second, it will provide policy-makers with ideas that can inform the design and implementation of new policy interventions in the covered policy areas. In addition to these key aims of the report, the research team will use its results in further monitoring activities. In particular, the developed project/organisation fiches will feed into preparing the EaSI Performance Monitoring Report for 2015-2016. Finally, the report team believes that the results will be useful for the evaluators of the programme. ",
