        "INTRODUCTION 1. The European Training Foundation (hereinafter \u2018the Foun\u00ad dation\u2019), located in Turin, was created by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90 ( 1 ). The Foundation\u2019s purpose is to support the reform of vocational training in the European Union\u2019s partner countries. As such, it assists the Commission in the implementation of various programmes (Phare, Tacis, CARDS and MEDA) ( 2 ). 2. The Foundation\u2019s 2008 budget amounted to 22,4 million euro compared with 21,1 million euro the previous year. The number of staff employed by the Foundation at the end of the year was 124 as compared with 131 the previous year. STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE 3. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 248 of the Treaty the Court has audited the annual accounts ( 3 ) of the Foun\u00ad dation, which comprise the \u2018financial statements\u2019 ( 4 ) and the \u2018reports on implementation of the budget\u2019 ( 5 ) for the financial year ended 31 December 2008 and the legality and regu\u00ad larity of the transactions underlying those accounts. 4. This Statement of Assurance is addressed to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 185(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 ( 6 ). The Director\u2019s responsibility 5. As authorising officer, the Director implements the revenue and expenditure of the budget in accordance with the financial rules of the Foundation under her own respon\u00ad sibility and within the limits of authorised appropriations ( 7 ). The Director is responsible for putting in place ( 8 ) the organisational structure and the internal management and control systems and proceduresre levant for drawing up final accounts ( 9 ) that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and for ensuring that the transactions underlying those accounts are legal and regular. The Court\u2019s responsibility 6. The Court\u2019s responsibility is to provide, on the basis of its audit, a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the annual accounts of the Foundation and the legality and regu\u00ad larity of the transactions underlying them. 7. The Court conducted its audit in accordance with the IFAC and ISSAI ( 10 ) International Auditing Standards and Codes of Ethics. Those standards require that the Court complies with ethical requirements and plans and performs the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the accounts are free from material misstatement and whether the underlying transactions are legal and regular. 8. The Court\u2019s audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and about the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying them. The procedures selected depend on its audit judgement including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the accounts or of illegal or irregular transactions, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments internal control relevant to the entity\u2019s preparation and presentation of accounts is considered in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. The Court\u2019s audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and, the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the accounts. 9. The Court believes that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for the opinions set out below.

        "Opinion on the reliability of the accounts 10. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the Foundation\u2019s Annual Accounts ( 11 ) present fairly, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 December 2008 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its Financial Regulation. Opinion on the legality and the regularity of the trans\u00ad actions underlying the accounts 11. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the Foundation for the financial year ended 31 December 2008 are, in all material respects, legal and regular. 12. The comments which follow do not call the Court\u2019s opinions into question. COMMENTS ON THE BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 13. The audited recruitment procedures showed various shortcomings. The overall reports prepared by the Recruitment Assessment Boards do not provide sufficient information on the procedures followed. Justifications for decisions and the dates of the same were omitted, rendering it difficult to assess the regu\u00ad larity of these procedures and hampering the transparency of the procedures. 14. In at least two cases, agents entitled to receive the expa\u00ad triation allowance ( 12 ) were denied this allowance on the basis of an incorrect interpretation of the rules in force. The Foun\u00ad dation should correct these cases and perform the necessary verifications in order to be fully assured that other agents are not in a similar situation. This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at its meeting of 8 October 2009. For the Court of Auditors V\u00edtor Manuel da SILVA CALDEIRA President EN C 304/138 Official Journal of the European Union 15.12.2009 ( 11 ) The Final Annual Accounts were drawn up on 15 June 2009 and received by the Court on 30 June 2009. The Final Annual Accounts, consolidated with those of the Commission are published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 15 November of the following year. These can be found on the following website http://eca.europa.eu or http://www.etf.europa.eu/ Archive ( 12 ) They are non-Italian nationals and arrived in Italy during the period of reference defined to determine the right to the expatriation allowance.
