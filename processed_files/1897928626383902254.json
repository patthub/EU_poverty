        "It is my great pleasure to present the 17 new EU- supported civil society projects starting in Azerbaijan in 2012. They cover a wide range of areas, from creating opportunities for disabled children or the blind, to providing independent media coverage, supporting the activities of civil rights campaigners, or raising awareness on the need to protect the environment. The combined EUcontributiontotheseprojectsis\u20ac2.6million. This is in addition to the over \u20ac4.7 million that the EU has already provided in Azerbaijan since 2007. This makes the EU the largest foreign donor to civil society in Azerbaijan, something that we are proudof. Mostimmediately,thisfundingisaboutproviding assistance. An active and engaged civil society is the most effective vector to address and resolve key issues in innovative, practical and effective ways. In a longer term perspective, however, our funding is about partnership. True, effective systemic change is only achieved via close cooperation between government and a legitimate, independent and vivid civil society, which raises key issues, proposes ideas and actively monitors and reports on progress. The long term vision of EU support to civil society is to promotingcivilsocietyasexactlysuchapartner. Thebeliefofthispartnershipisclearlyreflectedin EU relations with the Government of Azerbaijan, wherecooperationwithcivilsocietyformsabasis of all the cooperation frameworks that the Government of Azerbaijan has committed to, from the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed in 1999 to the Eastern Partnership,in2009. Of course, EU cooperation with Azerbaijani civil society goes beyond just providing funding. Civil Society is an invaluable partner for us, either through consultations on a regular basis at the level of the EU Delegation in Baku, but also at the regional level, at venues such as the Civil Society ForumoftheEasternPartnership. Havingsaidthis,anyfinancialsupportcomeswith a responsibility to ensure that EU funds are well spent, in full transparency and accountability. Interventions must have the widest possible impact in areas relevant to the Azerbaijani population. Thisisagoalwehaveworkedhardtoachievewith these 17 new projects, and I invite you to look throughthispublicationtonotonlyfindoutmore about the projects we are financing, but also how we selected them, what we are trying to achieve, andhowyoucanworkwithus. In 2012 we are planning to continue our support, and to expand it even further with the launch of new calls for proposals and new initiatives that will benefit even more of the Azerbaijani population. We look forward to working with you on these currentandonfutureefforts. EU Ambassador to the Republic of Azerbaijan Roland Kobia Salam, Welcome 33 ",
