        "4 How do we build a stronger, more united Europe? The views of young people March 2019 Report Flash Eurobarometer 478 INTRODUCTION The EU youth policy cooperation aims to address the challenges that young people are facing all over Europe, promote action to be taken in response to these challenges at EU level, and complement the efforts and initiatives of Member States. Member States recognise that some common challenges can be better addressed at the EU level rather than by individual Member States, and as a result a dedicated EU Youth Policy cooperation based on the principles of active participation and equal access to opportunities has been running since 2002 1 . The views of young people are important in shaping EU youth policy, and they contribute to it by sharing their aspirations and needs and by employing their creativity and talents. In that context, during 2017 and 2018, young people from all over Europe were involved in a pan-European dialogue with decision-makers with a view to developing 11 European Youth Goals. These goals include connecting the EU with youth, youth organisations, and European programmes and quality learning 2 . These goals informed the development of the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027 3 , with three key areas of action: \u00a7 ENGAGE: Fostering youth participation in democratic life; \u00a7 CONNECT: Bringing young people together across the EU and beyond to foster voluntary engagement, learning mobility, solidarity and intercultural understanding; \u00a7 EMPOWER: Supporting youth empowerment through quality, innovation and recognition of youth work. In parallel to the EU Youth Strategy, the EU has established a strategic framework for policy cooperation in education and training 4 (ET 2020), which allows Member States to exchange and build best practices, to improve the quality and efficiency of education and training and to make lifelong learning mobility a reality. The EU supports and amplifies its policy aspiration by offering concrete opportunities for learning mobility under programmes such as Erasmus+ and the European Solidarity Corps. In May 2018 the European Commission adopted its proposals for the next iteration of the successful Erasmus programme and the new European Solidarity Corps to run from 2021 to 2027. The Erasmus programme already enables millions of young Europeans to study, train or learn abroad while broadening their experience and awareness of Europe. The next programme will build on this success, extending its reach, increasing the budget and working to reach people from all social backgrounds 5 . The European Solidarity Corps will broaden its outreach by including volunteering, youth-led solidarity projects, traineeships and jobs 6 . Young people also have different priorities than the general public opinion (aged 15 years and more) when it comes to the ideal future European Union. In the 2018 Future of Europe Eurobarometer study 7 , the three most mentioned areas across all respondents for the ideal future for the EU are equal wages for the same job across the European Union (38%), a minimum level of guaranteed healthcare in all countries of the European Union and a high level of security within the European Union (both 32%). However, the priorities for young people aged 15-24 are quite different. Their top three ideas for the future of Europe are fair and equal access to education for all across the European Union (42%), gender equality established everywhere in the European Union and equal wages for the same job across the European Union (both 36%). 1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0269 2 https://ec.europa.eu/youth/policy/youth-strategy/youthgoals_en 3 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2018:456:FULL 4 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52009XG0528(01) 5 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/news/commission-adopts-proposal-next-erasmus-programme-2021-2027_en 6 http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14079-2018-INIT/en/pdf 7 http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/survey/getsurveydetail/instruments/special/surveyky/2217 ",
        "5 How do we build a stronger, more united Europe? The views of young people March 2019 Report Flash Eurobarometer 478 The current study, commissioned by European Commission Directorate General for Education and Culture provides a deeper exploration of the attitudes and opinions of young people aged 15-30. It covers: \u00a7 The proportion of respondents who have been abroad for learning experiences, and the reasons why respondents have not participated in learning experiences in other countries; \u00a7 Young respondents\u2019 participation in social, civic and political activities, including organised voluntary activities, as well as reasons for not participating in these activities; \u00a7 Opinions about the most important things schools should offer young people, and the topic areas that are not taught sufficiently in schools; \u00a7 Young respondents\u2019 views about the priorities for the EU in years to come; \u00a7 The most useful actions for young people the EU could support. Between 18th and 28th March 2019, 10,786 respondents aged 15 to 30 from different social and demographic groups in 28 EU countries were interviewed via telephone 3 (mobile and fixed line) in their mother tongue on behalf of the Directorate-General for Communication (DG COMM). The sample was 400 interviews per country except Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta where the sample size was 250 interviews. The methodology used is that of Flash Eurobarometer surveys as carried out by the Directorate-General for Communication (\u201cMedia Monitoring and Eurobarometer\u201d Unit) 8 . A technical note on the manner in which interviews were conducted by the Institutes within the TNS Political & Social network is annexed to this report.

        "6 How do we build a stronger, more united Europe? The views of young people March 2019 Report Flash Eurobarometer 478 MAIN FINDINGS Young people believe that protecting the environment and fighting climate change should be a priority for the EU in the years to come \u00a7 The five most mentioned priorities for the European Union in years to come according to young people are protecting the environment and fighting climate change (67%), improving education and training (56%), fighting poverty and economic and social inequalities ( 56%), boosting employment (49%) and improving health and well-being (44%). \u2022 In 18 countries, young respondents most often say protecting the environment and fighting climate change should be a priority for the EU in years to come, while in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom this topic is equally mentioned alongside improving education and training. Improving education and training, fighting poverty and economic and social inequalities, boosting employment and tackling unemployment and improving health and well-being are the most mentioned topic in two countries. \u2022 Gender, age, level of education and employment all influence the importance young people place on each of these areas. Regarding the EU\u2019s actions in the area of education and training, young people see efforts to connect schools or universities with others abroad as most useful \u00a7 Considering the competences of the EU, in the area of education and training the most useful actions for young people would be connecting schools or universities in their country with others abroad (44%), funding projects or activities for young people (41%) and increasing participation in European programmes among young people with fewer opportunities, for instance in rural areas (39%). \u00a7 At a country level, the most mentioned areas are connecting schools or universities in their country with others abroad (14 countries), funding projects or activities for young people (9 countries) and increasing participation in European programmes among young people with fewer opportunities (6 countries). Young Europeans are actively engaged. Three quarters have been involved in some form of organised movement. More than seven in ten young respondents have voted in local, national or European elections while one third have been involved in organised voluntary activities in the last 12 months \u00a7 77% of young people took part in activities of political movements, parties or unions; student or youth organisations; campaigns, strikes or street protests; volunteering activities or local community projects, \u00a7 The three most common social, political and civic activities young respondents have taken part in are voting in local, national or European elections (72%), getting information on current issues on social media (65%) or volunteering activities or local community projects (58%). \u00a7 Voting is the most mentioned activity in 23 countries. ",
        "7 How do we build a stronger, more united Europe? The views of young people March 2019 Report Flash Eurobarometer 478 \u00a7 By far the most common reason for not participating in organised movements or associations 9 is a lack of time (49%). More than one third (36%) say they are not interested, while 26% say they do not think these activities change anything. \u00a7 One third (33%) of all respondents have been involved in organised voluntary activities in the last 12 months, a slight increase (+3 pp) since 2017 but a sharp increase since 2011 (+ 9pp) 10 . Young people expect schools to prepare them for employment and to think critically. They consider the main shortcomings of schools currently to be not dedicating enough attention to entrepreneurship and financial competences; and climate change, environment and eco-friendly behaviours. \u00a7 Respondents say that the most important things school should offer young people are preparing them for employment (49%), giving everyone a chance to succeed and have access to the same opportunities (45%) and promoting creativity, adaptability and an entrepreneurial mindset (38%). \u00a7 In 14 countries, young respondents most often say the most important thing schools should offer young people is to prepare them for employment. In seven countries respondents most often mention giving everyone a chance to succeed and have access to the same opportunities. \u00a7 The topics respondents most often say are not being taught sufficiently in schools are critical thinking, media and democracy (42%); climate change, environment and eco-friendly behaviours (41%) and entrepreneurship and financial competences (41%). Almost one third of young respondents have spent at least two weeks abroad for learning experiences. Of those who did not stay abroad more than half considered such an experience. The main reasons why they did not take part are lack of financial means and family, personal or work-related factors. \u00a7 Amongst respondents who have not stayed abroad for learning experiences but have considered doing so, lack of financial means (42%) is the main reason for not doing so, closely followed by family, personal or work-related reasons (41%) \u00a7 Almost one in five (19%) say there was a lack of information how to apply, or that they had insufficient language skills. For respondents who had never considered going abroad for studies, training, work, exchanges or volunteering, a lack of interest (45%) is by far the most common reason for not considering these experiences. Three in ten (30%) say it would not have been possible because of their work or studies, 25% say it would not have been possible because of their family situation, and 22% say they did not feel comfortable living in a foreign country. 9 Political movements, parties or unions; student or youth organisations; campaigns, strikes or street protests; volunteering activities or local community projects. 10 Flash Eurobarometer 466: http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/instruments/FLASH/ surveyKy/2186 ",

YOUNG PEOPLE\u2019S VIEWS ON EU PRIORITIES This first section of the report considers young respondents views on the topics that should be a priority for the EU, as well as actions the EU could take to support young people. 1 Priorities of the EU Young people consider that protecting the environment and fighting climate change, along with education and training; and fighting poverty and social inequalities should be the top priorities for the EU in the years to come More than two thirds (67%) of respondents say protecting the environment and fighting climate change should be a priority for the EU in the years to come 11 . The majority also say improving education and training or fighting poverty and economic and social inequalities should be a priority (both 56%). Moreover, almost half (49%) think boosting employment and tackling unemployment should be a priority, while 44% say this about improving health and wellbeing, or promoting human rights, democracy and common values. Finally, more than one quarter (28%) say ensuring the EU's security and defence should be a priority, while 23% say this about bringing young people from different parts of the EU together.

The views of young people March 2019 Report Flash Eurobarometer 478 There are 23 countries where the majority of respondents think protecting the environment and fighting climate change should be a priority for the EU in the years to come, with respondents in Denmark (83%), France (81%) and Germany and Luxembourg (both 79%) the most likely to say this. In contrast, 38% in Lithuania, 41% in Romania and 43% in Croatia say the same. Respondents in the Netherlands (66%), Hungary (65%), Germany and Portugal (both 63%) are the most likely to mention improving education and training , while those in Poland (39%), Malta, Slovakia and Sweden (all 41%) are the least likely to do so. In 19 countries this issue is one of the top three priorities cited. Fighting poverty and economic and social inequalities is most mentioned by those in Portugal (72%), Germany (69%) and Luxembourg (68%), and least mentioned by respondents in Finland (38%), Poland (40%) and Italy (44%). In 26 countries this is one of the three most mentioned topics.

        "12 How do we build a stronger, more united Europe? The views of young people March 2019 Report Flash Eurobarometer 478 The socio-demographic analysis illustrates the following: \u00a7 Women are more likely than men to mention protecting the environment and fighting climate change (71% vs 63%), fighting poverty and economic and social inequalities (59% vs 53%), improving health and wellbeing (47% vs 41%) and promoting human rights, democracy and common values (48% vs 40%), but they are less likely to mention ensuring the EU's security and defence (25% vs 32%). \u00a7 The older the respondent, the more likely they are to mention boosting employment and tackling unemployment or improving health and wellbeing , and the less likely they are to mention protecting the environment and fighting climate change , and bringing young people from different parts of the EU together . \u00a7 Those who are still studying are the most likely to say protecting the environment and fighting climate change should be a priority (72%), and along with those who completed education aged 20+ they are the most likely to mention improving education and training and promoting human rights, democracy and common values . Respondents who completed education aged 15 or younger are more likely than those who completed education at an older age to mention fighting poverty and economic and social inequalities . \u00a7 Students (73%) and those who are not working (70%) are more likely than other occupation groups to say protecting the environment and fighting climate change should be a priority. Improving education and training and promoting human rights, democracy and common values are most mentioned by employees and those who are studying or not working. Manual workers (37%) are the most likely to mention ensuring the EU\u2019s security and defence . The analysis also shows that respondents who are positive about the EU are more likely than those who are negative to say protecting the environment and fighting climate change or promoting human rights, democracy and common values should be a priority. The more positive a respondent\u2019s view of the EU, the more likely they are to say bringing young people from different parts of the EU together should be a priority. Respondents who have been abroad for a learning experience are more likely to say improving education and training should be a priority, compared to those who have not participated (61% vs 54%). Finally, the more actively a respondent participates in civic, social and political activities, the more likely they are to think each area should be a priority. The exceptions are boosting employment and tackling unemployment, and improving health and wellbeing, where there is little difference. ",

They were asked which of these actions they thought were useful for young people 12 .

The analysis also highlights that those with a positive view of the EU are more likely to mention connecting schools or universities in their country with others abroad or raising awareness among young people on activities provided by the EU for them, compared to those with a negative view. In addition, respondents who have participated in a learning experience abroad are more likely to mention connecting schools or universities in their country with others abroad than those who have not participated (48% vs 42%). Finally, the more actively a respondent participates in civic, social and political activities, the more likely they are to think each action would be useful, with the exception of bringing young people from different parts of the EU together. For instance, 41% who are actively engaged mention increasing participation in European programmes among young people with fewer opportunities, compared to 36% who are slightly engaged and 27% who do not participate at all.

Specific attention is given to the involvement in organised volunteering. 1 Participation in social, political and civic activities Voting in local, national or European elections is the most common social, political or civic activity. More than three quarters of respondents took part in some form of organised movements (including youth organisations) and were therefore actively participating. All respondents were asked about their participation in a range of civic, social and political activities 13 . The two most common activities these young respondents have taken part in are voting in local, national or European elections (72%), and volunteering activities or local community projects (58%). These are the only activities undertaken by at least half of all respondents. Just over four in ten (41%) have participated in student or youth organisations, while almost as many (38%) have posted opinions on current issues on social media and 35% have participated in campaigns, strikes or street protests.

The views of young people March 2019 Report Flash Eurobarometer 478 The socio-demographic analysis highlights a number of differences: \u00a7 Women are more likely than men to mention climate change, environment and eco- friendly behaviours (46% vs 36%), foreign languages and cultures (34% vs 27%) or health education (39% vs 28%), but they are less likely to mention the use of digital tools and coding (22% vs 32%) or maths and sciences (7% vs 13%). \u00a7 The younger the respondent the more likely they are to mention the use of digital tools and coding , and the less likely they are to mention reading, comprehension and writing . For instance, 30% of 15-19 year olds mentioned the use of digital tools and coding, compared to 25% of 25-30 year olds. \u00a7 Respondents who completed education aged 15 or younger are the most likely to mention reading, comprehension and writing (29%) or maths and sciences (19%), but the least likely to mention health education (22%). However, this group represents a very small number of respondents. Those who are still studying are the most likely to mention critical thinking, media and democracy (48%) and the use of digital tools and coding (30%). \u00a7 Respondents living in large towns (47%) are the most likely to mention critical thinking, media and democracy , while those living in towns are more likely to mention entrepreneurship and financial competencies than those living in rural villages. \u00a7 Students (48%) and those who are not working (45%) are more likely than other occupation groups to mention critical thinking, media and democracy . The self-employed are the most likely to mention entrepreneurship and financial competencies (53%) and the least likely to mention climate change, environment and eco-friendly behaviours (33%). The results also show that those who have a very negative view of the EU (22%) are much less likely to say foreign languages and cultures are not taught enough, compared to those who have a less negative (33%) or a positive view (30%-31%). In addition, respondents who have participated in learning experiences abroad are more likely to mention critical thinking, media and democracy than those who have not participated (47% vs 39%). Finally, the more actively a respondent participates in civic, social and political activities, the more likely they are to mention critical thinking, media and democracy; entrepreneurship and financial competences; climate change, environment and eco-friendly behaviours; or the use of digital tools and coding. For example, 44% of respondents who are actively engaged in these activities say critical thinking, media and democracy is not taught enough in schools, compared to 37% who are slightly engaged, and 28% who are not engaged at all.

YOUTH MOBILITY This last section of the report looks at young people\u2019s experiences of going abroad for study, training, work, exchanges or volunteering. Reasons why young people have not taken part in such activities are also discussed. Almost one third of young respondents have spent at least two weeks abroad for learning experiences, increasing to over one third for the older cohort of respondents (aged 25-30). Just over three in ten (31%) young people say they have been abroad for at least two weeks for studies, training, work, exchanges or volunteering. The majority (69%), however, have not done this 25 . Base: all respondents (N=10,786) 25 D7 Excluding travel for tourism or living with one's family abroad, have you ever stayed abroad for at least two weeks? For example, for studies, training, work, exchanges or volunteering. ",
        "56 How do we build a stronger, more united Europe? The views of young people March 2019 Report Flash Eurobarometer 478 Participation in learning experiences abroad varies considerably across countries. Luxembourg is the only country where at least half (51%) have been abroad for at least two weeks for studies, training, work, exchanges or volunteering, followed by 42% in Lithuania and 41% in Italy. At the other end of the spectrum only 18% of young people in Croatia, 20% in Greece and also 18% in Malta have done the same. The map below shows that there are no clear-cut trends when it comes to regions of the EU (West- East-North-South). Base: all respondents (N=10,786) The socio-demographic analysis shows the following: \u00a7 Young people aged 25-30 (35%) and 20-24 (32%) are more likely to have gone abroad for at least two weeks for these learning experiences than those aged 15-19 (23%). \u00a7 Those who completed their education aged 20+ (39%) (i.e. those who are likely to have achieved higher levels of education) are more likely to have gone abroad for these experiences than those who complete education at a younger age, or those who are still studying. \u00a7 The more urbanised the respondents\u2019 environment, the more likely they are to have gone abroad for these experiences: 37% living in large towns have done so, compared to 26% living in rural villages. \u00a7 The self-employed (42%) are more likely than other occupation groups to have done this 26 . 26 However the total number of persons in this category in the overall survey sample is rather low and hence this finding should be taken with caution.

        "57 How do we build a stronger, more united Europe? The views of young people March 2019 Report Flash Eurobarometer 478 In addition, respondents who are very positive about the EU (38%) are more likely to have gone abroad for these experiences than those who are less positive or those who are negative. Finally, respondents who are actively engaged 27 (35%) in social, civic or political activities 28 are much more likely to have gone abroad for these experiences than respondents who are only slightly engaged 29 (22%), or those who are not engaged at all 30 (16%). Base: all respondents (N=10,786) 27 Participate in at least one of the following: Political movements, parties or unions; student or youth organisations; campaigns, strikes or street protests; volunteering activities or local community projects. 28 See Part II for a full discussion of these results (Q6). 29 Participate in at least one of the following: Voting in local, national or European elections; Posting opinions on current issues on social media; Getting information on current issues on social media; Making politically motivated consumer choices. 30 Do not participate in any of the activities discussed in Q6 ",

The views of young people March 2019 Report Flash Eurobarometer 478 1 Intention to participate in learning experiences abroad Earlier studies 31 analysed obstacles to young people\u2019s participation in learning exchanges abroad but they did not assess the intention of young people to do so. In this survey additional questions were added asking those who did not take part in learning experiences abroad whether they have considered doing so, as well as the reasons why they did not participate. Respondents who have considered taking part in learning experiences abroad are a small majority among those who did not participate in such activities. Respondents living in urban areas are much more likely to have this intention than those in rural areas. The main reasons why they did not take part are lack of financial means and family, personal or work-related factors. Just over half (53%) of respondents who have not stayed abroad for work, studies, exchanges and so on say they have considered doing so 32 . Almost half (46%) say they have not considered it. Base: respondents who never stayed abroad (N=7,409) 31 See Eurobarometer study on the European Education Area: http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Survey/ getSurveyDetail/instruments/FLASH/search/education%20area/surveyKy/2186 32 Q2 You said earlier that you have never stayed abroad for the purpose of studies, work, exchanges, etc. Have you considered taking part in any learning experience abroad?

At the other end of the scale 35% in Romania, 37% in Lithuania and 38% in Hungary say the same. Base: respondents who never stayed abroad (N=7,409) The socio-demographic analysis illustrates: \u00a7 The younger the respondent, the more likely they are to say they have considered staying abroad for learning experiences: 61% of 15-19 year olds have considered it, compared to 45% of 25-30 year olds. Given their age, it is likely that a share of them will take part in such activities later in their life. \u00a7 The longer a respondent remained in education, the more likely they are to have considered this. However, it is those who are still studying (68%) who are the most likely to have considered going abroad for learning experiences. \u00a7 The more urbanised a respondents\u2019 environment, the more likely they are to have gone abroad for these experiences: 60% living in large towns have done so, compared to 45% living in rural villages. \u00a7 Students (67%) and those not working (61%) are much more likely than other occupation groups to have considered these experiences. The analysis also shows that respondents who are very positive about the EU are more likely to have considered going abroad for these experiences (62%) than those who are less positive or those who are negative. Furthermore, 61% of respondents who have been involved in organised voluntary activities have considered going abroad for these experiences, compared to 50% who have not been involved. Finally, respondents who are actively engaged in social, civic or political activities are much more likely to have considered taking part (59%) than respondents who are only slightly engaged (41%), or those who are not engaged at all (27%).

        "TS 2 How do we build a stronger, more united Europe? The views of young people March 2019 Technical Specifications Flash Eurobarometer 478 Kantar has developed its own RDD sample generation capabilities based on using contact telephone numbers from responders to random probability or random location face to face surveys, such as Eurobarometer, as seed numbers. The approach works because the seed number identifies a working block of telephone numbers and reduces the volume of numbers generated that will be ineffective. The seed numbers are stratified by NUTS2 region and urbanisation to approximate a geographically representative sample. From each seed number the required sample of numbers are generated by randomly replacing the last two digits. The sample is then screened against business databases in order to exclude as many of these numbers as possible before going into field. This approach is consistent across all countries. Readers are reminded that survey results are estimations, the accuracy of which, everything being equal, rests upon the sample size and upon the observed percentage. With samples of about 1,000 interviews, the real percentages vary within the following confidence limits: various sample sizes are in rows various observed results are in columns 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% 95% 90% 85% 80% 75% 70% 65% 60% 55% 50% N=50 6,0 8,3 9,9 11,1 12,0 12,7 13,2 13,6 13,8 13,9 N=50 N=500 1,9 2,6 3,1 3,5 3,8 4,0 4,2 4,3 4,4 4,4 N=500 N=1000 1,4 1,9 2,2 2,5 2,7 2,8 3,0 3,0 3,1 3,1 N=1000 N=1500 1,1 1,5 1,8 2,0 2,2 2,3 2,4 2,5 2,5 2,5 N=1500 N=2000 1,0 1,3 1,6 1,8 1,9 2,0 2,1 2,1 2,2 2,2 N=2000 N=3000 0,8 1,1 1,3 1,4 1,5 1,6 1,7 1,8 1,8 1,8 N=3000 N=4000 0,7 0,9 1,1 1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5 1,5 1,5 1,5 N=4000 N=5000 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,1 1,2 1,3 1,3 1,4 1,4 1,4 N=5000 N=6000 0,6 0,8 0,9 1,0 1,1 1,2 1,2 1,2 1,3 1,3 N=6000 N=7000 0,5 0,7 0,8 0,9 1,0 1,1 1,1 1,1 1,2 1,2 N=7000 N=7500 0,5 0,7 0,8 0,9 1,0 1,0 1,1 1,1 1,1 1,1 N=7500 N=8000 0,5 0,7 0,8 0,9 0,9 1,0 1,0 1,1 1,1 1,1 N=8000 N=9000 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 0,9 1,0 1,0 1,0 1,0 N=9000 N=10000 0,4 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,8 0,9 0,9 1,0 1,0 1,0 N=10000 N=11000 0,4 0,6 0,7 0,7 0,8 0,9 0,9 0,9 0,9 0,9 N=11000 N=12000 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,8 0,9 0,9 0,9 0,9 N=12000 N=13000 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,7 0,8 0,8 0,8 0,9 0,9 N=13000 N=14000 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,7 0,8 0,8 0,8 0,8 0,8 N=14000 N=15000 0,3 0,5 0,6 0,6 0,7 0,7 0,8 0,8 0,8 0,8 N=15000 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% 95% 90% 85% 80% 75% 70% 65% 60% 55% 50% Statistical Margins due to the sampling process (at the 95% level of confidence) ",
