In addition, the Latvian Presidency has asked Eurofound to prepare a background note on social dialogue with a view to stimulating discussion in EPSCO.

Created in 1975, Eurofound was set up to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions, a European Agency with the unique mandate of providing knowledge on social and work-related issues. The goal then was to help policymakers shape a better future for Europe\u2019s citizens; 40 years on and now covering 28 countries and 520 million people, that goal remains as critical today as ever before. Eurofound will take this anniversary year as an opportunity to deepen its links with its core stakeholders, the social partners, governments and Institutions, and build on its vast network at EU and national level to continue to provide high-quality, policy-relevant information, which policymakers can use to shape a fair and competitive Europe. A series of initiatives and events will take place throughout the year, including a joint event with the European Agency for the Development of Vocational training (Cedefop) in the second half of the year. A promotional brochure \u2013 Eurofound: The fi rst 40 years \u2013 has just been published to mark the anniversary, from which the timeline below of key developments is taken.

        "Sustainable work is the future of work The ageing of European societies requires that more of the working-age population is brought into work and everyone\u2019s working life is extended. However, work itself is often the reason why people leave employment. Work may not adapt to the different needs of different people, may not change as workers get older, or may even damage their health, forcing them out of the workforce. To make work sustainable over the life course means adapting work so that people remain skilled, fit and motivated. Examining how this can be done in practice is a key research priority for Eurofound, highlighted by the recent publication of the latest issue of Foundation Focus , which takes as its theme Sustainable work: Towards better and longer working lives. The Focus will complement Eurofound\u2019s latest online spotlight, \u2018Sustainable work \u2013 The future of working life in Europe\u2019. This will give visitors direct access to its latest findings on the topic, information on events and updates on developments in the area. Annual work programme 2015 launched In this, the third year of Eurofound\u2019s four year work-programme 2013\u20132016, the Agency\u2019s pan-European surveys and observatories remain core elements of its research activities. Fieldwork for the sixth wave of the European Working Conditions Survey will be conducted in 2015. Meanwhile, the fourth wave of the European Quality of Life Survey is being prepared and analysis of the results of the third European Company Survey will be published shortly. In addition to exploiting data provided through the surveys, the 2015 research projects also make full use of information provided by Eurofound\u2019s network of correspondents. Projects being conducted have been selected on the basis of their potential to feed into relevant policy debates and to provide evidence that can support decision makers in finding better solutions. You can read the work programme at http://bit.ly/1AHMaUF Member States continue fight against undeclared work Undeclared work \u2013 any paid activities that are lawful forms of work but are not declared to the public authorities \u2013 continues to be a source of concern to public authorities across the EU. According to a Special Eurobarometer Report from 2014, almost a third of Europeans (32%) said they knew someone who had worked without declaring at least some of their income to tax or social security institutions. A recently published update from Eurofound\u2019s EurWORK observatory demonstrates the steps that Member States are taking to combat undeclared work. Latvia has temporarily increased its monitoring of certain sectors most implicated in the shadow economy, Lithuania and Slovenia have each introduced their own service voucher system as an alternative to undeclared cash payments, while in Estonia the hiring of a new employee must be reported to the authorities at least one day before they start work, in contrast to the previous regulation whereby employers could wait up to 30 days after employment began.
