        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 3 INTRODUCTION Since spring 2010 1 , Standard Eurobarometer surveys have measured European public opinion regarding the Europe 2020 strategy. This ten-year growth strategy launched in March 2010 by the European Commission has a triple purpose: to overcome the economic and financial crisis, to prepare the future of the European economy and to create the conditions for economic growth based on innovation, sustainability and the inclusion of as many people as possible 2 . In this new Standard Eurobarometer survey of autumn 2014 (EB82), three indicators are used to measure Europeans\u2019 opinions: \uf02d the first classifies the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy (the fight against exclusion, the modernisation of the labour market, support for a sustainable economy, the appeal of the higher education system, strengthening industrial competitiveness, support for research and innovation, and developing the digital economy) on the basis of how important Europeans think they are; \uf02d The second considers how realistic Europeans find the social, economic, environmental and educational targets set for 2020; \uf02d Finally, the third measures the extent of public support for the European Union\u2019s policy for emerging from the economic and financial crisis. The full Standard Eurobarometer 82 report consists of several volumes. The first volume presents the state of public opinion in the European Union (EU). Three further volumes present European public opinion on other issues: the Europe 2020 strategy, European citizenshipand media use in the EU. This volume focuses on the Europe 2020 strategy. This Standard Eurobarometer survey was conducted from 8-17 November 2014 3 in 35 countries or territories: the European Union\u2019s 28 Member States, the six candidate countries (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania), and the Turkish Cypriot community in the part of the country that is not controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus. Questions on the Europe 2020 strategy were only asked in the 28 EU Member States. 1 Standard Eurobarometer 73. Field work conducted in May 2010, some months after the launch of the Europe 2020 strategy by the European Commission in March 2010. 2 http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm 3 Please refer to the technical specifications for the exact dates of the interviews in each country ",

        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 6 I. THE PERCEIVED IMPORTANCE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION\u2019S EUROPE 2020 INITIATIVES - Europeans remain convinced of the merits of the Europe 2020 strategy initiatives - Respondents were first asked to determine the importance of the seven flagship initiatives defined in the Europe 2020 strategy. To this end, they were asked to give a score ranging between 1 and 10 to each initiative, where 1 means \u2018not at all important\u2019 and 10 means \u2018very important\u2019. In order to rank the level of importance ascribed to each initiative, the answers were then aggregated into three categories: \u201cimportant\u201d for scores of 7 to 10, \u201cfairly important\u201d for scores 5 and 6 and \u201cnot important\u201d for scores between 1 and 4 6 . The evolutions are analysed here in comparison with the Standard Eurobarometer of autumn 2013 (EB80). An absolute majority of respondents think that each of these initiatives is important. Furthermore, between autumn 2013 and autumn 2014, the perceived importance of all the initiatives increased (by between 1 and 6 percentage points), most strikingly for \u201cincrease support for the EU\u2019s research and development policies\u201d (+6 percentage points), \u201cdevelop the e-economy by strengthening ultra-fast Internet\u201d (+6) and \u201csupport an economy that uses fewer natural resources and emits less greenhouse gas\u201d (+4). These evolutions do not overturn the established ranking; social initiatives (the fight against exclusion and employment) and environmental initiatives (support for a sustainable economy) are still regarded as the most important , ahead of those designed to support competitiveness, education and innovation, as has been the case on every occasion since this indicator was introduced in spring 2010 (EB73). In detail: Around eight in ten Europeans agree on the importance of the initiatives to help the poor and socially excluded and enable them to play an active part in society (82%, +1 percentage point since autumn 2013), modernise labour markets, with a view to raising employment levels (81%, +1) and support an economy that uses fewer natural resources and emits less greenhouse gas (79%, +4). Around three-quarters believe that it is important \u201cto enhance the quality and appeal of the EU's higher education system\u201d (75%, +3 percentage points) and \u201cto help the EU's industrial base to be more competitive by promoting entrepreneurship and developing new skills\u201d (74%, +1). Seven in ten (70%, +6 percentage points) say it is important \u201cto increase the support for research and development policies and turn inventions into products\u201d . 6 QB1. For each of the following initiatives, please tell me how important or not you think they are in order for the EU to exit the present financial and economic crisis and prepare for the next decade. Please use a scale from 1 to 10 where '1' means that you think that this initiative is \"not at all important\" and '10' means that it is \"very important\". ",
        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 7 Finally, 57% of Europeans (+6 percentage points) believe it is important \u201cto develop the e-economy by strengthening ultra-fast Internet within the EU\u201d . Six of these seven initiatives seem important to an absolute majority of respondents in every EU Member State. The seventh, targeting the growth of the e- economy and the spread of broadband in Europe, is regarded as important by an absolute majority of people in 23 of the 28 countries in the European Union (compared with 20 Member States in autumn 2013). More particularly, the perceived importance of the fight against exclusion and support for social integration varies between 94% in Greece and 69% in the Czech Republic. The importance of modernising the labour markets and creating jobs ranges from 95% in Malta to 69% in France and Luxembourg. As in the case of the European average (with evolutions of +1 percentage point since autumn 2013), the variations by country are very slight for these two initiatives, which have continuously enjoyed a very high level of perceived importance since spring 2010. The others initiatives tested (with the sole exception of supporting the competitiveness of European industry, where opinions are unchanged in most EU countries) see more striking national evolutions, with a trend towards increased perceived importance in the great majority of Member States. Support for the importance of providing support for sustainable growth limiting the emission of greenhouse gas ranges from 90% in Sweden to 68% in the United Kingdom. This has consolidated since autumn 2013 in 24 of the 28 EU countries, increasing most notably in Poland (77%, +10 percentage points), Italy (78%, +9), Lithuania (86%, +8) and Denmark (83%, +8). It is unchanged or very slightly down in Sweden (90%, -2), the Czech Republic (76%, -1), Bulgaria (84%, no change) and Germany (84%, =). ",
        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 8 The perceived importance of the initiative aiming to enhance the quality and appeal of the EU's higher education system is the strongest in Malta (92%), and the weakest in the United Kingdom (65%). The perceived importance of this item has risen in 23 Member States, especially in Slovenia (75%, +12 percentage points), Poland (74%, +12), Luxembourg (80%, +10), Hungary (77%, +10), Lithuania (83%, +9) and Italy (71%, +9). However, it has declined slightly in Greece (84%, -3), Germany (81%, -3), Portugal (77%, -3), Spain (87%, -1) and Slovakia (77%, -1). Support for EU industrial competitiveness and entrepreneurship is most likely to be regarded as important in Finland (87%) and least so in France and the United Kingdom (66%). While in almost all Member States, opinions of the importance of this initiative are stable or show minimal evolutions, there has been a striking increase in its perceived importance in Poland (79%, +12 percentage points) and Italy (78%, +10). Perceptions of the importance of the initiative aiming to boost support for research and innovation are most marked in Sweden (79%) and Lithuania (79%), and the least so in France (59%). The importance of the this item has gained ground in 24 Member States, led by Slovenia (74%, +12 percentage points), the United Kingdom (61%, +12), Poland (72%, +11), Latvia (69%, +11), Estonia (69%, +11), Lithuania (79%, +9), Ireland (76%, +9), Italy (72%, +9), Belgium (69%, +9) and Luxembourg (61%, +9). It is unchanged in Bulgaria (74%) and in decline in Spain (74%, -5), Greece (71%, -5) and Portugal (69%, -3). Finally, the development of the e-economy and broadband in Europe is regarded as important by an absolute majority of respondents in 23 countries (compared with 20 in autumn 2013). An absolute majority holds this view in three Member States where this was not previously the case. These are Denmark (where 51% of respondents now think the development of the e-economy is important, compared with 44% in autumn 2013), the Netherlands (59% versus 48%) and the United Kingdom (51% versus 41%). The view that this is an important initiative, while still held by a minority, has gained ground in Luxembourg (40%, +10 percentage points), Sweden (36%, +8), France (38%, +6), Belgium (48%, +4) and the Czech Republic (49%, +2). The growth of the e-economy in the EU is seen as important by majorities in every other EU country. Support is most widespread in Ireland (77%) and has gained the most ground in Malta (71%, +18 percentage points), Poland (68%, +13), the Netherlands (59%, +11), Hungary (65%, +10), the United Kingdom (51%, +10) and Luxembourg (40%, +10). In total, this opinion is on the rise in 21 EU Member States. It is unchanged in Croatia (66%) and Portugal (56%). It has declined slightly in Bulgaria (62%, -4), Greece (62%, -4), Austria (53%, -2), Slovakia (65%, -2) and Romania (66%, -1). ",

        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 10 A longer-term analysis suggests that the perceived importance of the Europe 2020 strategy initiatives has increased significantly since the Standard Eurobarometer survey of spring 2010 (EB73), where this question was asked for the first time. All the initiatives are considered more important now than they were in spring 2010, with rises ranging from five percentage points for \u201cto modernise labour markets, with a view to raising employment levels\u201d to 11 points for \u201cto increase the support for research and development policies and turn inventions into products\u201d and \u201cto develop the e-economy by strengthening ultra-fast Internet within the EU\u201d. For all seven of these initiatives, it is the \u201cfairly important\u201d category that has lost the most ground. ",
        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 11 II. OPINIONS ON THE EUROPEAN UNION\u2019S EUROPE 2020 QUANTIFIED TARGETS Europeans were then asked to assess the realism of nine quantified targets set for 2020. They were asked to say whether these appear \u201cabout right\u201d, \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d or \u201ctoo modest\u201d 7 . Eight of these targets had already been tested in previous Standard Eurobarometer surveys. The target of raising industry\u2019s contribution to the EU\u2019s GDP to 20% by 2020 8 was tested here for the first time. As in the all the previous surveys since this indicator was introduced in the Standard Eurobarometer of spring 2010 (EB73), a majority of Europeans considered all these targets to be realistic (\u201cabout right\u201d). In the case of seven of the targets the majority was absolute. The preceding Eurobarometer in spring 2014 had recorded a slight fall in the perceived realism of most of the targets. This decline did not continue in the present survey, and the proportion of \u201cabout right\u201d responses rose slightly (1 - 3 percentage points) for all the targets tested. Overall, movement on this indicator - which has been very stable since its introduction \u2013 has been minimal between the Standard Eurobarometer surveys of autumn 2013 and autumn 2014. * This item was tested for the first time in this survey 7 QB2. Thinking about each of the following objectives to be reached by 2020 in the EU, would you say that it is too ambitious, about right or too modest? 8 This target was one of the Political Guidelines for the next European Commission presented in July 2014 by Jean-Claude Juncker. See http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/docs/pg_en.pdf ",
        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 12 In more detail: \uf02d 58% of Europeans (+2 percentage points since spring 2014) think that it is realistic to aim \u201cto increase energy efficiency in the EU by 20% by 2020\u201d. An identical proportion think that the target of ensuring that in 2020 \u201cthree-quarters of men and women between 20 and 64 years of age should have a job\u201d is \u201cabout right\u201d (58%, +1). \uf02d 56% (+1 percentage point) think it is realistic to aim \u201cto increase the share of renewable energy in the EU by 20% by 2020\u201d; \uf02d 53% (+2 percentage points) agree that the objective stating that \u201cthe share of funds invested in research and development should reach 3% of the wealth produced in the EU each year\u201d is realistic; \uf02d 52% (+1 percentage point) believe that \u201cthe reduction of EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020 compared to 1990\u201d is a realistic target; \uf02d 51% (+1 percentage point) describe the target stating that \u201cthe number of young people leaving school with no qualifications should fall to 10%\u201d as \u201cabout right\u201d; \uf02d An identical proportion of respondents think that the aim of raising industry\u2019s contribution to the EU\u2019s GDP to 20% by 2020 is realistic (51%). 17% say that this is \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d and 8% that it is \u201ctoo modest\u201d. This item was tested for the first time in this survey; \uf02d 49% (+3 percentage points) consider the objective stating that \u201cthe number of Europeans living below the poverty line should be reduced by a quarter by 2020\u201d is realistic, while 24% (-2) say that this is \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d and 21% (-1) that it is \u201ctoo modest\u201d. \uf02d Lastly, the objective stating that \u201cat least 40% of the people aged 30 to 34 should have a higher education degree or diploma\u201d seems realistic to 46% of Europeans (+2 percentage points), while 38% (-2) believe this is \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d and 9% (+1) \u201ctoo modest\u201d Overall \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d responses have declined slightly (1 -2 percentage points) for six of the targets, remain unchanged for one and have risen by a point for the last. While all the quantified targets appear more realistic than in spring 2014, an analysis of evolutions since spring 2010 shows a general downward trend: \u201cabout right\u201d answers have declined for all the objectives tested. These declines range from six to two percentage points. ",
        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 13 In more detail: For the targets concerning education, teaching, research and development: the perceived realism of the objective stating that by 2020 \u201cat least 40% of the people aged 30 to 34 should have a higher education degree or diploma\u201d has fallen by six percentage points; this has declined by three points for \u201cthe share of funds invested in research and development should reach 3% of the wealth produced in the EU each year\u201d, and by two points for \u201cthe number of young people leaving school with no qualifications should fall to 10%\u201d. ",
        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 14 Declines of between two and three percentage points are recorded for each of the environmental targets : three points for \u201cthe reduction of EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020 compared to 1990\u201d, and two points for \u201cto increase the share of renewable energy in the EU by 20% by 2020\u201d and for \u201cto increase energy efficiency in the EU by 20% by 2020\u201d. ",
        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 15 For targets in employment and the fight against exclusion , perceived realism has lost five percentage points for the objective stating that in 2020 \u201cthree-quarters of men and women between 20 and 64 years of age should have a job\u201d and four points for \u201cthe number of Europeans living below the poverty line should be reduced by a quarter by 2020\u201d. ",
        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 16 An analysis of national results shows that five of the quantified targets are judged as realistic (\u201cabout right\u201d) by a majority of people in every Member State: these are the three environmental targets ( increase the energy efficiency of the EU , increase the share of renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions ) and the two economic targets ( Invest 3% of wealth produced in research and development and bring the contribution of industry in the EU to 20% of GDP ). The target of bringing the employment rate among people aged 20-64 years to 75% is seen as realistic by a majority of respondents in 27 Member States; the only exception is Cyprus, where views are evenly divided between \u201cabout right\u201d and \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d. Though they are seen as realistic in most EU countries, the social and educational targets nevertheless provoke a wider range of responses. In Sweden a majority of respondents do not agree that it is realistic to reduce the number of young people leaving school with no qualifications to 10% (47% think this target is \u201ctoo modest\u201d while 38% say it is \u201cabout right\u201d); this is the case in four countries for the poverty reduction target (Cyprus, Luxembourg, Sweden, Greece), and in ten countries for increasing to 40% the proportion of those aged 30 to 34 who hold a higher education degree or diploma (the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Austria, Luxembourg, Estonia, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Latvia). A national analysis also shows that generally speaking these targets are most likely to be seen as realistic in Croatia, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal and Romania . For each of the objectives tested, the proportion of respondents assessing them as realistic in these countries is consistently higher than the European average. Finally it shows that respondents in Luxembourg are by far the most likely to regard the objectives as overly ambitious : the answer \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d is consistently given significantly more often than the European average, with the highest levels recorded in the 28 Member States for six of these nine targets. Similarly, respondents in Sweden are most likely to describe the targets as \u201ctoo modest\u201d: the proportion giving this response is always significantly greater than the European average, and for five of the nine targets Sweden records the highest levels found anywhere in the 28 Member States. In more detail: The objective of ensuring a 75% employment rate for men and women aged between 20 and 64 years in the EU seems realistic to an absolute majority of respondents in 23 Member States, led by Latvia (68%), Italy (67%), Croatia (65%) and Malta (65%). It commands a relative majority in four countries, large in France (49% versus 31% of \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d responses) and Sweden (49% versus 33% of \u201ctoo modest\u201d answers), and slightly less in Luxembourg (45% think it is \u201cabout right\u201d compared with 40% who say it is \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d) and Greece (36% versus 33% \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d). Views are evenly divided in Cyprus (35% \u201cabout right\u201d versus 35% \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d). ",
        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 17 Since spring 2014, the perceived realism of this target has gained significant ground in Latvia (68%, +10 percentage points), the United Kingdom (64%, +10) and Portugal (63%, +8). However, it has declined in Romania (63%, -7), Slovenia (57%, -7) and Luxembourg (45%, -5); this target is now much more likely to be seen as \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d in this last country (40%, +8). An absolute majority of respondents agree that it is realistic to target a 20% increase in energy efficiency in the EU by 2020 in every Member State except Greece, where there is a relative majority (47% compared with 25% who think this target is \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d). Respondents are most likely to think this objective is realistic in Malta (70%), Lithuania (69%), Slovenia (67%) and Finland (67%). Perception of the realism of this target has consolidated notably in Finland (67%, +8 percentage points since the Standard Eurobarometer of spring 2014), the Czech Republic (56%, +6) and Sweden (53%, +6) but has declined in Denmark (56%, -6) and Hungary (55%, -6). The target of a 20% increase in the share of renewable energy in the EU by 2020 is seen as \u201cabout right\u201d by an absolute majority of respondents in 23 European Union countries, led by Malta (68%), Finland (67%) and Lithuania (66%), and by a relative majority in the remaining five: Bulgaria (49% versus 20% who think it is \"too ambitious\"), Sweden (49% versus 35% who say it is \u201ctoo modest\u201d), Luxembourg (48% versus 28% \"too ambitious\"), Cyprus (48% versus 22% \"too ambitious\") and Greece (45% versus 26% \"too ambitious\"). The most striking evolution concerns Sweden, where a nine percentage point rise means that this environmental objective is now generally seen as \u201cabout right\u201d whereas it was predominantly regarded as \u201ctoo modest\u201d in the Standard Eurobarometer of spring 2014 (42% versus 40%). As well as in Sweden, the perceived realism of this target has risen significantly in Finland (67%, +9 percentage points), the Czech Republic (56%, +7) and Croatia (63%, +6). It has declined in Slovenia (64%, -6), Hungary (52%, -6), Belgium (50%, -6), Romania (58%, -5) and Luxembourg (48%, -5). An absolute majority of respondents agree that the objective of investing 3% of the wealth of the European Union in research is realistic in 22 EU countries, most strikingly in Italy and Denmark (both 61%), and commands a relative majority in the remaining six: Belgium (48% versus 23% saying this target is \u201ctoo modest\u201d), Bulgaria (44% versus 14% \"too modest\" and 14% \"too ambitious\"), Greece (40% versus 23% \"too modest\"), France (43% versus 18% \"too modest\"), Cyprus (42% versus 21% \"too modest\") and Luxembourg (44% versus 19% who say it is \"too ambitious\"). The perceived realism of this target has gained significant ground in Poland (54%, +8 percentage points), Slovakia (52%, +6) and Estonia (50%, +6), but has declined in Slovenia (58%, -8), France (43%, -7) and Denmark (61%, -6). The realism of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by comparison with 1990 unites an absolute majority of respondents in 17 Member States, with the highest scores in Malta (65%) and Croatia (64%), and a relative majority in the remaining 11 ",
        "STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 EUROPE 2020 \u2013 AUTUMN 2014 18 states, the largest being in Bulgaria (49% versus 18% who think this objective is \"too ambitious\") and the narrowest in Sweden (45% versus 39% who say it is \"too modest\"). After a 6-point rise since spring 2014, the \"about right\" response is now the majority view in Sweden, as was the case for the other environmental objective targeting the development of renewable energy sources. The perception of this target as realistic has also gained significant ground in Croatia (64%, +8 percentage points), the United Kingdom (53%, +6) and Estonia (52%, +6). Conversely, it has declined the most in Romania (57%, -5). The economic target of increasing the contribution of industry to the EU\u2019s economy to 20% of GDP is seen as realistic by an absolute majority of respondents in 18 Member States, most strikingly in Croatia (64%) and Portugal (60%). This majority is relative in nine countries, ranging from 49% in Denmark to 40% in France and Cyprus. Finally, in Luxembourg, \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d answers lead the way (36%), ahead of \u201cabout right\u201d (29%) and \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d (26%). The \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d rate is equal to or higher than 25% in eight other countries: Estonia (39%), France (33%), Germany (32%), Sweden (31%), Malta (30%), the Netherlands (30%), the United Kingdom (26%) and Denmark (25%). This item was introduced for the first time in this Standard Eurobarometer survey, so no evolutions can be discussed. As in the previous survey in spring 2014, Sweden remains the only EU country in which the educational objective of reducing the number of young people leaving school with no qualifications to 10% is seen as too modest (47% versus 38% who say it is \"about right\"). In every other country, a majority of respondents think this target is \"about right\", most strikingly in Italy (65%), Croatia (64%) and Malta (63%), more narrowly in Luxembourg (39% versus 35% \"too ambitious\" and 22% \"too modest\") and Germany (40% versus 35% \"too modest\" and 20% \"too ambitious\"). Overall, absolute majorities of respondents believe this target is realistic in 18 Member States. This proportion has gained ground significantly in Croatia (64%, +11 percentage points) but has declined in Romania (57%, -8) and Belgium (41%, -6). The objective of reducing poverty in the European Union by a quarter seems \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d in Cyprus (37% versus 31% who think it is \"about right\") and Luxembourg (43% versus 31%). This opinion ratio is unchanged since spring 2014 in Cyprus, but has reversed in Luxembourg under the influence of a six percentage point rise in \"too ambitious\u201d answers (43% versus 31%, compared with 37% versus 39% in spring 2014). In two countries, majorities think this objective is \u201ctoo modest\u201d: Sweden (44% versus 37% who say it is realistic and 15% for whom it is \"too ambitious\") and Greece (36% versus 31% who think the target is realistic and a further 31% for whom it is \"too ambitious\"). This was already the case in spring 2014. The target therefore appears realistic in the remaining 24 EU countries. This view commands an absolute majority of respondents in 13 Member States, led by Croatia ",

It has declined most strikingly in Luxembourg (31%, -8) and Hungary (46%, -6). Finally, the target of enabling at least 40% of those aged 30-34 to obtain a higher education diploma or degree continues, as in spring 2014, to be considered \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d by majorities in ten Member States: the Netherlands (72%), Germany (63%), Finland (58%), Austria (56%), Luxembourg (54%), Estonia (50%), France (46% versus 33% \"about right\"), the Czech Republic (47% versus 42%), Slovakia (44% versus 42%) and Latvia (45% versus 43%).

THE DIRECTION TAKEN BY THE EUROPEAN UNION TO TACKLE THE CRISIS The upturn seen in European public opinion regarding the European Union\u2019s policy for emerging from the crisis and facing the new global challenges since the autumn 2011 Standard Eurobarometer survey (EB76) continues in the current survey. 9 The approval ratio 10 for this policy hit its lowest level in 2011 (+7). In this survey it stands at +22, which is very close to the highest level measured for this indicator since its introduction in spring 2010 (+23 recorded in both autumn 2010 (Standard Eurobarometer EB74) and spring 2011 (Standard Eurobarometer EB75)). This index has risen by two points since spring 2014 (+20), recording its fourth successive rise since autumn 2012. A majority of Europeans (46%, +1 percentage point since spring 2014) think that the European Union is going \u201cin the right direction\u201d to emerge from the crisis and face the new global challenges, while 24% (-1) instead believe that it is moving in the wrong direction. A little over a fifth of respondents spontaneously answered \u201cneither one nor the other\u201d (22%, -1) and 8% (+1) gave no answer. After improving sharply at the time of the Standard Eurobarometer in spring 2014, the opinion ratio has stabilised in this survey in countries within the euro area (+14, compared with +15 in spring 2014 and +5 in autumn 2013). Already very positive, it has risen yet again outside the euro area (+38, compared with +30 in spring 2014 and +27 in autumn 2014). 9 QB3.

Approval of the path taken by the European Union to emerge from the crisis and face the new global challenges is now dominant in 26 countries, commanding an absolute majority of respondents in 15 (Malta, Lithuania, Sweden, Netherlands, Romania, Finland, Bulgaria, Poland, Ireland, Denmark, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Czech Republic and Croatia) and a relative majority in 11 (Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Luxembourg, Austria, France, Slovakia, Cyprus, Spain and Portugal). Approval is most widespread in Malta (71%), Lithuania (70%) and Sweden (68%). Since spring 2014, positive opinions have consolidated significantly in the United Kingdom (49% for \u201cthe right direction\u201d, +15 percentage points), the Czech Republic (53%, +9), Sweden (68%, +8), Poland (59%, +8) and Spain (38%, +8). However, they have lost substantial ground in Belgium (49%, -12), Denmark (56%, -8), Croatia (51%, -8) and Germany (49%, -8). Greece (48% for \u201cthe wrong direction\u201d, versus 25%) and Italy (36% versus 24%) are the only two countries in which a majority of respondents disapprove of the EU\u2019s policies for emerging from the crisis. Overall, the approval index for the EU\u2019s crisis policy (the difference between positive and negative opinions) has improved in this survey in 18 of the 28 Member States, most strikingly in the Czech Republic (+16), Spain (+16), Slovakia (+15), Poland (+14), Sweden (+11), Portugal (+11), Romania (+10), the United Kingdom (+9) and Cyprus (+8).

However, there are some differences of emphasis reflecting the age and social status of respondents. For example, there is a significant generational divide on this question; 54% of people born after 1980 (\u201cgeneration Y\u201d) approve of the EU\u2019s policy for emerging from the crisis and facing new global challenges, compared with 46% of those born between 1965 and 1980 (\u201cgeneration X\u201d), 44% of those born between 1946 and 1964 (baby boomers) and 39% of those born before 1946. The impression that the EU is moving in the right direction also increases with educational levels and self-positioning on the social scale: 34% of people who left school at the age of 15 or earlier believe that the EU is going in the right direction to emerge from the crisis and face new global challenges, compared with 45% of those who left education between the age of 16 and 19, and 52% of those who studied until the age of 20 of beyond. Meanwhile, 42% of unemployed people and 42% of people who describe themselves as working class approve of the EU\u2019s policy for emerging from the crisis, compared with 49% of those who place themselves in the middle class and 55% of those who say they are upper class.

The wave 82.3 is the STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 survey and covers the population of the respective nationalities of the European Union Member States, resident in each of the Member States and aged 15 years and over. The STANDARD EUROBAROMETER 82 survey has also been conducted in the six candidate countries (Turkey, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania) and in the Turkish Cypriot Community. In these countries, the survey covers the national population of citizens and the population of citizens of all the European Union Member States that are residents in these countries and have a sufficient command of the national languages to answer the questionnaire. The basic sample design applied in all states is a multi-stage, random (probability) one. In each country, a number of sampling points was drawn with probability proportional to population size (for a total coverage of the country) and to population density. In order to do so, the sampling points were drawn systematically from each of the \"administrative regional units\", after stratification by individual unit and type of area . They thus represent the whole territory of the countries surveyed according to the EUROSTAT NUTS II (or equivalent) and according to the distribution of the resident population of the respective nationalities in terms of metropolitan, urban and rural areas . In each of the selected sampling points, a starting address was drawn, at random. Further addresses (every Nth address) were selected by standard \"random route\" procedures, from the initial address. In each household, the respondent was drawn, at random (following the \"closest birthday rule\"). All interviews were conducted face-to-face in people's homes and in the appropriate national language. As far as the data capture is concerned, CAPI ( Computer Assisted Personal Interview) was used in those countries where this technique was available. For each country a comparison between the sample and the universe was carried out. The Universe description was derived from Eurostat population data or from national statistics offices. For all countries surveyed, a national weighting procedure, using marginal and intercellular weighting, was carried out based on this Universe description. In all countries, gender, age, region and size of locality were introduced in the iteration procedure. For international weighting (i.e. EU averages), TNS Opinion & Social applies the official population figures as provided by EUROSTAT or national statistic offices. The total population figures for input in this post-weighting procedure are listed below. ",
