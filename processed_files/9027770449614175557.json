        "3 (cid:96) Foreword There is now compelling scientific evidence that since the mid-1970s socio- economic inequalities have increased significantly in the world including in Europe. This publication not only confirms this observation but goes much further by showing where socio-inequalities are to be found in the European Union and their characteristics. Socio-economic inequalities are nothing new and many EU citizens and policymakers at times feel that inequalities are an inevitable consequence of our modernity. However such a stance takes no account of the fact that research shows that between the 1930s and the 1970s socio-inequalities were indeed reduced, and sometimes very significantly, in many parts of the World including Europe, mainly through the strong influence of \u201cthe Welfare State\u201d. Thus socio-economic inequalities are not an auto- matic consequence of modernity, they can be reduced and kept at bay. There is also ever more evidence that countries and regions with higher socio-economic ine- qualities experience the most acute socio-economic problems \u2013 whether we speak about lower economic growth, increases in violence, poorer educational achievement, declining civic or elec- toral participation or higher mortality rates. On the contrary, countries with a lower level of socio-economic inequalities fare better in all these domains. An intriguing question remains to be addressed. Why are socio-inequalities on the rise every- where in the world, including in Europe? The question is particularly important given that there has been a period of sustained economic growth since the 1980s. It means that the type of growth witnessed in recent decades fosters inequalities and, with them, all the social and economic evils that we see in the EU and which weaken it as a model for progress and well-being. As the Directorate for Science, Economy and Society already stressed in a 2009 publication on The World in 2025, what is badly needed is a new model of development which acts as a but- tress to a positive socio-ecological transition. Fighting socio-economic inequalities whilst at the same time remaining with the same old models of growth and not daring to be politically bold enough to accept the need for change will only lead to frustration and the ineffective use of our limited resources. The way forward is a new socio-ecological model which takes account of European democratic values such as equity, and will allow real progress. This will make sure that socio-economic inequalities will decline and soon. Jean-Michel BAER Director Science, Economy and Society Inequalities-100924.indd 3 27/09/10 16:54 ",

        "8 Socio-economic inequalities have been rising in the European Union (EU) and in most countries are higher today than in 1980 ( 1 ).These trends are similar to those found in the United States of America (USA) and other industrialised economies and reflect the combined effects of changes taking place in the labour market, linked to globalisation and technological change, in social variables, such as household composition, and in the redistributive activity of welfare states. Inequality matters because it contravenes the values of EU citizens, the European Commis- sion\u2019s objectives for economic and social cohesion, and the specific objectives of \u201cEurope 2020\u201d Strategy ( 2 ), for \u201csmart, sustain- able and inclusive growth\u201d ( 3 ). Research very convincingly shows that egali- tarian societies are associated with higher lev- els of economic growth and political inclusion. By contrast unequal societies experience higher rates of crime, ill-health drug abuse, and persistent poverty ( 4 ). Cohesion and growth objectives are therefore complementary as well as critical to socio-economic well being. This report is based on an extensive review of 13 research projects financed by DG Research under Framework Programme 6 that investi- gated the processes underlying inequality, poverty and exclusion and the effectiveness of strategies designed to promote social cohe- sion in EU Member States (MS). The report presents the main findings from their final reports, working papers, as well as from books and academic articles stemming from the projects. In addition the review draws on related work financed by the European Com- mission, other institutions including the International Labour Organisation, OECD and UN Development Programme and the wider literature.

        "9 W H Y S O C I O - E C O N O M I C I N E Q U A L I T I E S I N C R E A S E ? 1.1 The Research Projects The 13 research projects investigated the processes generating and aiming to redress economic and social inequalities and relate to the three main sources of income: \u2022\u2022 market earnings from paid employment; \u2022\u2022 social transfers through taxes and benefits; \u2022\u2022 non-cash resources, such as education, which also increase well-being. Correspondingly the research projects, while interrelated, can be grouped under three main themes: 1. INEQ, LoWER3, EQUALSOC, DYNREG and RESIST investigated the processes generating disparities in market earnings and highlighted the roles of economic restructuring associated with the develop- ment of a knowledge economy, innovation, education and changing labour markets; 2. PROFIT and WELLCHI focused on social inequalities including social transfers and the effectiveness of social policies designed to redress inequality; 3. AIMP-AP, CAPRIGHT, KATARSIS, INCLUD- ED, LLL2010 and EUREQUAL focused on non-cash incomes and analysed the effec- tiveness of policies designed to redress multi-dimensional forms of inequality and exclusion, including education, lifelong learning and political inclusion. The projects focused on inequality which means that they analysed disparities in the distribution of resources across the whole of society , that is, those generating economic growth and affluence as well as those lead- ing to poverty and social exclusion. Inequality is defined and measured in a number of ways which are discussed below and defined in Box 1.1. Socio-economic ine- quality refers to differences in a range of economic and social factors that influence well-being, including income, education, and health. Economic inequalities relate prima- rily to disparities in earnings, derived from paid employment and in household incomes, which reflect the combined effects of earn- ings and net social transfers (taxes and ben- efits). Social inequality refers to differences in access to social commodities, e.g. health care or education, or to social and institu- tional networks. When obtaining social goods depends on wealth, social and economic inequalities are linked. Inequality is also related to poverty and social exclusion which are distinct, but interrelated concepts. Poverty is defined primarily in eco- nomic terms and relates to people whose incomes and resources preclude them from having a standard of living considered accept- able in the society in which they live ( 5 ). Changes to either poverty or inequality may occur independently of each other but gener- ally countries with high levels of inequality tend to have high rates of poverty ( 6 ). Social exclusion encompasses aspects of poverty and inequality and highlights the complex, dynamic, and relational natures of disadvan- tage as well as the processes through which people become excluded. One of the key messages from the research is that the economic and social dimensions of inequality and poverty are interrelated , hence the need to examine socio-economic inequalities. Correspondingly, economic and social policies need to be attentive to their impact on socio-economic inequalities . (5) European Council's definition 1975.

        "I N T R O D U C T I O N : S E T T I N G T H E S C E N E 10 Box 1.1 Inequality, Poverty, and Social Exclusion ( 7 ): Inequality \u2022\u2022 Refers to disparities in the distribution of monetary resources within or between populations. A variety of measures are used: - the Gini coefficient captures differences in inequality in household incomes over time or between different regions and countries. It ranges between 0 (absence of inequality) and 1 (total inequality); - decile ratios measure disparities in earnings between high and low paid workers. Frequently used are the 90/10 decile ratio, which contrasts the top 10 % of earners with the lowest 10 %. Socio-economic inequality \u2022\u2022 Relates to disparities in both economic and social resources, linked to social class and includes earnings, income, education and health that contribute to a sense of well-being. \u2022\u2022 Measures incorporate such indicators as income, education, occupation, or health status. Poverty \u2022\u2022 The EU uses an \u201cat-risk of poverty\u201d measure, defined as \u201cthose living below 60 % national median equivalised disposable income\u201d, as not all those with low incomes are necessarily poor. \u2022\u2022 The unit of measurement is households adjusted for household size: equivalised incomes are defined as the household\u2019s total disposable income divided by its \u201cequivalent size\u201d.

This means that those defined as poor living at or below the poverty threshold in one country \u2013 for example UK (poverty threshold = PPS \u20ac 17 000 and 17 % of the population live in poverty) are considerably richer than those in another, for example the Czech Republic (poverty threshold =PPS \u20ac 6000 and 10 % live in poverty) ( 8 ). Social Exclusion \u2022\u2022 Multidimensional: relating to many spheres: - economic: livelihoods, employment, property, housing, poverty and material deprivation; - social: education, health, personal contacts, respect; - political: civic engagement and citizenship. \u2022\u2022 Multi-layered: existing at individual, household, community or national level. \u2022\u2022 Dynamic: refers to the process through which individuals or groups become excluded from full participation in the society within which they live. > Dynamic: refers t Inequalities-100924.indd 10 27/09/10 16:21 ",

Crucially, while EU policies address various dimensions of social and economic patterns of inequality and thus are relevant to some of the underlying processes associated with inequality, such as employ- ment or education, these policies do not target socio-economic inequality directly. 1957 1961 1974 1989 1992 1997 2000 2005 2006 2007 2010 European Social Charter Social Action Treaty of Rome Social Policy Treaty of Maastricht Lisbon Strategy Social Policy Agenda Social Inclusion OMC Gender Equality Pact Gender Equality Roadmap Year for Combating Poverty & Social Exclusion \u201cEurope 2020\u201d Charter of Basic Social Rights for Workers Treaty of Amsterdam Employment OMC Social Agenda Youth Pact Year of Equal Opportunities \u201cProgress\u201d Treaty of Lisbon Charter of Fundamental Rights Inequalities-100924.indd 12 27/09/10 16:21 ",
        "2.1 Development of EU Social and Economic Policies Figure 2.1 shows that EU-level concern with socio-economic inequalities has expanded over time. It evolved from the Treaty of Rome (1957) and the focus on freedom of movement for workers, to the Lisbon Strategy (2000) goals. The social and employment fields form a tightly interlinked approach to reducing social inequalities, although scholars point out the privileging of economic and employment over social policies ( 9 ) and that the focus has been on poverty reduction rather than combat- ing socio-economic inequality directly ( 10 ). The passing decade has emphasised the fight against poverty and exclusion, particularly within the Lisbon Strategy and its economic, social and environmental pillars. It set the challenge of making Europe \u201cthe most com- petitive and dynamic knowledge-based eco- nomy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\u201d and included modernization of the European Social Model, investing in people, and combating social exclusion ( 11 ). The Social Policy Agenda ( 12 ) and the Social Agenda ( 13 ) formed part of the inte- grated EU approach towards the Lisbon goals, confirmed by the renewed Lisbon Strategy ( 14 ) and continued in the \u201cEurope 2020\u201d Strategy.

        "T H E E U R O P E A N P O L I C Y C O N T E X T the Commission\u2019s Recommendation on active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market ( 21 ), urging MS to combine adequate income support, inclusive labour markets and access to quality services. Finally, education and training policies were also an essential part of the renewed strategy. The Copenha- gen Process, in particular, was intensified in order to develop lifelong learning policies that would effectively accompany and buttress innovation policies in Europe. Fighting poverty is especially relevant to chil- dren \u2013 the focus of the 2007 Social Protection and Social Inclusion policy cycle ( 22 ). Accessi- ble and affordable quality childcare is central in this respect and has been reflected in the coverage rate target to reach 33 per cent of children under three and 90 per cent between three and school age by 2010 ( 23 ). In 2006 the Spring European Council committed to \u201ctake necessary measures to rapidly and signifi- cantly reduce child poverty, giving all children equal opportunities, regardless of their social background\u201d ( 24 ). Other specific groups of European citizens also require attention. The European Youth Pact adopted in 2005 comprised of three pri- ority fields: education and training, employ- ment and social inclusion, and reconciliation of working and private life ( 25 ). The unequal position of ethnic and migrant population, especially female migrants from outside the EU, has also entered the EU policy sphere. The Social Inclusion Process was established to significantly eradicate poverty by 2010. The first objectives were designed: to facilitate participation in employment and access to resources, rights, goods and services; to pre- vent risks of exclusion; to help the most vul- nerable; and to mobilise all relevant bodies ( 17 ). Employment was highlighted as the best defence against social exclusion and as such the European Employment Strategy (EES) was closely linked to the Social Inclusion Process. A five year evaluation of the Lisbon Strategy signalled that the objectives of sustainable economic growth leading to more and better jobs and improved social cohesion were far from realised and that the Strategy needed refocusing. Consequently in 2006, on the basis of the Commission\u2019s Communica- tion ( 18 ), the European Council adopted the Social Protection and Social Inclusion process, whereby the fields of social inclusion, pen- sions, and health and long-term care were brought together. Similarly, the EES was merged with the broad guidelines for economic policies and became part of the Integrated Guidelines ( 19 ). Additionally, an integrated flexicurity approach was intro- duced to achieve social and employment goals, as flexicurity policies should address at the same time the flexibility of labour markets (work organisation and labour rela- tions, reconciliation of work and private life) and employment security and social protec- tion ( 20 ). Further impetus came in the form of (17) Presidency Conclusions, Nice European Council Meeting, 7-9 December 2000.

        "The Commission and the Council pursue common European immigration policy, including the need to bring unemployed and economically inactive third country nationals legally residing in the EU into employment, with a particular focus on women ( 26 ). Gender inequalities have been an object of EU poli- cies for over fifty years, but persisting differ- ences remain in a number of areas. In March 2006, the Commission adopted a Roadmap for Gender Equality 2006-2010 ( 27 ) and the Euro- pean Council approved the European Pact for Gender Equality to accelerate progress and achieve equality between the sexes ( 28 ). At the EU level policies aimed at combating gender inequalities comprise of a dual approach \u2013 specific measures and gender mainstream- ing of all policies and areas. A broader approach to inequality has been highlighted by the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All ( 29 ), seeking to raise awareness of equal treatment rights and discrimination relevant to racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion, belief, disability, age, or sex. 2010 is the Euro- pean Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion ( 30 ). Financial instruments available to MS and their regions, such as the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, and the Cohesion Fund ( 31 ), comprise a significant effort towards strengthening the economic and social cohesion of the enlarged EU. For example, over the period 2007-2013 the European Social Fund will distribute about \u20ac75 billion to EU MS and regions. EU activities in social and economic policies have also been marked by Community Action Programmes. In 2000 the Commission pro- posed a Community Action Programme to Combat Social Exclusion 2002-2006, adopted by the Parliament and the Council in 2001 ( 32 ). Further developments came in 2006 with the establishment of a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity \u2013 PROGRESS ( 33 ). 2.2 Future Policies to Support Social Protection and Social Inclusion The Lisbon Treaty, signed in 2007 and in force since December 2009, introduced the Char- ter of Fundamental Rights ( 34 ) into primary law. The Charter concerns civil, political, eco- nomic and social rights in light of social change, social progress and scientific and technological developments and makes them more visible.

        "T H E E U R O P E A N P O L I C Y C O N T E X T meet social and economic objectives are of key importance. As a recent Draft Joint Employment Report ( 35 ) points out, since the outbreak of the economic crisis the EU social and territorial cohesion has been at risk because countries and regions are affected in different ways and to varied degrees of intensity. In this context the European Commission has launched a consultation on the future \u201cEurope 2020\u201d Strategy ( 36 ), with a formal Communica- tion ( 37 ) addressed to the European Council with three mutually reinforcing priorities: \u2022 smart growth: developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation; \u2022 sustainable growth: promoting a more resource efficient, greener and more com- petitive economy; \u2022 inclusive growth: fostering a high-employ- ment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion. The European Council finalized this process in June 2010 when the detailed parameters of the strategy, including the integrated guidelines and national targets, were adopted. The \u201cEurope 2020\u201d Strategy purports to implement several flagship initiatives for a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth that should help fight socio-economic inequalities. The following Section 3 on the results of the Framework Programme research in Social Sciences and the Humanities shows how com- bating socio-economic inequalities is actually fundamental not only to an inclusive EU but also to growth. 16 (35) European Commission (2009) Draft Report from the Commission to the Council \u201cDraft Joint Employment Report (JER)\u201d 2009/2010.

        "18 (cid:96) 3 Key Thematic Research Findings The EU has consistently supported economic growth with economic and social cohesion from its inception and the \u201cEurope 2020\u201d Strategy confirms the objectives for cohesive growth and inclusion. Yet research projects financed under Framework Programme 6 show that socio-economic inequalities are high and have been rising within the majority of MS, in the last three decades, similarly to trends elsewhere in the world ( 38 ). For the majority of MS socio-economic inequalities were higher in 2007 than in 1980 . The projects analyse changes in inequality, explore the processes generating inequality and the effectiveness of policies and initiatives designed to redress these inequalities. 3.1 Rising Inequalities in the European Union 3.1.1 Earnings Inequalities The main source of income for individuals and households in the EU is earnings from employment. Earnings inequalities have been rising in the majority of MS, similarly to trends found elsewhere in the world including the USA, China and India. Figure 3.1 from EQUALSOC shows the increase in earnings inequalities, measured by the inter-decile ratio, for a number of EU member states and selected OECD countries ( 39 ). (38) OECD (2008) Growing Unequal. Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries, Paris: OECD In many states inequalities rose most steeply between the 1980s and mid 1990s and subsequently stabilised at a high level as the INEQ project showed. (39) See Box 1.1 for a definition of the measures. Inequalities-100924.indd 18 27/09/10 16:21 ",
        "As EQUALSOC shows, the largest increases in earning inequalities between 1979 and 2000 were in English speaking countries as well as in Northern Europe. By contrast continental European countries experienced only modest increases or even decreases ( 41 ). OECD data for a slightly longer period show similar increases in earnings inequality among men and among women of about 10 per cent. As inequality among men and among women have both increased the gender wage gap has largely remained unchanged (OECD 2008). Underlying the increase in earnings inequal- ities is the growing imbalance between pay increases and productivity increases, which has resulted in a decline in labour\u2019s share of value added (IMF 2007). INEQ shows that European workers, especially the lower paid, have not benefitted from increases in productivity in recent decades. Furthermore, an increasing proportion of European work- ers have experienced a decline in total income \u2013 wages plus social contributions.

The INEQ project concludes: \u201cDuring the 1996 to 1999 period, 48 % of the workforce saw their earnings rise more slowly than their productivity. Between 2003 and 2006 the gap widened to include 61 % of the workforce. Moreover, during that same period, 23 % of the workforce saw their hourly compensation drop while their productivity rose\u2026 Between 1996 and 1999, hourly compensation (wages plus social contributions) in major EU countries declined by 16.5 %. Within just a few years \u2013 between 2003 and 2006 \u2013 the figure doubled to 33 % ( 42 )\u201d. 012345 AU (79-00; n=21) BE (86-93; n=7) CA (81-94; n=8) CH (91-00; n=10) DE (84-00; n=17) DK (80-00; n=16) FI (80-00; n=17) FR (79-00; n=22) IT (86-96; n=11) JP (79-00; n=22) NL (79-99; n=20) NZ (84-97; n=9) SE (79-00; n=21) UK (79-00; n=22) USA (79-00; n=22) 1979 2000 p90/p10-ratio Inequalities-100924.indd 19 27/09/10 16:21 ",
        "K E Y T H E M A T I C R E S E A R C H F I N D I N G S 3.1.2 Income Inequalities Earnings inequalities are moderated by social transfers, taxes and benefits and are gener- ally measured at the household level. While the AIM-AP project points out that cash incomes are a partial measure of economic resources associated with welfare, income inequality is generally measured by the Gini coefficient on the basis of household dispos- able income (see Figure 3.2 and Box 1.1). Social transfers (taxes and benefits) moder- ate earnings inequalities (see Figure 3.2) but income inequality remains and has been increasing in recent decades . As Figure 3.2 shows, disposable incomes are far more equal than original incomes. Hun- gary for instance has the most in-egalitarian original income (that arises primarily from earnings), but is in the middle of the distribu- tion for disposable income, indicating strong redistributive policies. Sweden and Denmark have comparatively low earnings inequalities and are among those with the lowest levels of inequality in disposable income, with Gini\u2019s of 0.23, even though Sweden experienced a sharp increase in earnings inequality in recent decades, as shown by INEQ (see also Figure 3.1) ( 44 ). The more corporatist Western European countries, Austria, France, Ger- many and the Benelux, show comparatively low levels of inequality, while Southern Euro- pean states, and the more market oriented UK, and to a lesser extent the new MS, are among the most unequal. 20 As INEQ strikingly argues, \u201cthe inability of labour to capture an adequate share of productivity gains constitutes a major problem in Europe ( 43 )\u201d. A number of expla- nations have been advanced to account for this finding, including differential opportuni- ties for capturing productivity gains from different forms of innovation and the conse- quences of new, less secure working patterns which are discussed in more detail in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below. The outcome of this shift in the distribution of value added, rising earnings inequalities and the decline in relative earnings among low paid workers, is that although people of work- ing age in employment are less likely to be at- risk of poverty than those who are unemployed or economically inactive, employment does not provide a guarantee against poverty . In 2007 the working poor accounted for one third of working age adults at-risk of poverty as shown by LoWER3 . This poses a challenge to both employment policies and social policies that have relied on employment as a means of addressing social inclusion.

The level of inequality varies between different MS. For example, inequality declines marginally in Belgium but rises significantly in the UK. The main source of rising inequality for many states is the increased share of income accru- ing to more affluent households, those in the top quintile \u2013 (the top 20 % of incomes).

Source: Adapted from OECD (2008) op.cit. The projects show that a combination of factors (including economic restructuring associated with the move towards a knowl- edge economy, labour market change and redistributive policies of welfare states) account for these increases in inequality in the last two to three decades. In addition, AIM-AP finds that non-cash benefits are pro- poor, but they vary across populations and countries, and therefore are an important component in understanding socio-economic well-being in different European states. Variations in inequality between MS show that inequality is not inevitable and that policies can redress undesirable outcomes . Inequal- ity matters because it impacts negatively on social welfare and undermines social cohe- sion. EUREQUAL finds that in Central and Eastern Europe equality goes hand in hand with economic and political advantages and that more egalitarian states display higher economic growth and are more democratic than less egalitarian countries. More surpris- ingly, both INEQ and EQUALSOC find that the relationship between inequality and growth is Inequalities-100924.indd 23 27/09/10 16:21 ",

The projects find no evidence that redistributive policies adversely affects growth or that growth leads to lower levels of inequality as trickle down effects have been shown to be too weak . Drawing on evidence from Brazil, declines in economic inequality have occurred alongside economic growth as a consequence of a com- bination of macro-economic stability, eco- nomic growth and strong redistributive government programmes ( 47 ). INEQ, EQUAL- SOC and Klasen (2009) ( 48 ) report widespread evidence that high levels of initial inequality tend to reduce growth. Taking this evidence alongside the discussion below in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, relating to the knowledge economy and new forms of work, suggests that the form of growth or the model of the economy are crit- ical, and in this respect the projects do not find any evidence that suggests that securing the European values for greater equality, reflected to some degree in the European Social Model, would undermine economic growth ( 49 ). 3.1.3 Key Messages and Policy Implications \u2022\u2022 The relationship between inequality and growth is complex . The projects find no evi- dence that redistributive policies adversely affects growth or that growth leads to lower levels of inequality as trickle down effects have been shown to be too weak. The projects report robust evidence that high levels of initial inequality tend to reduce growth . \u2022\u2022 The economic and social mechanisms pro- ducing polarisation and inequality are gen- erally dealt with separately; much attention is devoted to the effects of inequality \u2013 such as poverty, discrimination and lack of social (47) EQUALSOC \u2013 Klasen, S.

Policy discussion tends to focus on narrow redis- tributive actions, drawing from an ever reducing base of public expenditure and welfare services, with little attention to the broader economic and social policy tools that may reverse the increase in inequality ( 50 ). \u2022\u2022 Inequality in earnings has risen in the majority of member states in recent dec- ades . In particular labour\u2019s share of value added has fallen especially among the low paid. This means that employment no longer provides a guarantee against pov- erty and exclusion. One third of working adults are in poverty, implying the need to strengthen policies aimed at working poor. \u2022\u2022 European workers, especially the lower paid, have not benefited from increases in productivity in recent decades. The inabil- ity of labour to capture an adequate share of productivity gains constitutes a major problem in Europe . \u2022\u2022 MS respond to inequality and poverty largely through social transfers to the benefit of the low income households but these policies do not meet the same success . Hungary and the Nordic States redress market inequalities to the greatest extent, pointing to the importance of insti- tutional environments in different Welfare State contexts. \u2022\u2022 States rarely address the processes lead- ing to market inequalities or earnings ine- qualities directly . Given employment changes, discussed in more detail below, states should consider ways of increasing labour\u2019s share of value added so that it better reflects their contribution to produc- tivity increases.

        "by equipping people to work in the knowledge intensive industries but sectors with a large proportion of highly educated workers are associated with wider disparities in earnings as shown by INEQ. A number of explanations have been advanced to account for widening inequalities, includ- ing: differential opportunities for capturing productivity gains associated with different forms of innovation as shown by INEQ; differ- ential barriers to education and training relat- ing to educational systems and styles, shown by KATARSIS and INCLUD-ED and the extent to which education and skills can be upgraded over the lifecourse, shown by LLL2010. In addition throughout the contemporary eco- nomy, working patterns have become less secure as shown by LoWER3 and EQUALSOC, and discussed in more detail in Section 3.3. 3.2.1 Innovation and Inequality Innovation is critical to establishing a more competitive economy but, as shown by INEQ, DYNREG and RESIST, new technologies can be associated with increasing inequalities at all levels: between the EU and other world regions, between different regions in the EU and between different groups of workers. INEQ found that high level workers and man- agers were able to appropriate gains from product innovation but not from process inno- vation (see Box 3.1). This finding shows that one of the reasons underlying widening ine- qualities is linked to the inability of low paid workers to share in the benefits of economic growth. INEQ recommend strengthening labour market institutions to address this problem .

In mature European economies there has been a shift from manufacturing, which provided relatively well paid and regular employment for people with medium levels of skills, to services, where employment is more polar- ised between highly paid professional and managerial work and more routine manual service work. Findings from INEQ and PROFIT show that the polarisation of the employment composition impedes career progression and increases the difficulty of redressing the intergenera- tional transmission of inequality (see Section 3.5 below). These trends in Europe are simi- lar to those in the US and in both cases are in sharp contrast to the era of income compres- sion between the 1930s and mid 1970s ( 51 ). Economic restructuring, innovation and a highly educated and well trained workforce are critical to the development of a competi- tive, smart, knowledge economy (\u201cEurope 2020\u201d) but these economic, employment and educational changes are associated with wage polarisation, primarily due to the expan- sion of earnings at the top of the distribution relative to those lower down and the inability of labour (especially lower paid labour) to capture an adequate share of productivity gains ( 52 ) as findings from INEQ, RESIST, LoWER3 and EQUALSOC show. Similarly edu- cation is critical to promote social inclusion (51) See Piketty T. and Saez E. (2006) The Evolution of Top Incomes: A Historical and International Perspective, American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings 96(2): 200-205. (52) ILO (2008) op.cit.

        "K E Y T H E M A T I C R E S E A R C H F I N D I N G S RESIST, focusing more on spatial rather than social inequalities, identifies ways of promot- ing growth without exacerbating inequalities by bringing economic and social objectives together rather than relying on redistributive policies to moderate the outcomes of unequal growth and by widening the understanding of growth beyond GDP to include social objec- tives (see Box 3.2). 26 Box 3.1 Innovation and Inequality INEQ research provides some advance over conventional explanations linking technological change to wage polarisation by using better measures of polarisation and by distinguishing between different types of innovation (process and product) and finally by considering the implications for different types of occupations. The research shows industries associated with greater skill intensity tend to have higher levels of wage inequality, especially where product innovation is frequent. Managers and highly skilled workers are able to gain from the high returns associated with new products because technology and product markets are more concentrated than industries with process innovations. Process technologies are linked with a diffusion of knowledge across a wide range of sectors and while they raise productivity, the impact is more difficult to identify and gains less easy to capture and appropriate by managers and highly skilled workers. To redress these market tendencies towards increasing inequality INEQ ( 53 ) recommends that labour market institutions be supported as they play a critical role promoting a greater sharing of productivity gains and opportunities for workers to raise their skills in the workplace. Box 3.2 The knowledge economy paradigm should not focus only on economic growth but should include social cohesion goals RESIST identifies ways in which regulatory regimes and policies on science, technology and innovation (STIs) could be redesigned so that scientific advance would more likely counter than reinforce existing economic and social inequalities within and between member states. RESIST shows how existing policy frameworks are implicitly based on a Knowledge Economy Policy Paradigm with the primary focus on growth, productivity and competitiveness. Within this framework knowledge generators are assumed to be private firms and benefits assumed to trickle down to a wider population. RESIST shows that STIs are more likely to contribute to redressing global inequalities and inequalities between EU regions if a Social Cohesion Policy Paradigm (SCoPP) is adopted. SCoPP takes equality and accountability as core objectives and values low technology and traditional indigenous knowledges in addition to economic goals. This way STIs are more likely to contribute to the combined goals of competitiveness and cohesion rather than just the knowledge economy pillar. In a similar vein, but relating to social ine- qualities, CAPRIGHT explores the possibilities for designing new measures of social well- being. As it can no longer be assumed that social cohesion follows from economic growth, CAPRIGHT proposes a broader set of measures drawing on the capabilities frame- work, similar to the United Nations in their Human Development Index, to encompass the combined goals of growth with cohesion. This framework would also better accommodate the social and environmental objectives within \u201cEurope 2020\u201d. (53) INEQ- Angelini, E., Farina, F. and Pianta, M.

(eds) Global Inequality, London: Polity Press. 3.2.2 The Knowledge Economy and Territorial Disparities Within the EU income disparities have dimin- ished between MS but increased between regions. DYNREG shows that countries where regional disparities increased strongly between 1995 and 2005 are also those where personal income inequalities have increased the most substantially. Taking an EU wide perspective, in order to redress overall inequality it is necessary to reduce inequalities between countries and regions as well as within countries. Regional policies aim to redress spatial inequalities in the EU and receive considerable funding through the EU Structural Funds. DYNREG shows, however, that socio-economic ine- qualities within regions and countries con- stitute 80 % of overall inequality ( 54 ). As a consequence DYNREG suggests that poli- cies to redress socio-economic inequalities within regions and countries rather than between countries might be given more attention at EU level . INEQ also comments that inequality is affected by many factors and that EU policies as a whole could be evalu- ated for their implications for inequality. 3.2.3 Education and Inclusion KATARSIS notes that exclusion in education can manifest itself in access, process, and outcome. All these forms of exclusion can have a cumulative effect leading to students dropping out of school and, given the chang- ing world of work, this trend has more lasting negative consequences than similar proc- esses from even a decade ago (see also Section 3.5.2). INCLUD-ED analyses educational systems which either contribute to social cohesion or exacerbate exclusion. Different approaches to segregating or grouping students in schools are associated with varied levels of inequal- ity and academic achievement. The project has identified methods schools use in segregating students into different groups (tracking and streaming) and in including het- erogeneous students in the classroom (mix- ture and inclusion) (see Box 3.3). Box 3.3 Segregating and Inclusive Methods in Education [INCLUD-ED] \u2022\u2022 Tracking segregates students into different tracks, e.g. into vocational and academic tracks in different schools. \u2022\u2022 Streaming uses different curricula according to students\u2019 ability, where different teachers works with a groups of more and less able children. \u2022\u2022 Mixture is based on a traditional classroom set-up with a diverse student body in terms of ability or culture being taught together by one teacher in the classroom. \u2022\u2022 Inclusion retains heterogeneity of the class- room and engages professionals, families, volunteers to support all students in a common environment. Tracking generates inequalities, which are greater for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and when tracking starts at an early age (in some countries as early as 10). Because tracking can deter access to higher education, and reduce thus long term oppor- tunities, postponing tracking can lower ine- qualities between students and schools. Comprehensive school systems can serve as a counter to early segregation. Streaming also widens the differences between students and lowers their academic performance, especially among low achievers. Students in the lower ability stream often come from Inequalities-100924.indd 27 27/09/10 16:21 ",

It concludes that the \u201cpatterns of lifelong learning appear to reflect, rather than challenge, these inequalities, i.e. it is the already better edu- cated segments of society who dispropor- tionately secure access the new learning opportunities\u201d( 55 ) (LLL2010). 28 Besides, employees with higher levels of edu- cation have greater access to training in the workplace, especially in the public sector. This pattern of unequal access, researchers argue, may be further intensified by increased involvement of the private sector in the pro- vision of lifelong learning (LLL2010). disadvantaged backgrounds, and streaming further exacerbates their lack of opportuni- ties. Mixture is associated with compromised outcomes for students and often leads to school failure for pupils from a disadvantaged background. In contrast, inclusion overcomes these problems as all students, including vulnerable groups, experience better rela- tionships and have more opportunities to learn . INCLUD-ED also emphasizes the importance of social agents to children\u2019s education. Fam- ily and community involvement helps to over- come inequalities and stereotypes, improves the coordination between home and school and meets the needs of children and commu- nities to a greater degree. Furthermore, involvement of women from the community (in addition to female teachers) helps in reaching more egalitarian gender roles. Inso- far as the educational system is the extension of care, the report recommends that fathers too should be encouraged to participate in the school activities. These research results, if taken into account by policy makers, require fundamental changes in our national educational systems. Typically, European countries treat lifelong learning as a \u201ccradle to grave\u201d practice, and many are reforming their early childhood and primary education systems. For example, the UK\u2019s Sure Start programme aims to provide young children, especially those with disad- vantaged backgrounds, with the necessary skills to gain from compulsory school educa- tion. Lifelong learning generally relates to post school education and is focused on skills training for the knowledge economy. The LLL2010 project studies lifelong learning policies in 13 European countries and how (55) LLL2010: SP1_Exec_Summary: pp. 12. Box 3.4 Lifelong learning and the persistence of inequality [LLL2010] LLL2010 reviews the lifelong learning policies in 13 MS and points to their inherent weaknesses, as exemplified by Slovenia, Scotland and Estonia. \u2022\u2022 In Slovenia, access to education has become highly selective and inequality is growing as those with lower educational levels, older people, and those with lower occupational status are less likely to participate in lifelong learning programmes. \u2022\u2022 Scotland\u2019s focus on human capital in lifelong learning strategies suggests that disadvantaged and excluded groups who often only get poorly paid work may have less chance to develop than those who make larger contributions to the economy. \u2022\u2022 In Estonia individuals pay for their own training, which is linked to the increase in inequalities in training by excluding people with lower incomes from participation.

        "In post-socialist states, the potential of edu- cation and life long learning programmes to reduce inequalities is related to the wider context of the political economy. The social- ist goal of broadening participation in educa- tion and reducing inequality was abandoned and the introduction of market forces into education appears to exacerbate inequality. While inequality in access to education has increased, it is persons with higher education who are better able to adapt to changing mar- ket conditions (LLL2010). The polarisation of the employment composition also impedes career progression and increases the diffi- culty of redressing the intergenerational transmission of inequality as shown by PROFIT and INEQ and discussed further in Section 3.4 below. Access to lifelong learning is differentiated by such social divisions as gender, age, ethnic- ity, and region. Generally, women are more likely to participate in formal education and lifelong learning, but this advantage does not translate well into labour market success and within vocational training programmes there are greater numbers of men. Younger people are more likely to participate in education and training than older age groups. Ethnic minor- ities are often deprived due to linguistic or other culturally-based forms of exclusion. Despite this recognition and a range of poli- cies for ethnic minorities, reliable quantita- tive data about learning provisions for these groups and about take-up is lacking. Finally, there is regional variation in access to educa- tion between urban and rural areas (LLL2010). 3.2.4 Key Messages and Policy Implications \u2022\u2022 Research shows that existing policy frameworks are implicitly based on a Knowledge Economy Policy Paradigm with the primary focus on growth, productivity W H Y S O C I O - E C O N O M I C I N E Q U A L I T I E S I N C R E A S E ? 29 and competitiveness. Within this frame- work knowledge generators are assumed to be private firms and benefits assumed to trickle down to a wider population. Poli- cies on science, technology and innovation are more likely to contribute to redressing inequalities if they integrate social mech- anisms or help value other inputs such as low technology and traditional indigenous knowledges in addition to economic goals . \u2022\u2022 Current innovation policies in industrial sectors where product innovation is high may actually reinforce socio-economic inequalities and thus weaken the innova- tion potential of Europe . Effective labour market institutions in these industrial sectors would make possible an improved trade-off between economic growth and economic and technological innovation on the one hand and socio-economic equal- ity and improvement of skills on the other hand. \u2022\u2022 If we look at inequalities spatially, inequal- ity between MS has generally decreased but inequality between EU regions has increased . Even more worrying, inequal- ity within EU regions has greatly increased . Socio-economic inequalities between peo- ple are thus much more visible now and put a strain on the socio-economic and politi- cal coherence of entire regions or cities of Europe. \u2022\u2022 Education, including lifelong learning, is essential to innovation. However, the Framework Programme research shows that education is more often likely to rein- force socio-economic inequalities than fight them because the European educa- tional systems often participate actively to various forms of social segregation . Edu- cation and lifelong learning should provide improved guarantees for adequate and fair returns in the labour market and personal development. Inequalities-100924.indd 29 27/09/10 16:21 ",

In particular, atypical work with shorter hours, intermittent and tempo- rary working has expanded and these jobs have lower relative rates of remuneration, especially at the lower end of the distribution as demonstrated by INEQ, EQUALSOC, LoWER3, WELLCHI and PROFIT. INEQ also shows that earnings inequalities are higher in industries with greater labour market dynamics or turnover and where labour regulations and the power of trade unions are lower.

Figure 3.3 from the INEQ project shows how the gap in wages between work- ers with permanent and temporary contracts varies between MS, with particularly high gaps in Sweden, though here the proportion of temporary workers is relatively small. More generally, INEQ and EQUALSOC show this gap is higher in countries characterised by more regulated labour markets, suggesting some- thing of an insider/outsider differentiation within these countries \u2013 with trade unions being able to protect the interests of perma- nent workers but less so for those on tempo- rary contracts. -40% -45% -50% -35% -30% -25% -20% -15% -10% -5% 0% - 3 7 . 6 % SE FR EL AT BE PT PL IT ES LU IE SI LT CZ UK EE LV - 2 8 % - 2 6 . 4 % - 2 3 . 4 % - 2 2 . 5 % - 2 1 . 6 % - 2 1 % - 1 8 . 8 % - 1 6 . 7 % - 1 6 . 3 % - 1 6 % - 1 0 . 8 % - 8 % - 7 . 4 % - 4 . 5 % - 1 . 9 % - 1 % Inequalities-100924.indd 30 27/09/10 16:21 ",

EQUALSOC demonstrates that in Italy, where the proportion of young workers in atypical forms of employment has increased in recent years (see Figure 3.4), those entering atypi- cal employment, including well educated school leavers, were likely to experience repeated spells of such employment rather than a fast move into regular contracts. Furthermore, these atypical jobs were not additions to employment but were substitutes for regular jobs ( 57 ). This finding suggests that deregulating the labour market does not nec- essarily lead to an expansion of employment, as often expected, but rather undermines employment quality and earnings, thus increasing socio-economic inequalities .

LoWER3 research shows that not only do non standard workers earn less because in general they work for fewer hours but also because they are likely to be paid less for each hour they do work, even when differences in education and experience are taken into account , which reflects the contin- ued existence of a part time and atypical work pay penalty and represents a \u201cserious flaw\u201d in the labour market ( 58 ). As women are more likely than men to work shorter hours, the part time penalty is associated with the gender pay gap as shown by LoWER3 (see Section 3.4 below). 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % 10 % 30 % 50 % 70 % 90 % 1998-03 1995-97 1990-94 1985-89 1980-84 1975-79 1970-74 Not employed Typical job Atypical job Other non-standard Inequalities-100924.indd 31 27/09/10 16:21 ",
        "K E Y T H E M A T I C R E S E A R C H F I N D I N G S 32 There is also a connection between the sta- tus of the employment contract and risk of poverty that is found in MS with very different labour market structures and overall wealth. For example, the risk of poverty was between two to five times higher between non stand- ard and full time employees in Romania, Fin- land and the United Kingdom in 2007 ( 59 ). This finding, together with the research from LoWER3, EQUALSOC, PROFIT and INEQ which shows that education and training are not suf- ficient to redress low pay, suggests that the broader processes shaping labour markets need to be reviewed thoroughly if the MS do not want to see socio-economic inequalities increase further and undermine social cohe- sion and economic development. 3.3.3 Key Messages and Policy Implications \u2022\u2022 Non standard forms of work have been increasing in all MS. They provide more flexibility for employers and to some degree for employees but they are associated with widening earnings inequality and the expansion of in-work poverty. \u2022\u2022 The labour market is not functioning cor- rectly as equivalently qualified non stand- ard workers are paid less for equivalent work. The inability of labour to capture an adequate share of productivity gains con- stitutes a major problem in Europe . It is important to combat low pay directly as well as finding ways of allowing productiv- ity gains to be shared more equally between capital and labour and between high and low paid workers. To redress market imperfections, the EU and the MS should support labour market institutions as they play a critical role in wage negotiation and (59) EUROSTAT (2010) op.cit.

These MS show that it is possible to combine economic growth and modernisation with lower degrees of labour market inequality and so better reflect European values of growth with cohesion that other states might follow. \u2022\u2022 These findings also suggest that it is important to find ways of ensuring security alongside flexibility. Ways of securing fair remuneration, reflecting skills and pro- ductivity are required . Genuine flexicurity policies with an equal focus on flexibility AND security are necessary. 3.4 Persistent Gender Inequality As declared by the European Commission, equality between women and men is a funda- mental right, a common value of the EU and a necessary condition for the achievement of the EU objectives of growth, employment and social cohesion ( 60 ). Progress has been made through equal treatment legislation, gender mainstreaming and specific measures for the advancement of women. On average, the EU has approached the Lisbon 60 % target employment rate, rising from 53.7 % in 2000 to 58.6 % in 2009 in EU-27 countries ( 61 ). Increasing female employment, including growing participation by mothers, reflects one of the defining economic and social developments of recent decades Inequalities-100924.indd 32 27/09/10 16:21 ",

More and more women are dependent on their individ- ual earnings owing to changes in family com- position and an increasing proportion of children spend at least part of their childhood in a single-parent family headed primarily by women (WELLCHI). 3.4.1 Gender, Parenting and Pay Flexible working enables people, primarily mothers, to balance paid work with caring responsibilities but it is not sufficient to redress gender inequality in employment as these forms of working are not available in all occupations (see Box 3.5). Women\u2019s over representation in low paid sec- tors and occupations and non standard work can partly be attributed to the continuing une- ven responsibility between women and men for childcare and domestic work. In particu- lar, parenthood affects women and men differently, the extent of difference varying between MS (see Figure 3.5). Box 3.5 Flexible Work, Precarity and Low Pay Flexible, part-time and non-standard forms of employment have contributed to raising women\u2019s employment rates, in line with securing Lisbon goals. However, flexible jobs are more often found in low paid work and bring higher risks of subsequent unemployment excluding individuals from secure and stable labour market positions with future risks of social exclusion ( 63 ). People working non-standard hours are also more likely to be paid less even when in the same form of work (See Section 3.3.2). Women are over represented in flexible and non-standard work so the part-time penalty is equivalent to a gender pay gap. In the UK, for example, 25 % of women in high skill jobs downgrade occupationally when they switch to part-time work and for those who change employer to do so, this figure rises to 43 %. A woman who downgrades and changes employer simultaneously will experience on average 32 % drop in earnings. Reversing these changes leads to less than 50 % recovery of the losses. Both the extent of flexible working and the scale of the pay penalty vary among MS, and are lower in the Nordic countries ( 64 ). (62) LoWER3: Gregory, M., Beblo, M. Salverda, W. and Theodossiou,I.

        "K E Y T H E M A T I C R E S E A R C H F I N D I N G S Although work pressures, such as long, unso- cial and unpredictable hours, affect women and men equally, gender differences exist in work-life conflict. EQUALSOC finds that, for all the 23 Member States studied, caring responsibilities increase time based conflicts only for women while job insecurity affects strain-based conflicts for men. These find- ings indicate the deeply entrenched charac- ter of gender divisions between caring and bread winning ( 65 ). Mothers, more than fathers, interrupt their careers through leave and move to jobs with shorter hours. As women\u2019s qualifications match those of men, under-utilising their human capital is socially inefficient (LoWER3). Additionally, Framework Programme 6 re- search (EQUALSOC; INEQ; LoWER3) confirms that motherhood related career breaks carry substantial and lasting wage penalties, with the size of the penalty rising with the dura- tion of the employment interruption . Institu- tional environments play an important role as in countries where working motherhood is not supported the wage penalties are higher. These unequal patterns throughout the life- course result in a higher at-risk of poverty rates among older women than older men (see Figure 3.6). 34 (cid:96) Figure 3.5 Employment Impact of Parenthood for Women and Men 25-49, 2008 (%) Source: EC (2010) Statistical Annex to the Report on Equal Opportunities between Women and Men NB The graph plots difference in % points in employment rates with presence of a child under 12 and without the presence of children.

        "The increase in female participation has also been associated with a decline in fertility, owing to the difficulties of combining mother- hood with a career. In the Nordic countries and in France by contrast, the increase in female work force participation is associated with an increase in fertility, indicating how state support for working parents and espe- cially working mothers can facilitate both roles. This finding is especially important given the \u201cEurope 2020\u201d objective of raising the overall employment rate to 75 % which is likely to require a higher rate for women than the current 60 %. More importantly for policy makers this positive association between employment participation and fertility is only found where part-time jobs are of high quality. Policy makers can be reluctant to address what might seem to be private \u201cchoices\u201d with respect to household gender decisions regarding how best to meet their require- ments for income with their desire to secure the best care for their children. However, these private \u201cchoices\u201d take place in a con- text that is shaped by social decisions with respect to parental leave entitlements, labour market regulations and the gender imbalance in pay. The role of women in child-care is associated with life-long disparities in eco- nomic status. Rebalancing responsibilities for caring towards fathers may help in address- ing the unequal and gendered labour market outcomes.

        "K E Y T H E M A T I C R E S E A R C H F I N D I N G S 3.4.2 Key Messages and Policy Implications \u2022\u2022 Owing to gender inequalities within employ- ment and women\u2019s over representation in non standard work, women and their dependent children are at a greater risk of poverty than men . \u2022\u2022 Available, accessible and affordable child- care, together with high quality part-time work are key in allowing the female labour market participation rate to rise without reducing fertility . \u2022\u2022 The right to \u201crequest\u201d flexible working needs to be strengthened to become a \u201cright to work flexibly \u201d to ensure that shorter working hours are available in a wider range of occupations and that the right has some practical outcome. \u2022\u2022 Removing the association between non- standard hours and low pay would contrib- ute to redressing wage inequality and the gender pay gap . Potentially this would also contribute to narrowing the gender division in domestic work and child care by increas- ing the likelihood of fathers working flexibly. \u2022\u2022 Measures for fathers to play a greater role in childcare and school activities through paid paternity and parental leaves should be supported . Policies such as Nordic \u201cdaddy\u201d leaves can be instrumental in changing attitudes and practices. \u2022\u2022 These measures are necessary in order to prevent motherhood imposing large and lasting earnings penalties on women, as well as to better combine both goals of larger female employment rates and higher fertility rates. 3.5 Persistent Child Poverty and Intergenerational Transmission of Inequality Socio-economic changes in European socie- ties, outlined above, are associated with persistent, and in some cases growing, patterns of child poverty and an interrelated process of intergenerational transmission of socio-economic inequalities. These patterns imply that existing policies to tackle poverty and inequality are inadequate and point to the need for more effective measures that not only respond to unequal outcomes, but also address processes leading to them. Child poverty is a major social and policy problem because children growing up in pov- erty face a high risk of exclusion and can be subjected to intergenerational transmission of poverty ( 66 ). PROFIT, for example, finds that education alone cannot overcome family disadvantage as returns from education tend to be lower for people from low income backgrounds. 3.5.1 Child Poverty and Inequality 36 (66) Based on Eurostat (2010) Combating poverty and social exclusion 2010 edition.

According to EUROSTAT data, child poverty and exclusion entails inequality of access to resources and opportunities, and is often linked to discrimination. It may restrain children from achieving their full potential, adversely affecting their health, inhibiting their personal development, education and general well-being ( 67 ).

        "Over the last two decades child poverty has risen in 17 out of 24 OECD countries for which data are available (WELLCHI). The prevalence of child poverty, however, varies among Euro- pean countries, and variation tends to follow the classification of welfare state regimes ( 68 ). As Figure 3.7 shows, in 2008 the Nordic states had the lowest at-risk-of-poverty rates (with Denmark leading the group at 9 %), while Mediterranean and some Central and East- ern European countries had the highest (with Romania reaching 33 %).

In addition to old class inequalities, new social risks increase its complexity. Social change in general, and family change in particular, have been linked to the growth and persistence of child poverty, but its re-emergence in recent years is con- nected mainly with: \u2022\u2022 the shift from industrial societies to service and knowledge-based economies associ- ated with polarisation of employment, the expansion of pay penalty attached to atyp- ical working in which women are over represented (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). \u2022\u2022 the decline of the male breadwinner model largely through increased participation of women in employment, as well as the emergence of new household forms, par- ticularly single-person households and single-parent households. 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% DK SI FI NL SE CZ CY AT DE SK EE BE FR (p) IE HU LU MT EU 27 PL EL PT LT UK (p) ES LV IT BG RO 2 0 . 3 % Inequalities-100924.indd 37 27/09/10 16:21 ",
        "K E Y T H E M A T I C R E S E A R C H F I N D I N G S These changes lead to increased reliance on individual earnings, and, as shown in Section 3.4, women are more likely than men to have sole responsibility for their children and, partly as a consequence, to have lower earn- ings, so that they and their children are more likely to be at-risk-of-poverty. The risk of pov- erty among children from single parent households was nearly double the average risk of poverty for all households with depend- ent children in 2007 (34 % compared with 18 %)( 70 ). This relationship is particularly disconcerting as there is a growth in the number of children spending at least some part of their life in a single parent family (WELLCHI). The other group most at risk is large family households with two parents and three or more children. As WELLCHI research notes, in population size terms most poor children in the EU live in two-parent house- holds, thus the increase in child poverty can- not be solely attributed to the growth of single-parent families (although in countries like the UK this is significant). 38 (cid:96) Figure 3.8 At-risk-of-poverty Rate of All Children and of Children Living in Households Most At Risk, 2007 (%) Source: Eurostat (2010: 46) ( 71 ) Note: The income reference period concerns the year preceding the survey year for the majority of countries.

The lower at-risk- of-poverty rates can be achieved despite hav- ing countervailing pressures from high proportions of lone-parent households. For example, in Sweden high rates of lone par- enthood (22 % of all households with children in 2001) are less of a factor in aggregate child poverty outcomes than high rates of lone par- enthood in the UK (17 %) ( 72 ). Clearly countries that devote more public resources to family and children tend to experience lower levels of child poverty.

Considering inequality among children in European countries more broadly, WELLCHI has devised an index of child well-being using 43 indicators and 7 clusters (material situa- tion, housing and environment, health, sub- jective well-being, education, children's relationships, risk and safety), resulting in a ranking of 27 EU Member States (as well as Israel and Norway) with the Netherlands and the Nordic States at the top of the league table of child well-being, while Malta, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia and Lithuania are at the bot- tom (See Figure 3.9). WELLCHI finds that \"child well-being is associated with inequal- ity; generally more unequal countries have lower child well-being\".

For example, PROFIT constructs a model (see Figure 3.10) which identifies the connections between the processes occurring in family, state, and economic contexts and how they are mediated through policies relat- ing to education, labour market and social welfare affecting children\u2019s status. Whether poverty and inequalities are transmitted inter-generationally depends on how these elements intersect for specific children. 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 LT LV BG RO MT UK HU PT EL PL EE IT SK CZ FR CY BE ES AT LU DE SL IE DK IS FI SE NO NL Inequalities-100924.indd 39 27/09/10 16:21 ",
        "K E Y T H E M A T I C R E S E A R C H F I N D I N G S Income inequality exhibits a strong tendency across generations and is regularly trans- mitted from parents to children. A disadvan- taged family background negatively affects children\u2019s opportunities with respect to both educational attainment and wage earn- ings (INEQ). For example, when children are selected into different schools based on ability and merit (often linked to their socio- economic status), and there is no mobility between these schools, family background becomes crucially important. As discussed in Section 3.2.2, exclusion in education can man- ifest itself in access, process, and outcome, and can have a cumulative effect of lasting negative consequences. Education systems which segregate students in such a way rein- force thus existing inequalities, rather than challenge them (KATARSIS, INCLUD-ED). WELLCHI research points out that early and sustained investment in children and families can help. Early childhood education, care and health, financial transfers and in-kind serv- ices are key mechanisms. A child investment strategy is seen as capable of breaking the cycle of inter-generational disadvantages, thus lessening socio-economic inequalities . 40 (cid:96) Figure 3.10 Analytical Model of Inter-generational Inheritance of Inequalities Source: PROFIT (2007) ( 75 ) (75) Policy Responses Overcoming Factors in the Intergenerational Transmission of Inequalities, Final Activity Report.

Box 3.6 Intergenerational Transmission of Poverty and Social Mobility EQUALSOC supplements survey data, with detailed qualitative research across 8 cities in states representing different welfare traditions \u2013 Anglo-Saxon (UK); Continental (DE), Nordic (FI), Mediterranean (IT) and cities in the new MS with more hybrid models (BG, EE, LV, PL). The research shows that 53 % of young people (aged 25-29) growing up in poverty remain in poverty. The intersection between family context, state welfare regime and community policies plays a key role in social mobility of young people. Educational, labour market and welfare policies and the ways in which these act in synergy are particularly influential (see Figure 3.10). INEQ analyses EU-SILC (Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) panel survey data from 13 countries: Anglo-Saxon (IE, UK); Continental (AT, BE, LU, FR, NE); Mediterranean (ES, IT); and Nordic (DK, FI, NO, SE). In all countries family composition (living with both parents and number of siblings), parents\u2019 educational attainment, and financial situation matter for intergenerational transmission of poverty with a separate effect on education and on earned wages, for example: \u2022\u2022 In Continental countries there is a 73 % proba- bility that a child of a parent with university degree will attend university, while having parents with lower education decreases this probability to a 20 % chance. The effect of educational attainment is compounded by financial distress, particularly in the Mediterranean countries. \u2022\u2022 Wages are influenced by parental education, own education and by parental earnings. In general education leads to higher earnings. However education has a less positive effect on earnings of people coming from low income households. An income family poor background reduces earnings by as much as 6 % in all countries, except the Nordic States and the Netherlands EQUALSOC and INEQ research points to the importance of institutional and policy arrange- ments. Low intergenerational earnings mobility tends to occur in countries with high levels of income inequality measured at a point in time, and vice versa . Nordic coun- tries fall at one end of the spectrum where wages and educational degrees are not related to family background and living stand- ards. In contrast, Mediterranean states fall at the other end where all background variables affect both wages earned and educational levels. Continental and Anglo-Saxon systems fall in between the two extremes with varied influence of family background on either edu- cational or wage outcomes. These conclu- sions support the established classification of welfare state regimes ( 76 ). PROFIT and INEQ direct our attention to pol- icy making and implementation and identify key barriers to social mobility (see Box 3.7). The extent to which the transmission of ine- quality and poverty is perceived by policy makers as an issue for public concern and social policy vary . In the UK and Germany the reduction of child poverty was specified as a government priority but not in the 6 other countries studied. Indeed, top level officials considered the problem to be a purely private family matter (PROFIT). Inequalities-100924.indd 41 27/09/10 16:21 ",

Family composi- tion and employment status are closely related to child poverty. As men\u2019s and women\u2019s contribution in care and financial support to families takes place within spe- cific institutional environments, policies must address the problems of unequal participation in these spheres. \u2022\u2022 Policies must respond more effectively to changing family and labour market pat- terns . Policy choices must combine strat- egies facilitating employment among parents in jobs that are of good quality and are well rewarded, strategies effectively redistributing resources to the poor, and strategies aimed at different groups of children with respect to education and care. \u2022\u2022 Education and learning policies can con- tribute to overcoming intergenerational transmission of inequality in addition to policies combating poverty. However, edu- cation and learning should be viewed in connection with other social factors related to exclusion (employment, econ- omy, youth, healthcare, justice, housing and social services), include practical and contextual knowledge and address social as well as human capital. 42 Box 3.7 Persistence of income inequality [INEQ, PROFIT] ( 77 ) \u2022\u2022 Inadequate awareness of the issue \u2022\u2022 \u201cTolerance\u201d of or limited aversion to inequality \u2022\u2022 Insufficient political and institutional opposition to inequality \u2022\u2022 Changes in commitment to inequality due to changes in political leadership \u2022\u2022 Scarce funding \u2022\u2022 Limited or lack of policy coordination \u2022\u2022 Inability to address both causes and outcomes of inequality \u2022\u2022 Lack of coordination among decision centres at various levels of government (77) INEQ European Policy Brief 2009: 5; PROFIT, final report.

This increase has happened during a period of economic growth. Economic modernisa- tion and labour market deregulation has resulted in employment polarisation and widening earnings inequalities that have not been offset by social transfers or other poli- cies . Professional and managerial workers have gained from the productivity increases but lower paid workers are more likely to have experienced precarious and intermittent working resulting in an expansion of the in- work poor. Paid employment which has formed a key element of the EES and social policies no longer provides a guaranteed route out of poverty. Poverty is transmitted from one generation to the next and increased education is not sufficient to overcome child- hood family disadvantages. Given unequal caring responsibilities, women are more likely than men to be in non-standard employ- ment and at greater risk of poverty. The rise in single motherhood adds to the problem of intergenerational transmission of poverty owing to their constrained opportunities in the labour market and their over representation in low paid work. This pattern of modernisation at the expense of socio-economic cohesion is contrary to the values and objectives of EU policies . The research projects demonstrate that policies can significantly modify the effects Inequalities-100924.indd 44 27/09/10 16:21 ",
        "\u2022\u2022 widening measures of economic perform- ance, beyond GDP per capita to include social objectives , perhaps by adopting a capabilities approach as in the UNDP but modified to suit the European context. For example child poverty could be considered as an indicator of social development and economic performance. Prevention should repay intervention owing to the long term adverse effects of child poverty, including transmission to the next generation; \u2022\u2022 combating low pay directly to ensure that labour and low paid labour in particular receive a fair share of productivity increases in order to redress inequality overall and prevent work poverty, gender inequality and child poverty. To do so EU and MS should provide support for labour market institutions as they play a critical role in wage negotiation and develop comprehen- sive and inclusive educational policies to reduce inter-generational transmission of poverty and inequality among children, improve lifelong learning and training opportunities for the unemployed, inactive, and persons at lower educational and occupational levels; \u2022\u2022 ensuring that shorter working hours are available in a wider range of occupations without any pay penalty to redress gender inequality and facilitate greater involve- ment of fathers in the care of their children; \u2022\u2022 strengthening the political commitment to reducing social and economic inequality to meet the EU and national goals of social cohesion and social inclusion. To do so the EU could: - learn from the experiences of countries where inequalities are least severe; - examine the potential impact of a more preventative approach through appropri- ate social investment strategies; - examine the potential impact of an amel- iorative approach through appropriate redistributive measures; W H Y S O C I O - E C O N O M I C I N E Q U A L I T I E S I N C R E A S E ? 45 of socio-economic change. The projects con- firm that the Nordic countries, and to a lesser extent the Western European countries that follow a corporatist model of welfare, have less socio-economic inequalities and at the same time consistently outperform other European countries on social and economic criteria. This pattern of modernisation has also an important social and economic cost for the EU . Countries with large socio-economic ine- qualities have greater social problems than countries with less socio-economic ine- qualities, whether we speak about poverty, educational achievements, criminality or other social disorders. Equally important for the EU, socio-economic inequalities run counter to economic growth and innovation by leaving a large part of the population out- side the modernisation process and actually putting a break on modernisation . Preventing the emergence of inequalities is preferable to redressing unequal outcomes and specific policy implications from the research are listed below. 4.2 Holistic Approach to Social and Economic Policies and Redressing Inequality To combat inequality it is crucial to represent the interconnections between economic change and socio-economic inequality in the formulation of EU economic and social policies. Economic growth does not enhance social well being equally and less socio-economic inequalities do promote stronger and more sustainable growth as well as other social benefits, including for the better-off. Adapt- ing the innovation paradigm is thus very important . In this regard the research shows that to redress the widening inequalities of recent decades the EU should consider: Inequalities-100924.indd 45 27/09/10 16:21 ",

This is why the European Union needs to put policies against socio-economic inequalities at the heart of its action, for the benefit of all citizens. - consider ways to modernise and reinforce the long standing values contained in the European Social Model especially as the perceived advantages of the Anglo-US model for economic growth have dimin- ished with the recession and have been associated with rising inequality and less cohesion.

        "There is now compelling scientifi c evidence that since the mid-1970s socio-economic inequalities have greatly increased in the world and also in Europe. What the research in social sciences and the humanities clearly show is that countries with higher socio-economic inequalities also experience more acute socio- economic problems \u2013 whether we are speaking about lower economic growth, more violence, poorer educational achievements, lower civic or electoral participation or higher mortality rates. At the same time, we have experienced sustained economic growth since the 1980s. This means that the kind of growth experienced over the last decades fosters inequalities and, with them, all the social and economic evils that strike the European Union and weaken it as a model for progress and well-being. The way forward is a new socio-ecological model which will have the European democratic values of equity and progress at its heart and make sure that socio-economic inequalities will decline and soon.
