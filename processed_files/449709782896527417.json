        "EP NEWS October 24-28, 1994 The week in Strasbourg \u2022 MEPs were out in force this week to vote through an 80bn ECU budget for 1995 on the assumption that the Twelve will have grown to Sixteen. The first reading draft now goes back to Council before returning to Parliament for a second and final reading in December, the under standing being that 600m ECU will remain blocked until all the national Parliaments have authorised an increase in own resources from 1.20 to 1.21%. \u2022 MEPs also endorsed plans to expand European education youth exchange and vocational training programmes, a priority for the future, and a proposal to grant voting rights in local elections to citizens from other EU countries was approved. \u2022 A call was made for firm action at a European level to tackle the growing threat of racism and xenophobia, and as the week came to a close British Labour and Tory MEPs clashed over trade union rights. European Parliament y AX-AD-94-9-EN-C ISSN-0250-5754 - EP NEWS (UK Edition) Anger as steel plan is abandoned \u2022 Steel industry \u2014 industry ministers to examine its future in November \u00a9 Belga IN voting through a 80bn ECU draft budget for 1995 to accommodate enlargement, MEPs sent a clear invitation to the people of Sweden and Norway to follow Finland and Austria and vote for EU membership in the forth coming referenda to be held next month. Council, on the other hand, had been adopting a wait and see approach by submitting figures just for the Twelve. But as budget committee spokesman Terry Wynn (Merseyside East and Wigan, PES) explained, this year's procedure was fraught with difficulties \u2014 not least on Budget move opens way to larger union account of Italy's backtracking on the 1992 Edinburgh Summit on agreement to increase the Union's revenue from 1.2% to 1.21% until it could settle the dispute over milk quotas. MEPs forced the issue by threatening to withhold payments to Italy and a deal was struck by finance ministers. Nonetheless, as Mr Wynn pointed out, this is unlikely to be approved by all national parliaments before the middle of next year, leaving Parliament with no alternative but to freeze the additional amount in question \u2014 some 600m ECU of mainly regional spending \u2014 until the money becomes available. Otherwise MEPs maintained the 37bn ECU figure for agriculture, 26bn ECU for regional and social spending but increased spending on education and development assistance. The foreign aid budget, comprising assistance to Eastern Europe, the Third World and the Middle East, now stands at almost 5bn ECU and includes some 125m ECU for the special European programme to help alleviate poverty in the black townships of South Africa and 20m ECU earmarked for a new hospital for Mostar in Bosnia-Herzogovina. But not all MEPs were happy with the outcome. \"Sleaze, fraud and blackmail\" was how John Tomlinson (Birmingham West, PES) described the deal to let Italy and Spain off with a 3.2bn ECU fine for exceeding milk quotas in exchange for the UK dropping its court case. The British government had been \"bought off' with a 45m ECU \"bribe\" for the Scotch whisky industry, he alleged, although James Elles (Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire East, EPP) took the view the agreement was a sensible compromise. Ian Paisley (Northern Ireland, Ind), on the other hand, was angry at what he saw as a climbdown when other dairy farmers, in particular those in Northern Ireland, had suffered hardship and a loss of income through abiding by the rules on milk quotas. The poverty action programme proved another bone of contention, for although the House voted through some 15m ECU for next year it remains blocked in the face of German resistance. Council President-in-Office Roswitha Verh\u00fclsdonk told MEPs that Germany took the view that the prime responsibility for tack ling poverty lay with the member states, and that financial assistance to deal with social problems was available under the Social Fund. The draft budget now goes back to Council for a second read ing before coming to Parliament for a final reading in December. MEPs reacted angrily to the Commission's plan to aban don its restructuring pro gramme for the steel industry. The intention was to achieve a 19-26 million tonne reduction in surplus capaci ty Europe-wide on the basis of \"voluntary\" cut-backs by continental producers, especially those benefiting from state aids. But it has not worked and, as European in dustry begins to move out of the recession, some plants are gearing up for an increase in output. Failure British MEPs were particularly anxious about the consequences of the failure of the plan for British producers in view of the painful restructuring and job losses that have already taken place in the United Kingdom. Pointing to the closure of the Ravenscraig plant in Scotland, Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands, ERA) recalled that at the time reference had been made to the Commission's demands for cut-backs, while David Bowe (Cleveland and Richmond, PES) said the British steel industry would feel badly let down by the Commission's failure to cut out state subsidies for continental producers. Referring to the Corby plant, Angela Billingham (Northampton shire and Blaby, PES) noted that on top of losing EU funding under the RESIDER programme, and seeing 160 jobs go, the industry there would be placed on an even more precarious footing as a result of this decision. Glenys Kinnock (South Wales East, PES) wanted to know what lay in store for the long-term future of steel production. It would be scandalous if the British industry was forced to undertake more cut-backs, she said. Other MEPs were annoyed at the way the decision was disclosed through the press and the failure of the Commissioners responsible, Karel van Miert and Martin Bangemann, to appear before the House. It was left to Commissioner Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi to explain that cuts of just 11 million tonnes had been achieved, although a reduction of a further five million tonnes for the Italian industry agreed in June had been linked to continuing aid for restructuring. It now falls on industry ministers to look at the situation again at their next meeting in November Programmes that are helping Europe's young \u2014 see page 2 EXPENSES CUTBACK IN A move to reduce the costs of running the new 567 member Parliament \u2014 set to rise to 641 following enlargement \u2014 MEPs voted to cut back their travel expenses by freezing the mileage allowance and limiting the use of taxis to journeys between the station or airport and the three places of work. Foreign travel is to be curbed with savings of 10m ECU achieved through cutting back on delegations. 1 ",
        "European Parliament \u2014 EP News Balance that will tilt towards English W ITH Finland voting to join the Union as from next January attention now switches to Sweden and Norway where referenda will be held on November 13 and 28. Parliament's officials however, are preparing for the arrival of new MEPs from the Scandinavian countries and Austria, which will see the number of MEPs increase from 567 to 641, assuming all the countries accede. Apart from squeezing them all into a Strasbourg chamber not yet large enough, the other main problem is accommodating three extra languages which will see the total number of combinations jump from 72 to 132. While documents for some political group meetings are restricted to English, French, German and Spanish, a democratic body like the European Parliament can hardly ask MEPs not to speak in their mother tongue. Legislation, too, will have to be translated into the new languages, but as far as day-to-day communications are concerned the balance will tilt away from French towards English. Many of the Scandinavians speak English as a second language and will no doubt be expecting to find information in a language they understand. Active aid for disabled T HE all-party Disablement Intergroup is one of the most active of Parliament's increasing number of pressure groups that brings together some 100 MEPs from different European countries on a cross-party basis. Its aim \u2014 confirmed at a meeting of the European Disability Forum held in Brussels on 17 and 18 October \u2014 is to see comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation at a European level to give disabled people full civil rights as is the case in America. The exclusion of disabled people from public places such as restaurants or cinemas is no longer acceptable. The group's action programme is to concentrate on four main themes: an acceptable definition of disability, genetics and the consequences for the disabled, independent living and sexuality. British, German and Dutch MEPs are particularly involved in the newly constituted group now chaired by Barbara Schmidbauer (G, PES), although the group is anxious to expand southwards and involve more French, Portuguese, Italian and Greek MEPs. It is particularly busy at this time of the year when budget discussions are taking place and its target now is to see a 65% slice of the HORIZON budget, designed to promote employment amongst disadvantaged groups, allocated to projects benefiting disabled people. The 246m ECU programme has now been merged with the NOW and YOUTH initiatives geared towards assisting women and young people. The group has been active on other fronts, too. Following pressure by its supporters, MEPS only last month adopted an amendment designed to improve access to lifts for wheelchairs. It is now pressing for improvements to the draft legislation on buses and coaches to contain a mandatory provision to facilitate access for the disabled. British MEPs prominent in the group include Hugh McMahon (Strathclyde West, PES) and Christine Oddy (Coventry and North Warwickshire, PES), Tom Megahy (Yorkshire South West, PES), Richard Howitt (Essex South, PES), John Corrie (Worcestershire and South Warwickshire EPP), Caroline Jackson (Wiltshire North and Bath, EPP) and Lord Plumb (Cotswolds, EPP).

High-note performance T HE European Community Youth Orchestra attracted the attention of the music world in London when it gave stunning performances of Brahms' Symphonies No. 2 and No. 4 at the Royal Albert Hall under Maestro Carlo Maria Giulini. As part of the BBC Promenade Series the orchestra played in honour of Giulini's 80th birthday to a live audience of 7,000 music lovers. The orchestra received standing ovations and wide acclaim. Other celebratory concerts were given under Giulini in Bolzano, Salzburg and Edinburgh, and the orchestra continued to tour under the baton of James Judd with concerts in Bonn, Berlin, Cottbus, Rotterdam and Amsterdam. The European Community Youth Orchestra, a British initiative renowned throughout the world as the Union's cultural flagship, comprises 130 young musicians from each of the member countries of the EU, who are chosen annually through national auditions. The orchestra's music director is Bernard Haitink. The Patrons of the orchestra are the prime ministers of each of the twelve member countries of the EU and its President is the President of the European Parliament, Dr Klaus Hansen. The orchestra is financially supported by the Commission of the European Communities, the European Parliament and the twelve member governments of the European Union. And music in the European Parliament is set to take off following the launch by the new Labour MEP for Essex West and Hertfordshire East, Hugh Kerr, of a cross-party musical inter-gro\u00fcp. The idea is to monitor copyright, audiovisual and trade issues likely to have an impact on the music industry as well as to stage musical events. HERBAL REMEDIES ARE SAFE T HERE is no truth in the rumour that herbal medicines are to be banned in the UK as a result of new European licensing procedures coming into force on 1 January, 1995, says Caroline Jackson (Wiltshire North and Bath, EPP). Not for the first time national civil servants, this time from the Department of Health, are to blame for the scare story. Mrs Jackson has discovered that although the 1968 Medicines Act exempts herbal remedies from licensing procedures, department officials are now seeking to include them under the new European system, although there has been no pressure from the European Commission to do so and no other EU country is planning similar moves. So now we know! YEAR FOR LIFELONG LEARNING T HE Commission has proposed that 1996 be designated as the 'European Year of Lifelong Learning'. According to the Commission, such an initiative would be a good way of highlighting the fundamental importance of education and training for the future of Europe, as well as complementing the actions to be developed under the SOCRATES and LEONARDO programmes. The proposal now goes to the Council of Ministers and Parliament for a decision. In its first reading of the 1995 EU budget Parliament included 3m ECU in preparation for the European Education Year in 1996. GRANT AID TO BOOST CULTURE A S in previous years, the Commission is inviting applications for grant aid under the EU's Kaleidoscope programme for the promotion of European arts and culture. Next year's scheme is being organised on three themes: cultural events with a European dimension with grants of up to 30,000 ECU possible, scholarships for creative and performing artists, and the establishment of cultural networks linking at least 3 EU countries. Application forms, which must be returned no later than 1 December this year can be obtained from Commission Offices in London (tel. 071-973 1992) or Dublin (tel. 01-671 2244) Driving force EARLIER this year the European Commission brought forward proposals for new EU education, vocational training and youth exchange programmes. With MEPs giving their verdict at second reading, this month's EP News looks at what the European Union has so far achieved in the field of education and what is on offer for students who are interested in spending some time studying in another European country. Schemes that will help youngsters go far AMBITIOUS new EU pro grammes to enable students and other young people to study or work abroad for short periods received Parliament's support this week in Stras bourg. The programmes \u2014 which are to be known as SOCRATES, LEONARDO and Youth for Europe \u2014 aim to encourage stu dent and teacher mobility, to give every young person the opportuni ty of vocational training and to promote youth exchanges. Building on the success of ex isting programmes such as ERASMUS and LINGUA, the new schemes will come into force on 1 January 1995, provided re maining difficulties between Council and Parliament can be quickly resolved. The first sticking point con cerns the Council's proposed 25% cut in the overall five-year budget to 1,485 million ECU. Both Parlia ment and the Commission want to see sufficient resources to allow the EU to meet its objectives in respect of young people. The second area of disagree ment surrounds the proposed committee arrangements which Parliament feels would reduce its role in monitoring the administra tion and implementation of the three new programmes. The pro posals with Parliament's amend ments now go back to Council. What the MEPs say on. .. . .. SOCRATES There is a need to ensure equal participation by young people from all disadvantaged groups, including the disabled and ethnic minorities, said Michael Elliott (London West, PES). Former primary head teacher Robert Evans (London North West, PES) was delighted the programme would go some way to improving language teaching in the UK, while Mark Killilea (Connacht/Ulster, EDA) welcomed the inclusion of Irish as an eligible language. LEONARDO Susan Waddington (Leicester, PES) said the programme should be \"non- elitist\", open to all, including the many people trapped in low-paid, low-skilled, casual employment. Those young people who have been excluded, whether because they leave school Without qualifications or no longer have the skills rele vant to the rapidly changing labour market, must be given a chance, insisted Brian Crowley (Munster, EDA), while David Morris (South and West Wales, PES) called for the programme to have adequate funding. . .. \\buth for Europe Mary Banotti (Dublin, EPP) feared that reduced funding would under mine the ambitious objectives of the programme. Parliaments youngest MEP, Eluned Morgan (Mid and West Wales, PES), thought the time had come to give young people the responsibility of managing their own projects. \"Encourage every young person to visit and enjoy the many cultures that colour our Member States,\" she said. BOOKSHELF A modern guide to the European Parliament \u2014 Martin Westlake London, Pinter, 1994 The Times guide to the European Parliament \u2014 a unique and essential guide to the European Parliament. Editor Robert Morgan, Times Books ISBN 072300708X \u00a325 THE first title is an exceptionally useful addition to the literature on the European Parliament written by a Commission official who follows the institutions closely. He offers a clear account of the way the Parliament now works and uses its powers in relation to the other institutions of the Union. The last part of the book is full of particularly good reference material: a glossary of parliamentary terms explaining much of the jargon used inside the Parliament, details of the development of the powers of the Parliament and a full bibliography. Easy to read and strongly recommended. The second publication is a unique and authoritative guide to the new Parliament, now updated, after the June 1994 elections. In addition to providing potted biographies of the new members, it contains a countrywide analysis of the election results and commentary on the implications for future European political developments. A must for the reference library. ",
        "European Parliament \u2014 EP News behind training in Europe IT IS fitting that one of the first tasks of the new Parliament following June's elections has been to consider the future shape of European pro grammes for young peo ple, since Parliament can rightly claim to have been the driving force behind Community involvement in education and training. During the early 1980s, when some member states were reluc tant to recognise a role for the EU in training and education, Parlia ment adopted a number of resolu tions calling for a specific European input. Eventually, with Parliament's budgetary support, programmes such as ERASMUS, LINGUA, COMETT and PETRA were established. These have pro ved highly successful. Since its launch in 1987 the ERASMUS programme has enabled more than 200,000 univer sity students and 15,000 teaching staff to study or teach for short periods in another country of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Last year applications to visit France, Germany and the UK ac counted for around half of all ap plications applied for. Sweden and Finland were the preferred EFTA destinations. This year's budget for ERASMUS is 82.5m ECU. The COMETT programme, worth 37m ECU this year, which is concerned with promoting co operation between universities and industry, assists about 7,000 trans national student placements each year. This year COMETT will be supporting more than 200 university-industry partnerships across 19 EU and EFTA countries. Under the PETRA and Youth for Europe exchange programmes young people gain work ex perience as well as experience of living abroad. This year, PETRA, with a budget of 40m ECU, will support 15,000 training place ments, a 25 % increase over 1993. Since its beginning in 1988 the Youth for Europe programme has enabled 160,000 young people to spend short periods of up to three weeks in another European coun try. It has a budget of 11m ECU this year. The LINGUA programme, in troduced in 1990 and with a budget this year of 43.5m ECU, was set up to promote language learning. So far, it has assisted about 10,000 student exchanges and 6,000 language teacher ex changes each year, including an exchange earlier this year between students from St. Catherine's Col lege, Armagh, and a college in Orleans, France. Other EU programmes helping young people include FORCE, which is concerned with continu ing vocational training, EUROTECNET, which links training and technology, and TEMPUS, which funds co operation and exchanges for students from Eastern Europe. With the first phase of EU funding for education, training and youth schemes ending this year, the end-of-term report is positive. The programmes have enabl ed many young people gain ex perience abroad, which is becoming of increasing impor tance in the search for jobs. They have reinforced the European dimension in studies and helped break down certain national pre judices. A whole series of net works linking universities, colleges and businesses across Europe have been established. Budgetary constraints, how ever, have limited the scale of European action. Only a small fraction of the 70 million young people in the EU have been able to benefit. While ERASMUS has enabl ed about 6% of students to study abroad, this is still short of the target of 10% originally proposed by the Commission. Another criticism is that young people from poorer backgrounds or ethnic minorities have not been able to fully participate. There are practical problems, too. Not all young people are in sured for health purposes when training abroad. In addition, some companies are still unwilling to recognise experience gained in another country as a part of training. Nevertheless, the value of European supported youth pro grammes is increasingly recognis ed. The Maastricht Treaty provides a solid base for continued EU action in respect of education and training, although, in line with subsidiarity, Articles 126 and 127 make clear that Community efforts are to support and supplement the role of the member states. Furthermore, the EU's White Paper on jobs identifies a central role for education and training in tackling Europe's unemployment crisis. With a view to meeting the commitments of the Maastricht Treaty and the White Paper, as well as strengthening and ra tionalising current EU actions, the Commission has proposed three new programmes: SOCRATES in the field of education, LEON ARDO for vocational training and Youth for Europe III. SOCRATES Named after the famous Athenian philosopher Socrates, who said \"I only know one thing: that I know nothing\", the EU's new education programme for 1995 to 1999 builds on the success of ERASMUS and LINGUA, as well as launching a new initiative for schools. It is to have three themes: a) in the field of higher educa tion, the promotion of stu dent and teacher mobility remains the top priority. The European Community Credit Transfer System (ECTS) for transferring academic credits between universities is to be extended. In addition, higher education establishments will increasingly be offered con tracts incorporating all the European-wide activities which they intend to conduct. This should simplify project presentations and applica tions for grants. b) Under a new initiative entitl ed COMENIUS there will be EU funds for partnerships in volving at least three schools, from three member states. The aim is to promote joint educational activities such as language learning and en vironmental or cultural pro jects. There will also be financial assistance for trans national projects concerned with the education of children from migrant and gypsy families. c) The LINGUA programme is being continued and reinforc ed, with particular priority to the teaching of least widely used languages. There will also be assistance for the development of open and distance learning and for ex changes of information and educational experiences. Mary Banotti (Dublin EPP) in sisted that Socrates should be open to all students, including student teachers. Mark Killilea (Connacht/ Ulster, EDA) welcomed the inclu sion of Irish as an eligible language under Socrates LEONARDO The new EU vocational training programme has been named after the Italian Renaissance painter Leonardo da Vinci in tribute to his vision and creativity. Replacing the PETRA, FORCE, COMETT and EURO TECNET programmes, its em phasis will be on supporting a member state's vocational training systems, developing a European dimension in training, promoting continuing training throughout working life and giving all young people the opportunity of voca tional training. It will support cross-border ex changes and placement program mes, the learning of languages and cooperation between universities and industry. Youth for Europe III This will extend the current pro gramme for a further five years until 1999. Its objectives are: \u2022 to promote exchanges for young people aged 15 to 24 \u2022 to support youth projects \u2022 to assist the training of youth leaders \u2022 to promote co-operation among member states \u2022 to promote exchanges with young people from non-EU countries To finance these ambitious new programmes the Commission would like to see increased fun ding for the next five years. It has proposed budgets of just over lbn ECU for education, 55% of which will go to higher education, 802m ECU for vocational training and 157m ECU for youth exchanges. Effectively this amounts to a doubling of the budget in com parison with resources spent bet ween 1990 and 1994. So far the Council is resisting such sizeable increases. It has decided to cut the overall five-year budget by 479m ECU to 1,485m ECU, taking the view that this represents a balance between the desire to support exchanges and training and the need to take ac count of budgetary rigour. For its part, Parliament believes there is a good case for additional funding. However, it wants the decision on funding taken each year during the normal budgetary process in which MEPs have a key role. Accordingly, in its vote on the first reading of the 1995 budget, Parliament has in cluded 181m ECU for the SOCRATES programme, 142m ECU for LEONARDO and 22m ECU for Youth for Europe. It will now be up to Parliament and Council to hammer out a compromise that will allow the EU to build on previous successes in education and training and enable a greater number of young people to benefit from a stay in another European country. Northern Ireland \u2014 A Presidential welcome for the peace process \u2022 U.S. President Bill Clinton welcomes MEP John Hume to the White House and lends his support to the peace process in Northern Ireland. Eurostar trains set to take off \u2022 A twice daily Eurostar passenger train service linking London to Paris and Brussels in just over three hours will commence on November 14th 1994. Apex style fares bookable two weeks in advance start at \u00a395 return, with reductions for children. The European Parliament will be meeting in plenary session in Brussels on 14th and 15th November. Commission fights shy of media barons DESPITE repeated calls from MEPs to tackle the increasing trend for media ownership across Europe to be concen trated in fewer and fewer hands, the Commission has backed off from tackling the press and TV barons. Following an investigation of the industry Europe-wide, an \u2022 Commissioner Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi bowing out at the end of the year extensive consultation process and a green paper, Commissioner Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi this month could only say that more consultations would be taking place, leaving any possibility of action to the new Commission next year. While Italian Green members were concerned about the extent of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest com pany's control over the Italian television and magazine industry, British Labour MEPs were look ing for European legislation to break up the monopoly of the British newspaper industry. \"We cannot allow the domination of the printed media by a handful of tabloid tyrants peddling their own brand of politics\", said Carole Tongue (London East, PES). Mary Banotti (Dublin, EPP) ques tioned where the political pressure came from to force the Commis sion to back off. But Bryan Cassidy (Dorset and East Devon, EPP), after declaring an interest took the view that what was needed was more liberalisa tion, especially in countries like Germany where other European companies were not allowed to take control of television channels. But the problem for the Com mission, as Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi explained, was deciding on what basis EU action could be justified. Competition policy law had been ruled out as this was designed to tackle cross- border mergers not national monopolies, and the new Maastricht provisions on cultural policy specifically excluded har monising legislation. He felt the only option was to use the provision relating to the single market which is basically concerned with removing national restrictions which prevent other European countries from com peting on the domestic market. LOCAL VOTES GET THE GO-AHEAD MEPs approved a Commission proposal emanating from a commitment in the Maastricht treaty to grant voting rights in local elections to some five- million EU nationals resident in a state other than their own. It will affect 800,000 citizens from other EU countries living in Britain and 62,000 living in Ireland, and follows on from a similar change introduced for the June European elections. But MEPs were anxious to see the changes properly publicised. This had not hap pened with the European elec tions in the UK with the result that too few people registered, said Richard Howitt (Essex South, PES). . ",
        "European Parliament \u2014 EP News Action plan to aid small firms PLAGUED by late payers, overburdened by red tape and treated as lepers by the banks, not to mention the tax man, Europe's small companies face a tough time. Their plight has at long last been recognised by the Commission, which has put forward an action programme designed to improve the business environment for small firms. The idea is to create a framework to examine at a European level the impact of legislation on costs and administrative procedures and to set up an \"administrative simplification committee\". Helping small businesses take advantage of the single market through improved training and advisory services co-ordinated at a European level is another aim. Perhaps the most controversial element in the plan is to grant businesses the legal right to charge interest on late payments, as happens for example in Belgium, but is likely to be resisted in the UK where many companies have got into the habit of paying bills late without a penalty charge. The problem is particularly acute however, when small firms with cash flow problems are bidding for contracts overseas and need guaranteed assurances that they will be paid, otherwise this key sector of the economy will be unable to take full advantage of opportunities in the single market. The Commission is proposing to build on existing cross-border co\u00ad operation schemes and allocate some lbn ECU over the next six years to help with training, access to credit and publicising opportunities in other EU countries. The programme was welcomed by MEPs across the House. \u2022 The European Investment Bank loaned some 15.5bn ECU to small firms over the 1989-1993 period and as part of the European growth initiative agreed at the December 1992 Edinburgh summit, another one- billion ECU credit in the form of a 2% interest subsidy will be available to small firms as from next year. New moves to improve MEPs approved a Commission proposal designed to impose tough controls on ships plying European waters through a system of inspections at ports. This means \"flags of convenience\" or sub-standard ships operating off European shores won't be able to evade the new legislation. Safety at sea The proposal was welcomed by Lyndon Harrison (Cheshire West and Wirral, PES), who pointed out that a proposal on shipping safety had been on the table since 1980 but nothing had happened. Action was all the more necessary now in view of recent accidents and the number of sub-standard ships and crews at sea. Pointing to the Estonia disaster, Brian Simpson (Cheshire East, PES) noted that some 112 accidents had occurred on ro-ro style ferries since 1980, suggesting a design fault. Robin Teverson (Cornwall and West Plymouth, ELDR) felt this was an area where the European Parliament held a special responsibility for the safety of Europe's citizens and called for a special committee of enquiry to be set up into the Estonia disaster. For Ken Stewart (Merseyside West, PES), the real need was for legislation to ensure enforcement of safety standards. He called on the Council and Commission to act without delay. Mark Watts (Kent East, PES) agreed. Unless there was action, the lives of seafarers and passengers would continue to be at risk, he said. In the light of the recent walkway accident at the port of Ramsgate, and a fire on a ferry off the Kent coast, he was particularly concerned about the lack of statutory checks on port infrastructure. For Council, Matthias Wissmann shared the concerns of the House and was optimistic about getting the legislation through as it comes under an area which now provides for majority voting. \u00a9 Belga Tougher air accident inquiries backed MEPs have given the go-ahead to a proposal aimed at tightening up air accident investigations across the EU. Under the directive every accident, near miss or other serious incident involving aeroplanes would be the subject of a compulsory investigation by national authorities. A report of the inquiry findings would then have to be published as soon as possible. Parliament backed the recommend\u00ad ation of transport committee spokesman Mark Killilea (Connacht/Ulster, EDA) that the EU should go further and legislate on compensation for victims of air accidents. He said this legislation would make a real contribution to the development of safer air transport, not just within the EU, but indeed throughout the world.

Parliament wants incitement to racism to be considered a criminal offence and has indeed been pressing for European measures since it prompted the Joint Declaration against racism signed by Parliament, Council and the Commission in 1986. National governments have, however, been reluctant to at\u00ad tempt to put anti-racist laws on the European Statute book in view of differences of opinion over competence. The European Council meeting at Corfu in June this year did, however, decide to set up a top-ranking committee, in\u00ad cluding MEPs Glyn Ford (Greater Manchester East, PES) and Arie Oostlander (Nl, EPP), to monitor the situation and devise a positive action pro\u00ad gramme designed to combat racism. For Council, Ursula Seiler Albring explained the idea was to promote tolerance and understanding through practical projects with action at a Euro\u00ad pean level over and above measures that could be achiev\u00ad ed by national governments. While most speakers in the debate supported the call, Na\u00ad tional Front MEfte such as Frank Vanhecke (B, Ina) and Marie- France Stirbois (F, Ind), who sit as independents in the European Parliament, sought to put on record the fact that they did not represent parties that were racist, although tempers flared when Glyn Ford accused members of the Belgian and French National Front parties of offensive behaviour. Clash over trade union rights All letters please to the Editor Roy Worsley Central Press Division DG for Information and Public Relations European Parliament Espace Leopold Building 89-91 Rue Belliard 1040 Brussels, Belgium Tel: 322 284 2941 London Office: 2 Queen Anne's Gate London SW1H 9AA Telephone: 071 222 0411 Designed by Newsflow: (Mike Conway) Printed by RAP Ltd, 201 Spotland Road Rochdale OL12 7AF Tel: (0706) 44981 A RESOLUTION expressing concern at the 70,000 job losses at British Telecom since privatisation prompted a clash between British Labour and Tory MEPs after Graham Mather (Hampshire North and Oxford, EPP) contended that the redundancies were voluntary and that this point should have been made in the text voted. Neither did he accept the reference to Caterpillar UK withdrawing trade union rights as a true description of the situation in the company, since a large majority of the workforce had opted for new procedures involving setting up a joint consultative council, he said. But Mel Read (Nottingham and leicestershirc North West, PES) retorted that Caterpillar's workforce had been \"bought off' for \u00a3500 a head, and that as fer as British Telecom was concerned the workers taking \"voluntary\" redundancy had little choice. Besides, a further 30,000 jobs at the company could be expected to go by 1997, she added. The dispute came after a wide-ranging debate on job losses and threats to trade union rights and welfare benefits across Europe, with Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek reaffirming the Commission would like to see an end to the UK opt out from the Social Chapter and industrial disputes settled by both sides of industry with due respect for subsidiarity. The resolution adopted calls on the Commission to use the Social Charter as a basis for a proposal to guarantee trade union rights. \u2022 Commissioner Padraig Flynn \u2014 retaining the Social Affairs portfolio Opt-out 'myth' is wrong IT was a \"myth\" to argue that opting out of the Social Chapter, as the UK has done, gave one region a huge competitive advantage over another, said Commissioner Padraig Flynn, replying to questions from MEPs on the Commission's White Paper for Social Policy. In fact, only one piece of legislation had been enacted by the eleven \u2014 on European Works Councils \u2014 and this still had to be implemented at a national level, he added. Mr Flynn sought to reassure MEPs that the Commission's aims were to create a level playing field by setting minimum standards Europe-wide in an area where most legislation was put in place on a national basis, and to seek an end to the UK opt out at the 1996 IGC. The main theme of the Commissioner's address, however, concentrated on the need for a new radical approach to tackling the number one problem facing all European states \u2014 reducing unemployment. While he accepted that economic growth would make a vital contribution, it would not be sufficient on its own. The Commission's strategy was based on linking social policy to the White Paper on growth and making maximum use of the European Social Fund to invest in training and education. It was important to create high standards so that Europe's workforce was in a position to compete at the highest level and was mobile. In this connection he announced the launch next month of a new network to provide Europe-wide information on vacancies and job opportunities. At the same time, he continued, he would be emphasising the need to reconcile family with working life and provide specific assistance for women. Other sectors of society that should not be forgotten, he added, were the elderly, the poor, disabled and those experiencing social exclusion. In other words, the Union's aim was to improve the quality of life for all its citizens. While recognising the need for flexibility in the jobs market, he emphasised this should not be at the expense of social protection. Gambia action FOLLOWING the military coup in Gambia, resulting in the arrest and imprisonment of former government leaders, the EU has decided to suspend financial support and military assistance to the new government. However, humanitarian aid will continue and proposed new aid projects will be reviewed on a case by case basis. "
