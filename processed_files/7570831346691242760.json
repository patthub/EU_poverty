        "5 Introduction This syllabus is the second output of the project \u201cEU Textbook on Ethics in Research\u201d, funded by the European Commission and delivered by members of the Centre for Professional Ethics at Keele University. As an accom- paniment to the principal output of the project, which is the textbook itself, this syllabus provides an overview of the content of the textbook and is designed to be used as a basis for training courses in research ethics aimed at researchers and/or research ethics committee members and officers. The textbook itself contains the same case studies as the syllabus, but with more detailed discussion of the ethical issues arising from them. Ideally the syllabus will be used in conjunction with the textbook, but it may also be used independently, in which case the guides to further reading provided at the end of each unit will be of particular importance. Overview and scope of the syllabus The syllabus presented here is designed for use in the training of researchers and research ethics committee members throughout the European Union and beyond. It is intended to be accessible to scientific and lay readers, including those with no previous experience of ethical theory and analysis. The syllabus will cover key issues in the ethics of research involving human participants, including the ethical issues associated with new technologies. The scope of the syllabus is the ethics of scientific research involving human beings. The case studies relate to a variety of scientific disciplines including biomedical and human life sciences, and the social sciences. Readers will be introduced to a range of philosophical perspectives and concepts, and these will be used to inform discussion of practical ethical issues, but without any particular approach being promoted. Similarly, reference will be made to major religious views where relevant (e.g. in relation to research involving human embryos), but without endorsing or rejecting any particular view. The syllabus consists of eight \u2018units of study\u2019 corresponding to the chapters of the textbook, each of which will include a list of intended learning outcomes for that unit, a brief overview of the topic to be addressed in the unit, one or more case studies each with a set of questions to guide discussion by students, descriptions of the main issues that should be discussed arising out of the case studies, and (where appropriate) identifi- cation of further issues for discussion that may not arise directly out of the case studies but are related to the themes of the unit. The intention is that an instructor should be able to use the intended learning outcomes and overview in planning the course and introducing the topics to students; the case studies and associated questions can be used either as a basis for small group discussion within the classroom or as preparatory work; and the descriptions of the main issues can be used by the instructor as a basis for guiding and responding to the discussions. The syllabus may be thought of as having three parts. The first unit introduces students to research ethics by considering the circumstances that have given rise to the requirement for ethical review of research and introducing some key principles and approaches to ethics that will provide a framework for later discussion of particular cases and ethical issues. The next five units form the core of the syllabus, each being focused on ",
        "6 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH a set of closely related ethical issues and/or types of research. The last two units address broader concerns that go beyond research itself, including the relationship between researchers and society and examples of how new biotechnologies can give rise to ethical issues that both exist independently of the research context and provide challenges to existing modes of ethical review. These units contain more, and more diverse, cases than the preceding ones, and may be thought of as extension materials to be drawn on as appropriate to the context of the course. Pedagogical approach and structure The syllabus is aimed at students of science, researchers, and people such as members of Research Ethics Committees who are responsible for the ethical review of research proposals. The syllabus as a whole, or selected units, will provide material suitable for use in Research Ethics modules within scientific educational programmes, and in training programmes for Research Ethics Committee members. It will also be suitable for use as a self-study tool. The case studies are designed to illustrate and provoke reflection on particular practical and/or theoretical issues. In some instances they will be perceived as presenting difficult ethical dilemmas that motivate the reader to consider the arguments for and against the described piece of research and to think about how to weigh up the conflicting values. In other instances the case will elicit a certain intuitive response which the reader can then be challenged to defend. Many of the case studies are based on real pieces of research, but all are adapted to serve a particular pedagogical purpose. The descriptions in the book will be kept relatively brief in order to maintain the reader\u2019s interest and to focus attention on the key ethical issues. One challenge for readers will be to identify what additional information they would need in order to reach a definitive conclusion in cases where the presented information does not allow them to do so, and to identify what is ethically significant about the additional information. This models the task faced by a Research Ethics Committee in determining what questions to pose to a researcher, and by a researcher deciding what infor- mation to include in a submission to a Research Ethics Committee. In some instances it may be useful to add further details of to explore alternative scenarios in the course of discussing the cases. ",

        "8 Learning outcomes SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH In this unit of study students will develop an understanding of the nature of ethical decision-making and its role in research ethics. They will also acquire an appreciation of what research is and of how it is regulated. Specifically, students will gain the following: I. An understanding of the nature and definition of research and an appreciation of the importance of good research. II. An appreciation of the reasons for conducting ethical review of research and an aware- ness of some of the international codes of research ethics that have been developed in response to scandals and abuses in research. III. A critical understanding of the main theories and concepts that inform ethical decision-making, including consequentialism, deontology, respect, dignity, discourse ethics, communitarianism, liberalism and the four principles approach. IV. An ability to draw on these theories and concepts in order to analyse and evaluate particular examples of research. V. An appreciation of opposing views on the role of the research ethics committee, and of the implications of these view for the evaluation of research. ",
        "9 UNIT 1 LOCATING ETHICS IN RESEARCH Introduction This unit introduces some central issues concerning the rationale and methods of ethical review, which will provide a context and framework for the discussion of more specific issues in subsequent units. It begins with a consideration of the nature of research, its value, and the historical scandals that have prompted the development of codes of research ethics and a system of ethical review. A case study is used to explore the types of ethical considerations that commonly arise in relation to research, and these are related to key moral concepts and theories. This leads on to discussion of the role of an ethics committee. What is research? Before we can identify the ethical issues that arise in research we need to have at least a working account of what research is. It may be useful to ask students to suggest defining features of research, or to consider accounts such as the following: \u2022 a systematic investigation to establish facts; \u2022 an attempt to find out something in a systematic and scientific manner; \u2022 a systematic investigation designed to develop generalisable knowledge; \u2022 a focussed systematic study undertaken to increase knowledge and understanding; \u2022 a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding; \u2022 collecting information about a particular subject; \u2022 an inquiry that involves seeking of evidence to increase knowledge. The challenge is to come up with a definition of research that includes the diverse activities that we think of as research while distinguishing research from other activities such as audit or journalism. We suggest the following as a working definition which captures the important elements of the partial accounts above. Research aims to generate (new) information, knowledge, understanding, or some other relevant cognitive good, and does so by means of a systematic investigation. The value of research For research involving human participants to be ethical there must be some positive justification for it, other- wise it would be a waste of time for the participants. It is important to emphasise, though, that research is not intrinsically ethically problematic. Whatever the difficulties that can occur, there are many reasons for holding that research is something to be encouraged. Various arguments might be given for the value of research. For example: \u2022 research has brought a better quality of life and increased welfare; \u2022 huge numbers of lives have been saved as a result of research. ",
        "10 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH 1. Some examples can be found in the following: Henry Beecher, \u201cEthics and clinical research\u201d, New England Journal of Medicine 274, no. 24 (1966): 1354-60; Laud Humphreys, Tearoom Trade: Impersonal Sex in Public Places (New York: Aldine, 1975); Stanley Milgram, \u201cBehavioral study of obedience\u201d, Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology 67, (1963): 371-8; Maurice Pappworth, \u201cHuman guinea pigs: a warning\u201d, Twentieth Century 171 (1962): 67-75; Udo Sch\u00fcklenk, \u201cIntroduction to research ethics\u201d, Developing World Bioethics 5, no. 1,(2005): 1-13; Philip Zimbardo, The Lucifer Effect: understanding how good people turn evil (New York: Random House, 2007). These are versions of a more general argument that research is worthwhile because of the extrinsic value of the knowledge that it produces; that is research is valuable because of what the knowledge that it generates enables us to do. A second argument appeals to the idea that the knowledge produced by research may be intrinsically valuable; that is, it is good to have knowledge or understanding of the world irrespective of any further benefit. This sec- ond justification provides a reason why research which lacks any direct application may nonetheless be ethical. It may be worth discussing whether either of these justifications applies to student research or whether another justification can be offered for it. Unethical research However, the history of research includes many cases of highly unethical research. Internationally known \u2018scandals\u2019 include: \u2022 medical experimentation in Nazi Germany; \u2022 the Tuskegee Syphilis Study; \u2022 the Stanford Prison study; \u2022 the Milgram experiments. It is useful to introduce the students to one or two of these and to discuss their reaction, as well as discussing local controversies where appropriate to contextualise the course. ( 1 ) These cases provide evidence of the abuses that can occur in unregulated research, and have encouraged the development of codes of ethics to govern research both internationally, nationally, and at the European level. Codes of ethics and legal constraints Ethical codes and guidelines are a means of establishing and articulating the values and obligations of an insti- tution or practice. Some of these codes have only an advisory status, others have regulatory force for members of specific professional bodies, while there are also legal constraints on certain kinds of research at both national and European levels.

( 6 ). The different scope, status and aims of these documents should be discussed, and it may be worth suggesting to students that they look at some of these codes as a follow up activity. The relationship between codes, ethical practice and the law should be discussed, including the following points: (1) ethical evaluation cannot simply be a matter of \u2018applying\u2019 codes or laws; since (2) these are often general and fail to provide clear guidance in complex cases; and (3) in some cases what is legal depends on the judgement of a REC; and (4) the contents of particular guidelines may be controversial and/or contradictory (internally or with other guidelines). It is sometimes argued that since unethical research is not widespread, the present form of regulation constitutes an over-reaction to rare scandalous behaviour in the conduct of research. While it is true that over-regulation may be an obstacle to the pursuit of (ethically and scientifically) good research, it should be pointed out that ethical decision-making is complex, and because of this complexity individual researchers may not be best placed to decide about the ethical issues a project raises. Instead it may need a group of experts, both scientific and ethical, to make a good decision. Likewise, given the plurality of ethical views that are available, a committee decision can be representative in ways that an individual decision about the ethical legitimacy of a course of action cannot. The following case study is designed to facilitate discussion of the kinds of consideration that might be morally important for the conduct of research and how these might fit into broader ethical frameworks. ",
        "12 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH 7. This case is based on the controversial trial of PolyHeme in the USA. A discussion of this research can be found in the American Journal of Bioethics 6, no. 3 (2006). Case Study 1.1 Testing of artificial blood product ( 7 ) Your ethics committee has been asked to review the following application. Currently ambulances can only carry a partial range of blood of the various blood types, potentially significantly delaying the treatment of critically injured and ill individuals until they can be transported to the hospital. A replacement for human blood has been developed by a pharmaceutical company and now needs to be tested in the field. This artificial blood is blood-type neutral and initial testing with healthy volunteers seems to have shown that it is well tolerated with minimal adverse reactions. The researchers now propose further testing of the artificial blood by equipping five local ambulances with the artificial blood to be used in emergency care situations. In many cases it will not be possible to obtain consent from the patients to take part in the research because of the urgency of treatment and the fact that patients are often unconscious. The researchers argue that given the extensive laboratory testing the product has already undergone the best way to test the usefulness of the artificial blood is in a \u2018real world\u2019 test. Furthermore they make the point that presently some people have to forego blood products until they reach the hospital in any case. Questions 1. What arguments can the researchers put forward in support of their proposal? 2. What objections could be raised against the proposal? 3. In your opinion, should this research be allowed to proceed in its present form? If not, how might it be modified to make it more acceptable? Discussion This case study provides the basis for exploring different ethical considerations and frameworks relevant to research. Initial discussion of the case will enable students to identify some of the key ethical issues that arise in research, and these can then be related to a range of theories and principles which will give some structure to the moral considerations raised and provide a framework for further consideration of this and other cases. ",
        "13 UNIT 1 LOCATING ETHICS IN RESEARCH Question 1 may elicit the following arguments in support of the proposal: 1. potential benefits to participants, especially those with rare blood types for whom there is currently no blood provided in the ambulances; 2. potential benefits for future patients and the community in general; 3. the fact that laboratory based testing and healthy volunteer testing has minimised risks of harm to participants; 4. the fact that, in emergency situations, getting consent even for purely therapeutic interventions is rare; 5. the thought that, because people benefit from research carried out on other participants, there may be a (weak) duty to participate in research themselves. Question 2 may elicit the following objections to the proposal: 1. risks to participants; 2. doubts about the methodological quality of the research; 3. inclusion of non-consenting patients \u2013 it should be up to people to decide for themselves; 4. difficulties in the consent transaction due to the emergency situation; 5. lack of community engagement, involvement, or consultation; 6. concerns about using people as means to an end; 7. the motives of the pharmaceutical company (are they developing this just to make money?); 8. violation of people\u2019s rights (which ones?); 9. concerns that the proposal fails to treat vulnerable people with the appropriate respect. These and other arguments arising from the discussion may then be categorised into different types and related to various different ethical frameworks. The moral frameworks referred to below will be described in the textbook and related to the case study. However, there would not be time in a single teaching session to address all of these. We recommend that discussion covers the basic distinction between consequence-based and rule-based approaches, and at least one of the approaches that responds to the existence of competing moral views. Other approaches or more specific variants of the basic frameworks may be introduced as appropriate to the interests of the students or the context in which teaching takes place. It may also be useful to suggest modifications to the case in order to explore particular issues relevant to the community or raised by the students. For example, it could be specified that the artificial blood is derived from pig\u2019s blood or from human embryonic stem cells in order to consider whether objections would be forthcoming from Jewish, Islamic or Catholic people and to explore the significance of religious perspectives. Likewise, communitarian views could be introduced by specifying that the researchers intend to obtain some form of \u2018community consent\u2019 rather than seeking the consent of individuals. ",
        "14 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH 8. Immanuel Kant, Groundwork for the Metaphysic of Morals (tr. Jonathan F. Bennett, 2005): 28. http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/kantgw.pdf Ethical frameworks and principles Consequence-based approaches Consequentialist theories hold that the rightness or wrongness or an action is determined by its actual or likely consequences. A popular version of consequentialism is utilitarianism, which claims that we ought to take whatever action produces the greatest overall welfare or happiness. Most of the arguments in favour of the research in the case study (arguments 1-4) are consequence-based, reflecting the fact that research is valued for the benefits it aims to produce. Some of the arguments against the research (arguments 1 and 2) are also consequence-based, reflecting the uncertainty of the intended bene- fits and the risks of harmful consequences. It is likely that a purely consequentialist approach to ethical decision-making will be unpalatable to the students because of the lack of attention to other moral considerations, and in particular the interests of individuals when these are opposed to the interests of society. This leads to the idea of moral constraints on the pursuit of good consequences. Rule- or duty-based approaches Rule-based or duty-based approaches hold that the rightness of actions is not just determined by the conse- quences but is related to the nature of the action itself. These approaches are also referred to as \u2018deontological\u2019. A familiar example is the Ten Commandments, which identifies particular types of action as morally prohib- ited or required, irrespective of their consequences. Sometimes (as with the Ten Commandments) the rules established by duty based accounts are taken to be absolute (so that breaking them can never be morally justified); however, on other accounts the rules established may be weighed against each other (and are then said to be \u2018prima facie\u2019 or \u2018defeasible\u2019 rules). For example, some deontologists think that it is generally wrong to kill but that the duty not to do so may be overridden in extreme circumstances (e.g. to save the world or to relieve severe intractable pain). The following are influential approaches to rule- or duty-based ethics. Respect for persons and respect for human dignity Fundamental to these approaches is the idea that there is something special about human beings, or persons, which warrants respect and limits what may permissibly be done to them even in pursuit of morally worth- while goals. Such view are often linked to the second formulation of Kant\u2019s categorical imperative: \u201cAct only in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.\u201d ( 8 ) To treat someone as a mere means would be to behave ",
        "15 UNIT 1 LOCATING ETHICS IN RESEARCH towards them as if they were just a tool to you, a means to achieving your own (or society\u2019s) goals. To treat them as an end is to respect them as a person with their own goals, and to treat their goals as important. This is often taken to ground the requirement for consent from research participants and thus arises in relation to arguments 3, 4, 6 and 9 against the proposed research in the case study. Kant\u2019s view of respect is based on the belief that what makes humans special is their \u2018autonomy\u2019, or capacity to set their own goals in accordance with reason. Other accounts appeal to different views about what makes humans special, including religious views about having been created by God. These can give rise to different views about the range of individuals to which the principle of respect applies; for example, whether it applies to humans who have lost, not yet acquired or will never have autonomy or the capacity for rational thought. Human rights Rights can be thought of as entitlements of individuals that give rise to obligations by other individuals, organ- isations or states. They are often thought of as providing security for individuals against having their impor- tant interests sacrificed for the collective good. Human rights are rights that people are thought to possess simply in virtue of being human, so that while they may be recognised by a legal system (e.g. the European Charter on Fundamental Rights ) they exist as moral rights independently of their legal expression. Rights that are often appealed to in the context of research ethics, and which may tend to oppose consequentialist reasoning, include rights to self-determination, privacy and bodily integrity. However, as with other non- consequentialist approaches, the question arises of whether these principles are absolute, and if not, at what point they may be overridden. Virtue ethics Another way of thinking about ethical issues, which is usually taken to be distinct from both consequence- based and rule-based approaches, focuses on evaluation of the character of the person carrying out an action. This approach is known as virtue ethics. Virtue ethical concerns might be raised if the students discuss the char- acter or motives of the researchers (argument 7 against the research in the case study). Dealing with moral disagreement We have now introduced several classical approaches to ethics, but these seem to support different conclusion in some cases. Given a pluralist society this creates an obvious problem for ethical decision-making especially when, as in the context of research ethics, we are making ethical decisions about what kinds of research society should permit. The following frameworks aim to provide us with ways of thinking about and responding to moral differences. ",

Tom L. Beauchamp and James F Childress, Principles of Biomedical Ethics (New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008). Discourse Ethics Discourse ethics aims to provide an account of our moral obligations as arising from the norms and practice of communication. Habermas claims that \u201cOnly those norms can claim to be valid that meet (or could meet) with the approval of all affected in their capacity as participants in a practical discourse.\u201d ( 9 ) On this account valid moral norms can only be established through dialogue under fair conditions. Discourse ethics might arise if the students focus on the process of collective deliberation that might take place within a research ethics committee. Principlism The origins of Principlism lie in the Belmont Report, ( 10 ) an American report on the ethical conduct of research published in 1979, but its most common contemporary form is the \u2018Four Principles\u2019 approach developed by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress. ( 11 ) Principlism is similar to \u2018defeasiblist\u2019 forms of deontology as outlined above, in that it proposes a plurality of moral principles that must be traded off against one another. However, it is also a response to the existence of competing moral perspectives at the theoretical level in that its prin- ciples are supposed to be derived from the common morality of society and capable of being endorsed by people with different theoretical approaches. The Four Principles proposed by Beauchamp and Childress are: \u2022 respect for autonomy (obligation to respect decision-making capacities of autonomous persons); \u2022 non-maleficence (obligation to avoid causing harm); \u2022 beneficence (obligations to provide benefits and to balance benefits against risks); \u2022 justice (obligations of fairness in the in the distribution of benefits and risks). Students should be able to see how these principles match up with the considerations raised in response to the case study. Two further political approaches to moral decision-making are worth articulating. Liberalism This political philosophy comes in many forms but typically holds that governments ought to be neutral between the different ethical values held by different members of society and/or that people should be free to live according to their own values unless their choices are liable to bring about harm to others. This philosophy has particular import for whether private ethical beliefs such as religious beliefs ought to be influential in law and public policy. This leads to a strong emphasis on individual autonomy and rights, which may be linked back to concerns about consent and harm raised in relation to the case study. ",

Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, Article 2. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0020:EN:NOT Communitarianism Some authors have claimed that liberalism fails to recognise the extent to which individuals are embedded in a community, and that individual choices are only meaningful within a context of shared values and prac- tices. These might be undermined by an excessive focus on the desires of the individual, so it is the duty of the government to promote the values and traditions of the community. Critics point out that communities are rarely homogeneous and can be oppressive to the minorities within them. Communitarian ideas may be linked to concerns about the interests and values of the community, and ideas of community consultation, in relation to the case study. Of course community consultations are not only a communitarian idea, as seen in the US context where these are sometimes used as a substitute when informed consent cannot be obtained. The role and legitimacy of research ethics committees In the first section of this Unit a case was made for the regulation of research. Given the preceding discussion of moral decision-making and the role of moral decision-making in society it might now be asked what role ought research ethics committees play in this regulation? The EU Directive on Clinical Trials defines a research ethics committee as: an independent body in a Member State, consisting of healthcare professionals and nonmedical members, whose responsibility it is to protect the rights, safety and wellbeing of human subjects involved in a trial and to provide public assurance of that protection, by, among other things, expressing an opinion on the trial pro- tocol, the suitability of the investigators and the adequacy of facilities, and on the methods and documents to be used to inform trial subjects and obtain their informed consent. ( 12 ) This of course only applies to committees governed by that directive but many other committees follow similar lines. Nonetheless this remit is a broad one and a significant amount of discretion exists for Research Ethics Committees to flesh out what they take their role to be. Roughly speaking, there are three main models of a research ethics committee\u2019s role: 1. to protect and support the autonomy of prospective and existing research subjects/participants; 2. to protect the welfare of prospective and existing research subjects/participants; 3. to balance a number of relevant moral considerations when considering research proposals, including that of respect for autonomy and the protection and advancement of welfare. Each of these models will generate different sorts of conclusions about research proposals. These may be discussed in relation to the case and to the moral perspectives mentioned above. ",

Specifically, they will acquire knowledge of: I. The important role that consent plays in research ethics. II. The ways in which the requirement for valid consent follows from other fundamental moral concepts such as autonomy, dignity, harm-avoidance, and respect for persons. III. The definition of valid consent: specifically the tripartite definition in terms of com- petence/capacity, adequate information, and voluntariness. IV. Key ethical issues relating to information-giving: e.g. how much should research participants routinely be told? V. Key ethical issues relating to voluntariness in research: e.g. when (if ever) do induce- ments render participation involuntary? VI. The issue of when, or whether, research without consent (on competent adults) is ethically acceptable: e.g. in cases where the methodology requires covert surveillance and/or deception. ",

However, this will be more effective if preceded by readings and/or a presentation introducing students to the following background and foundational issues. The prominence of consent in international codes and declarations There is near universal agreement that informed consent is of the first importance in research ethics, espe- cially (although by no means exclusively) in biomedical research. Students should be offered several examples of international codes or declarations reflecting this. Some of these are listed below. \u2022 The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 7). ( 1 ) \u2022 The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Article 3). ( 2 ) \u2022 The World Medical Association\u2019s Declaration of Helsinki (para. 22). ( 3 ) \u2022 The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences\u2019 (CIOMS\u2019) International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Guideline 4). ( 4 ) \u2022 The Council of Europe\u2019s Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine (Article 5). ( 5 ) \u2022 The World Medical Association\u2019s Declaration on the Rights of the Patient (Article 3). ( 6 ) \u2022 The International Sociological Association\u2019s Code of Ethics (para. 2.3). ( 7 ) Attention should be drawn to the rather more qualified commitment to consent in the International Sociological Association\u2019s document, and to the possibility of covert (and therefore non-consensual) psycho- logical or social research. This will be dealt with in more detail later in relation to Case Study 2.3 . How consent may follow from more fundamental moral principles The practical principle that research on competent adults should only proceed with their informed consent arguably follows from several of the more fundamental principles introduced in Unit 1. ",
        "22 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH 8. Stephen Wilkinson, Bodies for Sale: ethics and exploitation in the human body trade (London: Routledge, 2003): 42. These include: \u2022 respect for autonomy; \u2022 respect for dignity; \u2022 respect for persons. Arguably, each of these \u2018respect principles\u2019 generates a duty of non-interference, meaning that it would be wrong to do something to an autonomous person\u2019s body without his or her valid consent, whether this be for medical treatment, research, or any other purpose. This requirement may also apply (although perhaps less clearly and powerfully) to acquiring information about and/or observing an autonomous person. The extension of non-interference rights to non-observation rights takes us to the idea of privacy , which is dealt with in Unit 4. At this point, it is simply worth noting that there is a close connection between consent and privacy: that invasions of privacy are necessarily non-consensual. Thus, if someone were invited to observe me and did so then I could not (having validly consented) reasonably complain that my privacy had been invaded. There is a debate concerning whether something similar is true of dignity and respect for persons. One view is that any action could be consistent with these principles provided that a sufficiently robust valid consent had been obtained from the person affected. An alternative view is that some types of action are an affront to human dignity even if they are fully consensual: \u2018dwarf tossing\u2019 and \u2018sex work\u2019 are amongst the contested cases. ( 8 ) Students\u2019 attention should also be drawn to the important question of whether respect for autonomy creates an absolute requirement for consent, or one that can sometimes be overridden, perhaps in covert surveillance examples like the one in Case Study 2.3 . Similarly, there are interesting questions about whether a person\u2019s autonomy creates duties that extend beyond death (for example, in relation to burial preferences or the desire to have one\u2019s body used in biomedical research or for organ transplantation). The latter are dealt with in more detail in Case Study 2.2 . Harm-avoidance or non-maleficence is another reason for requiring informed consent. The idea is that, since most prospective research subjects have an understandable concern to protect their own interests, requiring informed consent makes it less likely that they will subjected to excessive risks by researchers. Furthermore, some of the harm and risk associated with research depends on people\u2019s subjective preferences: for instance, some people might be scared of going into hospitals and, for these people, hospital-based research would be more harmful and unpleasant than for others. Since people are generally well-acquainted with their own likes and dislikes, the informed consent process protects them from taking part in research that would be especially difficult or unpleasant for them, given their personal preferences. ",
        "23 UNIT 2 CONSENT The tripartite definition of \u2018valid consent\u2019 Students should be introduced to the distinction between valid and invalid consent, and to the tripartite account of valid consent. The tripartite account says that a consent is valid (of a sufficiently high quality to provide a prima facie justi- fication for the intervention under consideration) if and only if the prospective research participant: (i) is provided with adequate information and an opportunity to deliberate about and digest the information; and (ii) has sufficient mental competence or capacity to understand and retain this information, and to commu- nicate his or her views on the research; and (iii) is making the decision voluntarily (which, for our purposes, means not as a result of coercion, manipulation, or undue inducements). The three elements of the tripartite account will be explored in more detail through the case studies. The dis- cussion of competence will, however, largely be saved until Unit 3. Case Study 2.1 Spaceflight simulation study on healthy female volunteers A proposed International Space Agency (ISA) research project aims to gather preliminary information about how women\u2019s bodies would cope with prolonged periods of time in spacecraft. Since most astronauts to date have been men, very little information on this exists and, given the prospect of long-range space missions involving both sexes, the ISA believes that this research is vitally important for the design of future spacecraft and space travel protocols. In an experiment simulating certain aspects of weightlessness, 50 healthy female volunteers, recruited via advertisements in women\u2019s fashion and lifestyle magazines, will be paid EUR 200 per day (plus expenses and free food) to spend up to four months on a specially designed bed which is tilted backwards at a six degree angle. The volunteers will also be awarded a terminal bonus payment of EUR 20 000 provided that they manage to complete the study (i.e. if they stay for the full four months). ",
        "24 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH During the experiment (and afterwards, in follow up sessions) numerous medical checks will be carried out. Furthermore, subjects\u2019 behaviour will be continuously monitored by video feed. Participants will be largely cut off from the outside world and allowed only occasional contact with friends and family via email or telephone No visits will be permitted. They will however be given access to personal entertainment devices. Physical side-effects of participation are likely to include: swollen face, blocked nose, severe aches, muscle wastage, constipation, sores, and loss of bone mass. Participants are also likely to encounter psychological problems resulting from the boredom and lack of exercise. All of the abovementioned restrictions and risks will be fully disclosed in advance to prospective volunteers, who will be provided with written information and individual counselling, and will undergo thorough psychological assessments. Counselling and psychological assessment will also be made available to the women during and after the experiment. In order to enter the study, the women must be: (a) competent adults aged 20-40 (because this is the age group most likely to be recruited for space missions); (b) in good general health, mentally and physically \u2013 and moderately, but not exceptionally, fit; (c) not significantly over/under weight; (d) non-smokers (because smoking is not possible in space and withdrawal symptoms may contaminate the results of the experiment if addicted smokers were used); (e) childless (because of the welfare of the child, and possible psychological harm to mothers); (f) single (because of the welfare of the partner, and because of possible psychological harm to women who are separated from their partners); (g) not pregnant, and willing to undergo a pregnancy test before the start of the study (because of concerns about fetal damage). They must also promise to do their best to avoid pregnancy for 3 years after participation in the experiment ends. The experimental design has been subjected to extensive scientific peer review and graded \u2018excellent\u2019 for its methodology. Questions 1. Is the research important enough to justify subjecting these women to the discomfort, inconvenience, and risk described? 2. Do you have any concerns about the quality of the women\u2019s consents? If so, what are these? 3. Is it possible for a woman validly to consent to be in this study? 4. Do you have any other ethical worries about, or objections to, this research (that is, apart from those to do with consent)? ",

Discussion Before focussing on the question of consent, students are invited to consider the research in more general terms: for example, how important are its aims? On the one hand, it might be argued that the Space Agency is trying to advance the long-term interests of humankind and contributing to sex equality by conducting research that will help us to safely involve more women in the space programme. On the other, even if the women do validly consent, one might have concerns about the physical side-effects of participation and regard the experience of being in a space research centre for four months as too much to bear. Turning to consent, the most obvious issue is payment. Some kinds of research (for example, non-therapeutic drug trials and some experiments done by psychology students) can only take place if the participants are offered an incentive to take part; otherwise, there would not be enough willing subjects. For this reason, modest inducements (including but not limited to the payment of expenses) are considered acceptable provided that they are not set at a level high enough to make them \u2018undue\u2019 inducements. We might say that an undue inducement is one that has an excessively powerful effect upon people\u2019s motivations and that, in some sense, forces or manipulates people to participate. Undue inducement, then, compromises the voluntariness element of consent, and so consents arising from undue inducements may not be valid. It should be noted that not all inducements are monetary: for example, in a developing world context, participants in medical experiments may be offered medical care for themselves or their families that would not otherwise be available, and this raises the very same concerns about undue inducement. ( 9 ) Most ethical worries about inducement arise in two kinds of case. In the first, the inducement is so large that people from all walks of life would be tempted by it. In this case the worry is the enormity of the reward and its effects on people\u2019s ability to resist. In the second, the reward is not (or not necessarily) enormous but the people likely to be attracted by the inducement are driven by their grim circumstances: for example, extreme poverty or unmet medical need. The second type of case also raises issues about exploitation and social justice that are addressed later in Unit 6. In this unit, it will suffice to say that it would be a matter of concern if the majority of the women came from economically deprived social groups. While many people are intuitively worried about inducements in research, it is rather hard to see what the problem is. For paying people to get them to modify their behaviour, to do things that they would not otherwise do, is ubiquitous and thought to be morally unproblematic in other contexts. ( 10 ) For example, most people would not go to work were it not for the wages, and shopkeepers would not hand over their goods to customers were it not for the payment. Moreover, many researchers are paid to do research. So why should the position of research participants be any different? ",
        "26 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH So perhaps some of the general intuitive worries about payment are not sustainable. However, one special concern in the Spaceflight Simulation Study is the terminal bonus. Perhaps this is unfair (what if someone cannot take any more after 3 months and loses EUR 20 000?). And perhaps it is inconsistent with the widely accepted principle that research participants should be free to withdraw their consent at any time. Arguably, someone 14 weeks into the study will be in effect fined heavily for leaving early. Is she free to withdraw? On the other hand, perhaps a large incentive is required to make people stay the course and to make the study work scientifically. The Spaceflight Simulation Study also raises other ethical issues, ones not primarily about consent. For example, is it reasonable and proportionate to ask women to try to avoid pregnancy for three years after the study? Given that one of the inclusion criteria is childlessness, this could be a major sacrifice for a woman in her thirties. And are the inclusion/exclusion criteria fair? For example, married women (and their equivalents) with children are excluded. The researchers seek to justify this by reference to the interests of partners and children, but is this sufficient and are the interests of third parties any of the researchers\u2019 business? Case Study 2.2 Police and rescue research using cadavers The European Institute of Police and Rescue Research has a long running, internationally renowned research programme that seeks to discover which police and rescue training methods work best. One part of this programme aims to discover whether training using real human cadavers is more effective than the alternatives, in certain areas of police and rescue work. For instance, there is a growing (although still controversial) body of evidence suggesting that using real corpses (to stand for the victims of terrorist bombings or other disasters) is the best way to teach people anti-terrorist and \u2018catastrophic situation\u2019 techniques. One of the Institute\u2019s experiments is as follows. One group of trainees is instructed to search clothed corpses for objects such as diaries, mobile phones, jewellery and keys to ensure that they are properly documented. Trainees are then asked to strip the bodies to look for scarring and other distinctive marks that could aid identification. A second group of trainees goes through a similar process, but using realistic mannequins instead of actual bodies. A third receives classroom-based training only. The different groups\u2019 performances are later tested and comparatively evaluated using a well-established proprietary assessment tool. (The meth- odology of this experiment has been subjected to external peer review and accepted.) ",
        "27 UNIT 2 CONSENT Other similar experiments use corpses to assess different search training techniques. These involve, amongst other things, human body parts being buried and then searched for by trainees. The corpses used by the Institute come from the nearby University Hospital. All of the deceased persons involved gave general consent, in writing, for the use of their bodies for \u201cresearch, training and education\u201d. Questions 1. Ethically, does it matter that the consent given by the deceased persons was rather general and that they may not have known that their bodies would, or could, be used in the study described above? Would it have been morally better to give them more detail? 2. If valid consent was given by the deceased persons for their bodies to be used in this research would that allay all of your concerns about the research? Or would there be residual worries about using bodies in this way? 3. What sort of consent to take part in the trial (if any) ought the researchers to seek from the trainees? 4. Ought relatives of the deceased persons to be involved at all and, if so, at what stage and how? Discussion Although it concerns deceased persons, this case study raises a very general issue about valid consent: how much information must the consenter be given and how specific must a consent be? In this case, the worry is both that the consent given was not sufficiently specific and that the consenter may have been harbouring a false belief: namely, that his or her body would be used by the hospital for medical research (and not poten- tially mutilated and used for rescue personnel training). So, one might argue that the consent given is invalid because it is insufficiently detailed and/or based on a false belief. Against that, would it have been morally better to ask the dying person if their body could be used in this particular trial, and risk causing distress? Again, this is not a point that applies just to the dead: especially in a medical setting, disclosure of information can be distressing even when it does not involve death. A second issue concerns the idea of dignity. Even if valid consent was in place, some people might have qualms about using bodies in this way. A third point concerns the consent of the trainees themselves. What is at issue here is not so much their consent to be trained (which presumably is implicit in their career choice) but rather whether an additional consent is required for participation in this educational experiment. Finally, what about the deceased persons\u2019 relatives? Should their consent be required? In some contexts (e.g. organ donation) relatives\u2019 consent (or at least lack of objection) is felt to be important. But, in this case, approaching relatives is likely to be distressing and perhaps even offensive. There are some parallels here with research on non-competent living adults, which is dealt with in Unit 3. ",
        "28 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Case Study 2.3 Covert surveillance of health care professionals Studies have shown that many health- care professionals in hospital settings do not wash their hands correctly or as often as they should. This is believed to cause infection and illness in a number (possibly a very large number) of patients. A large interna- tional project is proposed to evaluate different methods of generating better hand hygiene. These methods include: (a) warning healthcare professionals that they might be the subjects of covert video or other surveillance; (b) sending healthcare professionals on a training course about hand washing; (c) installing additional hand washing troughs; (d) offering alcohol-based hand rub facilities as an alternative to conventional hand washing; (e) installing \u2018extreme signage\u2019 in staff washing areas and toilets (e.g. comparing non-washers to murderers & showing ghastly images of infected wounds). In general terms, the proposed study will proceed as follows. \u2022 Covert surveillance will be used to establish hand washing frequency baselines for a large number of sites. \u2022 (a)-(e) (above) will then be trialled at selected sites. \u2022 Covert surveillance will be used to assess the effectiveness or otherwise of (a)-(e). At no point will the consent of healthcare professionals or patients be sought because this would, it is argued, invalidate the study. The researchers will seek to anonymise the data collected as far as possible by (e.g.) pixelising (digitally obscuring) name badges and faces, and by removing date and place information from video files. They will not feed back information about individual misconduct (e.g. inadequate hand washing) to hospital managers but do reserve the right to report serious criminal activity. Questions 1. What are the arguments in favour of carrying out this research without the observed persons\u2019 consents? Are these arguments ultimately successful? 2. Can you think of any ways of modifying this research so that consent could be obtained? 3. Would it be ethically better or worse if the people observed were told about their unwitting \u2018participation\u2019 afterwards? ",
        "29 UNIT 2 CONSENT Discussion Most of Unit 2 concerns the nature and scope of valid consent. Case Study 2.3 raises a different issue: under what circumstances (if any) is non-consensual observational research on competent adults (specifically that involving covert surveillance and/or deception) ethically acceptable? Those seeking to justify covert or deceptive research generally claim that it is acceptable when the following conditions are met. (a) The research is worth doing, sufficiently important in its aims to justify overriding the usual requirement for valid consent. In this case, the researchers may claim (for instance) that their research is potentially life-saving. (b) The research cannot, for methodological reasons, be done without either covert observation or deception. In this case, the researchers may say that if the healthcare professionals were aware that they were being observed then they would change their hand washing behaviour, thus invalidating the study. (c) The surveillance and/or experimentation will not substantially harm (or expose to risk) the research subjects. In this case, the researchers could claim that harm and risk will be minimal because: (i) the research subjects will not find out about the research, (ii) anonymisation will be used (as far as possible) thereby reducing the risk of personal information or embarrassing images being revealed, and (iii) (with the exception of serious criminal activity) there will be no reporting of bad behaviour to the management. Against this, it may be argued: (i) that the research subjects might find out about being observed, in which case they are likely to be angry and upset, (ii) that the proposed anonymisa- tion is fallible, and (iii) that there is always a risk of data falling into the wrong hands and (for example) ending up on the internet. (d) The gathering and storage of personal information (information about identifiable individuals) must be kept to a minimum. The researchers in our case could claim to be meeting this requirement by using anonymisation. One concern about this research proposal is requirement (b). For perhaps there are ways of gathering this information that do not require the covert surveillance of individuals. This is one of many examples in which methodological questions impact on the ethics of the research. Several other issues may be discussed in relation to this case. These include: \u2022 Is it possible to wrong research participants without harming them (for example, in a case where they never find out that they have been observed)? \u2022 Would some form of debriefing for participants make this research ethically better (or worse)? For example, researchers might seek to \u2018come clean\u2019 after the research project, informing the subjects of their involvement and perhaps seeking some form of retrospective approval. ",

Robert E. Goodin, Protecting the Vulnerable (London: University of Chicago Press, 1985): 39. Introduction This unit examines the ethical issues that arise when research subjects are vulnerable. The emphasis is on subjects who are non-competent (or lacking the capacity to consent), although it should be made clear that not all vulnerable subjects are non-competent. Most of the learning outcomes will be achieved through discussion of two case studies: one focusing on vulnerable and non-competent adults, and the other on children. However, students may benefit from some preliminary discussion of the concept of vulnerability, covering the following points. \u2018Vulnerability\u2019 is a hard concept to define precisely, and is used in a variety of ways. For example, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) defines vulnerable persons as \u201cthose who are relatively (or absolutely) incapable of protecting their own interests\u201d, ( 1 ) while Goodin views vulnerability specifically as a dependency of one person on another, which, he argues, gives rise to specific moral obligations of the stronger party \u201cto protect the dependent\u201d. ( 2 ) In very general terms, vulnerability may be characterised as the inability of a person to protect their own interests, placing them at greater than normal risk of harm or exploitation. This inability is often associated with a power imbalance between the individual and those who are in a position to cause them harm. However, such definitions do little to distinguish those who are in need of special protection in the research setting, given that most research subjects will be in just such a position simply in virtue of the risks of research participation and the imbalance of power between research subjects and researchers. A working conception of vulnerability must therefore be understood in terms of factors lim- iting the ability of some research subjects to protect their own interests and control their exposure to harms, risks, and exploitation, over and above those resulting from the research setting itself. There are three main ways in which this ability may be compromised: 1. the subjects lack competence and therefore cannot protect themselves from harm by choosing to give or withhold consent, as discussed in Unit 2; 2. the voluntariness of the subjects\u2019 consent is compromised, again affecting their ability to protect them- selves by choosing to give or withhold consent; 3. the subjects\u2019 physical condition leaves them especially liable to harm, for example as a result of frailty through age, disability, or illness. Many different groups may be considered vulnerable for one or more of these reasons; for example young children probably fall under all three headings. Other groups may be vulnerable for less obvious reasons, for example to do with power imbalances between different social groups. The case studies in this unit are designed to facilitate discussion of what constitutes vulnerability in research, which groups are vulnerable, how vulnerability is ethically important, and what kind of research is acceptable using subjects from such groups. In each case the initial focus is on consent \u2013 whether and to what extent consent may be obtained. This leads on to discussion of how important consent is in such cases, whether research should be permitted to go ahead in the absence of valid consent, and, if so, what additional safeguards should be followed to protect the interests and welfare of subjects. ",
        "34 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Case Study 3.1 Research involving adults with terminal illness Dr Abbott, an oncologist at a major teaching hospital, has been asked to put forward a number of her patients for participation in a clinical trial of a new cancer treatment. Mr Day is a terminally ill patient with a type of cancer suitable for participa- tion in this trial. Mr Day is incredibly keen to participate and volunteers at the first opportunity. When asked to explain his eagerness during the recruitment process, he says that God has sent him this opportunity, that the treatment (which he\u2019s \u201cread all about on the internet\u201d) is a \u201cwonder drug\u201d, that it will save his life, and that (if entered into the trial) he expects to be \u201ccompletely cured\u201d in time for Christmas (less than 6 months away). Mr Day\u2019s health carers all think that his views of the trial are extremely over-optimistic. What\u2019s more, his views persist in spite of the fact that he\u2019s been told on a number of occasions that: (a) the experimental treatment is not expected to prolong his life by more than a few months (although it may have quality of life benefits too); (b) this expected benefit cannot be predicted with any certainly; (c) the chances of his being \u201ccompletely cured\u201d by it, or anything else, are close to zero. When confronted with this information, Mr Day just says things like: \u201cyou\u2019re just being cautious and covering your backs\u201d, or \u201cyou lack faith\u201d. Dr Abbott thinks that participation in the trial might benefit Mr Day psychologically, alongside any direct clinical benefits, by sustaining his hopes and suchlike, and (conversely) that not permitting him to take part would be psychologically damaging. She also thinks that the fact that he\u2019s very keen to take part should be taken seriously and that not to do so would be a failure to respect his autonomy. But, on the other hand, Dr Abbot is not sure whether Mr Day is capable of supplying informed consent, since he appears unable or unwilling to grasp the true nature of his situation and of the trial. Questions 1. What are the main ethical issues that this research raises? 2. Is Mr Day in a position to give valid consent to take part in the trial? 3. Would denying Mr Day a chance to participate in the trial be a failure to respect his autonomy? What is the relationship between strong beliefs and autonomous decision-making? ",
        "35 UNIT 3 VULNERABLE AND NON\uf6baCOMPETENT SUBJECTS 3. There is a great deal of disagreement in the literature as to what elements are required of an assessment of competence and discussion of this can be found in the further readings for this Unit. See in particular Allen E. Buchanan and Dan A. Brock, Deciding for Others: the ethics of surrogate decision making (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), Chapter 1. 4. Should the fact that Mr Day\u2019s seemingly irrational beliefs have a religious basis be a matter for special attention in assessing his vulnerability? 5. Would entering Mr Day into the trial be exploiting his vulnerability? 6. Are there any alternatives to Mr Day offering consent or any additional safeguards that should be in place to protect his welfare? Discussion Links with previous topics The case study opens with a broad question that invites students to think about how the ethical theories and concepts introduced in Unit 1 apply in this case. For example, students might discuss how consequentialism can be used to weigh up benefits against potential harms or risks, or whether the research proposed would violate ethical principles such as respect for autonomy or dignity, and how these raise particular issues in rela- tion to vulnerable subjects in virtue of their propensity to harm and restricted ability to protect themselves. In doing so, students may start to see how moral theories and principles can help them to analyse challenging situations in research ethics, even if they are not committed to one particular approach. The remaining questions highlight issues of competence (and to some extent voluntariness). Students should note that these are ethically important because of their roles in the tripartite conception of valid consent introduced in Unit 2, and that, as previously discussed, valid consent is itself important for reasons relating to moral principles such as respect for autonomy and harm avoidance. Thus, lack of competence to consent may, on its own or in combination with other factors such as medical condition (e.g. Mr Day\u2019s terminal illness), social or institutional position, constitute a form of vulnerability. Awareness of these underpinning principles may help students to interpret and apply the more practical concepts; for example, to determine what level of competence is necessary to make a consent valid. Competence Questions 2 and 3, together with the description of Dr Abbot\u2019s concerns about entering Mr Day into her trial, invite reflection on the difficulties of assessing competence (or capacity) to consent. There are certain aspects of Mr Day\u2019s case that might cast doubt on his competence to consent to participate in this trial. In particular, he appears to hold factually incorrect views about the trial and the potential benefits of participation (by thinking he will be \u2018completely cured\u2019), and to be unwilling to engage with the views of his health workers on this matter. It is difficult to provide an uncontentious account of what competence is, but it is generally thought to involve the ability: ( 3 ) ",
        "36 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH 1. to understand and retain relevant information (e.g. about the pros and cons of participating or not in the proposed research); 2. to weigh up that information and make a decision; 3. to decide without undue influence; 4. to communicate consent or refusal. Competence to consent is also said to be decision-relative: a person may be capable of validly consenting to participation in some kinds of research but not others, depending on the degree of complexity and perhaps also (although this is disputed) on the extent of any risk. This account of competence can be explored and evaluated by considering how its various elements relate to the case of Mr Day. Question 4 raises the issue of whether the religious basis of Mr Day\u2019s apparently irrational beliefs about the trial should make a difference to our assessment of his capacity to consent. Freedom of religion and respect for people\u2019s religious views are considered key values in many societies. Moreover, it is widely held that sub- scribing to a system of values considered unusual or eccentric by most people should not in itself be consid- ered evidence of irrationality or incompetence. However, what is at stake here is whether Mr Day actually holds false beliefs about his prospects in the trial. Factors worth considering are whether Mr Day\u2019s assertions should be interpreted as expressions of his hopes (deriving from religious convictions), rather than firm factual beliefs; whether he is engaging in some form of self-deception as a psychological mechanism to protect him- self from what he really knows to be true; or whether what he says is attempting to hide the fact that he does not understand the nature of the trial. Vulnerability and inclusion in research Question 5 invites consideration of vulnerability in respects other than those relating to competence, and whether these make it ethically inappropriate to include Mr Day in the trial. In particular, discussion can centre on whether and in what ways being diagnosed as having a terminal illness is a source of vulnerability. One issue is the lack of alternative treatment options. The concern here is that if the only possible hope of extending one\u2019s life is an experimental treatment, this may leave a patient suffering from a terminal illness with no reason- able choice other than to participate in the research trial. As mentioned in Unit 2, it is a matter of debate whether such a lack of alternatives genuinely impinges on the voluntariness of the consent process. One might also wish to discuss whether the experience of being diagnosed with a terminal illness can itself impact on an individual\u2019s ability to consent to participation, and if so, under what circumstances? Other issues that arise in the context of terminal illness are that an individual may be especially prone to suffer physical harm due to the nature of their terminal condition, that any adverse effects of experimental treat- ments on the patient\u2019s abilities or relationships with others may be especially damaging because of the point in the patient\u2019s life when they occur and the lack of future opportunities, and that there is unlikely to be an opportunity to compensate the individual for any harm that arises in this period. These concerns raise the question of whether, and in what circumstances, including terminally ill and other vulnerable people in research is defensible. A common view, reflected in many in research ethics guidelines, ",
        "37 UNIT 3 VULNERABLE AND NON\uf6baCOMPETENT SUBJECTS is that this is justified only when the results cannot be obtained by using less vulnerable research subjects, and when the research is likely to benefit if not the subject then at least others in the same vulnerable group. We shall return to this when discussing the next Case Study (3.2) . Safeguards for vulnerable and non-competent subjects One reason for caution about allowing non-competent subjects to participate in research is that they lack the ability to protect their own interests by choosing whether or not to participate. Question 6 invites students to consider whether the interests of research subjects such as Mr Day might be protected in other ways. Key issues arising in relation to non-competent subjects include proxy consent, where someone else consents on behalf of a non-competent subject, and advance statements, where the subject consents in advance of an anticipated loss of competence. Other factors that may have special importance for non-competent or other vulnerable subjects include protection of privacy and confidentiality. These may be especially important in cases of vulnerability due to social factors, such as sexuality, ethnic grouping, or domestic abuse, where revealing information may have significant detrimental effects on the subject\u2019s safety or welfare. Careful monitoring of subjects\u2019 welfare during the research may also be important in cases where their ability to recognise and communicate problems is likely to be impaired. Case Study 3.2 Research into the role of carers for Alzheimer\u2019s patients The increasing number of people diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease has led to a significant growth in the number of people needed to care for them. Researchers want to find out how people with Alzheimer\u2019s relate to their carers, and the impact this has on both patients and carers. The initial aim of the research is to identify the challenges that carers most often face as well as the aspects of care that do most to enhance or reduce the welfare of people with Alzheimer\u2019s. The researchers believe that answering these questions is vital if they are to develop better training and support systems for carers. Researchers plan to carry out observational research on the daily activities of carers as they go about their normal duties caring for Alzheimer\u2019s patients. The observations will be carried out in a number of different institutions where people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease are cared for, such ",
        "38 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH as nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and respite centres. Researchers also want to distribute questionnaires to carers and, where possible, patients to find out their responses to a number of central issues, such as: \u2022 Which aspects of working with people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease do carers find easy and which aspects do they find difficult or stressful? and: \u2022 Which aspects of the carers\u2019 approach do most to enhance or harm the welfare of people with Alzheimer\u2019s? The researchers are aware that the patients involved in the research will have varying levels of competence. Consent will be sought from all carers involved in the research, as well as the institutions in which the observations are taking place. Every effort will be made to gain consent from each patient. Where a patient is not competent to consent, proxy consent will be sought from the most appropriate third party. Questions 1. What are the main benefits that might arise from this research proposal? 2. What are the ethical problems with this research proposal? In particular, is it ethical to conduct the research on those patients with Alzheimer\u2019s who are incompetent and cannot consent? 3. What additional efforts should be made to increase the understanding about the research for those with Alzheimer\u2019s? Do you think such efforts could have a negative effect on the patients? 4. Should any additional safeguards be put in place to protect the welfare of research subjects who are unable to give valid consent? Discussion Case Study 3.2 involves research into a condition which often results in a lack of competence. It therefore invites consideration of the permissibility of research involving such subjects, and ways in which the interests of such subjects should be safeguarded. In response to Question 1, it should be noted that the research proposed in the case study offers the prospect of significant benefits for both people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and their carers. \u2022 The research subjects themselves may benefit, if the results of the research are used to provide better support and training for carers, and which in turn will benefit the patients they care for. \u2022 If this knowledge is used more widely to develop and implement improved approaches to caring for people with Alzheimer\u2019s, this will benefit future patients and carers. Question 2 asks about the ethical problems arising from the proposal. The most obvious problems result from the inclusion of potentially vulnerable people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the research. Discussion of this may include the following. ",
        "39 UNIT 3 VULNERABLE AND NON\uf6baCOMPETENT SUBJECTS \u2022 Care should be taken to determine the level of competence of subjects who have conditions that can cause cognitive impairment, since the ability to understand, retain and evaluate relevant information, or to make and communicate a decision based upon it may vary widely even amongst patients with the same condition. Competence may also decline gradually over the course of a study so that a patient who is able to consent at the beginning of the study may lose that capacity during the trial. Similarly com- petence may fluctuate so that a patient who is incompetent at the beginning of the trial may be capable of giving or withholding consent at certain points in the research. \u2022 As noted above, it is commonly held that research involving vulnerable subjects is only permissible if it is not possible to obtain the same results using less vulnerable subjects. This requirement is satisfied in this case, since it is the condition being researched (Alzheimer\u2019s) which generates the vulnerability. Unit 6 will discuss how the exclusion of vulnerable subjects from research may have detrimental conse- quences for society, and especially for those with conditions that result in exclusion and are therefore under-researched. \u2022 Many of the Alzheimer\u2019s patients will be elderly and therefore potentially physically vulnerable. The risk of harm is low because the research is largely observational and involves no change to the patients\u2019 daily care. However, there may be some risk of patients becoming distressed or the quality of care being adversely affected because of the presence of observers. \u2022 There are concerns about the privacy and dignity of those being cared for, given that observers may wit- ness behaviours and aspects of care of an intimate nature, which the cared-for person would not permit observers to view if he or she was competent. There are also ethical concerns relating to the effects of the research on the carers. The Case Study does not specify whether the carers who will be involved in the research are employees of the institution in which the research will take place, members of the patients\u2019 families, volunteers, or a mixture of these. \u2022 If they are paid carers then concerns might arise about the uses that their employer might make of infor- mation acquired through the research. \u2022 If they are members of patients\u2019 families, then they might themselves be vulnerable, due to the emotional or psychological impact of the deterioration of a loved one, or the stresses of being an unpaid carer. \u2022 For carers in any of these groups, the observation may give rise to privacy concerns. Researchers need to consider under what circumstances information identifying individual carers will be supplied to the rel- evant authorities in the case of abusive, dangerous or criminal behaviour being observed or disclosed. Issues about privacy and disclosure will be addressed further in Unit 4. Question 3 raises the issue of how to deal with those subjects whose decline in health has placed them at or just below the threshold level of competence. These subjects may be able to give valid consent if they are given additional help to aid their understanding of the research. However, care needs to be taken that this does not lead to unnecessary distress: forcing dementia patients to confront aspects of their mental state in an attempt to make them better understand the research may be distressing to them, while over-simplifica- tion of the proposed research may be taken by some as an affront to their dignity. Question 4 asks what might be done to protect the welfare of those research subjects who, even with help, are unable to give valid consent to participate in the research. One approach is to consider alternatives to the standard consent processes, including proxy consent and advanced statements (as discussed in relation ",
        "40 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH to Case Study 3.1 ). Another common suggestion is that where a subject cannot give valid consent, their assent (understood as agreement to participate given by an individual who is not competent to give valid consent) should be sought and any expression of dissent (refusal to participate) should be respected. These approaches provide some indication of an incompetent subject\u2019s wishes, but are not equivalent to valid consent. It may therefore also be considered appropriate to set the level of acceptable risk lower for these subjects than for those who can consent to the risk. Case Study 3.3 Research into treatments for behavioural disorders in children Professor Helsinki, a world famous psychiatrist specializing in the treatment of children, wants to comparatively evaluate four different treatments for a rare behavioural disorder called RBDC. RBDC, which involves occasional bouts of abusive and violent behaviour and episodes of severe paranoia, is most prevalent in 11-15 year-olds, but 14 % of cases occur in young adults, and a further 6 % of cases are in people aged over 25. All of the treatments that Professor Helsinki wants to test are \u2018standard\u2019 insofar as each has been used in clinical practice in the recent past. However, the evidential basis for each one is minimal (at least specifically in relation to RBDC) and none is proven to work. In general terms, the options for trial are: i. a widely used pharmaceutical product; ii. a programme of anger management and relaxation exercises; iii. group therapy; iv. cognitive behavioural therapy. Professor Helsinki wants to enter virtually all of his patients with RBDC (all of whom are minors younger than 16) into the study and to randomly allocate them into one of the above options. He proposes to do this without telling them or their parents/guardians and, hence, without prior consent for participation in the research (although the parents/guardians will be informed after the trial). Consent for the particular therapies offered will be obtained as normal, but the patients and their parents will not be told about the existence of the study or about the randomisation process. ",
        "41 UNIT 3 VULNERABLE AND NON\uf6baCOMPETENT SUBJECTS Professor Helsinki\u2019s grounds for the non-disclosure policy include: (a) that disclosure to patients or parents would undermine the scientific validity of the study by affecting the behaviour & mental states of the research subjects; (b) that disclosure would harm the research subjects by upsetting them and/or exacerbating their paranoia (e.g. the idea of being \u2018experimented on\u2019 and \u2018watched\u2019 would be highly disturbing to many of these young people); (c) that disclosure would make it impossible to recruit research subjects; (d) that most people with RBDC lack the capacity to validly consent owing to the nature of the illness; (e) that this important research will benefit sufferers from RBDC and may even benefit the research subjects themselves; (f) that his patients could have (\u2018randomly\u2019) received any of the treatment options in ordinary clinical practice depending on, for example, where they happen to live and that Helsinki\u2019s research is just a more systematic and scientifically valuable version of what would have happened anyway. Questions 1. What are the likely benefits of conducting this research? 2. What are the ethical problems with this research proposal? In particular, is it ethical to conduct the research without obtaining the consent of either the children participating in the trial or that of their parents/guardians? 3. Do Professor Helsinki\u2019s grounds for non-disclosure justify her carrying out the trial without consent? 4. Are there any additional safeguards that should be put in place to protect the welfare of the research subjects if they are unable to give valid consent to participate? Discussion The use of children in research is a sensitive issue, which has received special attention in research codes and regulations (e.g. CIOMS\u2019 International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, Guideline 14 ( 4 ) and the European Union\u2019s Clinical Trials Directive, Article 4 ( 5 )), although many of the general concerns about vulnerability are also applicable to children. There are interesting ethical questions about when children can be competent to consent to participate in research, the role of parents and guardians, the ways in which they may be vulnerable, and the nature of the safeguards that should be implemented when they are the subjects of research. Case Study 3.3 may be used to initiate a discussion of these issues. 4.

        "42 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Question 1 invites general reflection on the benefits of research involving children. As with other vulnerable populations there is a question about when research involving children should be permitted, and a commonly held view is that, at least for research that carries significant risks, children should only be used when the research produces benefits for children that cannot be achieved using adult subjects. This is most obvi- ously the case when researching a condition or social phenomenon that only or mainly affects children so that adult participants are not available (or not available in sufficient numbers). However, it is increasingly recognised that there is reason to include children when researching treatments for non age-specific medical conditions, in order to understand how the treatments will function in children. An important consideration would therefore be whether the fact that there are adults who suffer from this condition would make it unnecessary to carry out the study using child subjects. Questions 2, 3 and 4 focus discussion on issues relating to consent in children. Possible topics for discussion include: \u2022 the fact that children acquire competence gradually and at different rates so that some of the children in the study will meet the criteria for competence while others will not; \u2022 whether consent to participate in research requires a higher level of competence than consent to similar interventions in a purely therapeutic context; \u2022 what role parental consent can have in the case of non-competent children, and whether it should always be required in the case of children who meet the criteria for competence; \u2022 what role the welfare of parents and carers should have in a decision about a child\u2019s participation in research; \u2022 whether there is a requirement for children to assent to participate in research, and how the child\u2019s deci- sion may be permissibly be influenced by adults, in such cases. Welfare issues relating to children in research are examined in question 4. Question 5 explores what additional measures besides obtaining a child\u2019s and/or parent\u2019s consent should be taken to safeguard child participants from harm. Some measures may be similar to those appropriate for vulnerable adults, but may raise distinc- tive problems in the case of children. For example, research into the sexual activity of teenage children may give rise to a conflict between protection of the subjects\u2019 confidentiality and obtaining of parental consent, while restricting participation to teenagers willing to confide in their parents would produce a skewed result. Similarly, concern to protect confidentiality may conflict with the imperative to intervene where abuse or a risk of serious harm is discovered. ",
        "43 UNIT 3 VULNERABLE AND NON\uf6baCOMPETENT SUBJECTS Further issues The cases can be used to open-up discussion of the wide range of different factors that can give rise to vulnerability in research subjects. Vulnerability can arise from factors such as physical or mental disability or infirmity, age, membership of minority groups subject to disadvantage or discrimination, and from experiences that may form the subject of research. Examples of potentially vulnerable groups not covered by the case studies in this unit include: \u2022 asylum seekers and survivors of violence; \u2022 addicts; \u2022 disabled people; \u2022 patients requiring emergency medical intervention; \u2022 the recently bereaved; \u2022 homeless people; \u2022 ethnic or racial minorities; \u2022 prisoners.

Specifically, students will gain the following: I. An understanding of the definition of both concepts that will allow them to grasp what privacy is and what confidentiality is. II. An appreciation of the ethical importance of privacy and confidentiality in research. III. An awareness of the main challenges to maintaining privacy and confidentiality in research, including those imposed by methodological demands such as covert observation. IV. An increased knowledge of how ethical issues relating to privacy and confidentiality may arise in research. V.

        "47 UNIT 4 PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY Introduction This unit of study explores two substantial and related ethical constraints in research ethics: privacy and confidentiality. Both are central to research ethics and there is often both an ethical and a legal duty to respect them. It builds upon previous units of study by relating its subject matter to ethical theories (from Unit 1), issues surrounding consent (from Unit 2) and the protection of vulnerable groups (from Unit 3). Matters of privacy and confidentiality will be explored through the use of two case studies, chosen to engage students in thinking about these issues in the research context. The first case focuses primarily on privacy while the second focuses on confidentiality. The questions provided on each case study are designed to help students identify the main ethical issues raised by the research, which include issues familiar from previous units of study as well as the new issues of privacy and confidentiality. Analysis of the case studies will be used to raise general issues relating to each of the key concepts, starting with their definitions and an account of their ethical basis. This will draw on ethical theories familiar from Unit 1, including consequentialist welfare concerns and deontological or respect-based constraints. Students will be made aware of relevant statements in international codes and declarations. Subsequent discussion will look at the challenges to privacy and confidentiality in a research setting, and strategies for reconciling respect for privacy and confidentiality with the needs of research through consent and/or anonymisation. Ultimately, questions will be raised as to whether there are any situations in which it is acceptable to override privacy and confidentiality because of other important considerations in research. Case Study 4.1 Observational research in an Accident and Emergency Department A psychology researcher wishes to investigate the ways in which indi- viduals try to attract attention from authority figures. The researcher pro- poses to observe the waiting area in a city hospital Accident and Emergency (A & E) Department and record the actions of those who attend seeking treatment. The time that people first enter the reception area will be noted, as will the times at which people see relevant hospital employees (medical receptionist, triage nurse, attending doctor). Any attempts to bring attention to themselves in order to be seen before being officially called will be noted, as will the nature and outcome of ",
        "48 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH the action. No attempt will be made to obtain individuals\u2019 consent to participate in this research project, as it is believed that the knowledge that they are being observed might alter their behaviour and lead to unrepresentative results. As it is only types of behaviour and people\u2019s responses to it that are under investigation, there will be no attempt to link behaviour to identifiable individuals and hence the research results will be entirely anonymous. Permission has been granted from the hospital in question to carry out the research, although the individual staff members have not been asked for their consent to participate. It is hoped that the information gathered will not only have implications for behavioural psychology but could also be used to train hospital staff to deal with potentially inflammatory situations in the A & E Department. Questions 1. What are the main benefits and ethical problems that this research raises? 2. Does the research place anyone at risk? 3. Is it an invasion of privacy to observe the injured or ill whilst waiting for treatment in an A & E waiting room? 4. Do the methodological requirements of this observational study outweigh any concerns about privacy and the fact that subjects have not consented to be observed? 5. Does anonymous recording of data allay any concerns you may have about respect for privacy? 6. Should this research be allowed to proceed in its present form? If not, how might it be modified to make it more acceptable? Case Study 4.2 Genetic research into susceptibility to respiratory disease in smoky environments A research team is trying to under- stand the genetic basis of respiratory diseases such as asthma, lung cancer and emphysema, which are attributed to environmental factors. One area they are particularly keen to explore is whether the presence of a particular genetic trait significantly increases the chances of people developing such a respiratory disease when exposed to tobacco smoke. Researchers intend to identify families (through a clinical referral from children seeking treatment for asthma) with a significant incidence of respiratory disease, in which several relatives have died from asthma or lung cancer in the past. What is crucial for the success of this study is obtaining a sufficient number of related individuals with or without the condition who consent to be evaluated and to have blood tested for the genetic trait. A further important component is the testing of ",
        "49 UNIT 4 PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY children and other family members who do not themselves smoke but who live or were raised in an environment containing second-hand smoke. Suitable families for the study are rare so the researchers propose to study them one at a time as they find them over a period of time. One family in question is large enough to potentially provide sufficient data for the study to be a success. It is suspected that those family members who possess the genetic trait under scrutiny will be more likely to develop a respiratory disease than family members who do not possess the gene but who were raised in a similarly smoky environment. The first indications that a respiratory disease has developed usually appear in childhood asthmatic conditions, although this may develop later in life. Questions 1. What are the main benefits and ethical problems that this research proposal raises? 2. Is it ethical to take blood samples from affected children? What about from the unaffected adults and children? 3. Is it appropriate to withhold results from the family on the grounds this is only one small part of a study of a complex genetic condition? If not, to whom should they be disclosed? Discussion Links with previous topics Both case studies raise issues that will be familiar from previous units of study and may be used to draw links between privacy and confidentiality and topics addressed previously. The question about the benefits and problems arising in each case study invites students to think about how consequentialism would weigh up the benefits and harms in each case, and conversely how the research might violate norms such as respect for autonomy or dignity. In so doing they may see how these moral theories and principles highlight different reasons for regarding privacy and confidentiality as ethically important. Students are likely also to notice the absence of consent in the A & E case, and the involvement of children who may not be competent to give consent in the genetic research case. Both cases may involve subjects who are considered vulnerable (children in the respiratory disease case; people with serious illness or injury in both case; people under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the A & E case). This may prompt students to consider whether privacy and/or confidentiality is especially important for vulnerable individuals. Privacy Issues about privacy are primarily raised by Case Study 4.1 and discussion should cover what privacy is, its ethical importance, challenges to privacy in a research setting, and whether it is ever ethical to invade privacy without consent for research purposes. Discussion of the nature of privacy is prompted by question 3 (Is it an invasion of privacy to observe the injured or ill whilst waiting for treatment in an A & E waiting room?). This invites reflection on: ",

Relevant considerations here are that even in public we may talk of invading someone\u2019s personal space, and that the A & E Department is not somewhere that patients typically make an unconstrained choice to visit, and is a place of work for the staff. \u2022 Whether the type of observation proposed constitutes an \u2018intrusion\u2019, and whether what counts as an intrusion is relative to the environment in which it takes place and the reasonable expectations of those who are observed. Students might be asked to consider whether the mode of recording, e.g. memory, written notes, video, makes a difference to whether the observation is intrusive. Is it more or less intrusive if those who are observed do not know that the observation is taking place? Although there is no single uncontroversial definition of privacy, students may be introduced to, and invited to assess, definitions from the philosophical literature ( 1 ) and the usage of the concept in international docu- ments such as the Universal Declaration on Human Rights ( 2 ) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. ( 3 ) Between them, these identify a cluster of issues commonly discussed under the heading of privacy, including territorial privacy, privacy of communications, protection of family life, and individuals\u2019 ability to control information about, and access to, themselves. Discussion of the ethical importance of privacy may draw on students\u2019 answers to questions 1 and 2 (particu- larly their identification of ethical problems and risks associated with breach of privacy). Broadly, the impor- tance of privacy can be related to the cluster of interests that it protects. These may include certain fundamental aspects of freedom, independence and personal human dignity, including freedom from scrutiny, prejudice, pressure to conform, exploitation, and the judgment of others. Having considered its ethical basis, attention can be given to the strength of the obligation to protect privacy. Although there is not considered to be an absolute right to privacy (i.e. a right that cannot be breached in any circumstances), a key question in research ethics is how strong our obligation to respect privacy should be, and when if ever it should be overridden by pressing concerns of research. Students should have given some consideration to this in addressing question 4. Relevant issues for discussion include whether breach of privacy really is necessary for a methodologically sound study or whether it would be possible to obtain consent for the necessary observation, the value of the research in question, compared with the amount of harm likely to result from the breach of privacy, and the steps that might be taken (including recording the observations anonymously) to minimise the effects of the intrusion. ",
        "51 UNIT 4 PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY Privacy and confidentiality Question 5 provides a bridge between discussion of privacy in relation to Case Study 4.1 and discussion of con- fidentiality in relation to Case Study 4.2 . The suggestion that anonymous recording of information can assuage concerns about privacy is one that is often made about confidentiality. However, it is important to recognise that privacy and confidentiality are distinct concepts. Differences between them include the following. (i) Confidentiality is related to information in a way that privacy is not. Only information can be confidential, but places (e.g. bedrooms) can be private. (ii) The duty of confidentiality arises only within the context of special relationships and/or agreements (e.g. contracts). We only have duties of confidentiality where information has been given to us subject to an agreement or understanding that it will not be further disclosed without permission. This is not (or not obviously) true of the duty to respect privacy. Thus, ordinary members of the public who are unknown to me have a duty to respect my privacy but typically have no duty of confidentiality towards me. The duty to respect others\u2019 privacy is therefore a more general duty than that of confidentiality. (iii) Respect for privacy might place constraints on the ways in which researchers (and others) acquire infor- mation about their subjects whereas confidentiality is chiefly about what you do with information that you already have. Covert video surveillance is an example of a practice that arguably breaches privacy (although perhaps justifiably in some cases) but not confidentiality. Research that involves accessing exist- ing confidential data from records, may breach the record owner\u2019s duty of confidentiality to the provider of the information, and the user of the information may commit a breach of privacy if the information is of a personal nature. (iv) One can owe duties of confidentiality to institutions, as well as to individuals. This is not true of privacy. Confidentiality Case Study 4.2 also raises issues about privacy. For example, there are potential intrusions into subjects\u2019 privacy insofar as researchers enquire about family relationships between subjects, matters of personal lifestyle (e.g. smoking habits) and if their research involved visits to subjects\u2019 homes (e.g. in order to obtain or verify information about environmental smoke levels. However, discussion of this case should primarily address issues about confidentiality. The nature of confidentiality has already been raised in the preceding comparison with privacy. However, a key point is that confidentiality is about respecting undertakings given (perhaps implicitly) to providers of information about how that information will be used or disclosed. Thus, the obligation to respect confiden- tiality is a species of promise keeping. It is important to note, however, that that the undertaking to maintain confidentiality need not be explicitly given. Providers of information may have reasonable expectations that their information will be kept confidential, which recipients of information should respect. This point is particularly relevant in health care contexts where there is a convention, backed up by professional codes of practice, that information given to heath care professionals will be treated in confidence. If researchers do not intend to act in accordance with the likely assumptions of information providers they can make clear how they will use any information before it is disclosed to them. These issues can be related to the case study by considering what expectations the research subjects might reasonably have about the ways in which genetic, behavioural and environmental data will be used and the people to whom it might be communicated. ",
        "52 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH The ethical importance of confidentiality is partly given by its nature as a species of promise keeping. It is generally considered that breaking promises is (usually) wrong because it undermines the autonomy of the person to whom the promise has been made, is liable to cause harm to that person, and is damaging to the social institutions of promising and trust on which many social interactions depend. The issue of trust has a further significance in relation to research: researchers often need access to the kinds of information that people are reluctant to disclose. People may be willing to disclose such information under conditions of confidentiality but are less likely to do so if they become aware of previous breaches of confidentiality by researchers. Thus, if the researchers in Case Study 4.2 deliberately or inadvertently revealed sensitive infor- mation about one family member to another, or to the wider public, the potential for researchers to conduct similar research in the future may be damaged. This case also raises some of the problems of maintaining confidentiality in a research setting. One problem central to the research activity itself is that researchers may need access to data that is governed by confidentiality, under conditions that do not include its use for research. In Case Study 4.2 , for example, the researchers may want to access medical records in order to assess the extent to which individuals are affected by respiratory disease. One strategy for dealing with this is to seek consent of the person the information relates to. Since the obli- gation to maintain confidentiality arises from an undertaking given to the original information provider, consent from that person to disclose it will remove the obligation. In Case Study 4.2 this may be a workable solution. However, in other cases it may not be. For example: \u2022 the person concerned may not be competent to consent; \u2022 contact details may not be available, especially where the data was gathered a long time ago; \u2022 in cases which involve data about traumatic issues, making contact in order to seek consent might risk distressing the subject; \u2022 the number of subjects involved may be too large for contacting them to be practicable; \u2022 seeking consent might result in a skewed sample, invalidating the results of the research. Another strategy for making confidential data available to researchers is to anonymise it. This severs the con- nection between the information and the individual, so that the information no longer reveals anything about that person. There are, however, limits to the effectiveness of this strategy. Somebody has to access the raw data in order to perform the anonymisation and if that person is not entitled to access it under the terms of its confidentiality then at least a small breach will have occurred. In a localised study, or where dealing with rare conditions, individuals may be identifiable in published results even if the data is anonymised. Anonymisation may also make it harder for results to be checked for errors or scientific fraud. It also gives rise to an ethical problem where information (e.g. that someone has a serious but treatable disease) could be used to save someone from serious harm. A compromise is to use coded data, where identifying information is removed from the raw data, but can be linked back to the identifying information via a \u2018key\u2019. In this case it is important for researchers to consider in advance under what circumstances the key will be used to link the data back to the individual. ",
        "53 UNIT 4 PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY Other problems in maintaining confidentiality arise from specific features of Case Study 4.2 . Since it involves genetic data, it illustrates how revealing such information about one individual can have implications about other, related individuals. Thus an individual might find that other family members acquire knowledge of his genetic status (or that he himself acquires unwanted knowledge of his genetic status) without having consented to disclosure of his test results and without any formal breach of confidentially having occurred. In such cases we might conclude that it is unhelpful to think in terms of ownership and individual control of information, and that attention instead needs to be given to balancing the benefits and harms likely to result from particular disclosures. Case Study 4.2 also raises the possibility that researchers will want to study medical records of, or ask family members about, deceased relatives. Clearly this is a case in which consent for the disclosure of confidential information cannot be obtained. However, this also raises a questions about the extent to which obligations of privacy and confidentiality extend to the dead. Although we cannot be physically harmed once we are dead, our reputations can still be damaged by disclosure of information, and we may think that the auton- omous wishes of a former person still warrant respect (as discussed in relation to Case Study 2.2 ). This also raises an issue about the effect that disclosing information about the dead may have on living relatives, either as a result of revealing shared genetic properties or by giving rise to distressing memories or new knowledge relating to the deceased person. Finally, given the limits to what can be achieved by anonymisation and consent, the conflict between research objectives which rely on use of confidential data and the principle of respect for autonomy may be inescap- able. Consideration therefore needs to be given to the question of when, if ever, it is justifiable to breach confidentiality in order to achieve research objectives. Relevant factors to be discussed might include the sensitivity of the confidential information and the level of harm liable to result from its disclosure, and the importance and methodological soundness of the research. The significance attached to these factors is likely to differ between adherents of the different moral theories discussed in Unit 1. ",
        "54 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Further issues 1. Databases. Issues of privacy and confidentiality (as well as issues about consent and data security) arise on a large scale, when databases containing information relating to individuals are set up for research purposes, or when researchers are given access to databases originally set up for other purposes. These issues will be explored in Case Study 8.5 . 2. The tension between the obligation to respect privacy and confidentiality, and the obligation to disclose information relating to illegal activity or risk of serious harm. How should these be balanced in different kinds of cases, for example: \u2022 where disclosure could save the subject from serious harm; \u2022 where disclosure could save a third party from serious harm; \u2022 where illegal activity has been observed or reported; \u2022 where there is a legal obligation to report a matter to the authorities? To what extent should subjects be informed in advance that disclosures of these kinds will be made, bearing in mind that in some area of research this may reduce recruitment and lead to subjects being less candid than they would otherwise be? 3. The risk of some subjects disclosing other subjects\u2019 confidential information, e.g. following focus group discussions. How can this risk be minimised? What kinds of warnings about such disclosure should be given to participants? Does this risk place limits on the kinds of research for which focus groups should be used?

        "57 UNIT 5 BALANCING HARMS AND BENEFITS: THE CASE OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS 1. The case described here is a fictional one which includes elements of real pieces of research. See for example the trial described in T.B. Freeman et al., \u201cUse of placebo surgery in controlled trials of a cellular-based therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease\u201d, New England Journal of Medicine 341, no. 13 (1999): 988-91. Introduction This unit addresses two intersecting themes. Firstly, it invites students to consider issues about the benefits and harms produced by research. On the benefit side this will include the distinction between knowledge that is sought for practical (e.g. medical) reasons and that which is sought for purely intrinsic reasons, and the effect of this distinction on the justifiabil- ity of risking harm to participants. There will also be discussion of the differing ethical significance of benefits to different parties, e.g. participants, researchers and associated institutions, and wider society at large. On the harm side, discussion will cover the definition of harm, different types of harm, and the relation between harm and risk, including issues about the handling of very small risks, low probability/high magnitude and unquantifiable risks. Ethical issues about the use of human embryos in research will be raised, though detailed discussion of this will be deferred until Unit 8. Consideration may be given to the balancing of risk against benefit with reference to the distribution of benefits and risks, the distinction between causing and allowing harms to happen, and the impact of consent on the acceptability of risk (and of level of risk on the need for consent). Secondly, the unit addresses particular issues of harm and benefit that arise within Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs). These include the possibility of physician/researchers violating their \u2018therapeutic obligation\u2019 by subjecting patients in control arms of trials to inferior or placebo treatments, and problems of consent in RCTs arising from the \u2018therapeutic misconception\u2019 and the role of experimental treatment as an inducement. The principle of equipoise will be considered as a possible but controversial response to these problems. The Unit uses a single case study to raise both the general issues and those specific to RCTs. Case Study 5.1 Randomised placebo-controlled trial to investigate surgical treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease ( 1 ) Parkinson\u2019s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the patient\u2019s motor function and producing symptoms including tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement. The impairment of motor function is caused by loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Standard treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease is levodopa, which converts to dopamine in the brain. However, this results in further suppression of endogenous dopamine production and so becomes less effective with prolonged use. ",
        "58 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Experiments using rats and non- human primates have suggested that implanting fetal neural tissue into the brains of affected individuals can improve motor function. Several centres have consequently developed programmes of fetal tissue transplanta- tion for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease in humans. Some of these have reported significant and lasting benefits; however, the possibility that these result from a placebo effect or investigator bias cannot be ruled out. Moreover, fetal neural tissue used for this procedure is in limited supply, and the fact that it is derived from aborted human fetuses makes this therapy ethically controversial and vulnerable to changes in legal or regulatory regimes. A randomised controlled trial is proposed to determine the effectiveness and safety of the fetal tissue procedure and to compare it to an alternative (xenotransplantation) therapy using tissue derived from pigs. If successful, the latter would provide an alternative that could be used by patients with a conscientious objection to the use of fetal tissue or in jurisdictions where the use of such material is not permitted. All subjects recruited to this trial will be patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease who are receiving the standard treatment. They will continue to receive standard treatment throughout the trial, but will in addition be randomly assigned to one of the four \u2018arms\u2019 of the trial. 1) Subjects in this arm will receive implants of human fetal tissue taken from a single donor. These will be administered by injection into the brain after drilling a hole in the skull under general anaesthetic. 2) Subjects in this arm will receive the same treatment as those in the first arm, except that in this case the implant will consist of material taken from multiple donors. Results of animal experimentation suggest that implants from multiple donors may have a better success rate than those from single donors. 3) Subjects in this arm will receive a similar implant but consisting of porcine neural cells. ",
        "59 UNIT 5 BALANCING HARMS AND BENEFITS: THE CASE OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS 4) Subjects in this arm will receive a placebo treatment designed to simulate the experience of subjects in the active arms of the trial. This will include magnetic resonance imaging, anaesthesia, a skin incision and partial drilling of the skull, but without penetration into the brain. The trial will be \u2018double blinded\u2019 in that neither the subject nor those evaluating the results of the procedures will know which arm an individual is assigned to. The surgeon will know which treatment an individual receives but will have no contact with those evaluating the results. Subjects will be provided with information about all four arms of the trial and will consent to being randomly allocated. They will be evaluated every three months for two years following the procedure. Subjects will have the right to withdraw from the trial at any point, except that those in the xenotransplantation arm will be subject to ongoing monitoring as a precaution against them becoming a vector for the transmission of porcine infections into the wider human population. The researchers think that this is extremely unlikely, as the cells will be taken from pigs raised in \u2018specified pathogen free\u2019 herds and subject to close monitoring. However, the possibility cannot be conclusively ruled out and the researchers think that monitoring is necessary to allay public concerns. Provision for this will be included in the original consent. Questions 1. Who are the potential beneficiaries of this piece of research and in what ways do they stand to benefit? What are the advantages of the proposed trial design? 2. What are the potential harms resulting from this trial and who is put at risk by it? Which potential harms do you think are most important? 3. What ethical problems, if any, are raised by the use of the placebo control? 4. Are participants in a position to give valid consent? Why (or why not)? What difference does this make to your assessment of the trial? 5. Do you think the trial is ethically acceptable as described? Why (or why not)? If you need more information to decide, what questions would you ask the researcher and what answers would satisfy you that the trial was justified? Are there any other modifications that would make you more likely to approve the proposed trial? 6. What should happen if a preliminary analysis (while the trial is ongoing) gives some indication (although not conclusive) of differences in outcome between those on different arms of the trial? 7. Would a more limited trial consisting of the following arms be ethically preferable? If so, why? a. arms (1), (2) and (4); b. arms (3) and (4); c. arms (1), (2) and (3). ",
        "60 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH 2. World Medical Association, Declaration of Helsinki: ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects (2008), Article 6. http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm Discussion Links with previous units Students should notice that the major issues raised in this case study and discussed in this unit have been encountered, though not analysed in detail, in previous units. Several of the earlier case studies were randomised controlled trials, though not explicitly identified as such, and important issues relating to the potential for harm to research participants have been discussed, for example in relation to breaches of privacy and confidentiality. However, whereas the principles of consent and respect for autonomy were central to the discussion in previous units, the focus here is on the kinds of harm and benefit that research can give rise to, and how these should be balanced against each other. In considering limits to acceptable levels of risk, and the balancing of risk against benefits, students should consider the moral theories introduced in Unit 1 as well as the pronouncements of codes of research ethics such as the Declaration of Helsinki. Benefits of research Since almost any research involving human subjects will involve some cost to the participants (e.g. risk of harm, inconvenience, sacrifice of time or monetary expenses) some corresponding benefit seems necessary in order to justify it. It is therefore important to distinguish different types of benefits that research can produce and their differing moral significance. In response to question 1, it may be noted that the research described in the case study, like most medical research, is primarily intended to benefit future patients. In this case future patients may have their quality of life improved by treatments that are developed and/or adopted as a result of the research or by being are spared from going through treatments that are shown to be ineffective or dangerous. The RCT methodology makes it likely that the research, provided it is well designed, will achieve reliable results that will be widely accepted by the medical community and regulatory and funding authorities. Research participants may also benefit from the experimental treatments, but this is uncertain both because the treatments are as yet unproven and may be in need of refinement, and because a proportion of participants will be allocated to the placebo group. Extrapolating from the case study we can identify some general factors to be considered when evaluating the benefits of a piece of research: \u2022 Benefits can accrue to research participants and to others (e.g. future patients, society at large, and research- ers and their institutions). Different ethical frameworks will give rise to different views about the permis- sibility of trading off costs borne by participants against benefits to others. The Declaration of Helsinki takes a strong stance against interpersonal trade-offs of this kind in its assertion that the wellbeing of the individual subject must take precedence over all other interests, ( 2 ) but if this is applied too literally most research will be deemed impermissible.

        "61 UNIT 5 BALANCING HARMS AND BENEFITS: THE CASE OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS 3. Joel Feinberg, Harm to Others: The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987): 33. \u2022 Benefits to patients may include medical benefit (e.g. from receipt of the experimental treatment) and other forms of benefit. The latter may include economic benefits, in the case of paid participation, and what may be termed a \u2018moral benefit\u2019 in the case of participants who enter into trials in order to help others and benefit from the knowledge that they are doing so. \u2022 The benefits accruing to research participants can be altered by varying aspects of a study that do not affect its methodology. For example: levels of payment may be varied, and undertakings may be given to provide participants with experimental or other treatments post-trial. \u2022 Knowledge may be sought for its own sake (i.e. for its intrinsic value) or because it has practical (or instru- mental) value in terms of reducing suffering or improving people\u2019s lives. Research with substantial prac- tical value may be easier to justify than research pursued solely for reasons of intellectual curiosity, but on the other hand it is difficult to predict which lines of research may have important practical benefits in the future. \u2022 Benefits, whether to participants or future patients, are likely to be uncertain, so the probability of their being realised must be considered. This raises the controversial question of whether and in what circum- stances research ethics committees should assess the methodological quality of the proposals they review. Types of harm Harm is often defined, following Joel Feinberg, as a setback to interests. ( 3 ) Since people have many kinds of interests this implies that there can be many kinds of harm. In answer to question 2, the following kinds of harm may be identified as potentially arising from the research described in the case study: \u2022 physical harm, e.g. adverse reactions to the therapeutic interventions or anaesthesia, zoonotic or other infections; \u2022 psychological harm, e.g. anxiety about undergoing an experimental procedure, effect on self-image of implantation of non-human cells; \u2022 social harm, e.g. being shunned by others due to fear of zoonotic infection or disapproval of treatment involving aborted fetuses; \u2022 loss of liberty, e.g. the requirement for those in the xenotransplantation arm of the trial to undergo monitoring after the trial has ended. It may also be noted that some of these harms may affect people other than the participants, and that institutions as well as individuals may be harmed. Other types of harm that can result from research include economic and reputational harms. Another kind of harm, to be discussed in connection with the principle of equipoise below, concerns the withholding of experimental treatments from those in the placebo arm of the trial. ",
        "62 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Balancing risk and benefit As with the benefits of research, harms are generally probable rather than certain. Risk may be defined as a probability of harm; thus the seriousness of a risk increases with the magnitude of the potential harm and the probability of its occurrence. Discussion of risk may include the following issues. \u2022 What sense can be made of the idea of balancing risk and benefit? Can this be given a literal interpretation e.g. in terms of expected utility? What does it mean to say that risks and benefits should be \u2018proportionate\u2019? Should risks and benefits accruing to different individuals be balanced or only risks and benefits to a single individual? The suggestion that balancing between different individuals may be exploitative will be explored in unit 6. These issues can usefully be related to the distinction between consequentialist and deontological approaches to ethics outlined in Unit 1. \u2022 Minimal risk: Are some risks so small that they can be ignored in appraising research proposals, or can be imposed without full consent? What are the relevant thresholds? \u2022 Large risks: Are some risks so serious as to be unacceptable even with the consent of the people affected? \u2022 High magnitude/low probability risk: How should we respond to risks of unlikely but very serious conse- quences or to the possibility of serious consequences with unknown probability? How much evidence of a purported risk is needed before it should be considered? The Precautionary Principle will be considered in Unit 8 as a possible response to such cases. \u2022 Risk to whom? Should RECs be concerned with all risks or only risks to research subjects and the general public? Is it within the remit of RECs to prevent researchers from placing themselves at risk? Randomised controlled trials As well as raising general issues about how to think about the harms and benefits produced by research the case study should focus attention on ethical issues arising from RCTs in particular. The last part of question 1 invites students to think about the nature and advantages of RCT methodology, in particular the ability of RCTs to produce reliable results by controlling for confounding factors including placebo effects and investigator bias. It should also be noted that, in order to produce their intended benefits, it is important that trials are perceived as reliable, for example by clinicians or others who are expected to employ the techniques under investigation, and by the bodies that will licence and approve funding for them. The remaining questions should prompt discussion of ethical problems arising from the RCT trial design. Placebos and harm Questions 2 and 3 raise the issue of whether being allocated to the placebo arm (or more generally the con- trol arm) of a trial amounts to being harmed. The thought here is that receiving either the \u2018standard treat- ment\u2019 or a placebo may be a setback to the subject\u2019s interests relative to receiving the experimental treatment. The case for saying that the subject is harmed is stronger in the case of a placebo arm, since in that case the subject may also be disadvantaged relative to patients not in the trial who receive the standard treatment. A common response to this concern is that placebo controlled trials are only justifiable where there is no well- established standard treatment, and that where an established treatment exists this should be used as the ",

( 4 ) There are, however, difficulties with this position arising from the fact that placebo controlled trials can produce more reliable results than trials employing active controls, and may do so using fewer participants. There is also a problem about what counts as the availability of a standard treatment, particularly in devel- oping countries where a treatment that is standard elsewhere may be unavailable for economic reasons. ( 5 ) The research in Case Study 5.1 is less problematic than many placebo-controlled trials in that patients are not denied the standard (drug) treatment for Parkinson\u2019s. In another respect, however, this trial is more prob- lematic than typical placebo-controlled trials, because placebo surgery poses a greater risk to participants than inactive placebo drugs. The problem with placebo-controlled trials is that those in the placebo arm of the trial face a possibility of harm without any compensating therapeutic benefit. Possible responses to this include the following. \u2022 A benefit may be provided by undertaking to provide those who are assigned to the placebo arm with whichever treatment proves more effective at the end of the trial. \u2022 In \u2018crossover trials\u2019 all participants receive a period of active therapy as well as a period on the placebo. However, this trial design is not possible in all cases. \u2022 Participants may receive benefits extrinsic to the research, including monetary payment and/or the moral benefit experienced by altruistic participants. \u2022 It is sometimes claimed that that there is a \u2018trial effect\u2019, such that patients enrolled in RCTs have better medical outcomes than those who are not, even if they are in the control arm. ( 6 ) Placebos and the therapeutic obligation Another way of thinking about the ethical problem that may be involved in allocating subjects to the control arm of a trial is that this may be a violation of the therapeutic obligation. This is the (supposed) obligation of doctors to do what is medically best for their patients, an obligation that is arguably violated if they allocate patients randomly between different treatments rather than according to their individual needs. In relation to this, the following points may be considered: \u2022 whether doctors really have this obligation (as opposed to, say, an obligation to provide treatment that is \u2018good enough\u2019); \u2022 the fact that in non-research situations this obligation is frequently overridden by the interests of patients in general (for example when doctors have to ration scarce resources); \u2022 whether doctors\u2019 obligations may be modified when they engage with patients within a research setting.

Veatch, \u201cIndifference of subjects: an alternative to equipoise in randomized clinical trials\u201d, Social Philosophy and Policy 19, no. 2 (2002): 295-323. One difficulty with the suggestion that the therapeutic obligation should not apply in the research setting is that there is evidence that patients persistently believe that doctors entering them into trials will provide treatment aimed at meeting their individual therapeutic needs, even after attempts have been made to explain the methodology of RCTs. ( 7 ) This is known as the therapeutic misconception, and its effect on the validity of participants\u2019 consent will be discussed below. Equipoise In response to question 5, students with some prior knowledge of research ethics are likely to raise the doc- trine of equipoise. This attempts to define the circumstances in which it is permissible to allocate patients randomly between the active and control arms of a trial. According to the doctrine, if there are no grounds for believing any of the treatments provided to patients in any of a trial to be better than that in any other arm, then nobody is harmed, or treated less favourably than the therapeutic obligation demands, by being randomly assigned to one or another arm of the trial. A discussion of equipoise should include the following key points: \u2022 The simplest interpretation views equipoise as a state of an individual researcher\u2019s beliefs. However, researchers are rarely if ever genuinely agnostic about the relative merits of experimental and control procedures and, as may be noted in response to question 6, even if a researcher was in equipoise at the beginning of a trial this would be disturbed by preliminary results, which in a lengthy trial could give some reason to believe one arm superior long before achieving the degree of statistical significance necessary for publication and regulatory approval. \u2022 The idea of \u2018community equipoise\u2019 is intended to avoid these problems. On this account equipoise exists if there is disagreement within the scientific community about which treatment is best. It follows that equipoise can exist even where an individual researcher has firm beliefs about which treatment is best, and, rather than being disturbed by preliminary data, is likely to persist until statistically significant results are obtained and subjected to peer review. It may, however, be questioned whether the boundaries of the relevant community and degree of disagreement necessary to constitute equipoise are well defined, and whether the existence of equipoise in this sense justifies a researcher in subjecting patients to a treatment that he or she personally believes to be sub-optimal. Consent An alternative approach to the ethical issues raised by RCTs is that the use of placebos and other controls is justified by the consent of research participants. Limiting patients to participating in research that doctors, researchers or ethics committees consider to be in (or at least not too far opposed to) their interests might be considered unduly paternalistic. ( 8 ) ",
        "65 UNIT 5 BALANCING HARMS AND BENEFITS: THE CASE OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS This approach raises both practical questions and questions about underlying values. The consent-based approach reflects liberal political values including Mill\u2019s Harm Principle, but seems on the face of it contrary to the Helsinki Declaration\u2019s injunction that the wellbeing of the individual research participant must always have priority over the interests of others. Practical limits on the ability of consent to justify use of placebos and controls may be raised in response to question 4, and may include the following: \u2022 consent cannot be used to justify RCTs conducted on young children or non-competent adults; \u2022 as noted above, there is evidence that many participants misunderstand the nature of RCTs (the \u2018therapeutic misconception\u2019). This casts into doubt the validity of participants\u2019 consent; \u2022 the prospect of receiving an experimental treatment not available outside the trial may act as an induce- ment that would lead some to question the voluntariness of participants\u2019 consent. Further issues Question 7 prompts consideration of issues relating to particular arms of the trial. A trial involving only arms 1, 2 and 3 would avoid the ethical concerns associated with use of placebo, but may undermine the actual or perceived methodological validity of the trial, leading to the loss of its intended benefits. The other arms of the trial raise issues that concern the particular therapies being investigated in the case study rather than the RCT trial design. Those who believe that a human fetus has a similar moral status to post-natal humans (a view that will be discussed further in Unit 8) may consider it immoral to utilise tissue resulting from electively aborted fetuses in research or therapy. People who hold this view are likely to reject the trial as described, but may accept a trial that involved only the xenotransplantation and placebo arms (arms 3 and 4). Similarly, those who object to the xenotransplantation procedure (for example because of the risk of zoonosis described above or for animal rights reasons) might reject the trial as described but accept a variant that involved only the human implant and placebo arms (arms 1, 2 and 4).

        "69 UNIT 6 JUSTICE IN RESEARCH 1. This case shares some features with the recruitment practices reported in reported in Laurie P Cohen, \u201cTo screen new drugs for safety, Lilly pays homeless alcoholics: it\u2019s \u2018quick cash\u2019 to habitues of Indianapolis shelters; it vanishes quickly, too\u201d, Wall Street Journal (Eastern Ed.) (November 14, 1996): A1, A10. Introduction This unit examines concerns about justice and injustice as they relate to research. The issues to be addressed fall into two broad types: concerns about researchers unfairly taking advantage of research subjects and imposing unfair burdens on them for the sake of others, and concerns about unfair exclusion of particular groups from participation in research and the benefits that may attach to research participation. The former concern is broadly about the exploitation of research subjects while the latter is broadly about discrimination. This unit includes three case studies. Two of these are intended primarily to focus discussion on issues of exploitation while the third is intended to focus discussion on the issue of discrimination in relation to access to trials. Case Study 6.1 Recruiting homeless participants to Phase 1 trials ( 1 ) A large pharmaceutical company conducts Phase 1 trials of its products at a specialist trials unit in a major European city. These are trials conducted using \u2018healthy volunteer\u2019 subjects and designed to test the safety and pharma- cological effects of new drugs, and to establish maximum tolerated dose levels. The products being tested have all undergone prior testing on animals, and in some cases there will have been previous trials in humans. Volunteers typically spend between a few days and several weeks in the unit. After completing a questionnaire and undergoing initial health checks and baseline measurements, they will receive one or more doses of the investigational product, while being subject to regular moni- toring and assessment. Volunteers are required to report any adverse effects, and medical staff are on hand in case treatment is needed. Because subjects participating in Phase 1 trials receive no therapeutic benefit it is usual for them to be paid. The unit\u2019s recruitment materials (leaflets and posters, which volunteers are encouraged to take away and distribute) state that \u201ccompensation for time and inconvenience\u201d will be paid ",
        "70 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH \u201caccording to the length and nature of the trial\u201d. In addition, the leaflets highlight the fact that meals and accommodation are provided free for the duration of the trial, and that entertainment and recreational facilities are provided. In the past the company has had little difficulty in getting its trials approved by the Research Ethics Committee, and it has a good safety record. However a new REC member has questioned the level of payments offered to volunteers and discovered that these are much lower than those typically offered by other pharmaceutical companies. Further investigation reveals that a large proportion of the volunteers are long-term unemployed and homeless (most of the addresses given on the initial questionnaire are for local hostels for the homeless or other temporary accommodation). Many are thought be alcoholics or drug addicts, although they have to declare themselves \u2018clean\u2019 at the time of registering for a trial and will be unable to consume alcohol or drugs (other than the investigational product) while in the unit. It is also evident that, despite an absence of high-profile advertising, the unit is widely known about, with many volunteers travelling long distances to participate in trials. Many have participated in trials for this or other companies on several previous occasions, and although the eligibility criteria specify a minimum of three months between trials there is some evidence of volunteers falsifying their identity to overcome this restriction. The company is unapologetic about its low payment levels or the socioeconomic groups from which its subjects are drawn. It argues that the ease with which it recruits volunteers demonstrates that the benefits to participants are substantial, and that higher payments might amount to undue inducement. It also points out that the number of participants withdrawing from trials is very low, as is the number of complaints received. Questions 1. What advantages does the pharmaceutical company gain by recruiting from a disadvantaged sector of society, and what benefits do the volunteers gain from participation in the trials? 2. What disadvantages or risks does this method of recruitment have for the company and for the volunteers? 3. Are there grounds for considering the company\u2019s recruitment practice to be exploitative? If so what are they, and do you agree that it is exploitative? 4. What changes would the company need to make in order to persuade you that its recruitment practice was morally acceptable? ",
        "71 UNIT 6 JUSTICE IN RESEARCH Discussion This case study prompts students to consider what is meant when research is claimed to be exploitative, and the moral significance of such claims. The discussion can draw on many of the themes introduced in previ- ous units, including benefit and harm, vulnerability and consent. It may be useful to frame the discussion as an attempt to determine how exploitation relates to these other concepts, and what, if anything, it adds to the framework that they provide for ethical appraisal of research. In considering question 1, student should note that the recruitment of volunteers from a socially and eco- nomically disadvantaged section of society may be beneficial to both the pharmaceutical company and the volunteers. Benefits to the company include the lower level of payment necessary to attract volunteers, the fact that they may be recruited by word of mouth without the need for expensive advertising, and the fact that participants for whom the payment is an important consideration and who hope to participate in future trials may be less likely than more affluent volunteers to withdraw part way through a trial, and, if adverse events occur, less inclined to seek legal redress and willing to accept lower levels of compensation. Benefits for the volunteers include the payment (which even if relatively low may be very significant to indi- viduals with few economic resources to draw on), the provision of food and accommodation (which may be an important benefit for impoverished and homeless volunteers), and he opportunity to be in a safe, medically supervised environment free from alcohol and illicit drugs. On the other hand (question 2), the company risks reputational damage, due to the apparently exploitative nature of the arrangement; the scientific quality of the trials may be jeopardised if the participants are tempted to lie about their drug use or medical history in order to get into the trials, or to conceal adverse reactions for fear of being removed from the trial. The concealing of relevant information may also put the participants at increased risk of harm. The fact that the trials go ahead, however, suggests that both sides judge that the benefits outweigh the risks. Question 3 invites students to identify features of the company\u2019s practice that seem intuitively exploitative. These can then be compared with common accounts of exploitation such as \u2018taking unfair advantage\u2019 or \u2018wrongfully using\u2019. In this case the company appears to be taking advantage of the volunteers\u2019 disadvantaged situation to obtain their participation for less than the \u2018going rate\u2019. The fact that the volunteers consent to this arrangement and benefit from it provides an opportunity to explore questions such as whether, for a trans- action to be exploitative, it is necessary for it to be based on coercion or defective consent, and whether exploitation is necessarily harmful to the exploited party and/or beneficial to the exploiter, or whether it can be mutually advantageous or mutually harmful. Question 4 provides a context to consider what is morally objectionable about exploitation and whether a practice that was exploitative could nevertheless be morally acceptable. The conclusions reached about the nature and moral significance of exploitation can then be brought to bear on the next case study. ",
        "72 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Case Study 6.2 Tuberculosis vaccine research in a developing country Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with nearly nine million new infections and two million deaths per year worldwide. Incidence of the disease is highest in developing countries, particularly in Africa, but it is also a problem in developed countries, some of which have seen a resurgence of the disease after earlier falls, as a result of antibiotic resistance, reduced immune response due to HIV infection and migration from parts of the world in which the disease is rife. The most commonly used vaccine against TB is Bacile Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG). However, while this is effective in young children, its effectiveness is more variable in adolescents and young adults, and it is not recommended for patients with impaired immune systems. In addition to problems of antibiotic resistance, drug treatments have had limited impact in developing countries due to cost and poor compliance. Development of new, more effective vaccines appears to be the most promising strategy for controlling and eventually eradicating TB. Several potential vaccines have been developed as a result of advances in understanding of genome of the infectious agent (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Some of these have undergone Phase I testing in Europe, and now European researchers working on a Modified Vaccina Ankara (MVA) vaccine wish to carry out further trials in various countries including Mozambique, a country classified by the United Nations as one of the world\u2019s Least Developed and with prevalence rates among the highest in the world for HIV and TB. The proposed trial in Mozambique is designed to test the effectiveness of the new vaccine when used post-infection and in conjunction with BCG. It will run for five years and will involve the following arms: 1) BCG only in adult males not known to have HIV; 2) BCG plus MVA in adult males not known to have HIV; 3) BCG only in adolescent males not known to have HIV; 4) BCG plus MVA (lower dose) in adolescent males not known to have HIV; 5) BCG only in subjects in the early stages of HIV; 6) BCG plus MVA in subjects in the early stages of HIV. ",
        "73 UNIT 6 JUSTICE IN RESEARCH Participants will be subject to monthly health checks, which will include monitoring of weight, blood tests and sputum tests. They will be given advice on healthy eating and where necessary provided with the resources to maintain a healthy diet (for themselves and their families). Consent will be obtained in the standard way. Costs will be lower than if the trial was conducted in Europe, and the high prevalence of TB should make recruitment of subjects relatively quick and easy. The researchers argue that it is important to test the vaccine in populations similar to those in which it is intended to be used. However, some members of your Research Ethics Committee question the affordability of the vaccine for a country as impoverished as Mozambique and contend that, while it may be affordable for richer African countries, such as South Africa, the primary use is likely to be in those developed countries that are experiencing an increase in TB infection. Questions 1. What ethical problems are raise by this case? 2. In what ways might the trial be considered exploitative? 3. How might the researchers respond to accusations of exploitation? Would they be right to reject such accusations? 4. Should the trial be allowed to go ahead as it stands? If not, are there any modifications that could be undertaken to make it ethically acceptable? Discussion Assuming that the concept of exploitation has already been discussed in connection with Case Study 6.1 , discussion of this case can be briefer, applying what students have learned about the meaning and moral significance of exploitation to a different but equally controversial issue, and using the case to illustrate and further explore aspects of the concept of exploitation. Question 1 allows for general concerns about the proposed research to be aired, and for links to be made with topics discussed in earlier units. These might include risk to the subjects (e.g. from use of BCG and MVA in HIV positive subjects), the use of subjects who may be vulnerable (e.g. due to youth or HIV status), and the possibility of the vaccines or resources provided for food acting as an undue inducement. Question 2 focuses attention specifically on the issue of exploitation. A key issue here is the suggestion, albeit uncertain, that the vaccine will mainly benefit populations in developed countries while the risks fall on less well-off participants in a developing country. Various other connections can be made with the earlier analysis of the concept of exploitation, for example: \u2022 the role of the researchers\u2019 intentions (since they appear to intend the vaccine to benefit populations in countries like the one in which the trial is to take place); \u2022 the role of vulnerability and/or impaired ability to consent in an account of exploitation; \u2022 the possibility of altruistic exploitation (i.e. exploitation carried out in order to benefit people other than those doing the exploitation). ",
        "74 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH 2. This case draws on the following reports: US National Institutes of Health, \u201cNicotine Replacement Treatment for Pregnant Smokers\u201d, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00115687 (2008), http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00115687 ; Tim Coleman et al., \u201cProtocol for the Smoking, Nicotine and Pregnancy (SNAP) trial: double-blind, placebo-randomised, controlled trial of nicotine replacement therapy in pregnancy\u201d, BMC Health Services Research 7, no. 2 (2007). It may also be worth considering the question of whether the whole process of developing and marketing medicinal products to developing countries at prices that that they can ill-afford should be considered exploitative. Question 3 allows students to identify and assess possible responses to the charge of exploitation. For example it might be argued: \u2022 that consent of the subjects (assuming it is valid) makes the trial non-exploitative; \u2022 that the trial will bring benefits to the subjects and to their community; \u2022 that it is normal for a trial to benefit people other than its subjects, and whether the beneficiaries come from a different country or socioeconomic group is ethically irrelevant. Question 4 allows for variants on the trial design to be considered. One possible modification would be to exclude subjects who are considered vulnerable to harm (e.g. those with HIV) or who may be unable to give valid consent (e.g. adolescents). It may also be noted that women are excluded from the proposed trial, and that this may be ethically problematic given the potential benefits of research participation. This leads onto the next case, which explores the issue of exclusion from trials. Case Study 6.3 Nicotine replacement therapy for pregnant smokers ( 2 ) Children of mothers who smoke during pregnancy are at increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth, pre-term birth and low birth weight, neo-natal mortality, sudden infant death syn- drome, asthma, attention deficit and learning problems. Over a quarter of pregnant women smoke and most of these continue to smoke throughout their pregnancy. It is known that, in non-pregnant smokers, drug therapies to treat the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal can increase smoking cessation rates beyond what can be achieved by behavioural support alone. However, there has been a reluctance to use drug therapies in pregnant smokers because of the risk of fetal damage. Consequently, little is known about the safety or effectiveness of using medications to treat pregnant smokers. ",
        "75 UNIT 6 JUSTICE IN RESEARCH The proposed research involves the testing of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for pregnant smokers. The aims of the trial are to establish the safety and effectiveness of NRT plus behavioural support, compared with behavioural support alone, and to determine which subjects benefit most from NRT during pregnancy. Researchers have chosen to investigate NRT rather than other drug-based anti-smoking interventions as it is considered ethically problematic to introduce untested drugs that would not otherwise be present into pregnant women. Subjects will be recruited at a prenatal clinic in an English university hospital that serves an ethnically mixed, mainly low income population. Women who agree to participate will be asked to complete a questionnaire to establish that they meet the eligibility conditions, and those who meet the criteria will be randomly assigned to receive either smoking cessation behavioural counselling plus an 8-week course of nicotine patches or the same counselling plus a similar course of placebo patches. The outcomes to be measured include self-reported smoking abstinence and cessation rates, biochemical measures of tobacco exposure, birth weight, gestational age at birth, fetal death and neo-natal mortality. Recruitment will be subject to the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion a) Maternal age 16-50. b) Gestational age 12-24 weeks. c) Patient is able to speak English. d) Patient intends to carry to term. e) Patient has stable residence. f) Patient currently smokes five or more cigarettes per day and has exhaled CO reading of at least 8 ppm. Exclusion a) Cardiovascular and other medical conditions established as contraindications to the use of NRT. b) Known sensitivity to nicotine patches. c) Psychiatric disorder. d) Drug or alcohol dependence. e) Inability to give informed consent. f) Known congenital abnormality in the fetus. g) Multiple gestation. Questions 1. What ethical issues are raised by the decision to carry out trials of medications in pregnant women? Can the use of pregnant women as subjects be justified in the case of NRT? 2. What justifications might be given for each of the inclusion and exclusion criteria? Based on the information available are there any groups who appear to be unnecessarily or wrongfully excluded by these criteria? ",
        "76 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH 3. If there are any cases of unnecessary exclusion what ethical issues does this raise? Are there any individuals or groups who could claim to be discriminated against by this proposal. Discussion Like much of the debate about justice in research, the last two case studies have focused on concerns about unfair \u2013 or exploitative \u2013 distribution of the burdens of research. One response to such concerns is to exclude those thought to be at particular risk of harm or exploitation from participation in research. However, justice is about the distribution of benefits as well as burdens, and is increasingly recognised that excluding catego- ries of people from research participation can itself lead to injustice by depriving excluded individuals and groups of the benefits arising from participation in research. In discussing Case Study 6.2 , students may have noticed the exclusion of women from the proposed vaccine study. Women, particularly those of childbearing age, have often been excluded from participation in research out of a well-intentioned concern to avoid causing harm to unborn fetuses. However in the context of a devel- oping country this could mean that women are deprived of the only opportunity they would have had to receive vaccination against TB. As well as disadvantaging the particular women who could have benefited from participation in the trial, such exclusions result in a lack of data about the safety and effectiveness of the investigational treatment in women. Similar concerns have been raised about the exclusion of children from drug trials, leading to a lack of data about appropriate dosages for children. Case Study 6.3 presents a scenario in which women who are known to be pregnant are deliberately used as research subjects. Students are encouraged to think about the justifiability of this, and about the justifiability of a range of other exclusion criteria. Question 1 invites students to reflect on the reasons why pregnant women are often excluded from drug trials and to consider whether these reasons for exclusion are justifiably overridden in the NRT case. Points to be discussed here might include methodological concerns (arising from possible differences in responses to drugs in pregnant and non-pregnant women), the relative weights given to fetal and maternal interests (which links to the discussion of the moral status of the fetus in Unit 8), and the fact that in the NRT case any risks may be balanced against potential benefits to the fetus itself and not just to the mother. Questions 2 and 3 call for evaluation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the study. Two broad types of justification for exclusions should be identified: those concerned with the protection of vulnerable individu- als (such as those who are unable to consent or are particularly susceptible to physical harm or exploitation), and those concerned with methodology (for example where the inclusion of certain categories of subject would introduce confounding factors making the analysis of results more difficult or less statistically robust, or where certain categories of subject are more likely to drop out of the trial threatening its statistical validity). Arguments against exclusion may be similarly categorised: methodological considerations can oppose exclusions where these would skew the results or make them generalisable only to a certain section of the population, and harm-based arguments come into play where individuals are deprived of the benefits of participation or society is deprived of knowledge of how treatments perform in the excluded groups. ",
        "77 UNIT 6 JUSTICE IN RESEARCH Difficult cases occur where these considerations pull in different directions or where the methodological or vulnerability-based grounds for exclusion could be overcome, but at significant cost (e.g. the inability of non-English speakers to consent and to communicate with research staff could be overcome by provision of translated materials and an interpreter). The question then arises whether researchers have an obligation to bear this cost even if this restricts the amount of worthwhile research that can be done. Question 3 invites identification of cases where exclusion criteria could be considered discriminatory against certain groups. Discrimination is the treatment of a group or category of people less favourably than others on the basis of some actual or perceived difference that does not in fact justify differential treatment. There are several ways in which this could apply to exclusion from research: 1. the reasons for exclusion apply only to some members of the excluded group, and it would be possible to exclude those to whom the reasons apply without excluding the whole group; 2. the supposed reasons for exclusion do not justify exclusion even of those to whom they apply (for example if they are based on prejudice or refer to vulnerabilities that could easily be overcome); 3. the reasons for exclusion are not applied consistently across different groups (for example the reasons apply to some people outside the excluded group but no effort is made to identify and exclude these people). Student should be able to identify possible examples of these types of scenario from the case study. However it should be noted that judgements about which exclusions are discriminatory will be contestable insofar as they depend on prior judgments about what are good grounds for exclusions. Further issues 1. A controversial question connected to issues of exploitation in research is whether there is a general obliga- tion to participate in research. Does such an obligation exist and if so what is its basis? What difference would such an obligation make to our tendency to view certain kinds of research participation as exploitative? 2. Attention may also be given to the ethical issues that arise when scientists use themselves as research subjects. Can individuals exploit themselves for the benefit of other? Are researchers who find it necessary to make sacrifices and take personal risks in order to achieve scientific advances having their commitment to scientific or humanitarian goals exploited by society?

        "81 UNIT 7 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Introduction This unit examines some ethical issues that arise out of the broader relationship of research and researchers to the society in which they operate. It begins by considering the extent to which the collective interests of society should determine what research it allows to be conducted. This is explored through a case in which the treatment that researchers propose to test is likely to place a significant burden on a country\u2019s healthcare resources. From this starting point students are asked to consider the broader relationship between social concerns and the ethics of research. The second part of the unit looks at ethical issues that may arise across societies or cultures. It raises practical questions about research taking place across national and cultural borders and about the role of cultural sensitivity and tolerance in research ethics. Finally this part considers the broader issue of relativism and its place in the process of ethics review. The final part of the unit looks at the obligations and responsibilities of researchers to the society that facili- tates their research. This part begins with the issue of the misuses of the knowledge generated by research. It asks students to consider the ways in which society might deal with such misuse and, in particular, the researchers\u2019 responsibility for the use to which the products of research are put. The final case study in this unit brings together questions about the proper role of society (in the form of social distinctions) to research with questions about the researchers\u2019 responsibilities in the conduct of research. It considers the relevance of social concepts such as race and ethnicity to particular kinds of research and the responsibilities of the researcher to uphold academic integrity and avoid conflicts of interests. In each part the case study is designed to prompt students to consider these themes by beginning with an initial problem and abstracting to the more general considerations. Case Study 7.1 Enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe\u2019s disease A large multinational pharmaceutical company has begun to develop an enzyme replacement treatment for Pompe\u2019s disease. The drug is about to enter phase III trials. Pompe\u2019s disease is a rare metabolic disorder also known as Glycogen Storage Disease type 2 or Acid Maltase Deficiency. In the early onset form of the disease, affected children do not usually live longer than 2 years. The late onset form of the disease is milder but nevertheless does lead to premature death. ",
        "82 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH There is currently no curative treatment available. However research done in the Netherlands in the mid 1990s on enzyme replacement therapies was very positive. This research has led to the development of other reasonably successful enzyme replacement therapies for other conditions. These drugs are likely to be extraordinarily expensive when they reach the market with costs reportedly running at about EUR 650K per person per year over the course of the patient\u2019s life. Despite the small numbers of sufferers, funding this drug after the trial is completed will put a serious burden on the health resources of individual countries. Moreover there are many more drugs of this kind currently in development that are likely to cost still more and so further burden health resources. Questions 1. Would the sufferers of Pompe\u2019s disease (or their parents) be able to validly consent to participate in the trial? 2. Should this phase III trial go ahead? Why? 3. Should research involving very expensive treatments be permitted in countries where there are significant budgetary constraints or where the treatment is unlikely to be funded off-trial? 4. What role should broader social concerns (like cost) play in limiting or guiding the kind of research that is conducted? Discussion This case is designed to draw together two sets of considerations: research ethics related questions such as con- sent and voluntariness, and questions about the proper role of broader social considerations in determining the kind of research that is permitted. In answering the questions it is useful to concentrate on the former issues initially so as to be clear about the point at which the resource question becomes relevant. Links with previous topics The case raises questions about consent in cases of \u2018last resort\u2019 \u2013 that is, research that involves conditions for which there is no treatment, leaving the research population with seemingly no other choice but to participate. This links with the discussion of voluntariness in Units 2 and 3. Post-research provision An initial issue that may arise in the discussion of this case is the ethical imperative to continue to fund treat- ment (if it is shown to be beneficial) once the research has been completed. It is useful to explore reactions to the idea that, so long as research participants are properly informed (and consent), there is no requirement on the part of the trial researchers or sponsors to have any program of ongoing funding in place. This line of discussion seeks to clarify the justification for the widely accepted requirement that treatment be provided post-trial. ",
        "83 UNIT 7 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Social concerns and research The case study asks students to consider the relationship between the ethical issues involved in research and broader ethical concerns of society. At its most general, the case is designed to raise questions about the role of society in facilitating, guiding or constraining research. Society and other external sources provide the funding for research. To what extent should these sources or their institutional representatives control or limit research? Should society have less control in the case of non-publicly funded research? The specific tension in this case is between the requirements (and autonomy) of research and researchers and ongoing budgetary constraints associated with resource allocation. Particularly in countries with socialised health care systems, some decisions are required about the kind of ongoing support that can be afforded. The type of treatment described in this case has the potential to place a significant burden on the health system, if routinely funded. If the research is not permitted, then demand on resources from future users of these expensive treatments and, in particular, from those coming off the clinical trials, will be avoided. Do these allocation concerns constitute reasonable grounds on which to base decisions about what kinds of research will be permitted? The relevance of resources questions to research can be seen as a specific example of a broader issue. In these resource questions it is the prior social values, reflected in the resource framework, that are largely responsible for the dilemma. For example if more resources (whether taken from elsewhere in health, education or defence) were earmarked for funding current and future enzyme replacement therapies, this particular problem would be solved. This means that social values can matter for the kinds of research that can and ought to take place in a given society. Two sets of questions arise from this: (1) Other social values: What other social values should play a role in determining, limiting or constraining the kind of research that takes place within a society? Is there research that is unethical because social values are a particular way? This question looks forward both to Case Study 7.4 and to Unit 8. (2) Including social values: How can social values be included in decisions about the ethics of research? This question is a more practical one about the process of research ethics review. If there is a role for the values of society informing decisions about research, how could this be achieved? How might the review process be conducted to take account of, for example, the public\u2019s views on future finding priorities? ",
        "84 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH 1. This case is based upon research described in Joseph M. Mfutso-Bengu and Terrie E. Taylor, \u201cEthical jurisdictions in biomedical research\u201d, Trends in Parasitology 18, no. 5 (2002): 231-4. Case Study 7.2 International research on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria ( 1 ) For a research project examining the pathological symptoms of fatal cerebral malaria, a group of researchers from a European university wants to remove the eyes of deceased children. Good indications exist that the degree of damage to the retina caused by malaria will provide a useful clinical marker that could improve diagnosis and optimise treatment. In the African country where the research is to take place, malaria accounts for one-third of all child deaths and hospital admissions. The participant information sheet that will be given to parents of the deceased children states: \u201cAlthough the research will involve cutting and then stitching the body, we will replace any parts that we have taken with natural appearing material, and you will not see any marks or changes on the face.\u201d No specific information about removing the eyes is included in the information sheet, but such information will be provided if parents ask. An African bioethics committee has approved the study, considering that the expected benefits justify providing partial information to the parents. In addition, they felt that the information sheet provides sufficient information for parents to make an informed choice, whilst also acknowledging the cultural sensitivities surrounding autopsy. An ethics committee in the researchers\u2019 home country, however, did not approve the study, because only partial information was supplied and the consent form was found to be euphemistic and misleading. Questions 1. Given the account above, is the information given about the nature of the study detailed enough for appropriately informed consent? 2. Do the expected benefits that may be produced by the study justify the amount of information provided to potential participants? 3. Should the study proceed? Why or why not? 4. Who should have the final decision about the research? Why? ",
        "85 UNIT 7 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Discussion The first three questions are designed to lead on to the last question and to the more theoretical issues asso- ciated with international research. The first three are more usual questions arising about proposed research. The differences here are likely to be informed by the international setting. Links with previous topics In terms of those issues that are likely to come up with this research that have been considered earlier, the importance of consent and the trade off between it and the general benefits associated with the study are perhaps the most central. International research tends to emphasise the key ethical tensions in research. This case revisits issues from Units 2 and 5 by raising questions about the nature and adequacy of the consent as well as the balance of risks and benefits. The international context also raises similar concerns to those raised in Unit 6 about exploi- tation, in this case arising from differing standards for consent and/or significant socio-economic inequality. Relativism, tolerance and cultural sensitivity An important theoretical issue raised by this case involves cultural sensitivity, tolerance and relativism. The final two questions are designed to get the students to commit to a view about the appropriate stand- ards to be applied by ethics committees when deciding about research. These are likely to give rise to a range of answers. However, at one extreme will be an insistence on applying one particular standard, whether it be that of the home or the foreign committee. It is worth asking students to be specific about whether their answer is the result of a view about the importance of consent when weighed against the expected benefits of the research or is a product of a view about who should decide. This can be explored by modifying the details of the case; for example, if students are inclined to favour the judgement of the African committee it will be instructive to see whether they continue to do so when the amount of information given to the parents is reduced. There are two kinds of consideration that are raised by recognition of the divergence in ethical judgements about research in this context. First, there is a theoretical question about the status of ethical judgements and the possibility of there being a fact of the matter, a \u2018genuinely\u2019 right answer. This clearly links into discussions about ethical relativism. Second, there is a more practical question about the circumstances under which we should tolerate (significant) difference in ethical assessment and respect cultural differences. Dealing with variations in ethical judgement The discussion of relativism can also usefully be connected to issues about variability between committees whether at an international or intra-national level. This can follow on from the issues of tolerance and sensi- tivity by asking whether researchers should be held to the standards of their home country or the country in which the research is conducted and by focussing on the final question in the case.

From a practical point of view variation can be very difficult to handle: multiple committees applying different standards and coming to different conclusions makes getting approval an onerous task. On the other hand, if some variation and disa- greement is to be expected just from the nature of ethical judgements, then some difference in views between committees is also. Case Study 7.3 Research on a \u2018trust\u2019 drug Oxytocin is a natural hormone pro- duced in the hypothalamus in response to stimuli including social interaction, sex, breastfeeding and childbirth. It has an important role in the formation and maintenance of social bonds including those between sexual partners and between parents and their offspring. The mechanisms by which it functions are not fully understood, but it is known that oxytocin makes people more trusting. In one study, partici- pants who had received oxytocin via a nasal spray were more willing to hand money to a trustee knowing that the trustee could choose not to return it to them, and were less likely to modify this behaviour after having their trust betrayed. ( 2 ) Research has suggested that deficiency of oxytocin may be associated with a range of neuropsy- chiatric conditions including autism, social anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disor- ders resulting from childhood neglect. Studies using nasally administered oxytocin have given strong indications that the hormone may have important therapeutic potential for some of these conditions. ( 3 ) An obstacle to the development of such therapies is the short half-life of nasally-administered oxytocin. Response to the drug peaks in about 50 minutes and wears off about 2 hours after ",
        "87 UNIT 7 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY administration. In order to overcome this limitation a group of researchers wish to trial a slow release version of the hormone with a significantly longer half-life. They hope that an appropriate form of the hormone can be of widespread assistance to those suffering from autism and other disorders. Speculation has been rife about alternative uses of this kind of product. Worries have included its (mis)use in the interrogation of terrorists or combatants or for the indoctrination of new recruits to fanatical sects. Finally, it has also been suggested that such drug would add signifi- cantly to currently available drugs to form a new form of date rape cocktail. Questions 1. What are the risks associated with this research? 2. Do the risks associated with the research and with the misuse of the knowledge generated by this research outweigh the potential benefits of the research? 3. Is there anything that the researchers can or should do to prevent misuse? 4. What are the researchers\u2019 responsibilities in relation to the possible misuse of their findings? 5. Who (if not the researchers) should be responsible for preventing misuse? Discussion Links with previous topics This case study introduces a new kind of risk associated with research \u2013 the risk of misuse. It is useful, though, to ask students to identify the more general kinds of risks associated with the research and to think about the risk benefit calculation overall, before concentrating on the misuse issues. Dual use The main purpose of the case is to introduce the problem of dual use. Dual use problems arise when the knowledge generated by research can be put to both good and bad uses. This includes most if not all research but the problem has arisen and received attention in a number of more extreme situations. The central question posed by dual use is: How do we balance the risks associated with the misuse of the knowledge generated by some research against the potential of the research to benefit? This kind of problem is of concern to both researchers and those involved in the governance of research. There are practical issues to discuss in both cases. The discussion could include: (i) situations under which certain research should not be conducted because the risks are too great; (ii) situations under which research should not be published or be allowed to enter the public domain; or (iii) situations under which various methods of oversight of the research and its application might be appropriate. ",
        "88 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Responsibility and security What are the researchers\u2019 responsibilities? The question of what can be done by researchers is an important one that will vary with the context and, of course, what researchers are obliged to do will be importantly dependent on what they are able to do. It is worth getting students to come up with a range of possibilities in this regard. One that will always be pos- sible is to refrain from doing the research. Other possibilities will be reporting that the research is taking place to a relevant authority, not publishing the research at all or in publically accessible places and modifying the research (or its published form) so as to make the possibility of misuse lower. Discussion here might centre on the obligations that the researcher has to conduct research in a responsible way. One view is that since the researcher is conducting research for the benefit of (and perhaps funded by) society, he or she should take adequate measures to ensure that the research findings are not misused. Given publication there may not always be much that the researcher can do, but such things as alerting the relevant authority of the research and its potential misuse may be appropriate. This view takes the obligations to take steps to prevent misuses to be part of the responsibility of the researcher. A second view notes that the researcher is at once researcher and citizen. As researcher the obligation is to conduct research that is as effective and most capable of being good science. However as a citizen the obli- gation is to act so as not to endanger society. This means that the obligations of the researcher and the researcher-citizen can conflict and require balancing, perhaps on a case-by-case basis. A final view is that the researcher\u2019s responsibilities are to the science and to conducting optimal scientific research. If there are responsibilities concerning the use or misuses of the research, these are not the busi- ness of the researcher but of the broader social institutions involved in the oversight of the application of the research. Who (if not the researcher) should be responsible for preventing misuse? From the perspective of the relevant governance institution, the questions are the extent to which research should be overseen, the nature of this oversight and the form that any restriction should take. Discussion of this question may include the responsibilities of research ethics committees, research funding bodies, governments and international organisations. The main focus of this discussion however is on the locus of ethical responsibility. Students should be pressed to explain why it is that the responsibilities fall the way that they suggest. ",
        "89 UNIT 7 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Case Study 7.4 Pharmacogenetics research Two researchers are collaborating with an international drug company to develop drugs that are targeted at particular genetically related sub-groups within the European community. Their first project involves Europeans of African descent. The idea is to produce versions of heart disease drugs that counteract genetic variants that are known to be present in this population and may reduce the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs. The research program will draw on established work on the genetic variation between various groups of different origin. It will then link this genetic variation to drug response and uptake variation. As with other pharmacogenetic research of this kind, it has the potential to make drugs safer and more effective for the relevant population. It is hoped that this research will lead to progress on personal, tailor- made drugs based on an individual\u2019s entire genetic profile. However, questions have been raised about racial and ethnic discrimination which might follow from such research. For commercial reasons, the drug company has insisted that the research can only be published if it is successful and after the drugs in question have passed all of the relevant approval stages. Questions 1. What are the benefits of this research? 2. How might discrimination follow from this kind of research? 3. Should concepts like race feature in this kind of research? Is there any (medical) research for which these concepts are relevant? 4. What are the ethical issues associated with personal, genetically-based medicine? 5. Is the company\u2019s stipulation ethically acceptable? 6. Do the researchers have an obligation to publish their research? ",
        "90 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Discussion Links with previous topics There are a number of links to be made between this case and issues previously discussed. The question about personalised medicine may raise questions about access to confidential (genetic) information. (The specific genetic-related question will be considered in Unit 8.) There are also justice related questions concerning access to the genetic testing required in order to take the drugs in question. Finally, this case revisits some of the issues surrounding discrimination that were considered in Unit 6. Social categories in research Pharmacogenetics is the study of how genetic variation affects our response to drugs. The key issue raised here concerns concepts of race and their relationship to genetics. The main problem that needs to be discussed here is the relationship between the genetic characteristics that are the basis of the pharmacogenetic research and the socially based categories of race and ethnicity. The pharmacogenetic interactions operate exclusively at the genetic level and the groupings associated with them may not match the social groupings. So, not all members of a particular social group, say Europeans of African descent, will possess the relevant genetic structures for which the drug has been developed. This is the familiar issue of needing to be careful that the group on which the drug is tested is the group that use that drug. Further, social groupings like race and ethnicity are often associated with stereotyped behaviours, traits and characteristics, these associations being more often than not influenced by historical prejudice and generali- sation. In the face of discrimination of various forms, is important to be clear about the distinction between these two kinds of groupings \u2013 the genetic and the social. Given the difference it would be unfortunate if the science were seen to be reinforcing prejudice and stereotyping. The issue in the background here involves the genetic underpinnings of race. It is useful to encourage the students to discuss their understanding of the connection between genetics and race (or ethnicity, etc.). One side of this debate insists that because race is an ethically loaded, social construction, it has no business in science. The other side relies on the relationship between historical origins and genetics, and the increasingly understood connections between genetics and dispositions to behaviour. According to this side, genetics and behavioural research is relevant to how we understand such social categories as race. Commercial interests in research The general issue here concerns the balance between the commercial involvement required to enable the continued and effective progression of medical science and the dangers associated with involving the profit motive in medical research. The tension arises largely because of a worry about the way in which the (heavy) involvement of money and a profit motive can skew the practice of medicine and medical research. The other side of this view involves recognition of the benefits that can accrue from a market driven medical research industry. ",

International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication (October 2008). http://www.ICMJE.org There have been a number of steps taken at the international level in recent years to protect against harms associated with commercial interests. These include public registration of clinical trials and disclosure of results. Of particular note are the recommendations made by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ( 4 ) and the WHO ( 5 ). Clearly the conflict of interest worry involves researchers (and indeed those responsible for the governance of research) being motivated by financially related self-interest rather than a concern to develop medical products that benefit patients. An important issue to raise in discussion is the distinction between actual wrongdoing \u2013 for example cutting safety corners in drug trials or misleading research participants \u2013 and the appearances of impropriety associated with conflicts of interest. Publication ethics and academic integrity Discussion of the final question, should link back to the discussion earlier in the unit about the role of society and the obligations of researchers and sponsors of research to society. The idea here is that broad social benefit can be understood as an important part of the justification of research. The obligations of researchers to publish and accurately present findings follow on from the public benefit arguments for the justification of research. An interesting part of this involves the publication of \u2018negative research\u2019 \u2013 for example, research which is unsuccessful in showing that a particular drug benefits the relevant patient group. The ICMJE document, \u2018Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication\u2019 is a useful resource in this regard. ( 6 ) ",

        "95 UNIT 8 ETHICAL ISSUES IN THE NEW BIOTECHNOLOGIES Introduction This unit examines a range of issues that arise in the context of new biotechnological developments. Broadly it looks at issues in reproductive and reproductive-related technology, disability, nanotechnology and genetics. Each case study raises a specific set of ethical considerations that connect with and apply the discussions of earlier units. These cases raise two kinds of issue. First, they present specific challenges for the process of ethical review \u2013 diffi- culties, for example, associated with obtaining consent, protecting confidentiality and assessing risks and benefits. As such, they ask students to look forward and to consider the ways in which the current system of ethics review and the contemporary approach to research ethics will be able to cope with the biotechnological developments of the future. This first kind of issue draws on the discussions of the earlier parts of the syllabus in the attempt to consider future problems confronting those involved in research ethics and research ethics review. The second kind of issue raised by these cases is more closely connected to the nature and permissibility of the technology itself (as distinct from issues arising specifically from the research process). The four broad topics considered in the cases each encapsulate new challenges to our understanding of ethics generally and quite apart from the research context. As such they represent challenges to the way we think about ethics and society. The first case looks primarily at the ethical challenges raised by new reproductive technologies including the moral status of embryos and the acceptability and limits of interventions in the reproductive process. The second case examines the status of disability and the proper responses to it. The third case raises questions about decisions under conditions of uncertainty and the adequacy of the Precautionary Principle in dealing with this nanotechnology. The final case study looks more closely at the use of genetics and in particular at the global use of human genetic data in the context of genetic biobanks. In discussing the cases it is useful to separate these two kinds of consideration initially and then to consider the ways in which the latter, more general ethical issues might affect the former, more specific, research related questions.

Case Study 8.1 Germ-line gene therapy ( 1 ) A clinical geneticist, Corinne, working with colleagues in an IVF facility has developed a technique for manipulating the genetic structure of implantable embryos. If successful this will have the advantage over embryo selection of allowing couples to have a child free from an inherited defect in cases where all of their available embryos are affected (for example in cases of \u2018double domi- nance\u2019, or where one of the couple is unable to produce further gametes following illness). One couple attending the IVF facility, Anna and Boris, has a history of serious, genetically related renal failure. Several of their closely related family members have suffered very signifi- cantly from kidney problems over the course of their lives. Although both Anna and Boris possess the relevant genes, they have not been expressed in either of them to a serious extent. The particular condition itself is too complex to address using this method of gene manipulation. It may however be possible to use Corinne\u2019s technique to address one of the key symptoms of the condition. Individuals who suffer from this kind of renal problem are very often anaemic \u2013 lacking sufficient red blood cells to carry oxygen through the body. Corinne\u2019s procedure would induce a genetic polymorphism in the embryo that would increase the resultant child\u2019s sensitivity to erythro- poietin (EPO). Erythropoietin is a protein that stimulates bone marrow to make more red blood cells. It is thought that increasing the sensitivity to erythropoietin will compensate for the reduced levels of the protein (and hence the anaemia) caused by the renal problems. Artificially produced erythropoietin is sometimes given (off-label) to those with severe kidney disorders for precisely this reason and has also, more controversially, been used by athletes to enhance their performance by increasing the amount of oxygen carried by the blood. Moreover, in the 1970s, Finnish cross-country skier and dual Olympic gold-medal winner, Eero M\u00e4ntyranta was found to have this genetic polymorphism naturally. It enabled him to produce between 25-50 % more red-blood cells than normal people and greatly improved his endurance capabilities. Another couple at the clinic, Dana and Eddie, are very committed to an active, athletic lifestyle. Eddie competes at a high level in a number of endurance sports but has always suspected that there is a connection between his inability to \u2018make it\u2019 at the highest level and his genetic inheritance. Dana and Eddie would very much like to avoid this being the case for their progeny. ",
        "97 UNIT 8 ETHICAL ISSUES IN THE NEW BIOTECHNOLOGIES Together with Corinne they have enthusiastically discussed the possibility of using her gene therapy technique to increase the endurance capabilities of their child. Thus, if it turns out that the child is interested in competitive sport, there will be no concerns about endurance. Both couples understand very clearly: (i) that this technique has not been tested in humans and that the success seen in animals may not translate to humans; (ii) that if the resulting child (in Anna and Boris\u2019 case) has kidney problems, this therapy will not solve all of them \u2013 it is only intended to address the problems related to anaemia; (iii) that if the resulting child does not have kidney problems, this therapy will mean that the child will have enhanced levels of erythropoietin (this is true for both couples); (iv) that if the resulting child has no kidney problems and enhanced levels of erythropoietin, there may be a slightly increased chance of stroke; and (v) that because these alterations are taking place at the embryonic level it is likely that they will be carried on in future generations. Questions 1. Is the use of Corinne\u2019s technique on Anna and Boris\u2019s embryos treatment or research? 2. What are the ethical considerations raised by the use of this technique (whether it is research or treatment)? 3. Is this kind of treatment of embryos permissible? If so why? If not, why not? 4. In the case of each couple, is the use of Corinne\u2019s technique on the embryos therapy or enhancement? How does this affect the ethics of the prospective interventions? 5. Do the couples have the right to decide whether or not to go ahead with this procedure? If we assume that the resultant child will benefit from the intervention, do the couples have an obligation to go ahead with this procedure? How much depends on the assumption of benefit to the prospective child? 6. Should there be special regulation or oversight of this kind of activity? 7. Are there any special ethical issues raised by the fact that these interventions may, if successful, affect future generations? Discussion This case introduces ethical issues surrounding new reproductive technologies. It may be useful in the discus- sion of the case to begin with an initial survey of the research ethics issues raised by this kind of situation (as raised by questions 1 and 2, for example) and then to return to them after the more general ethical concerns have been discussed. It is useful, that is, to consider the research-specific issues both before and after the discussion of the more controversial \u2018enhancement\u2019 and reproductive technology-related considerations. By separating ethical issues raised by the specific nature of the proposal from more general research ethics issues, students will be better places to assess the particular research ethics problems raised by controversial research.

Wilkie and Alastair Kent. \u201cEthical review of research into rare genetic disorders\u201d, British Medical Journal 329 (2004): 288-9. Links with previous topics The case raises issues of consent and harm relating to the severity of the potential effects on the resulting off- spring, the ability of individuals to understand and consent to risks when there is very little evidence to go on, and the right of parents to consent to risks to be borne by their future children. These issues connect with units 2 and 5. The question of how to handle decisions under significant uncertainty, in contexts of risk of serious harm is further considered in the discussion of Case Study 8.3 below. The distinction between research and treatment The application and testing of the new techniques described in this case appear to be on a small scale (rather than in large trials), involving individuals with suitable circumstances who are willing (arguably desperate) to find a particular solution. This will mean that the kind of data that can possibly be gained from this experi- mentation will be very specific and a very long way from being generally established. There are two related issues here: 1) How can this \u2018experimentation\u2019 be justified methodologically given that, even if it is successful, there will be relatively little (if any) scientific progress. Alternatively, if this experimentation is understood as \u2018tailor- made\u2019 treatment, the justification need not be research focussed at all. It is quite often the case in clinical genetics that specific mutations require investigation and exploration. In such cases, one off responses to patient need help to build up the geneticist\u2019s \u2018library\u2019 of mutations and conditions and so contribute to experiential or clinical knowledge rather than more general, \u2018publishable\u2019 research. This case and the situation in clinical genetics provide an interesting challenge to the conception of research and its relationship to clinical practice. ( 2 ) 2) Oversight and Scrutiny: Given (1), who would judge borderline cases and how might these difficult cases be subject to ethical scrutiny? Whether it is thought that this case should count as research or not, it arguably still may require scrutiny of the kind that research ethics committees provide. If this kind of experimentation is treatment, then there may be some need for regulation and oversight irrespective of the involvement of a research ethics committee. The moral status of the embryo Clearly, this case raises issues about the proper treatment of embryos and its moral status. Four common accounts may be discussed and applied to the research context. According to these, moral status is attached to (i) the continuous human organism; (ii) persons and potential people, (iii) to persons only; or (iv) conferred by agents. These general ethical considerations provide a basis for consideration of the nature and extent of the limits of permissible research on embryos. How, in particular, should the various approaches to the moral status of the embryo be balanced against the value of important research? ",

The divergence of views on the moral status of the embryo raise the question (first addressed in Unit 1) of how regulators and those involved in ethical review should respond to divergent ethical views, especially where they are associated with different religious perspectives. Therapy and enhancement The central pedagogical point of involving the two couples in this case is to compare the moral significance of using a technology to treat a symptom of a condition) and using it to enhance. That is, is there a morally relevant distinction between therapy and enhancement? Under what conditions, if any, might research into human enhancement be justified? It is noteworthy that if Anna and Boris\u2019 child does not have the kidney condition (if the genes are not \u2018expressed\u2019) then the child will have the increased sensitivity to EPO and so would also have increased endur- ance capabilities. Thus, despite the initial difference in the couples\u2019 intent, the outcome may be the same. Procreative beneficence and procreative liberty This case also raises questions about the obligations and rights of prospective parents to decide in these kinds of cases. Questions five and six directly address issues surrounding procreative beneficence and procreative liberty as well as the appropriateness of regulation and oversight in these contexts. Again, part of the idea is to contrast the two couples and to ask the students to articulate the morally relevant differences between them, if there are any. Interfering with nature One quite common response to major technological developments and, in particular, developments affect- ing more central or significant aspects of life is to claim that such developments are unnatural, constitute an inference with nature, or involve human beings \u2018playing God.\u2019 Claims like these are common enough to warrant some attention. Moreover, the questions raised in this case pose difficult challenges to ordinary moral responses. After con- sidering the force of these challenges it is useful to focus on a range of attempts to respond to them. In one way or another, the attempts made by Sandel ( 3 ), Kass ( 4 ), Habermas ( 5 ) and others to respond to the challenge posed by the claims of reproductive beneficence, liberty and enhancement are attempts to make sense of the proper limits of human activity. In this sense they begin to address questions like: How best can we understand arguments and claims about the unnaturalness of certain human behaviour? What, if anything, is wrong with \u2018playing God\u2019, and which actions count as doing so? ",
        "100 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH 6. We would like to thank Dominic Wilkinson for his helpful suggestions about this case. Germ line and somatic gene therapy The final question asks students to consider the moral significance of interventions that are likely to affect directly future generations as compared to those that do not. This introduces the distinction between germ line and somatic gene therapy. Issues that may arise in this context may include the lack of consent on the part of the \u2018future generations\u2019 or the degree of risk and level of uncertainty involved. This latter point may lead on to an initial discussion of the Precautionary Principle (which will arise again in Case Study 8.3 ). Case Study 8.2 Research into cochlear implants ( 6 ) A consortium of researchers including developmental psychologists and cochlear implant surgeons has proposed research that will attempt to assess the developmental differences between children with cochlear implants and those without. Part of their general research interest includes claims made by the Deaf community that deaf children are better off deaf when they are a part of the Deaf community. The proposed research involves a small scale cohort study looking at the differences in devel- opment between four groups of children: (i) deaf children without cochlear implants and living in the Deaf community; (ii) children with cochlear implants who are a part of the Deaf community; (iii) children with cochlear implants who are not a part of the Deaf community; and (iv) children who are not deaf and are not a part of the Deaf community. Ideally they would have liked to include a fifth category \u2013 children who are congenitally deaf, without cochlear implants and not a part of the Deaf community \u2013 however due to the wide- spread uptake of cochlear implants in the region, the team has not been about to identify a significant number of potential participants. The research will involve a series of detailed semi-structured interviews with the parents (beginning before the child is born) as well as simple testing and observation of the child over the course of its early years of development. At this stage they hope to gather some initial data about the range of developmental concerns, with a view to developing an instrument that can be usefully applied in a much larger international study. ",
        "101 UNIT 8 ETHICAL ISSUES IN THE NEW BIOTECHNOLOGIES Through various academic contacts, they have approached a number of couples in the Deaf community to assess their attitudes to the use of cochlear implants to enable their child to hear. They have found a number of couples within the Deaf community who are prepared to have their children undergo the implant surgery as well as a number who would not. They have also identified a number of couples with a history of congenital deafness in the family who would choose to undergo the implant surgery should their child turn out to be deaf. These couples are happy to participate in the study even if their child is not deaf. A member of your committee is disabled (though not deaf) and, at the meeting, strongly objects to this research on two grounds: (1) that the tools and measures that will be used by the researchers are biased in favour of the hearing; and (2), that the researchers are clearly pursuing an \u2018paternalistic\u2019, anti-disability agenda. In the former case the committee member explains that the usual developmental milestones are keyed to expressive and responsive measures related to linguistic capability. In the latter case, it is clear any future research of this kind is likely to receive a similar appraisal from this committee member, particularly if it involves any of the members of this consortium. Questions 1. Putting aside the committee member\u2019s objections, what ethical issues arise in this piece of research? 2. How should the committee respond to the first of the individual member\u2019s objections, about the research methodology? 3. How should the committee respond to the second of the individual member\u2019s objections, about the researchers\u2019 political agenda? 4. In the light of the individual committee member\u2019s objections should this research go ahead in any form? If so what changes are required? 5. In terms of the general conduct of research ethics committee business, how should this kind of objection be handled? What can be required of individual committee members in this regard? Discussion This case is intended to raise issues about the nature of disability, discrimination and the use of technological developments with respect to disability. The important tension that is developed, largely through the disa- bled committee member, is between the conception of the Deaf community as a culture and the conception of deaf individuals as disabled because they are without full or normal human functioning. The perhaps uncomfortably strong view of the individual committee member also raises ethical issues about the role of diversity and representation in ethics review process. Questions two, three and four are designed to draw the discussion towards these questions through the anal- ysis of the committee member\u2019s objections. Question two focuses on the more methodological aspects of the tension. The idea is to challenge the tools and methods by which \u2018normal\u2019 development is measured. ",
        "102 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Question 3 focuses more on the overtly political, second objection. To what extent, for instance, is it appro- priate to think of the researchers\u2019 project as something approaching \u2018cultural paternalism\u2019 or \u2018imperialism\u2019? These political issues tie closely to the social model of disability. In both cases it may be claimed that the values underpinning the criteria of \u2018success\u2019 in development are not shared by the Deaf community and so, are not values against which members of that community should be compared. The final question calls for resolution in the specific committee context as well as consideration of and justi- fication for a more general position about consensus and decision-making. Perhaps the most significant point to consider in answering this question concerns the way in which ethics requires handling strongly held, perhaps dogmatic, minority views. This is not simply a point about the research ethics committee but one that operates at the national and European level, about the kind of research that takes place. Links with previous topics The main connections with topics from previous units are the involvement of children (Unit 3) and issues surrounding discrimination (Unit 6). With respect to the former the research looks rather straightforward: parental consent can be ongoing, with some input, where relevant, from the child as this becomes appro- priate. It is worth revisiting the general justifications of decision-making by parents of the child\u2019s behalf both in preparation for as well as after the discussions about the nature of disability. The nature of disability The discussion of this case will raise questions about the main competing accounts of the nature of disability and its relationship to an account of \u2018normal human functioning\u2019. These accounts involve consideration of the arguments for and against the \u2018medical\u2019 model of disability as well as the view of disability as a social construct. Parents and the state A key issue raised in the context of research on children is the relative responsibility of the parents and the state with respect to the child. The claims of the Deaf community can be taken to challenge the limits of parental control. This discussion is a natural corollary of reflection on the nature of disability. In particular: 1) How does the nature of disability connect with questions about harms? 2) What are the limits of the kinds of lives that parents should be allowed to \u2018inflict\u2019 on their children? 3) When should the state regulate such matters? ",
        "103 UNIT 8 ETHICAL ISSUES IN THE NEW BIOTECHNOLOGIES Case Study 8.3 Research using gold nanoparticles A team of researchers at a leading cancer research institute has recently become interested in the use of nanote- chnology. The team has put together a program of research that involves two different uses of gold nanoparticles in the treatment of cancer. The first process used is called \u2018nano- photothermolysis\u2019 \u2013 using nanotech- nology to generate enough heat to break down a substance to its constitu- ent components. Directed laser energy is used to heat up the nanoparticles until they explode, in the aftermath of which localized cancer cells get destroyed without damaging healthy cells nearby. Several after effects contribute to the destruction of cancer cells using nanoparticles. These include acoustic shock waves from the explo- sion, optical plasma and particle fragmentation. In the second process, the gold nanoparticles carry an anti-cancer drug and can seek out the tumour within the body. Once the nanoparticles have surrounded the target cells, infrared light is used to heat the nanoparticles so that they release the drug. In order for the therapy to work, the nanoparticles must target only cancerous cells and avoid healthy cells. The property that identifies a cell as being cancerous is a protein known as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This protein surrounds the cancerous cell, but is not found in such abundant quantities in the healthy cells. The nanoparticles attach themselves to the antibody for the EGFR and then destroy the cancer cell without damaging healthy tissue. Both processes have been successfully used in animal models but there is some concern about the scale-related differences \u2013 that is, how the different volume of nanoparticles may influence the effects both on the individual and on the external environment. In both cases the use of these particles promises to be a very effective way of targeting particular cancer cells but very little is known about the consequences of the accumulation of nanoparticles in the body or the environment. Because of their size, nanoparticles are able to move through normal barriers easily and possibly interact with other parts of the body. There is some concern that the remaining particles may translocate to other organs causing toxicity (for example, neuronal uptake in the brain). Another possibility is that these particles will interact together ",
        "104 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH in the outside environment in ways that could be harmful, particularly if there is significant use of this technology. Some researchers at the institute (not working on this project) are uncomfortable about the current volume of nanoparticles in use. They are concerned that enough of these particles might become \u2018nuisance dusts\u2019 and produce serious adverse health effects in those in the vicinity. Some even worry that because so little is known about nanoparticles, they may turn out to be the asbestos of the 21st century. Questions 1. What immediate ethical problems will the researchers face as they try to build a series of research proposals designed to test their treatments? 2. Given the level of uncertainty associated with the use of nanotechnology and the potential dangers involved, what level of precaution administered either by the REC, regulation or alternate oversight ought to be in place? 3. What level of precaution should be adopted to guard against the possible harmful consequences of the overuse of nanotechnology? Discussion The main focus of this case is on issues related to risk and, in the research ethics context, dealing with significant uncertainty about the nature and magnitude of the risk. Links with previous topics Like Case Study 8.1 , this case raises questions about the risk of harm and the possibility of subjects consent- ing to research when very little is known about the risks they will face. More general questions about dealing with risks that are unknown or difficult to quantify lead directly to consideration of the Precautionary Principle. It is also worth pausing to consider various methodological and research design questions that arise about the best way to proceed in gathering knowledge about the potential of these technologies. The Precautionary Principle Given the focus of the case, the discussion will be assisted by the early introduction of the various attempted formulations of the Precautionary Principle. After considering the background context of the regulations of risk and the interpretations of the Precautionary Principle, the students will be well placed to return to the case to consider the principle\u2019s application in the context of nanotechnology. There are various approaches to risk regulation and the Precautionary Principle as they appear in European legislation. These serve as examples of more general strategies that will be used to understand the ethical considerations involved in cases where precaution may be required and for formulating an adequate Precautionary Principle. Part of the adequacy of the various formulations will involve consideration of the justification of the alternatives. ",
        "105 UNIT 8 ETHICAL ISSUES IN THE NEW BIOTECHNOLOGIES Case Study 8.4 Genetic information and biobanks Kurt is a teacher in a city in northeastern Europe. He has been asked to join a large research project that is looking at the genetics of cardiovascular disease. This will involve giving a DNA sample, answering a questionnaire and allowing details of his treatment to be given to the researchers. This study will directly help clinicians decide which drug to give to those patients who are enrolled in the study. Researchers at the local hospital where Kurt is being treated, in collaboration with a team of researchers from a southern European university and a medical sciences institute in China are conducting the study. Kurt has been asked to give a broad consent that will allow the researchers to keep the DNA sample and information for use in suitably approved future research projects. This will save them the expense of coming back for consent for each new research project. He can choose whether researchers are allowed to come back to him to ask further questions. The DNA will be processed in China and then sent to southern Europe for analysis. All of the direct identifiers (such as his name and address) will be removed before the samples are sent to China. The samples will, however, be given a code which will remain in a secure location at Kurt\u2019s hospital. The samples and information collected from Kurt will then put in a biobank that can be accessed by many other researchers for many years into the future. It is anticipated that when the technology is cheaper, whole genome scans will be carried out on some of the samples and this will be put on web for other researchers to use. Questions 1. Is it acceptable to obtain consent to the use of the samples and information for many different research projects into the future (broad consent)? 2. Does the coding of samples and information mean that it is not necessary to ask for Kurt\u2019s consent for future research projects? 3. Is it necessary to tell Kurt that the DNA samples will be processed in China and will leave the European Union? 4. The researchers discover that people with Kurt\u2019s genetic predisposition are more likely to die if they are treated with a drug that is commonly used for heart conditions in that part of northeastern Europe. Should they tell Kurt? 5. Do the researchers need to go back to Kurt to get permission for his whole genome scan to be put on the web? ",
        "106 SYLLABUS ON ETHICS IN RESEARCH Discussion This case raises general issues about consent and its role in the developing context of global research and global access to data, and it points to questions that are more specific to genetics and our relationship to and control of genetic information. In turn, these lead to further questions, raised initially in Unit 7, about the form and context of research governance. One strategy for discussion is to begin with a brief revision of the main principles of consent and confidenti- ality from units 2 and 3 and then move to considering how they feature in this case. This leads onto the issues surrounding broad consent and then to governance and genetic exceptionalism. Links with previous topics This kind of research presents challenges to standard conceptions of consent, confidentiality (and data pro- tection) and research governance. As such they relate to discussions in Units 2, 3 and 7. Broad consent Broad consent involves the research participant agreeing for their sample or data to be used in a variety of different research projects, sometimes by different researchers and sometimes, potentially, in very different contexts. This potentially includes uses that might otherwise be considered breaches of confidentiality or privacy. Each of the questions accompanying the case raises a different kind of consideration about broad consent, its limits and closely related ethical concerns. Research governance One way to understand broad consent, at least as it applies in cases like this one, is as consent to particular kind of governance arrangement. That is when an individual gives \u2018broad\u2019 consent to the use of their data in future research they are giving permission for someone else to decide how to use that data. If this is correct then the question of governance becomes important again, as does the disclosure of the governance arrange- ments to the participant. This case also raises issues about the global governance of research. The involvement of international partners with research spanning national boundaries means that some consideration is needed about the form of over- sight in these contexts. One possibility is to establish an international committee to examine such research; another is to require that specific standards are upheld and processes in place in each of the participating countries. The general kinds of questions raised here (and related to earlier units) include: (i) How should large collections of biological samples and data be governed? (ii) Who should have access and under what conditions? (iii) When is the reuse of data for a different purpose acceptable? (iv) What kinds of regulations should be in place to facilitate global or public access to research materials? ",
        "107 UNIT 8 ETHICAL ISSUES IN THE NEW BIOTECHNOLOGIES Genetic exceptionalism The final question further considers the acceptability of broad consent in the context of broadening access to an individual\u2019s genetic information. However it is also important to notice the possible involvement of others in this sort of disclosure. Genetic information is shared between (extended) family members and so informa- tion about one person is also information about a number of others. This leads to numerous confidentiality and privacy issues. To what extent does this mean that genetic information and genetic research should be treated differently? Are these differences enough to mean that different rules apply in the case of genetics?

        "K I - N A - 24451 - E N - N This syllabus is the second output of the project \u201cEurope Textbook on Ethics in Research\u201d, funded by the European Commission and delivered by members of the Centre for Professional Ethics at Keele University. As an accompaniment to the principal output of the project, which is the textbook itself, this syllabus provides an overview of the content of the textbook and is designed to be used as a basis for training courses in research ethics aimed at researchers and/or research ethics committee members and officers. The scope of the syllabus is the ethics of scientific research involving human beings. The case studies relate to a variety of scientific disciplines including biomedical and human life sciences, new technologies, and the social sciences. Readers will be introduced to a range of philosophical perspectives and concepts, and these will be used to inform discussion of practical ethical issues, but without any particular approach being promoted. Ideally the syllabus will be used in conjunction with the textbook, but it may also be used independently, in which case the guides to further reading provided at the end of each unit will be of particular importance.
