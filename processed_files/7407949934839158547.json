        "GUIDELINE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 11 December 2008 amending Guideline ECB/2006/16 on the legal framework for accounting and financial reporting in the European System of Central Banks (ECB/2008/21) (2009/100/EC) THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ESCB Statute), and in particular Articles 12.1, 14.3 and 26.4 thereof, Having regard to the contribution of the General Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) pursuant to the second and third indents of Article 47.2 of the ESCB Statute, Whereas: (1) Guideline ECB/2006/16 of 10 November 2006 on the legal framework for accounting and financial reporting in the European System of Central Banks ( 1 ) needs to be amended in order to reflect policy decisions and market developments. (2) The Eurosystem has revised its disclosure policy for sec\u00ad urities transactions with a view to enhance further the transparency of the financial statements. As part of the revised policy, securities that previously qualified as financial fixed assets should be reclassified from the balance sheet item \u2018 Other financial assets \u2019 to the appro\u00ad priate item under the heading \u2018 asset \u2019 depending on the origin of the issuer, the currency denomination and on whether the securities are held-to-maturity. Moreover, all financial instruments that are part of an earmarked portfolio should be included under the item \u2018 Other financial assets \u2019 . (3) Guideline ECB/2006/16 does not contain specific rules on the accounting of forward interest rate swaps, foreign exchange futures and equity futures. Such instruments are increasingly used in the financial markets and may be relevant to the management of the ECB \u2019 s foreign reserves. While forward interest rate swaps should be accounted for in the same manner as \u2018 plain vanilla \u2019 interest rate swaps, foreign exchange futures and equity futures should be accounted for in the same manner as interest rate futures. (4) The current rules on equity instruments need to be amended in order to reflect the possibility to deal with marketable equities as part of the management of the ECB \u2019 s foreign reserves, HAS ADOPTED THIS GUIDELINE: Article 1 Amendments Guideline ECB/2006/16 is amended as follows: 1. Article 5(2) is replaced by the following: \u2018 2. Securities transactions including equity instruments denominated in foreign currency may continue to be recorded according to the cash/settlement approach. The related accrued interest including premiums or discounts shall be recorded on a daily basis from the spot settlement date. \u2019 ; 2. Article 7 is amended as follows: (a) Paragraph 2 is replaced by the following: \u2018 2. The revaluation of gold, foreign currency instruments, securities other than securities classified as held-to-maturity and non-marketable securities as well as financial instruments, both on-balance sheet and off- balance sheet, shall be performed as at the quarterly revaluation date at mid-market rates and prices. This shall not preclude reporting entities from revaluing their portfolios on a more frequent basis for internal purposes, provided that they report items in their balance sheets only at transaction value during the quarter. \u2019 ; (b) The following paragraph 5 is added: \u2018 5. Securities classified as held-to maturity and non- marketable securities shall be valued at amortised costs and shall be subject to impairment. \u2019 ; EN L 36/46 Official Journal of the European Union 5.2.2009 ( 1 ) OJ L 348, 11.12.2006, p. 1.

Reverse transactions, including security lending trans\u00ad actions, conducted under an automated security lending programme shall only be recorded with effect on the balance sheet where collateral is provided in the form of cash placed on an account of the relevant NCB or the ECB. \u2019 ; 4. Article 9 is amended as follows: (a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following: \u2018 1. This Article applies to marketable equity instruments, that is to say equity shares or equity funds, whether the transactions are conducted directly by a reporting entity or by its agent, with the exception of activities conducted for pension funds, par\u00ad ticipating interests, investments in subsidiaries or significant interests. \u2019 ; (b) paragraph 2 is replaced by the following: \u2018 2. Equity instruments denominated in foreign currencies and disclosed under \u201c other assets \u201d shall not form part of the overall currency position but shall be part of a separate currency holding. The calculation of the related foreign exchange gains and losses may be performed either on a net average cost method or an average cost method. \u2019 (c) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following: \u2018 3. The revaluation of equity portfolios shall be performed in accordance with Article 7(2). Revaluation shall take place on an item-by-item basis. For equity funds, the price revaluation shall be performed on a net basis, and not on an individual share-by-share basis. There shall be no netting between different equity shares or between different equity funds. \u2019 ; (d) the following paragraphs 4 to 8 are added: \u2018 4. Transactions shall be recorded in the balance sheet at transaction price. 5. Brokerage commission may be recorded either as a transaction cost to be included in the cost of the asset, or as an expense in the profit and loss account. 6. The amount of the dividend purchased shall be included in the cost of the equity instrument. At ex- dividend date, the amount of the dividend purchased may be treated as a separate item until the payment of the dividend has been received. 7. Accruals on dividends shall not be booked at end- of-period as they are already reflected in the market price of the equity instruments with the exception of equities quoted ex-dividend. 8. Rights issues shall be treated as a separate asset when issued. The acquisition cost shall be calculated based on the equity \u2019 s existing average cost, on the new acquisition \u2019 s strike price, and on the proportion between existing and new equities. Alternatively, the price of the right may be based on the right \u2019 s value in the market, the equity \u2019 s existing average cost and the equity \u2019 s market price before the rights issue. \u2019 ; 5. Article 16 is amended as follows: (a) The heading is replaced by the following: \u2018 Article 16 Future contracts \u2019 (b) Paragraph 1 is replaced by the following: \u2018 1. Future contracts shall be recorded on the trade date in off-balance-sheet accounts. \u2019 6. Article 17(3) is replaced by the following: \u2018 3. Interest rate swaps shall be individually revalued and, if necessary, translated into euro at the currency spot rate. It is recommended that unrealised losses taken to the profit and loss account at the year-end should be amortised in subsequent years, that in the case of forward interest rate swaps the amortisation should begin from value date of the transaction and that the amortisation should be linear. Unrealised revaluation gains shall be credited to a revaluation account. \u2019 7. Annexes II, IV and IX to Guideline ECB/2006/16 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Guideline.
