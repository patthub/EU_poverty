        "For the past 60 years, the EU budget has progressively changed with the building of the European Union. The EU budget is the tool to ensure that Europe remains a democratic, peaceful, prosperous and competitive force. It provides the means to make Europe a global leader facing today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s challenges. THE EVOLUTION OF THE EU BUDGET 1960s Agriculture first major common policy. 1980s and 1990s \u2022 Single market. \u2022 New domains: economic, social and territorial cohesion; transport; space; environment and research. Since 2004 \u2022 13 new Member States. \u2022 Growing role of the EU in the world, as a leader in the fight against climate change and as the largest donor of humanitarian and development aid in the world. The European Union budget helps to deliver on things that matter for Europeans. At the origin of the European project was the idea that pulling resources together would make Europe stronger and be the key to prosperity and peace. The EU budget continues to do that by financing projects that make a difference in the life of European citizens. Why do we need an EU budget? 5 ",
        "6 Unlike national budgets, the EU budget is an investment budget: it does not fund social protection, primary education or national defence, but rather the key areas that provide European added value by boosting growth and competitiveness. It intervenes only when it is more effective to spend money at the European level than at local, regional or national level. An emergency at sea or during a road trip? The EU\u2019s Galileo satellites can help locate anyone in need of assistance and save many lives. Criteria: Treaty objectives and obligations - Public goods of a European dimension - Economies of scale - Spillover effect - Subsidiarity - Benefits of EU integration - European values: peace, democracy, rule of law IT IS DIFFERENT FROM NATIONAL BUDGETS What makes the EU budget unique? By pooling resources at the European level, Member States can achieve more than they could by acting alone. Every euro invested under the EU budget should bring added value. Significant investments are needed at the European level to compete with other global players. They cannot be financed by one Member State alone because of their scale. For instance, the EU budget promotes infrastructure and research projects by creating economies of scale and leverage effect, and by avoiding duplication of efforts.

The EU budget provides the means for a global response to tackle transnational issues that affect all its citizens. Faced with the most severe refugee crisis the world has seen since the Second World War, the EU managed to bring about a profound change in migration management and border protection. The EU has offered protection and support to millions, saved lives, dismantled trafficking networks and brought irregular arrivals to Europe down to the lowest level recorded in five years at the end of 2018. IT ENSURES EUROPE\u2019S ROLE AS A GLOBAL ACTOR The EU budget provides the guarantees needed for risky or long-term projects, which could never be financed by a single EU country by itself. It improves the business environment by unleashing the potential of European companies, and by removing regulatory barriers to investments both nationally and at the EU level.

        "9 It increases shared prosperity and solidarity The EU budget contributes to reducing disparities within Europe and between regions. Average gross domestic product per capita in the EU has almost doubled over the past twenty years. The increase has been over tenfold for some of the poorest members. It is estimated that the return on investment of regional spending by 2023 will be \u20ac2.74 for every \u20ac1 invested between 2007 and 2013 \u2014 that is a 274% return. Example To bridge the digital divide, the EU is supporting access to broadband. This is vital for ensuring the balanced development of all EU regions and allowing citizens and businesses to benefit from new digital services. In France, the EU invested \u20ac600 million in the \u201cEnhanced Broadband for All\u201d project to bring very high speed broadband to the whole of the country by 2022. REGIONAL POLICY IN FIGURES For 2014-20, the EU allocated over \u20ac460 billion to regional spending.

Researchers can benefit from partial financing through Horizon 2020 . Thanks to the EU budget, the European Union is a world leader in research and innovation. It is responsible for one quarter of global expenditure on research and one third of global patent applications. Small and medium businesses benefit from grants, loans and in some cases guarantees, as well as better access to finance and markets under the competitiveness of enterprises and SMEs (COSME) programme. Farmers receive aid to bolster their income, as well as environmental funding from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and LIFE programme to promote sustainable agriculture.

        "LONG-TERM BUDGET As the EU budget is mainly an investment budget, it needs to be decided on a long-term basis to ensure stability. A long-term spending plan, called the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), is adopted for a period of at least five years (generally seven years). The MFF lays down the maximum annual amounts (ceilings) that the EU may spend in the different categories of expenditure (headings) for each of the five to seven years.

        "What does the EU budget finance? The EU budget is broken down into five headings, which represent spending areas. The lion\u2019s share of the EU budget (around 75%) goes to regional development, agriculture and fight against climate change (headings 1b and 2). Only 6% of the EU budget goes towards administrative costs. Smart and inclusive growth a. Competitiveness for growth and jobs . The EU invests in research and innovation, education and training, trans-European networks in energy, transport and telecommunications, development of enterprises, etc. b. Economic, social, and territorial cohesion . The EU finances regional policy to help the least developed EU Member States and regions catch up with the rest, strengthening all regions\u2019 competitiveness and developing inter-regional cooperation. Sustainable growth: natural resources . The EU budget finances agriculture \u2013 including rural development, fisheries, and environmental and climate action. Security and citizenship . It invests in justice and home affairs, border protection, immigration and asylum policy, public health, consumer protection, culture, youth, civil protection and dialogue with citizens. Global Europe . It covers all external action (foreign policy) by the EU such as development assistance and humanitarian aid. Administration.

        "18 Too much money for agriculture? In 2017, the share of EU spending on farming was 41%. In 1985, 70% was spent on farming. Over the past decade, 13 countries \u2013 most of them with large farming sectors \u2013 have joined the EU. However, the common agricultural policy budget has not risen. In fact, spending continues to fall. For 2021-2027, the Commission proposed to dedicate less than 30% of the EU budget to agriculture. Its relatively large share of the EU budget is justified: it is the only policy funded almost entirely from the EU budget. This means that EU spending replaces national expenditure to a large extent.

        "23 SHARED MANAGEMENT A big part of EU budget expenditure is managed by Member States under so-called shared management in areas such as agriculture and regional development. Benefits of shared management EU funding under shared management has been a major and stable source of public investment in many Member States. It acts as a catalyst for further public and private investment. Member States or private partners are more likely to finance projects if they can share the funding and the associated risks with the EU. It encourages Member States to implement necessary structural reforms to make efficient and effective use of the European funds. All these measures benefit the economy as a whole, creating a more favourable business environment. Territorial cooperation between neighbouring countries is a way to strengthen the internal market and reduce barriers between Member States. Example. EU funds help renovate one of Catalonia\u2019s most densely populated areas EU funding and private investment have enabled the council of Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Catalonia to renovate neighbourhoods in the Serra d\u2019en Mena area. Upgrades include construction of a multi- purpose building with a market, a library and a cr\u00e8che. This is an example of how neighbourhoods can be made more welcoming and economically and environmentally sustainable.

The Commission presents in a transparent manner the results of controls and audits carried out by the Commission, the Member States and other organisations, as well as the actions taken to address any weaknesses found.

There are different types of safeguards in place: preventive and corrective measures. Errors versus fraud Errors do not mean that EU money is lost, wasted or affected by fraud. In fact, fraud affects approximately 0.2% of the total EU budget.

Now, the EU needs the resources to protect and build on this legacy. Therefore, the Commission proposed a new mechanism to protect the EU budget from financial risks linked to generalised deficiencies regarding the rule of law in the Member States. It would allow the EU to suspend, reduce or restrict access to EU funding in a manner proportionate to the nature, gravity and scope of the rule-of-law deficiencies. To reduce the weight of the gross national income contribution for the Member States and to reflect the EU\u2019s policy priorities, the Commission proposes to introduce a basket of new own resources consisting of: \u2022 20% of the revenues from the emissions trading system; \u2022 a 3% call rate applied to the new common consolidated corporate tax base; \u2022 a national contribution calculated from the amount of non-recycled plastic packaging waste in each Member State (\u20ac0.80 per kg).
