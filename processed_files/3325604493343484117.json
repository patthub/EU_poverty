        "Macroeconomic relevance of energy IMPORTANCE OF THE ENERGY SECTOR The share pf energy in total employment has been considerably higher than the EU average, but much less so in 2012 than 2005 which may for a part reflect restructuring in the sector. Source: EUROSTAT \u2013 National Accounts for EU27 \u2013 Malta NSO: Total gainful occupations* According to EurObserv'ER, in 2013, the share of direct and indirect renewable energy related employment in total employment of the economy in Malta was estimated to be about 0.06%, below the EU average of 0.53%. Limited resources and the small size of the market do not incentivize certain investments such as the production of photovoltaic panels. Source: European Commission, based on EurObserv'ER and EUROSTAT TRADE BALANCE OF ENERGY PRODUCTS The almost full dependency on imported oil products translates into one of the largest energy trade deficits in the EU in GDP terms. It has also strongly increased over the period under consideration, but since 2005 the very large current account deficit has turned into a modest surplus in 2014. As a result of the investments in the generation and distribution sectors, the efficiency in the use of primary energy is expected to increase significantly which will reduce the demand for imports of energy products. The statistics of the trade balance of energy products for Malta are volatile over time depending on stock and valuation movements. The trend to a more balanced energy mix (such as through a higher share of renewable energy and the electricity interconnector) will most likely reduce this volatility. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 2005 2012 MT EU27 Employment in energy sector % of total employment* Towards an Energy Union Malta ",

As a result, Malta's electricity interconnection capacity increased from 0% to approximately 35%. 2 In addition, a new gas-fired CCGT power plant and a Liquified Natural Gas facility (LNG) are being built. In addition, the existing power plant will be converted to run on natural gas once the new LNG facilities are built. Malta is involved in one Project of Common Interest (in gas): connection of Malta to the European Gas network (gas pipeline with Italy at Gela and Floating LNG Storage and Regasification Unit). 2 The graph reflects the situation in 2014 and therefore the increase of the interconnection level is not yet reflected.

The generation sector is open to competition but market size had restrained development until very recently with two major private energy generators as well as a number of small renewable energy suppliers entering the market. Dispatch and balancing is carried out by Enemalta plc. The electricity retail sector is not open to competition and therefore customer switching is not possible in Malta (the physical and structural constraints are a barrier to an effective market). The Electricity Market Regulations have to be seen in the light of the derogations granted to Malta by virtue of Article 44 of Directive 2009/72/EC from the requirements of Articles 9, 26, 32 and 33 of this directive. All consumers of electricity are on regulated retail tariffs. In 2014, retail electricity prices for households were below European average. The assessment of the retail electricity market expressed by consumers in an EU-wide survey is well above EU average 3 . Malta is proceeding with electricity smart meter roll out. Sources:E S TAT and European Commission Calculations CONTRIBUTION OF ENERGY TO CONSUMER PRICE EVOLUTION Despite Malta's almost complete dependency on imported oil products, neither overall inflation nor the contribution of energy prices to inflation appears much more volatile than their Euro area counterparts. The import price hedging arrangement in the sector may have had an important stabilising impact on prices. 3 10th Consumer Markets Scoreboard (June 2014), http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumer_evidence/consumer_scoreboards/10_edition/index_en.htm ",

The target for 2020 expressed in final energy consumption was increased from 0.493 Mtoe to 0.547 Mtoe due to economic growth, which means that the target became less ambitious. Malta would need to increase its current efforts, in line with its National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, regarding energy efficiency to reach its 2020 target expressed in final energy consumption.

Non-ETS Emissions (vs. 2005) Projections/proxy target Projections with existing measures 2020 -16% +5% Proxy 2014 -2% +6% The projections, submitted by the Member States, undergo a QA/QC (quality assurance/ quality control) process to fill any gaps and to align the projections with historic data. RENEWABLE ENERGY SHARE TARGET 2020 (10%) Malta's renewable energy share has recently increased, reaching 3.8% in 2013, above the indicative trajectory towards the 2020 renewable energy targets. However, significant renewables deployment is needed in view of the steeper trajectory towards 2020. Use of the cooperation mechanisms with other Member States could be considered to facilitate the achievement of the renewable energy target. ",

Regional Cooperation Regional cooperation on infrastructure development is necessary to optimise the identification of regional infrastructure priorities and to coordinate cross-border investments. Malta is a member of two Regional Groups established under the TEN-E Regulation: North-South electricity and gas interconnections in Western Europe. 8. Cohesion policy contribution The EU Cohesion policy provides for important investment possibilities to implement energy policy objectives in Malta which will be complemented by national public and private co-financing, aiming at optimal leverage. It also ensures integrated territorial solutions to challenges by supporting capacity building, technical assistance and territorial cooperation. Energy efficiency: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 15 million in energy efficiency improvements in public and residential buildings and in enterprises in Malta. These investments are expected to contribute to a decrease of around 170 000 kWh per year of decreased primary energy consumption of public buildings. A further estimated EUR 52 million will be invested in transport, of which EUR 28 million will be used to support the move towards an energy-efficient, decarbonised transport sector. Decarbonisation: Overall, the EU Cohesion Policy investments in Malta over 2014-2020 are expected to contribute to an estimated annual decrease of GHG of around 68 000 tonnes of CO2eq. Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 31 million in renewable energy (solar) in in public and residential buildings and in enterprises in Malta. These investments are expected to contribute to around 80 MW of additional capacity of renewable energy production. Research, Innovation and Competitiveness: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest significantly in R&I and in SME competitiveness in Malta. This will be based on the national strategy for smart specialisation. For Malta, the strategy includes seven areas of specialisation, plus ICT as a horizontal enabler. One of the seven areas targets resource efficient buildings, aiming to develop solutions for improved resource efficiency in new and existing buildings through, inter alia, demonstration projects and optimisation of building design. At this stage, the allocations foreseen for investments in R&I and adoption of low-carbon technologies in Malta are not specified, but should become available in line with the evolving content of the smart specialisation strategy.
