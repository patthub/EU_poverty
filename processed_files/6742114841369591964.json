        "EXECUTIVE Policy Department for Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs Directorate-General for Internal Policies PE 691.875- April 2021 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Study for FEMM committee The traumas endured by refugee women and their consequences for integration and participation in the EU host country 1 Migration has been part of human history and an ever-growing phenomenon. The number of displaced people worldwide in 2019 was about 79.5 million. Most of them were displaced within their own country (internally displaced persons). Over 30 million are refugees (26 million) and asylum seekers (4.2 million). In the end of same year the number of refugees in the EU was 6,570,500 (this figure does not include migration within the EU). 2 Nearly half of them are estimated to be women. Refugee women flee their countries due to war, abuse of their human rights, poverty and seek refuge in Europe. The common themes in millions of stories and different experiences are loss and violence: loss of loved ones, loss of freedom, status, social and cultural identity, loss of physical and mental health, loss of community and support networks. Refugee and asylum-seeking women and LGBTI people escape situations of abuse of their human rights (e.g., sexual torture, rape and other forms of gender-based violence). They are exposed to hardships and different types of extreme violence throughout the migration process and in the context of the destination countries. Although migration for women is more difficult due to their lack of means and traditional care duties, the number of refugee women is rising. The trauma generated by such experiences has long-lasting damaging effects on their lives, physical and mental health, and impedes their integration in the destination country. The fate of refugees in the EU often depends on the constellation of political parties and their attitude to the refugee question. An increasing number of Member States\u2019 governments either close their borders (Hungary 3 ) or are opposed to the EU relocation quotas (Hungary, Poland, Czechia and Slovakia) 4 . At the same time, the EU Member States, which serve as entry points (Italy, Greece, Malta, Spain), have been overwhelmed with the influx of refugees and unable to provide 1 Full study in English: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/691875/IPOL_STU(2021)691875_EN.pdf 2 UNHCR (2020) Global trends: Forced displacement in 2019.

(2021) Debordering and re-bordering in the refugee crisis: a case of \u2018defensive integration\u2019. Journal of European Public Policy . 28(3):331-349. This study was commissioned by the European Parliament\u2019s Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs at the request of the FEMM Committee. The study focuses on the trauma that refugee and asylum-seeking women suffer when reaching their host country. Drawing on an extensive survey of scientific literature, international organisations\u2019 reports, websites, press, and discussions with relevant experts, it highlights survivors' different needs and the structural, cultural and psychological barriers to their resettlement in the EU. It argues for coordinated, gender- and culture-sensitive policies, EU collective responsibility in managing the refugee crisis and multi-level interventions from an intersectionality perspective. ",
        "Executive summary - The traumas endured by refugee women and their consequences for integration and participation in the EU host country 2 adequate support measures. 5 The recent European Commission New Pact on Migration and Asylum does not seem that it is going to improve the situation, as shown in the sections 4.2 and 5.2 of this study. The \u2018refugee crisis\u2019 is instrumentalised by the media that portray refugees as \u2018illegal\u2019 and distinguish between regular and irregular ones for electoral purposes, thus rendering them prey to xenophobic rhetoric. Gender is a central dimension that merits attention. Women and the LGBTI community are more prone to be victims of violent incidents due to patriarchal structures, cultural factors, and their socio-economic status, while in their countries of origin, as well as during the migration journey and in the post-migration periods. Race, socio-economic status, and culture intersect with gender and lead to compound discrimination. An intersectionality approach , combined with feminist, trauma, and post-colonial analyses, will help understand and capture the multitude of effects traumatic experiences cause for refugee and asylum-seeking women. Health issues are part of the vulnerabilities of migrant populations because of diseases endemic in the countries of origin, inadequate health care received, and health complications during the migration journey, together with often insufficient health facilities in transit camps and accommodation centres. Besides, traumatic experiences at all migration stages exacerbate physical problems and cause many mental health issues, not least psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. 6 Psychotherapeutic interventions are usually based on European cultural elements and understanding of therapy and do not incorporate different senses of self. As a result, they often act as an impediment to refugee and asylum-seeking women\u2019s smooth adjustment to their new reality and acculturation process. Trauma is correlated with physical and psychological problems. Victims of sexual violence often flee their country of origin and seek refuge in the destination country. 7 Mental health issues (mainly PTSD, depression, and anxiety) act as significant barriers to seeking treatment, care and support. 8 Their increased vulnerabilities in the host country, often combined with structural impediments, such as lack of education and literacy, contribute to their poverty and isolation. 9 Recovery from trauma occurs within a social context that involves reconnection with family, and engagement in everyday, routine activities and integration into the local community. Gender inequalities and different women's expectations require gender-sensitive responses by the European Member States and all relevant authorities. 10 In the last decades, a growing body of research has investigated refugees' needs and informed policies designed to meet their needs in the EU Member States. A review of the literature shows that, despite the increasing number of studies, the approaches of data collection do not capture the different needs of refugee women or their diversity. Much more research into the intersectionality of refugee women\u2019s disadvantage must be complemented by gender-disaggregated data and more qualitative studies to reveal cultural differences toward effective policies and services. This study, through a survey of existing evidence (i.e., scientific literature, international organisations and NGO websites, statistics, press articles), seeks to: \u2022 better understand trauma (at all stages of the migration process) through an intersectional lens, and identify refugee and asylum-seeking women\u2019s and LGBTI people\u2019s needs and areas of intervention; \u2022 look into the interrelation of their lived experience with structural and cultural circumstances in the destination country, which often intensify their trauma and social disadvantage; and \u2022 highlight how policies can simultaneously address structural and cultural barriers, provide trauma relief, and facilitate smooth resettlement through gender-sensitive and multi-level approaches. 5 Robbers, G., Lazdane, G. and Sethi, D.

        "IPOL | Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs Evidence and best practices across the EU and other destination countries inform a set of policy recommendations to this end. More interdisciplinary research , both qualitative and quantitative, into the diverse and complex circumstances of refugee and asylum-seeking women and LGBTI people is required; standard definitions and gender-specific data collection methods throughout the EU should be the starting point of debate on the EU level. A holistic approach to addressing refugee women\u2019s needs i s a priority. Interventions must be multi-level and multi- phased both within the national and the EU context. They must target individuals and groups to improve their physical and mental health and address structural social, economic, and cultural impediments to integration. Interventions should draw on cultural diversity and harness cultural beliefs and attitudes to enhance healing potential. A better understanding of the specific nature of refugee women\u2019s lived experiences will lead to a more gender-sensitive policy design and services that meet their needs. Their experience, marked by the prevalence of gender-based violence, is different and must be acknowledged as such. Health and psychological support services should be integrated with housing, employment and education/training policies and welfare provisions to help refugee women regain their self-esteem, confidence, and optimism to make a new start. Granting asylum and facilitating integration helps coping with trauma experiences. Raising awareness of both the locals and the refugee and asylum-seeking women will promote a genuine cultural dialogue and lead to a mutually beneficial and harmonious co-existence . Policy-making should include bottom-up elements, (i.e., involve migrant women and girls) as well as relevant civil society organisations, all of which can provide useful input regarding migration, asylum and integration policies and risks. Coordination of all relevant stakeholders and strong political will are indispensable. Europe can be the safe haven where traumatised refugee and asylum-seeking women are offered opportunities to recover and thrive. Respecting and celebrating their differences, while building on their shared experiences and common goals through an honest cultural dialogue, refugee and European women can weave together a brighter future for all. .
