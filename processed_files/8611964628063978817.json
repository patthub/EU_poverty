        "Foreword Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 3 Foreword Competitiveness is underlying the priorities set by the President Junker for his mandate. Competitive economies allow high and sustainable growth to benefit the wellbeing of citizens. High-quality official statistics play a fundamental role for the assessment of the performance of European economies, enable to identify potential reform areas and to design and properly implement the reforms. The European Wheel of Competitiveness (EWoC) is the fruit of a close collaboration between Eurostat and the Joint Research Centre together with European Commission services working in the area of competitiveness analysis. It attempts to put together key data on the different aspects of competitiveness, going beyond its purely economic dimension. It is aimed at supporting competitiveness analysts in EU institutions or in Member States, but it is also relevant to others active in the field of competitiveness, in think tanks or academia. This paper is meant to be more than a mere statistical analysis: its ambition is to serve as a quality check of the EWoC design. The aim is to produce similar analyses prior to the launch of future projects or initiatives. It provides also evidence how inter-service collaboration, between Eurostat and the Joint Research Centre, can improve the quality of the results by reaping the benefits of bringing together statisticians and data scientists.

        "Abstract Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 4 Abstract This study aims to realize a statistical analysis of competitiveness in the EU-28 based on a statistical reference framework, previously defined as the European Wheel of Competitiveness. This framework comprises a list of 35 indicators (EWoC indicators) related to macroeconomics, microeconomics, globalization, environment and socio-institutional aspects. The analytical methods for this study were established in line with the Statistical reference framework for competitiveness analysis in the EU-28 Member States(1). As a rather broad concept, competitiveness can be described by a large set of different factors and definitions. The aim of this analysis is to show possible redundancy between indicators, but also possible explanatory power. Moreover, it tests the initial assumption that the largest principal components will be sufficient to explain the variability in the observed dataset. Finally, it detects possible patterns based on available set of indicators. Results confirmed some well-known correlations. For instance, the unemployment rate is positively correlated with the indicator People at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) , which is also negatively correlated with the Real GDP per capita. Nevertheless, the performed correlation analysis did not provide any substantial results regarding some other expected correlations. It has to be mentioned at this point that, the presence or the absence of correlation results between several indicators of the set of EWoC indicators, is a fact that should not be understand as a weakness of the EWoC framework but rather as a strength due to the fact that there is not redundant information. Exploring the high correlations between the aforementioned indicators and indicators by themselves, it was decided to control for the indicator 4. Concerning the results obtained with partial correlation analysis, it was evident that most of the previously captured correlation actually comes from the Gross domestic expenditure on R&D. More precisely, when controlling the correlation for the aforementioned indicator, the correlation across EWoC indicators becomes weaker or insignificant in almost all cases. For that reason, and other reasons detailed in the article, indicator 4 was not used for the latter analysis. Finally, the correlation analysis showed that indicator 34: Control of corruption could be also removed from the set of the EWoC indicators. The cross-correlation analysis explored time series correlation and showed that for the same pair of indicators, different or opposite correlation results can be obtained. This proved that countries may react differently and in several periods in time, to similar economic changes. This result provided the idea of countries clustering. In addition, obtained correlation coefficients vary from country to country. Therefore, it was of interest to look for the evidence of formation of groups of countries. In another words, the country-clusters. EU-28The performed analysis showed that the \u201cbig old\u201d EU Member States (France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy...) form a cluster while the Eastern EU countries, i.e. \u201cnewest\u201d Member States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia...) form a separate cluster. It is also noteworthy the fact that Luxembourg stands out as being very different, insofar as it forms its own cluster (Figure 1). The explored dataset consists of 29 indicators for time span 2000-2014. Therefore, it seemed logic to examine opportunities for the reduction of dimensionality or indicators` grouping. All analysis (Principal Components, k-means cluster analysis and Gaussian mixture model and the Hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis) showed that indicators, either as a component of one linear combination or as a member of one group, can be classified into 4 groups. It is noteworthy the fact that indicator 29: Real GDP per capita stands out as being different, insofar as it forms its own cluster. ( 1 ) Letizia Montinari, Soeren Lindner, Antonio F.

        "Introduction 1 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 9 This study provides a summary of the results( 4 ) of the statistical analysis of indicators of the European Wheel of Competitiveness using real EU-28 Member States data for period 2000-2014. The analytical methods for this study were established in line with the Statistical reference framework for competitiveness analysis in the EU-28 Member States ( 5 ) . As indicated in the aforementioned document, as a rather broad concept, competitiveness can be described by a large set of different factors and definitions. The aim of this analysis is to show possible redundancy between indicators, but also possible explanatory power. Moreover, it tests the initial assumption that the largest principal components will be sufficient to explain the variability in the observed dataset. Finally, it detects possible patterns based on available set of indicators. In line with the aforementioned analytical plan, this article starts with a data exploration phase which includes different correlation analysis (simple, partial and correlation for each dimension of competitiveness \u2013 subset of indicators listed at page 7. Correlation analysis is followed by the Cluster analysis (further in text \u2013 CA) of EU-28 Member States, as well including the examination of time series patterns. Then, a dimension reduction analysis is conducted, i.e. Principal Component Analysis (further in text \u2013 PCA) for each country group (and all EU-28 Member States) obtained under the PCA. Finally, different PCA are tested, in order to validate and reinforce the results. 1.1. Data and methods For the purpose of the multivariate statistical analysis of the set of EWoC indicators, a real EU-28 data for period 2000-2014 was used. Regarding the data sources, several official web-sites were used for the data collection \u2013 Eurostat, JRC, OECD and World Bank. Moreover, some indicators required statistical manipulations: for instance, indicator 32: Healthy life years at birth, by sex is summarised as a simple average of value for men and value for women for the same year. Although available, some indicators (e.g. indicator 8: Share of high-growth enterprises ) were excluded from the analysis due to big proportions of missing values. In addition, at the time when data was extracted, data was missing for indicators 18: Share of domestic value added generated in one country by the EU exports of all MS to the rest of the world , 21: Share of service value added content of EU exports of manufacturing goods , 24: Real unit energy cost and 26: Energy intensity by industry . Finally, 30 indicators and 28 countries were examined, in total. However, indicator 4: Gross domestic expenditure on R&D was used only for the Correlation analysis. For the latter analysis it was excluded from the initial dataset. Concerning the data quality, it is noteworthy to mention that data has missing values (more or less, depending on the indicator). Therefore, since some analysis are more sensitive on missing data, results must be taken with caution. For all analysis the statistical software SAS and/or Matlab are used. In addition, it was chosen the 95% or the 99% confidence interval ( \u03b1 =0.05 or \u03b1 =0.01). ( 4 ) The results shown in this article are related to the data extracted in September 2016.

        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 10 2.1. Correlation analysis This section aims to explore different linkages between indicators of the European Wheel of Competitiveness. Correlation analysis is useful because it can indicate a predictive relationship that can be exploited in practice. Nevertheless, this analysis did not go into possible causal relationships among them. 2.1.1. Simple correlation The most familiar measure of dependence between two variables is the Pearson's correlation coefficient 8 . If the variables are independent, Pearson's correlation coefficient is 0, but the converse is not true because the correlation coefficient detects only linear dependencies between two variables. More precisely, this coefficient measures the linear co-movement between pairs of variables giving a value between 1 and \u2212 1 inclusive, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and \u2212 1 is total negative linear correlation. The analysis first started with the exploration of the simple relations between the observed indicators using so- called simple correlation, where the evidence of well-known( 9 ) correlations is searched. Moreover, some other interesting relationships between indicators were observed . Table 1 displays significant correlations between indicators of the European Wheel of Competitiveness taking into account all EU-28 Member States( 10 ). Strong positive correlation (more precisely 0.987 ) was found between indicator 4: Gross domestic expenditure on R&D and indicator 10: R&D expenditure in the business sector (% of GDP). In addition, analysis showed that indicator 33: Government Effectiveness is strongly positively associated with indicator 34: Control of corruption ( 0.945 ). Figures 2 and 4 show the correlation results, in form of a scatter plot, for Gross domestic expenditure on R&D and R&D expenditure in the business sector and correlation results for Government Effectiveness and Control of corruption , respectively. The same figures show the strength and direction of correlation, taking into account all EU-28 Member States. ( 8 ) Pearson`s correlation coefficient (or simply correlation coefficient) is sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables (which may exist even if one is a nonlinear function of the other). Other correlation coefficients have been developed to be more robust than the Pearson correlation \u2013 that is, more sensitive to nonlinear relationships. ( 9 ) For instance, the well-known correlation is the one between GDP and income and labour productivity (strong and positive correlations). ( 10 ) The correlation table ( Table 1a ), which shows results for all the indicators of the European Wheel of Competitiveness, can be found in Annex. Statistical findings ",

        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 12 correlation, refers to the correlation between two time series shifted in time relative to one another. Cross- correlation is important in studying the relationship between time series for two reasons. First, one series may have a delayed response to the other series, or perhaps a delayed response to a common stimulus that affects both series. Second, the response of one series to the other series or an outside stimulus may be \u201csmeared\u201d in time, such that a stimulus restricted to one observation elicits a response at multiple observations.( 11 ) In each subfigure (referring to a EU-28 Member State) of the Figure 3, the horizontal black lines mark the upper 99% confidence level for significance of the cross-correlation results. The lags, from \u2013N to +N, where N is the number of observations, indicate the shift between the two time series representing the indicators 4 and 10 respectively. For example, at lag 0, the red bullet value indicates that the correlation between the two-time series is not shifted in time. At lag +1, the red value represents the correlation, when the vector of observations corresponding to the second variable, i.e. the indicator 10 is shifted one unit time forward to the one of the indicator 4. It can be remarked that, for almost all countries, at lag -3, a very high positive correlation exists between the indicators 4 and 10, which means that the indicator 4 is \u201cleading\u201d the indicator 10 over 3 units in time = 3 years( 12 ). In other words, the time series of the indicator 10, shifted backwards 3 units time and of the indicator 4, are very high correlated and they are moving in the same direction. Slightly different results can be remarked for Greece (EL) that has the same high positive correlation at lag -4 for the same indicators. Cyprus shows a different behaviour for the pair of indicators 4 and 10, since results show negative cross-correlation result at lag +3. Figure 5 shows positive cross-correlation results between indicators 33 and 34 at lag 0, for countries Denmark (DK), Spain (ES), Italy (IT), Latvia (LV), Hungary (HU), Austria (AT), Poland (PL), Slovakia (SK) and United Kingdom (UK) which means that the related indicators are moving in the same direction at the same time. Negative correlation results were observed for some countries at different lags, as follows: Belgium (BE) (lag -3), Ireland (IE) (lag +1), France (FR) (lag +1 and +2) and Luxemburg (LU) (lag -2).

Partial correlation for the indicator Gross domestic expenditure on R&D The partial correlation analysis, the same as simple, aims to measure the degree of association between two variables. However, in partial correlation, the effect of a controlling variable(s) is removed. In first instance, the linear correlation between many indicators was apparently significant and moderate or high. These findings did not go in a line with the initial hypothesis that each indicator brings some unique information regarding competitiveness. Exploring the high correlations between aforementioned indicators , it was decided to repeat the correlation analysis but this time controlling it for the indicator 4: Gross domestic expenditure on R&D and compare the results. To demonstrate the decision, a selection of empirical evidence and arguments is presented, using both the results from the previous analysis and the definitions of the listed indicators. Starting with the correlation, analysis showed that indicator 4 has correlation with 16 indicators amongst 3 with a high correlation, whereas the indicator 10 has correlation with 15 indicators amongst 2 with a high correlation (please see Table 2). More precisely, it was found that the indicator 4 is strongly correlated (more than 0.7) with three indicators (I23, I33 and I34), moderately correlated (between 0.5 and 0.7) with five indicators (I14, I15, I29, I30 and I35) and weakly correlated (between 0.3 and 0.5) with eight indicators (I2, I3, I9, I16, I17, I27, I28 and I31). The same correlation analysis for the indicator 10 showed that this one is strongly correlated with two indicators (I23 and I34), moderately correlated with seven indicators (I14, I15, I16, I29, I30, I33 and I35) and weakly correlated with six indicators (I2, I9, I17, I27, I28 and I31).

The ",
        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 15 argument here goes that many multivariate statistical analysis are sensitive on highly correlated data which can influence the results and lead to wrong assumptions and conclusions. Moreover, exploring the definitions and reasoning for each indicator, it was concluded that the similar information has been captured with both of them. More precisely, no meaningful information for the latter analysis will be lost by excluding indicator 4. Finally, to reinforce the decision of excluding the indicator 4, a comparison between the average( 13 ) values for each indicator by each country (see Figure 6) was done. The basic and simplified conclusion is that the ratio between the two indicators is very similar in all EU-28 Member States (average is 2:1). More precisely, in case of 23 Member States, the ratio is between 1.3:1 and 2.4:1. The biggest ratio has Cyprus (4.8:1). Figure 6: Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (MA4_4) over R&D expenditure in the business sector (% of GDP) (MI3_10), by each EU-28 Member State (Average for 2000-2014) Concerning the results obtained with the partial correlation analysis, it is evident that most of the previously captured correlation actually comes from the Gross domestic expenditure on R&D . More precisely, when controlling for the aforementioned indicator, the correlation becomes weaker or insignificant in almost all cases. Moreover, the correlation found initially between indicator I10 and the other indicators also disappeared. To demonstrate these findings, the Table 3 displays the partial correlation analysis results. Nevertheless, strong positive association between indicators I33 and I34, and the high correlations between Green gas emissions per capita (indicator I22) and real GDP per capita (indicator I29), remained. Moreover, the interesting and also expected correlations appeared between some other indicators. For instance, the positive correlation between the Unemployment rate (indicator I2) and people at risk of poverty (indicator I30)( 14 ) was remarked. ( 13 ) Average values refer to the average of time span 2000-2014 for each EU-28 Member State.

Cross-Correlation analysis by dimensions of competitiveness Taking into account the results of the correlation analysis, it was also examined how the leading indicator is linked with other indicators in its own dimension of competitiveness. In another words, the cross-correlation analysis was done for each group of indicators by selecting one representative indicator for each dimension \u2014 Macroeconomic, Microeconomic, Globalization, Environment and Socio-institutional. 2.1.3.1. MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS The ability of a country to raise its level of income and growth is typically measured by the evolution over time of its real gross domestic product. However, it is very important the way in which countries use the input factors. Having that in mind, in the group of macroeconomic indicators (listed in the introduction), indicator 5: Real labour productivity per hour worked (Sustainable Development Indicator), was selected as representative for its group. Since the analysis showed lack of significant correlation both with indicator I1: Real GDP growth rate (1 year % change) and with indicator I7: Gross fixed capital formation at market prices (% GDP) , the relative results will not be presented. In contrast, as shown in Figure 7, interesting cross-correlation results were found with indicator I2: Unemployment rate (3 year average) in different EU-28 Member States (red highlights the most relevant results). Similar results for each EU-28 Member State can be found in Annex ( Figure 7a ) (grey represent not very meaningful results). Let us recall the fact that the presented correlation results refer, in most cases, to the presence of correlation between several pair of indicators, but the presence or the absence of correlation should be taken as it is and not to be associated as positive or negative. It can be remarked, for countries like Spain (ES), Hungary (HU) and Portugal (PT), a high positive correlation for indicators I2 & I5 at lag 0, which means that these indicators are moving in the same direction at the same time. Moderate negative correlation can be seen for countries Czech Republic (CZ), Slovakia (SK), and Finland (FI) for lags -1( 15 ) and 0, which means that indicator I2 and indicator I5 have bigger similarity at lags -1 and 0. In other ( 15 ) One unit time = one year for the collected data. ",
        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 17 words, it can be considered that indicator I5 is correlated with the indicator I2 in approximately 1 year (due to the lag -1) or before (due to the correlation at lag 0). Figure 7: Cross-correlation results for Unemployment rate (3 year average) and Real labour productivity per hour worked, by EU-28 Member States (example of several EU-28 Member States with the most interesting findings) Figure 7a from Annex, for the same indicators, shows that particular cross-correlation results were found for countries like Greece (EL), Slovenia (SI) and United Kingdom (UK) which have positive moderate correlation for indicators I2 & I5, at lags -6 and -5, which can be interpreted as follows: real labour productivity per hour worked has a medium term correlation (5 to 6 years) with the unemployment rate. Similar cross-correlation results are shown in Annex (please see figures 7b, 7c, 7d), for the macroeconomic indicators I3: Real effective exchange rate (3 year % change) , indicator I4: Gross domestic expenditure on R&D and indicator I6: Nominal unit labour cost (3 year % change) , confronted with aforementioned indicator. Moreover, a negative moderate correlation between indicators I3: Real effective exchange rate and indicator I5: Real labour productivity per hour worked , for the following countries: Bulgaria (BG) and Lithuania (LT) at lag 0. Furthermore, it shows also negative correlation for Portugal (PT), Netherlands (NL), Hungary (HU) and Ireland (IE) at lag -2 and positive moderate correlation for Greece at lag 0 (please see Figure 7b ). In contrast, Figure 7c in Annex displays a high positive correlation between indicator I4 - Gross domestic expenditure on R&D and indicator I5, at lag 0, for the following countries: Germany (DE), Estonia (EE), Ireland (IE), Cyprus (CY), Hungary (HU) and Austria (AT). Similar results were obtained for Bulgaria (BG), Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Malta (MT), Poland (PL) and Portugal (PT). Finally, a moderate to high negative correlation results at lag 0, for indicators I6 and I5, for countries like: Czech Republic (CZ), Ireland (IE) and Slovenia (SI) and Spain (ES), Hungary (HU), Austria (AT), Portugal (PT), Romania (RO) and Slovakia (SK) can be seen in Figure 7d in Annex. High positive correlation results have also been found for Austria (AT) at lag 0. 2.1.3.2. MICROECONOMIC INDICATORS Competitiveness at the firm level is determined by a large set of factors affecting firms` performance and productivity where high-growth enterprises are considered to be a key driver of competitiveness. In the group of microeconomic indicators , explained below, the indicator 12: Private Sector Credit Flow (% of GDP) (MIP Indicator) was selected as representative for the group.

Similar results were found for Denmark (DK), Estonia (EE), Croatia (HR), France (FR), Greece (EL) and Finland (FI). Positive correlation was found for the same indicators at lag 0 and lag -1, for countries like Czech Republic (CZ) and Lithuania (LT), respectively. 2.1.3.3. GLOBALIZATION INDICATORS In the near past, export market shares (together with the current account balance) were considered as sufficient indicators for analysing a country`s competitiveness regarding its ability to conquer greater parts of the world trade market. The indicator I17: Export market shares (MIP Indicator) was selected as representative for the group. Analysis shows no significant correlation results with indicator I19: Exports of high technology products and with indicator I20: Global value chain participation index .

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS Policies used to improve countries` competitiveness are usually seen as a complement to actions which aim to promote environmentally oriented growth and to protect the nature. Hence, in the group of environment indicators , indicator 28: Implicit tax rate on energy (Sustainable Development Indicator) was selected as representative for the group. No significant correlation results were found with the indicator I23: Eco-innovation index . Results displayed in Figure 10a in Annex show that the cross-correlation was found for indicators I22: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita and leading indicator I28, with a red highlight for the most relevant results. Similar cross-correlation results were found for the environment indicator I25: Resource productivity and indicator I27: Share of environmental taxes in total tax revenue from taxes and social contributions , confronted with indicator I28 (please see Annex \u2013 Figure 10b and Figure 10c , respectively). Indicators I22 and I28 have negative high correlation at lag 0, for countries Greece (EL), Netherlands (NL), Hungary (HU), and Romania (RO), which means that the aforementioned indicators are moving at the same time in opposite direction for the listed countries.

Negative correlation results were remarked at lags -2 and 3 for Belgium (BE), Finland (FI) and United Kingdom (UK), respectively (please see Figure 10c in Annex). 2.1.3.5. SOCIO-INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS The competitiveness is not only affected by afore explained groups of indicators, but it is also affected by different social and institutional factors. For instance, income inequality, poverty and social exclusion, captured by GDP per capita, are considered to be both determinants and consequences of a lack of competitiveness. Thus, in the group of socio-institutional indicators , indicator I29: Real GDP per capita was selected as representative for the group. Analysis shows no significant correlation with indicator I32: Healthy life years at birth, by sex . As displayed in Figure 11a, the cross-correlation was found for indicator I35: Age population dependency and the leading indicator I29, with a red highlight for the most relevant results. Similar cross-correlation results are shown in Figure 11b, Figure 11c, Figure 11d and Figure 11e for socio-institutional indicators \u2013 I30: People at risk of poverty and social exclusion, I31: Tertiary educational attainment, I33: Government Effectiveness and I34: Control of corruption , confronted with indicator I29, respectively. All aforementioned figures can be found in Annex. As an example, Figure 11 shows that Germany (DE) and Romania (RO) have high positive correlation at lag 0. In contrast, Lithuania (LT) and Slovakia (SK) have negative correlation results at lag -1 and 0, respectively. To conclude, based on different correlation analysis, results show (in most cases) no significant or very strong linear relationships between indicators. Those statistical findings go in line with the initial assumption that each indicator brings some unique information regarding competitiveness. Moreover, results obtained with partial correlation analysis confirmed that most of the initially captured correlation, actually comes from the Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (indicator I4). More precisely, when controlling for the aforementioned indicator, the correlation becomes weaker or insignificant in almost all cases. Exploring the correlation results more in detail and explanations found in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2, indicator I4 was not considered for further analysis. The indicator Control of corruption I34 could be also considered to be excluded ",
        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 21 from the further analysis since the information that it provides is captured with indicator Government Effectiveness I33. However, for this article, indicator Control of corruption I34 was captured. Figure 11: Cross-correlation results for Age population dependency and Real GDP per capita, by EU- 28 Member States (example of several EU-28 Member States with the most interesting findings) 2.2. Statistical country-cluster mapping Exploring linkages between the observed indicators, some well-known correlations were confirmed. For example, it is evident that the unemployment rate is positively associated with the People at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) indicator or the fact that the AROPE indicator is negatively correlated with the Real GDP per capita. Moreover, analysis provided the well-known results, as for example, the positive association between aforementioned real GDP per capita and greenhouse gas emissions per capita. Nevertheless, the performed correlation analysis did not provide any substantial results regarding some other expected correlations. In addition, obtained correlation coefficients vary from country to country. Therefore, it was of interest to explore the visual data as the starting point in order to look for the evidence of formation of groups of countries, i.e. the country-clusters. Although time series plots can shed light on systematic trends or cycles over time, they can also show possible homogeneous trends across EU-28 Member States. In another words, it was interesting to test which countries are more similar to each other and which countries have different trends, with respect to the selected indicators. To demonstrate the approach, Figure 12 is given as an example. Results displayed in Figure 12 show the unemployment rate( 17 ) for several Member States \u2013 Belgium, France, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, confronted with the EU-28 aggregate, covering the period 2000-2014. It is evident that three (or even four) different patterns appear. For instance, Latvia and Lithuania had the stable unemployment rate during period 2000-2003. However, in 2004 they had significant drop. Furthermore, after 2008, the unemployment rate started to rise and reached its top in 2011 followed by a moderate decline in later years. In contrast, Greece and Spain had relatively stable unemployment rate in period ( 17 ) 3-year average ",
        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 22 2000-2008. However, after this period, the unemployment rate started to rise and reached its maximum in 2014. Other Member States \u2013 Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Sweden had a stable trend during observed period. This simplified analysis revealed a potential country grouping which might develop in a similar way in terms of competitiveness. Figure 12: The unemployment rate (3-year average) \u2013 indicator 2, 2000-2014 (example of several EU-28 Member States with the most interesting findings) After the literature review ( 18 ) and simple visual data inspections of many different indicators, it was decided to conduct the K-means correlation analysis, by pre-setting 5 groups of countries ( maxclusters =5). The conducted K-means cluster analysis refers to a statistical method used for classifying units (in this particular case \u2014 countries) into pre-defined number of groups. The aim of this analysis was to obtain the maximum countries\u2019 similarity within a group while having the countries in different groups as different as possible. The performed cluster analysis showed that \u201cold\u201d EU Member States (France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy...) form a cluster while the Eastern EU countries, i.e. \u201cnewest\u201d Member States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia...) form a separate cluster. It is also noteworthy the fact that Luxembourg stands out as being very different, insofar as it forms its own cluster. For the demonstration of results( 19 ) please have a look at Figure 13. ( 18 ) Innovation Clusters in Europe: A statistical analysis and overview of current policy support, European Commission - DG Enterprise and Industry; European Cluster Panorama 2014, European Commission - European Cluster Observatory; Strengthening Clusters and Competitiveness in Europe, Stockholm school of economics (Center for strategy and competitiveness) and Innovation clusters in the 10 new member states of the European Union, European Commission - DG Enterprise and Industry. ( 19 ) Although convergence criterion is satisfied and Approximate Expected Over-All R-Squared = 0.96099, obtained results need to be considered with caution due to type, size and quality of used data (correlation, missing values, etc.). Time series data are not independent but exhibit various degrees of autocorrelation which can bias correlations between countries. ",

Principal Component Analysis Principal Component Analysis (further in text PCA) represents one of the dimension reduction analysis and it is usually used as an intermediate step before conducting some other analysis \u2013 e.g. cluster analysis. In other words, it can be used as an indication for the number of clusters. By now, the analysis showed existence of medium and high correlation between different indicators . Moreover, it showed existence of similar countries with respect to the selected indicators. However, observed indicators relate to the same dimension and they do not provide any additional information that is not already covered by another indicator. This analysis aims to test if the largest principal components will be sufficient to explain the variability in the dataset. In other words, to use the set of the EWoC indicators, in order to find a few meaningful and empirically supported combination of these and to compute new variables, which are not correlated with each other and that may reduce the dimensionality of the data. It is of potential interest the result obtained in the previous analysis that some countries are more similar to each other but very different compared to the rest. Therefore, concerning the homogeneous trends across the EU-28 Member States, the PCA was conducted \u2013 first, for each group of countries and then, for all countries. Finally, the results were compared. This section provides a summary of the results showing how the selected indicators relate to each other. Nevertheless, concerning the results, it is also noteworthy to mention a potential weakness in using this analysis. For instance, it is up to analysts to consider if one or two main components are enough to explain the variability. More precisely, as all self-perceived interpretations of the results, this one is also by its very nature, subjective ( 20 ). The performed analysis did not deliver strong evidence for the existence of latent constructs, but it did show that the main principal components, emerged from the PCA, contain some interesting groups of indicators which differ for each country group. To demonstrate the results, the analysis for the fifth group of countries ( 21 ) (newest EU-28 Member States \u2013 Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) are presented. Table 4 displays the eigenvalues of the Correlation matrix for the aforementioned country group.

However, it is evident that with less components it can still be described the meaningful amount of the data variation. Therefore, simple visual data inspections was used as the starting point to look for the evidence of the optimal number of components. ( 20 ) In addition, it has to be taken into the consideration the type of the observed dataset (time series data, missing values, etc.). Therefore, this analysis is only seen as the intermediate step and finding should be taken with caution. ( 21 ) The results for all groups of indicators (except for Luxembourg) can be found in Annex under the section Principal Component Analysis. ",
        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 25 Figure 14 displays both Scree Plot and Variance explained (cumulative and proportion variance) for the aforementioned group of countries. Figure 14: Scree Plot and Variance Explained (5 th group - Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) Using the visual examination of results (Scree plot), 4 or 5 principal components can be chosen. Moreover, the maximum number of principal components should be 5 since the distance between 5 th and 6 th component is very small. Nevertheless, this argument is basic and simplified. Hence, a selection of other empirical evidence is presented, in order to choose the final number of principal components. Concerning the MINEIGEN criterion( 22 ) (please see again Table 4), only the first four components have eigenvalues greater than 1 (10.78, 9.34, 5.45 and 2.07, respectively), so these four should be retained. Moreover, the cumulative variance explained, with first four principal components, is around 95%. Finally, the content( 23 ) of each of four principal components with their effects (positive |+| and negative |\u2013|) is shown in Table 5, which displays the rotated factor pattern matrix. The database used for this analysis consists of 29 different indicators related to macroeconomics, microeconomics, globalisation, environment and socio-institutional aspects. It therefore seemed prudent to examine if the indicators belonging to one or two dimensions would be strongly on one axis (for example macroeconomics and/or microeconomics) and, for example, the environment and socio-institutional indicators strongly on the opposite axis. Concerning the country groups, the findings are slightly different. The main principal component, in case of observed group of countries( 24 ), is a mixture of all dimensions of competitiveness but it is mostly related to dynamics of gross fixed capital formation, effectiveness, control of corruption, net international investment position and similar. In contrast, third and fourth component primarily describe labour (employment, unemployment, age population dependency, labour productivity, labour cost).

Statistical indicators clustering One of the questions facing in this study is how to organize the set of indicators into meaningful groups. In another words, how to classify the set of EWoC indicators in a way that the degree of association between two objects is maximal if they belong to the same group, and minimal, otherwise. In addition, the final number of groups should be in line with the concept of competitiveness and indicators characteristics. Therefore, different cluster analysis were conducted to search for the formation of groups of indicators and to detect possible patterns between them. As aforementioned for the PCA, cluster analysis has similar weakness. For instance, it is up to analysts to define how many clusters should be created or how to classify the variables. More precisely, the interpretation of the ",
        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 29 results is also by its very nature, subjective. Although simplified argument, the PCA showed that indicators of the European Wheel of Competitiveness are not entirely independent of each other. Moreover, they showed that observed indicators can be classified in four or five groups, which can be used as an input for the Cluster analysis. To examine this assumption \u2013 existence of 4 or 5 groups of indicators, the K-means cluster analysis was conducted first, by pre-specifying 5 groups. Moreover, this assumption also goes in line with the dimensions of competitiveness since we assume the equal sizes of clusters as each dimension has the same number of indicators.( 25 ) However, to compare and have a complementary and general view on the results obtained by K-means cluster analysis, a benchmark on the available data was done using the Gaussian mixture model and the Hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis. More precisely, the Gaussian mixture models can be more appropriate to use than K-means clustering, if clusters have different sizes and correlation structures within them. In contrast, the Hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis was conducted as a starting point to look for the evidence of possible different formation of groups, e.g. to test the initial assumption regarding the number of clusters. 2.4.1. K-means cluster analysis Taking into account the preliminary results obtained with PCA, concerning the most appropriate (or most likely) number of clusters, we first applied K-means cluster technique pre-specifying k =5 \u2013 for all countries, for each group of countries and for each Member State. The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify the given set of the EWoC indicators through a certain number of clusters fixed a priori. The main idea is to define k centroids, one for each cluster. As indicated in the first part, this analysis assumes the equal size of clusters. Moreover, it is also noteworthy the fact that it is extremely sensitive to cluster centre initialization and sensitive to outliers. The K-means cluster analysis performed both for all countries and for each group of countries, did not deliver any strong evidence or meaningful results. Moreover, the cluster analysis performed for each country caught and explained, in average, only around 40% of variation. Nevertheless, the results for each country have more sense and provide some interesting findings. To demonstrate the results we show Table 7 (Annex) with all countries and classification of indicators for each of them. Moreover, countries are placed and visually grouped depending on the group they belong to. Concerning the number of clusters, although we specified five groups, it is evident that 4 groups are more realistic. In addition, it is of potential interest the fact that indicator 29: Real GDP per capita stands out as being very different, insofar as it forms its own cluster. Moreover, the similar issue is with indicator 28 but this vary from country to country. For instance, for newest Member States (country group 5) \u2013 Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, indicator 28: Implicit tax rate on energy is in a group with some other indicators. Although providing some interesting results, analysis is leading to various conclusions, difficult to interpret, when it comes to indicators grouping. Therefore, we present our approach which takes into consideration each Member State independently but also making a unique decision of grouping indicators that can be applied for all countries. The basic and simplified subjective decision is to choose 4 groups: Group 1. Indicators = 1 2 3 6 7 9 10 12 15 27 33 34 The following indicators can be added here: 13 16 17 19 22 Group 2. Indicators = 11 14 20 31 32 35 The following indicator can be added here: 30 Group 3. Indicators = 5 23 25 28 Group 4. Indicator = 29 ( 25 ) Please see again the list of the EWoC indicators at page 10. Each dimension of competitiveness \u2013 Macroeconomic, Microeconomic, Globalization, Environment and Socio-institutional, has seven representative indicators. ",
        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 30 As aforementioned, the results need to be taken with caution \u2013 due to missing values, data type, number of observations, explained variability and similar. Taking into account these preliminary findings, performed with K- means algorithm, it was remarked that, for each country, results have more sense and provide some interesting findings. The initial number of clusters, equal to five, was not the most appropriate and these findings were concluded with four clusters. This analysis was leading to various conclusions, difficult to interpret, when it comes to indicators grouping. In addition, it was related to each country and might be influenced by this hypothesis. Consequently, it was of interest to test a more general approach, using the amount of available data for all countries and see if these results are confirmed. The following two approaches (hierarchical agglomerative clustering and Gaussian mixture distribution) had as a purpose to confirm these results or give eventually a more general view on the available data. 2.4.2. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis Hierarchical clustering is a widely used data analysis tool that allows to build a binary tree of the data that successively merges similar groups of points( 26 ). Visualizing this tree provides a useful summary of the data. The hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis is a \"bottom up\" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy. In order to decide which clusters should be combined, a measure of dissimilarity between sets of observations is required. In most methods of hierarchical clustering, this is achieved by use of an appropriate metric (a measure of distance between pairs of observations), and a linkage criterion which specifies the dissimilarity of sets as a function of the pairwise distances of observations in the sets. The Mahalanobis distance has been used, which implies the calculation of the covariance matrix. The linkage criterion determines the distance between sets of observations. For this study, the Ward's criterion was used, which implies the decrease in variance for the cluster being merged.( 27 ) In other words, the Ward's minimum variance criterion minimizes the total within-cluster variance. The implementation of this method implies to find, at each step, the pair of clusters leading to minimum increase in total within-cluster variance after merging. Figure 17 shows that the indicator 29: Real GDP per capita forms its own group (Group 4), as obtained with previous analysis. Other group contains three components, i.e. indicators 5, 25 and 28, related to the productivity and innovation (Group 3). Group 2 has 6 indicators listed below, related to the business and population. Finally, Group 1 contains most of indicators of the European Wheel of Competitiveness. The formation of groups is listed below: Group 1. Indicators = 1 2 3 6 7 9 10 12 13 15 16 17 19 22 23 27 30 33 34 Group 2. Indicators = 11 14 20 31 32 35 Group 3. Indicators = 5 25 28 Group 4.

        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 31 Figure 17: Hierarchical agglomerative clustering for all data indicators Comparing these findings with those obtained for K-means clustering analysis, it has to be remarked that similar indicators groups are obtained except for one. Only the indicator 23 was migrating from the group 3 (first approach) to the group 1 (second approach). Figure 18 shows different relationships existing between indicators, grouped in the 4 previously presented groups, by using a dendrogram hierarchical binary cluster tree. The Ward error sum of squares hierarchical clustering method( 28 ) has been implemented for the results. The horizontal axis of the dendrogram represents the distance or dissimilarity between clusters. The vertical axis represents the objects, here indicators, and clusters. The dendrogram is fairly simple to interpret, since our main interest is in finding similarity and clustering. Each joining (fusion) of two clusters is represented on the graph by the splitting of a horizontal line into two horizontal lines. The horizontal position of the split, shown by the short vertical bar, gives the distance (dissimilarity) between the two clusters. Looking at this dendrogram, it can be remarked the four clusters as four branches that occur at about the same horizontal distance. The three pairs of outliers: 16 and 5, 6 and 14 are fused in rather arbitrarily at much higher distances. Then if the number of clusters is increased, indicators I25 and I28 tends to form their own group, separately, similarly like the indicator 29 does. Similar results have been obtained using different clustering analysis methods. ( 28 ) C. Fraley and A. E. Raftery (1998) How Many Clusters? Which Clustering Method?

Gaussian mixture model Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are often used for data clustering and they represent a probabilistic model that assumes that all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. One can think of mixture models as generalizing K-means clustering to incorporate information about the covariance structure of the data as well as the centres of the latent Gaussians. Moreover, the GMM clustering can accommodate clusters that have different sizes and correlation structures within them. Because of this, the GMM clustering can, in some cases, be more appropriate to use than, e.g. afore demonstrated K-means clustering. Like most clustering methods, analysts must specify the number of desired clusters before fitting the model. The number of clusters specifies the number of components in the GMM.( 29 ) For the GMMs, it is best practice to also consider the Component covariance structure. Analysts can specify diagonal or full covariance matrices, or whether all components have the same covariance matrix. The diagonal covariance structure was chosen for this study( 30 ) ,(31), (32) .

Given a collection of models for the data, the AIC and BIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. According to the AIC and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) values (minimum values are showing a good quality model), the best cluster modelling has 4 components and a diagonal, shared covariance matrix structure.( 33 ) The best GMM is the one providing minimum values for AIC and BIC. Thus, looking at these values in figures 19 and 20, the minimum value for AIC and BIC is for k = 4 clusters and for a full unshared covariance matrix.

        "Statistical findings 2 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 34 Secondly, analysts should consider the initial conditions. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm ( 34 ) fits the GMM. Like the K-means clustering algorithm, EM is sensitive to initial conditions and might converge to a local optimum. However, analysts can specify their own starting values for the parameters, specify initial cluster assignments for data points or let them be randomly chosen. This last case has been considered for this study.

This last approach confirms again the previous results, the number of clusters equals to four and also similar repartition of indicators into the four groups. ( 34 ) T.K. Moon (1996).

        "Conclusion 3 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 35 This article presents different multivariate statistical analysis on indicators of the European Wheel of Competitiveness where the time horizon for the analysis covers the period 2000-2014. First, some widely known or strongly suspected economic relationships between these indicators were confirmed. This first result came in contradiction with the initial hypothesis, that each of proposed indicators brings some unique information regarding competitiveness. For instance, a strong positive correlation was found between indicator 4: Gross domestic expenditure on R&D and indicator 10: R&D expenditure in the business sector. In other words, the two indicators bring similar competitiveness information. Moreover, the associations between indicator 4 and indicator 10, confronted with other indicators, were significant too. With respect to the results, it was decided to explore the partial correlations analysis between the aforementioned indicators with the rest of listed indicators. Interestingly, the results obtained with partial correlation analysis, indicated that the most of the previously captured correlation actually comes from the Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (indicator 4). More precisely, the correlation becomes weaker or insignificant in almost all cases when performing the partial correlation controlling it for indicator 4. Associated with the aforementioned findings and other substantial empirical analysis, this indicator was not considered for the latter analysis. In the same line, the correlation analysis showed that indicator 34: Control of corruption could be also removed from the set of the European Wheel of Competitiveness indicators, since is highly correlated with the indicator 33: Government effectiveness and its information is included in the information provided by the Government effectiveness. This analysis was followed by the cross-correlation analysis exploring the time series correlations and showed that the association between the same pair of indicators, can diverse across observed countries and it can be different for the full sample of the EU-28 Member States. Those results provided the idea of countries clustering, performed afterwards. With respect to aforementioned findings, analysis regarding countries clustering suggested that each obtained group of the EU-28 Member States develops in a similar way in terms of competiveness and that Luxembourg stands out as being very different compared to the other countries. Given the variety of indicators included in this analysis, an important hypothesis explored in this article was to show a possible redundancy between indicators and possible explanatory power. Within this context, it seemed logic to examine the reduction of dimensionality by using the Principal Component Analysis. This statistical analysis tested the initial assumption that the largest principal components will be sufficient to explain the variability in the observed dataset. The results, obtained with the Principal Component analysis, for each group of countries and then for all countries, showed that it would be sufficient to explain the substantial amount of the variability (around 75%) by using only two principal components. Although the performed analysis did not deliver strong evidence for the existence of latent constructs, it did show that the main principal components contain some interesting groups of indicators. Conclusions ",
        "Conclusion 3 Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 36 In addition, another aim of the study was to detect some possible patterns emerged from analysing the available set of indicators: the indicators grouping. All analysis showed that indicators, either as a component of one linear combination or as a member of one group, can be classified into 4 groups. It is also noteworthy the fact that indicator 29: Real GDP per capita stands out as being very different, insofar as it forms its own cluster. Initially, the K-means cluster analysis (pre-specifying 5 groups) was conducted. Even though providing some interesting results, this first analysis was leading to various conclusions, difficult to interpret, when it comes to indicators grouping.

Consequently, it was of interest to test a more general approach, using the amount of available data for all countries and see if these first results are confirmed. The following two approaches - hierarchical agglomerative clustering and Gaussian mixture distribution, confirmed that similar patterns are emerging and completed the general view on the available data. The number of indicators clusters was calculated by using two statistical criterions: AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion). Associated with the above presented results, it can be concluded that the correlation between many indicators, after removing the effect of indicator 4, is insignificant or small. Moreover, indicators can be classified into 4 groups of different sizes but with the interesting contents. In addition, analysis showed the existence of homogeneous groups of EU-28 Member States which develop in a similar way in terms of competitiveness. All of this suggests that, despite the fact that indicators 4 and 34 could be removed from the set and that some of data were missing when analysis was conducted, the chosen set of the EWoC indicators is adequate for the analysis of competitiveness.

        "Annexes Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness 57 Table 7 represents the K-means cluster analysis output run for each Member State separately. As indicated in the section 2.4.1, the average coughed and explained variability in each country is around 40%. The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify the given set of the EWoC indicators through a certain number of clusters fixed a priori. In this particular case \u2013 5 groups. To demonstrate the results, each indicator has the number of a cluster where it belongs (for each Member State). Moreover, each cluster is represented by different colour to make easier interpretation of the results (visual presentation). Finally, Member States are placed in a way that Member States which belong to the same country group (obtained in section 2.2) are next to each other and visually separated by red line from other countries/groups. Results show that in all cases (i.e. for all EU-28 Member States), indicator 29: Real GDP per capita forms its own cluster. Concerning other indicators, indicator 28: Implicit tax rate on energy has similar issues as indicator 29 (forms its own group). However, that is not the case for all country groups. For instance, for country group 5 (newest Member States), indicator 28 forms a group with other indicators \u2013 5, 23 and 25 (in most cases). In general, it can be concluded that all countries have more or less, a similar formation of groups. Moreover, the country group 4 (Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands and Sweden) is the most homogeneous group compare to the other groups of countries. Finally, as indicated in the section 2.4, cluster analysis has some weaknesses. For instance, it is up to analysts to define how many clusters should be created or how to classify the variables. More precisely, the interpretation of the results is by its very nature, subjective. ",

        "M a i n t i t l e 2 017 e d i t i o n Data analytics: European Wheel of Competitiveness Competitiveness is a multifaceted concept. This study realizes a quality control of the design of the European Wheel of Competitiveness (EWoC) by means of statistical analysis. Results disregard the existence of redundant indicators and confirm that they present different aspects of competitiveness that are not just explained just by the Gross Domestic Product per capita. The paper also identifies country-clusters across the EU-28 Member States and groups of indicators. A cross-correlation analysis of the time series was also performed to test how countries react differently to similar economic changes.
