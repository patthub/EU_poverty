        "4 SURVEY REPORT - IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ERASMUS+ CBHE PROJECTS 1. INTRODUCTION EACEA Unit A4 carried out a survey to examine how the capacity building in higher education (CBHE) projects and higher education institutions in partner and programme countries have adapted their means of working and cooperation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The main findings are : \u2023 Institutions quickly had to put in place COVID-19 policies and deal with a range of challenges . \u2023 Project implementation has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Uncertainty was and continues to be the main challenge to project implementation. \u2023 Overall, the impact of the pandemic has been mainly on activities such as project meetings, budget, dissemination activities, and the implementation or piloting of the courses and/or the study visits. \u2023 The pandemic affected communication between the partners and forced projects to find new means of cooperation . \u2023 Staff members needed support from their managers, clear directions, as well as technical support . \u2023 Students\u2019 involvement has been affected in most of the projects, given that mobility exercises have either been delayed or changed to online training or blended learning. \u2023 Collaboration with external stakeholders such as public authorities and enterprises has been affected in a large number of projects. \u2023 Some projects took the challenge of the pandemic as an opportunity to improve certain areas which were not initially within the projects\u2019 scope , such as the development of digital competences and the use of IT tools within the consortium. \u2023 Overall, the partnerships have reacted very well to the challenges of the pandemic and have made considerable efforts to adapt quickly to the new situation. \u2023 The pandemic brought opportunities for change and innovation , and the institutions can benefit from the new possibilities that arise. \u2023 Despite the challenges encountered, the projects found many positive elements in the new ways of working, and may keep these positive elements in the future. 1.

        "5 SURVEY REPORT - IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ERASMUS+ CBHE PROJECTS TITLE 2. AIM 3. METHODOLOGY The aim of this study is to share the main challenges encountered, and provide recommendations on how to face them in future, drawing on the experience and best practices adopted by many CBHE projects. This study provides higher education institutions with deeper insight into current challenges, experiences and alternative ways to deal with the pandemic crisis. This may serve to raise more awareness and understanding within higher education institutions on topics such as how to support the staff in implementing international projects in times of crisis. Furthermore, sharing experiences of the ongoing projects provides other projects with new insights and ideas on how to deal with issues they encounter in the implementation of their projects. In December 2020, Unit A4 of EACEA launched a survey to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the implementation of Erasmus+ Capacity Building in Higher Education (CBHE) projects. The survey was sent to 456 project coordinators from three different project generations, namely 146 projects from 2017, 147 from 2018 and 163 from 2019. The survey covered all the Regions participating in the CBHE action : Western Balkans, Eastern Partnership, Southern Mediterranean, Central Asia, Russia, Latin America, Asia, Africa, Caribbean and Pacific region (ACP), South Africa and Iran / Iraq / Yemen. Out of the 456 questionnaires sent, 395 replies were received, representing an answer rate of 87% . The survey focused on the following main categories of questions : \u2023 To what extent have the projects been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic ? What has changed and what are the consequences of these changes ? \u2023 How have the projects adapted to the new circumstances? What are the lessons learned ? \u2023 To what extent do the projects expect these changes to remain in place after the pandemic is over ? The survey has highlighted the challenges faced by most of the projects and the measures adopted by the consortia to overcome them. The survey has also shown that some of the new working methods have had positive effects, and that in some cases, the projects would be keen to keep using these methods in future. 2. AIM - 3.

        "6 SURVEY REPORT - IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ERASMUS+ CBHE PROJECTS 4. FINDINGS 4. FINDINGS The findings of this study are presented in three parts. The first part refers to challenges and the impact of COVID-19 on project implementation, including challenges for receiving accreditation, project duration, budgetary issues, implementation of activities in Partner Countries, and student involvement and learning etc. The second part focuses on the how COVID-19 has impacted cooperation between partners and other stakeholders involved in supporting the CBHE projects. The third part focuses on examples of good practices and underlines the need to share these. It also highlights some positive changes that could be continued after the pandemic is over. 4.1 How COVID-1P impacted the in the project implementation This part examines how higher education institutions have adapted their activities and working methods to the pandemic. The survey revealed that almost 60% of projects were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in their implementation phase. Uncertainty was and continues to be the main challenge to project implementation. Under these circumstances the partnership has proven to be optimistic, flexible and proactive, which has been helpful in dealing with the challenges to their work during the pandemic. An optimistic mindset as well as a willingness to be flexible helped to adapt more quickly to an unknown situation. Overall, the main impact of COVID has been on activities such as project meetings, the budget, dissemination activities, the implementation of piloting of the courses, and/or the study visits. However, some projects have indicated that the impact has been low to moderate. This can be explained because some of the 2017 generation of projects were almost closed by the time the pandemic started and the main activities had already been implemented. Consequently, the highest impact is seen on projects which are in the mid-term of their implementation , which means projects that started in 2018 and 2019.

FINDINGS The detailed analysis of the areas most affected by the pandemic shows that, unsurprisingly, the impact is highest in the activities that mostly involve mobility, such as the planned trainings and study visits (72%). These activities have often been moved online or been postponed for later implementation. The implementation of the work programme was also significantly affected (66%) and there have been general delays in the timelines of various activities, such as delays in the purchase and delivery of equipment. There is also evidence of an increased additional managerial workload and administrative burden, with re-scheduling of project activities, requests for project extensions, and intense communication with project partners etc. On the other hand, those activities which in normal circumstances would take place remotely have been able to continue more or less normally. Here we refer to preparatory activities, such as desk surveys and comparative studies, as well as quality assurance activities. \u2022 Areas of implementation most impacted In order to face the current challenges and make progress in their implementation, all projects have converted planned activities into online activities . The crisis has put the project managers and the project partners on a steep learning curve regarding the use of digital and education technology both for project management as well as for teaching. In fact, while the pandemic has been a challenge, it has also been an opportunity to improve the partners\u2019 education technology and digital tools. The survey has shown that projects have shifted nearly all the consortium and management meetings online . In particular, there is evidence that most of the CBHE projects starting in 2020 organised their kick-off meetings online.

        "8 SURVEY REPORT - IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ERASMUS+ CBHE PROJECTS Moreover, a significant number of training courses, study visits, piloting of courses and dissemination events were also transformed into online activities. For dissemination , projects started using more online dissemination channels and social media. The projects that were finalised in 2020 organised their final dissemination events online, when feasible. Main recommendations \u2794 Review your work plan and start with the activities that can be done online : Given that the projects were operating in completely new circumstances, it is very important to review the work plan and to decide which activities can be done online and which have to be postponed. Given the current uncertainty, we recommend that you review at least the work plan of the first year of project implementation. \u2794 Develop better digital tools : As the survey has shown, this crisis is also an opportunity to develop better digital tools to communicate, to disseminate information or to organise online events and training. These tools can continue to be used afterwards and can deliver efficiency gains. 4. FINDINGS The survey has shown that projects have shifted nearly all the consortium and management meetings online .

FINDINGS \u2022 Challenges faced by the Partner Countries Partner Country institutions have faced a number of significant challenges during the pandemic. The survey shows that CBHE projects in all Regions have been affected. The greatest difficulties were in the following areas : \u2023 Dissemination of project results \u2023 Teaching online in terms of the new modules or programmes developed \u2023 Access to online activities (for instance courses, training\u2026) \u2023 Communication within the project consortia Main recommendations In order to support partner institutions in the Partner Countries, the consortium should : \u2794 Communicate clearly, share information and promote mutual trust between the partners The survey has shown that one of the key aspects for coping with COVID-19-related challenges is to communicate well between the partners of the consortium . It is essential that regular communication take place between the partners from the very start of the project. In fact, the experience during the pandemic has demonstrated that the partnership can react very well to the new challenges if each partner has a clear understanding of the modifications to be carried out in the work plan and the changes needed in the nature of the activities. This will enable the consortium to adapt better to the current circumstances and to be more flexible towards the changes required. https://www.pexels.com/it-it/foto/persone-vicino-al-tavolo-3184639/ \u2022 Challenges faced by the Partner Countries Partner Country institutions have faced a number of significant challenges during the pandemic.

The budget heading \u2018 Staff costs \u2019 has also been affected as staff from partner universities have devoted more time to organisation of online activities, the revision of the work plan, and on communicating with project partners. Main recommendations \u2794 For projects that have started recently, do not request amendments for the budget at this stage but rather use the 10% flexibility between the budget headings.

The pandemic has also affected students\u2019 involvement , as in most of the projects mobility activities have either been delayed or changed into online training or blended learning. Some projects have pointed out challenges in persuading the students to reply to student surveys because it is more difficult to encourage student participation when the students are off the campuses. The survey has shown that the start of the course implementation has been delayed in 28% of the cases. At the same time, new ways of teaching and learning have been introduced in 26% of the projects. Main recommendations \u2794 Keep students well informed of the changes that have taken place so that they can still be involved in the project activities. \u2794 Carry out regular surveys of students to assess whether the new methods of teaching and learning are appreciated and appropriate, and whether the students are able to access the online activities easily. \u2794 When revising your work plan, take into account the delays in starting the implementation of the new study programmes and modules developed. 4.

In particular, the pandemic affected communication between the partners and forced the projects to find new means of cooperation . Participants have different perspectives on how communication has been affected during the pandemic. Some argue that communication has been hindered while others argue that it has improved. Due to the absence of face-to-face contact, they feel they need to put more effort into meetings. There is also a sense that during the pandemic people are more reachable because they are constantly online, which has improved communication. The feedback from the projects indicates that face-to-face meetings, in particular at the beginning of the projects, increase mutual trust and improve the sharing of tacit knowledge, which are important elements in creating a conducive environment for innovation. In this sense, some projects considered that the capacity to innovate has been affected. However, as the projects progress and virtual meetings become the new way of working, the capacity to innovate may be rediscovered. All project partners, both in the Programme and in the Partner Countries, started working from home, and all teaching staff had to make a sudden and radical shift to online and blended teaching. This resulted in a higher workload for all staff members involved. This shift was more challenging in the Partner Countries, where connectivity and reliable internet access is lower than in the Programme Countries. Moreover, very often teachers and students do not have all the required IT tools at their disposal. 4. FINDINGS 4.2.

For instance, a large number of projects demonstrated a high level of flexibility in adopting alternative working methods , which is essential for adapting to the new implementation methods necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2023 Moreover, some projects took the challenge of the pandemic as an opportunity to improve some areas in ways that were not initially anticipated : For instance : \u25cf Many projects decided to include more external stakeholders in their online activities. \u25cf Other projects took the opportunity to develop digital competences and improve the use of IT tools within the consortium. Main recommendations \u2794 Show flexibility and make contingency plans to cope with uncertainty. The current crisis shows that it is necessary to be flexible, have contingency plans and be ready to carry out the activities despite uncertainty. \u2794 Consider the current challenges as potential opportunities to improve aspects of your project. 4.

In fact, a large number of projects underlined that they would be in favour of keeping : \u2023 Online management meetings (35%) and consortium meetings (25%) : The consortia concluded that they can organise meetings more frequently online and in many cases these are more efficient. As a result, communication between partners is more regular and useful. \u2023 Online dissemination events : Online events can potentially reach more people, more stakeholders and increase the impact that the project has in the countries concerned. Main recommendations \u2794 Find out about activities that have been successfully organised online and that you could replicate in the future when the pandemic is over. This could enable you to have a better mix of virtual and face-to-face activities and to manage the timing and the budget of your project in a more efficient manner. 4.

        "23 SURVEY REPORT - IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ERASMUS+ CBHE PROJECTS TITLE The EU cooperation policy with ACP countries primarily aims to reduce poverty in the Region. It also contributes to other international priorities such as sustainable economic, social and environmental development, respect for human rights, promotion of democracy, rule of law and good governance. This is in accordance with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Within this context, the CBHE 2016 projects have promoted higher education exchanges and cooperation between the EU and ACP countries contributing to the establishing of several regional university partnerships and collaborative networks as well as mutually beneficial linkages in learning and teaching and, by extension, making a strong contribution to the evolution of the regional higher education area. A first analysis of a small sample of 2016 project reports - most of which are still ongoing - has shown that CBHE projects play an important role in the support and development of education systems in the Partner Countries. The higher education sector is a driving force for the economy and society as a whole and the role of the CBHE action is important as it has a long-term structural effect on the Partner Countries. A number of best practice examples show in an impressive way the benefits that CBHE projects can have on educational systems, HE institutions and individuals (academics, administrative university staff, and students). However, the impact of the CBHE action can be further improved by looking at the challenges that were identified via the sample of final project reports and the monitoring activities (desk monitoring, monitoring missions, cluster meetings) conducted by the Agency. Some of the challenges refer to the CBHE action as a whole, others specifically to the ACP region and in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa. 6.1. Challenges \u2022 The CBHE action has a large number of recurrent beneficiaries , both institutions and individuals. In the long term, this leads to a lack of innovative and creative project ideas (and few new collaborations) and diminishes the impact of the CBHE action in the Region. \u2022 The Region is relatively new to the programme and the Partner Country HEIs do not yet have sufficient knowledge of the EU financial regulations and experience of international project management in order to take a lead and coordinate projects. \u2022 The success rate of the projects to be funded in the calls is around 15% and the quality of proposals in increasing yearly. This means that the funding is not sufficient for the interest shown in the Region. For the same reason, there is not very widespread knowledge of the existence of this programme and its provision of funding opportunities across the ACP Region. \u2022 The unit costs for travelling should be revised in order to be closer to the real costs. In particular, in Sub-Saharan Africa, Caribbean and Pacific, the flight prices are very expensive, and do not reflect the unit costs . \u2022 Internationalisation strategies in HEIs are often absent or insufficiently developed. The creation of project consortia often lack a long-term strategic vision for the development of the HEIs, and proposals are developed because of existing or recurrent collaborations. \u2022 The large maximum grant amount of EUR 1 million sometimes leads to \u2018inflated\u2019 project budgets and lowers cost efficiency of project activities. In terms of staff costs, we observed that individual ",

        "Erasmus+ Capacity Building in Higher Education (CBHE) action Survey Report Impact of COVID-19 on the implementation of Erasmus+ CBHE projects Resume The publication analyzes the outcomes of a survey carried out by EACEA Unit A4 on how the capacity building in higher education (CBHE) projects and higher education institutions in partner and programme countries have adapted their means of working and cooperation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its aim is to share the main challenges encountered, and provide recommendations on how to face them in future, drawing on the experience and best practices adopted by many CBHE projects. The findings are presented in three parts. The first part refers to challenges and the impact of COVID-19 on project implementation, including challenges for receiving accreditation, project duration, budgetary issues, implementation of activities in Partner Countries, and student involvement and learning. The second part focuses on the how COVID-19 has impacted cooperation between partners and other stakeholders involved in supporting the CBHE projects. The third part focuses on examples of good practices and underlines the need to share these. It also highlights some positive changes that could be continued after the pandemic is over.
