        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons and objectives This proposal is made in the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021- 2027 as outlined in the communication \u2018A modern Budget for a Union that Protects, Empowers and Defends \u2013 The Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027\u2019 1 from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. The communication sets the main priorities and overall budgetary framework for EU external action programmes under the heading \u2018Neighbourhood and the World\u2019. The European Instrument for Nuclear Safety complements this framework with activities to be carried out within the framework of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom Treaty). The objective of the new European Instrument for Nuclear Safety is to promote the establishment of effective and efficient nuclear safety standards in third countries in accordance with Article 203 of Euratom Treaty, building on the experience of nuclear safety activities within the Euratom Community. The non-proliferation regime has been challenged in recent years and calls for a continuous support to strengthen the international framework to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. This is the primary role of the safeguards of nuclear materials which aims at preventing and detecting the diversion of nuclear materials. Moreover, under different association and partnership agreement (e.g. with Ukraine), the Union has committed to support the concerned countries in adopting in their national legislation the acquis communautaire , including nuclear safeguards. Under the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, a financing instrument which will expire on 31 December 2020 was dedicated to the promotion of a high level of nuclear safety (Regulation (EURATOM) 237/2014 establishing the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation). In line with the Communication \u2018A new, modern Multiannual Financial Framework for a European Union that delivers efficiently on its priorities post-2020\u2019 2 and as concluded in the impact assessment 3 that accompanies this Regulation, most instruments should be streamlined into one broad instrument. Parts of nuclear safety cooperation activities currently covered by the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation may not fall under a streamlined broad instrument, since they need to follow the specific procedure of Article 203 of Euratom Treaty which is incompatible with the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) procedure based on Articles 209 and 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Recent reviews and evaluations 4 of the external instruments have shown the added value and relevance of the existing instruments. However, they have also highlighted opportunities for improvements, in particular the need to simplify ways of working and to enable the EU to respond to unforeseen circumstances with greater flexibility. The lessons learned taken 1 COM (2018) 321 final 2 COM/2018/092 final 3 SWD (2018) 337. 4 https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/mid-term-review-report-external-financing-instruments_en ",
        "EN 2 EN together with the growing challenges have prompted the Commission to modify the architecture of the external financing instruments to the extent possible. This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2021 and is presented for a Union of 27 Member States, in line with the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to withdraw from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community based on Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union received by the European Council on 29 March 2017. \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions This proposal provides an enabling framework through which external action policies and international obligations can be implemented. \u2022 Consistency with other Union policies When implementing this Regulation, consistency with other areas of external action and with other relevant EU policies will be ensured. As reflected in the 2030 Agenda, this means taking into account the impact of all policies on sustainable development at all levels \u2014 nationally, within the EU, in other countries and at global level. Moreover, synergies with actions under other EU programmes should be sought, in order to maximise the impact of combined interventions. Interactions and complementarity with such programmes should allow for an enhanced Union impact. Actions funded under this proposal should be consistent and complementary to those carried out under the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument 5 covering nuclear activities, the Instrument for Pre-Accession III 6 , the Decision on Overseas Countries and Territories 7 , the common foreign and security policy and the newly proposed European Peace Facility 8 which is financed outside the EU budget. 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Legal basis This proposal is based on Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. \u2022 Subsidiarity The Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (\u201cthe Community\u201d) are together in a unique position to deliver external assistance for a number of reasons. Their status as a supranational entity brings with it political influence and consequent leverage. The Community has a global presence through its Union delegations, which ensures a vast network of information on developments affecting countries worldwide. The EU and the Community are also parties to most multilateral processes aiming at addressing global 5 Regulation COM(2018)460 final Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument. 6 COM (2018) 465 final Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA III). 7 COM(2018) 461 final Proposal for a Council Decision on the Association of the Overseas Countries and Territories with the European Union including relations between the European Union on the one hand, and Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark on the other ('Overseas Association Decision'). 8 C(2018) 3800 final Proposal of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to the Council for a Council Decision establishing a European Peace Facility.

        "EN 3 EN challenges. This allows the EU and the Community to be constantly aware of new needs and problems and, therefore, to reallocate resources accordingly. Complementarities at the level of the Community and the Union action and the actions carried out by the Member States are increasing. This enhances dialogue and cooperation with partner countries, which is increasingly channelled through joint programming with Member States. The Union and the Community are also able to complement Member States activities in dealing with potentially dangerous situations or in the event of particularly costly interventions. In some areas where Member States are not active, the Union and the Community remain the main, and sometimes the only, actors to intervene. The subsidiarity related to nuclear safety and nuclear safeguards activities is referred to in the Euratom Treaty and in particular in the furtherance of the objectives contained in Title Two Chapters 3 and 7 thereof. The Community also pursues close cooperation, in accordance with Chapter 10, with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in this specific area. The EU and the Community have significant expertise in this field originating from the history of Europe itself, building on its own safeguard activities within the Union, and from successful policies. It has a recognised international reputation in the area of the nuclear safety and nuclear safeguards of nuclear materials in particular through its role in implementing safeguards in the EU and in supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency. The EU and the Community can provide added value based on the volume of resources channelled through its instruments, its relatively flexible modes of management and the predictability of resources over the period of the Multi-annual Financial Framework. \u2022 Proportionality In line with the principle of proportionality, the proposed Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives. \u2022 Choice of the instrument One of the objectives of the Euratom Treaty is to attain a high level of nuclear safety in the Union. This should also be achieved outside of the Union. Since the Euratom Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, on the basis of Article 203, appropriate measures must be taken. The proposal takes the form of a Regulation, ensuring its uniform application, binding nature in its entirety and direct applicability. 3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \u2022 Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation The mid-term review report 9 adopted by the Commission on ten of the external financing instruments 10 , the ex post evaluation reports on macro-financial assistance and the mid-term 9 The mid-term review report COM(2017) 720 final, was based on ten staff working documents, one per instrument (see list below), which in turn were based on ten independent evaluations. The mid-term report, the staff working documents and the independent evaluations can be found at here: https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/public-consultation-external-financing-instruments-european-union_en ",
        "EN 4 EN review on the European Investment Bank external lending mandate 11 all concluded that the external financing instruments were, overall, fit for purpose and that positive trends were emerging in relation to the achievement of objectives. The reports show that more resources are needed for external financing instruments because they have been stretched to their financial limit. The instruments set the scope, objectives and procedures for implementing the policies. The mid-term review report has shown that their enabling nature allows them to cover most needs and goals of EU and Community external action. They would benefit from better reflecting a number of developments such as: the new policy framework including the universal coverage of the 2030 Agenda and the external projection of internal policies. In addition, more consideration needs to be given to the links between development and security and the overall level of ambition for peace and security in external action. Consistency is needed between an instrument's component parts, between different instruments and with donors. Overall, the mid-term review report notes mixed findings on coherence. In terms of coherence within the instruments, the findings were satisfactory. There was a certain level of consistency between the instruments but the multiplicity of programmes sometimes led to overlapping actions, in particular complex cooperation with more advanced developing countries. In addition, the interplay between geographic and thematic approaches sometimes resulted in inconsistent responses at country level. \u2022 Stakeholder consultations When drafting the evaluation documents that fed into the mid-term review report, three types of consultations with stakeholders were held. Evaluators carried out some one thousand structured or semi-structured interviews with EU officials and representatives from EU institutions, Member States and partner countries. Several technical workshops were held to present and discuss the draft evaluations with participants from the European Parliament, Council working groups, Member States committees, and civil society organisations and local authorities. An open public consultation was held in 2017 12 . It aimed at gathering feedback from stakeholders on the findings emerging from the evaluations of the instruments and on the future external financing instruments after 2020 13 . The main messages emerging from the stakeholders consulted are summarised below. Flexibility: Stakeholders agreed that the new financing instruments should be more flexible in responding to unforeseeable challenges and crises. In particular, they underlined the need to make it easier to shift funds across regions and between aid modalities. However, it was also underlined that increasing flexibility should not come at the cost of less predictability, weaker country ownership and less focus on achieving long-term development objectives. To ensure flexibility and predictability, some respondents argued in favour of having sufficient reserves. Coherence: Stakeholders considered it necessary to ensure greater consistency between the internal and external policies of the EU, and between the external instruments themselves. 10 The 10 instruments were the: Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI); European Development Fund (EDF); European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI); Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA II); Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP); European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR); Partnership Instrument (PI); Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation (INSC); Greenland Decision (GD); and Common Implementing Regulation (CIR). 11 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016DC0584 12 https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/public-consultation-external-financing-instruments-european-union_en 13 For more information on the public consultation see https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/public-consultation- external-financing-instruments-european-union_en ",
        "EN 5 EN Some emphasised the need to strengthen complementarity and synergy between geographical and thematic instruments. Others argued that the Sustainable Development Goals provide the most appropriate basis for increasing consistency between internal and external policies. Most recommended that the EU take a leading role in improving complementarity between various stakeholders, both inside and outside the EU. Some respondents highlighted the risk of overlap whereby the same policy objectives are funded by multiple instruments. Respondents also called for clear delineation of instruments, while underlining the need to ensure that geographic and thematic programmes take advantage of cross-sectoral synergies and linkages between them. Complementarity: On the structure of future instruments, stakeholders agreed that combining geographic and thematic programmes brings positive results. They emphasised that the value of geographically structured instruments lies in their capacity to address the specific needs of partner countries in a tailored manner. This is crucial given the diversity of the challenges and needs across these countries. Global, targeted interventions offered by instruments such as the Partnership Instrument and the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace was also appreciated by stakeholders. Simplification: The EU was strongly encouraged to further simplify the overall architecture of the instruments. The EU should also continue its efforts to simplify cumbersome administrative and financial procedures. Civil society and local authorities emphasised that procedures and rules currently in place have important implications for their ability to become more involved in development cooperation. Leverage: Stakeholders agreed that innovative financial instruments can play an important role in leveraging public and private financing for EU external assistance. The positive findings on the leverage effects and financial additionality of such instruments in the recent evaluation on blending 14 are considered encouraging. However, civil society respondents raised concerns about private sector priorities overriding poverty reduction objectives in partner countries. Since nuclear safety, including safeguards fall under the Euratom Treaty, this proposal cannot respond to the concerns expressed by stakeholders. Nevertheless coherence and complementarity with the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument which responds to the main concerns raised by stakeholders will be ensured, including by implementing activities in the nuclear field that are ancillary to its broader objectives, mainly peaceful uses of nuclear energy in line with the development and international cooperation policy for health, agriculture, industry and social projects addressing the consequences of any nuclear accident. \u2022 External expertise The mid-term review report and associated staff working documents were largely based on a set of independent evaluation reports conducted between 2016 and 2017 (one evaluation per instrument). At the same time, an independent report was also produced on the set of external action instruments covered by the mid-term review report, drawing key lessons and messages from them 15 . 14 See https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/evaluation-blending_en 15 See https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/public-consultation-external-financing-instruments-european- union_en ",
        "EN 6 EN Beyond these recent reports, the OECD Development Assistance Committee peer review of the EU\u2019s development cooperation in 2012 16 came up with a set of recommendations with regard to the architecture, rules and procedures of the Union's external financing instruments. For example, the OECD called on the EU to further simplify and modernise cooperation, by reducing the number of budget items, aligning the rules of the Development Cooperation Instrument and European Development Fund, streamlining approval procedures and increasing consistency between regional and thematic programmes. The EU was asked to become more effective, timely and flexible both at programme level and across the set of instruments. The latter was particularly sought after in situations of fragility and crisis, in which the OECD saw significant room for improvement. \u2022 Impact assessment In 2018 the Commission carried out an impact assessment 17 covering the external action heading \u2018Global Europe\u2019 under the 2014-2020 Multi-annual Financial Framework focusing on the major changes proposed for external action, including streamlining several instruments into one broad instrument and the integration of the activities currently financed by the European Development Fund into the EU budget. The impact assessment also concluded that most instruments aside from those with a very specific nature such as humanitarian aid with its principle of neutrality could be merged in one instrument, namely: the Common Implementing Regulation, Development Cooperation Instrument, European Development Fund, European Fund for Sustainable Development, External Lending Mandate, European Neighbourhood Instrument, European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, Guarantee Fund, Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace, Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation 18 and Partnership Instrument. Those instruments that should remain separate are: the instrument for pre-accession assistance; humanitarian aid; the common foreign and security policy budget; overseas countries and territories including Greenland; the EU\u2019s Union Civil Protection Mechanism; the EU aid volunteers scheme; support for the Turkish Cypriot community; the Emergency Aid Reserve; and the new European Peace Facility. As noted by the Commission 19 and supported by feedback from partners during the open public consultation, the current architecture of the external financing instruments is too complex. Streamlining a number of instruments into one broad instrument would provide an opportunity to rationalise their management and oversight systems and so reduce the administrative burden for all stakeholders. Having a simplified oversight system would allow the relevant institutions to have a better, more comprehensive view of the EU\u2019s external expenditure. A broad instrument would provide a more geographically and thematically comprehensive approach, facilitating the implementation of different policies in a trans-regional, multi- sectoral and global way. The EU would facilitate coherent responses and synergies, breaking down thematic and geographic silos. 16 http://www.oecd.org/dac/peer- reviews/europeanunion2012dacpeerreviewmainfindingsandrecommendations.htm 17 SWD (2018) 337.

        "EN 7 EN On 25 April 2018, the impact assessment was examined by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board and received a positive opinion with reservations 20 on the understanding that the assessment should be adjusted in order to integrate the Board\u2019s recommendations on certain aspects. As a result, the assessment was revised to: \u2013 provide more information on the governance structure of the new instrument, including information on decision-making procedures; \u2013 further explain several funding issues, including the funding baseline, the ring- fencing for regions and thematic areas and the contribution key of Member States to the European Development Fund; and \u2013 elaborate how the future monitoring and evaluation systems would work. The Board\u2019s opinion and the associated modifications made to the impact assessment are further described in annex 1 of the impact assessment. \u2022 Simplification A priority for the Commission across the Multiannual Financial Framework is to simplify its regulatory environment. Streamlining a number of instruments within one broad instrument will provide an opportunity to rationalise management and oversight systems, and so reduce the administrative burden for EU institutions and Member States. Instead of focusing on multiple programming processes, debates would be more focused on political objectives and engagement with external partners. In addition, actions that receive cumulative funding from different Union programmes shall be audited only once, covering all involved programmes and their respective applicable rules. Nuclear activities will therefore be part of the new NDICI and only the nuclear safety activities that require a specific Euratom legal base will be under the present instrument, implemented in full coherence with the NDICI. In terms of aligning rules, incorporating provisions from the Common Implementing Regulation will give the new instrument a coherent set of principles across all its component parts and will make it easier to understand for partners and implementing agents. These are either recalled or adapted to this regulation which retains references to the NDICI for a coherent and simplified approach. \u2022 Fundamental rights The EU is founded on a strong engagement to promote and protect fundamental rights, human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It actively supports these rights and principles within its borders, but also when engaging in relations with third countries. 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS In its Communication of 2 May 2018 21 , the European Commission proposed to allocate EUR 89 500 000 000 (in current prices) to the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument 2021-2027, of which 300 000 000 (in current prices) will be allocated to this Instrument to complement nuclear activities that fall under the Euratom Treaty. 20 Placeholder 21 COM (2018) 321, 2.5.2018 ",
        "EN 8 EN 5. OTHER ELEMENTS \u2022 Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements The Commission will regularly monitor its actions and review progress made towards delivering results. In line with paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Inter-institutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 22 , where the three institutions confirmed that evaluations of existing legislation and policy should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action, the Commission will carry out an interim and a final evaluation. The evaluations will assess the instrument\u2019s effects on the ground based on the relevant indicators and an analysis of the degree to which the instrument can be deemed relevant, effective, efficient, provides enough EU added value and is coherent with other EU policies. The evaluations will include lessons learned to identify any problems or potential to further improve the actions or their results and to help maximise their impact. The conclusions of the evaluations accompanied by observations will be communicated to the Council and the European Parliament. Progress will be monitored on the basis of indicators aligned with the objectives of the proposal. From 2022 onwards, the Commission will send the European Parliament and the Council an annual report on the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation. Evaluations will be carried out in a timely manner to feed into the decision-making process. \u2022 Geographic scope and participation of third countries The proposed Regulation has a worldwide geographic scope. As regards the choice of partners outside the Union, the Commission may decide to work with international organisations, partner countries or entities from other third countries under indirect management for the implementation of a specific action, when this is in the interest of the Union and of the objectives of such action, and subject to the rules and conditions laid down in the Financial Regulation. This choice would require a Commission decision. \u2022 Provisions of the proposal TITLE I: GENERAL PROVISIONS TITLE II \u2013 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INSTRUMENT TITLE III - FINAL PROVISIONS 22 Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016; OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1\u201314.

(8) The implementation of this Regulation should be based on consultation, where relevant, with the relevant authorities of the Member States, and on a dialogue with the partner countries. (9) Whenever possible and appropriate, the results of the Community's external action should be monitored and assessed on the basis of pre-defined, transparent, country- specific and measurable indicators, adapted to the specificities and objectives of the Instrument and preferably based on the results framework of the partner country. (10) The Union and the Community should seek the most efficient use of available resources in order to optimise the impact of their external action. That should be achieved through coherence and complementarity between the Union's external financing instruments, as well as the creation of synergies with other Union policies and Programmes. In order to maximise the impact of combined interventions to achieve a common objective, this Regulation should allow for the combination of funding with other Union Programmes, as long as the contributions do not cover the same costs.

(13) Horizontal financial rules adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Article 106(a) of the Euratom Treaty and Article 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should apply to this Regulation. These rules are laid down in the Financial Regulation and determine in particular the procedure for establishing and implementing the budget through grants, procurement, prizes, indirect implementation, financial assistance, budget support, trust funds, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees, and provide for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 106(a) of the Euratom Treaty and Article 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU also concern the protection of the Union's budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in Member States and third countries, as the respect for the rule of law is essential for sound financial management and effective EU funding.

Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.4.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative The aim of this Regulation is to complement those nuclear cooperation activities that are financed under [the Regulation NDICI], in particular in order to support the promotion of a high level of nuclear safety, radiation protection, and the application of effective and efficient safeguards of nuclear materials in third countries, building on the activities within the Community and in line with the provisions of this Regulation. 1.4.2. Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone. The EU and the Community have significant expertise in this field originating from the history of Europe itself, building on its own safeguard activities within the Union, and from successful policies. It has a recognised international reputation in the area of the nuclear safety, including safeguards of nuclear materials in particular through its role in implementing safeguards in the EU and in supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency. The EU and the Community can provide added value based on the volume of resources channelled through its instruments, its relatively flexible modes of management and the predictability of resources over the period of the Multi-annual Financial Framework. 34 As referred to in Article 58(2)(a) or (b) of the Financial Regulation.

        "EN 2 EN 1.4.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past The mid-term review report 35 adopted by the Commission on ten of the external financing instruments 36 , the ex post evaluation reports on macro-financial assistance and the mid-term review on the European Investment Bank external lending mandate 37 all concluded that the external financing instruments were, overall, fit for purpose and that positive trends were emerging in relation to the achievement of objectives. The reports show that more resources are needed for external financing instruments because they have been stretched to their financial limit. The instruments set the scope, objectives and procedures to allow implementation of the policies. The mid-term review report has shown that their enabling nature allows them to cover most needs and goals of EU external action. They would benefit from better reflecting a number of developments such as: the new policy framework including the universal coverage of the 2030 Agenda, the migration/refugee crisis, and the external projection of internal policies. The mid-term review report points to positive trends emerging in relation to achieving results. However, difficulties in measuring achievements were noted. There was often limited information on monitoring systems referred to in the instruments. There was a lack of data (including baselines) to measure if the instruments were on track to meet some of their objectives (particularly the high- level ones), and an understanding that many external factors (e.g. partner country policies and other donors) influence achievement of the objectives. While overall organisational performance was found to be efficient, some actors considered that the implementation of some instruments was administratively burdensome. At times the Commission was perceived to be more focused on process rather than on policy objectives and results. 1.4.4. Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments When implementing this Regulation, consistency with other areas of external action and with other relevant EU policies will be ensured, together with policy coherence for development 38 . As incorporated in the 2030 Agenda, this means taking into account the impact of all policies on sustainable development at all levels \u2014 nationally, within the EU, in other countries and at global level. Moreover, synergies with actions under other EU programmes should be sought, in order to maximise the impact of combined interventions. Actions funded under this proposal should be coherent and complementary to those carried out under the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument, the Instrument for Pre-Accession III, the Decision on Overseas Countries 35 The mid-term review report COM(2017) 720 final, was based on ten staff working documents, one per instrument (see list below), which in turn were based on ten independent evaluations.

        "EN 5 EN 2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules Specify frequency and conditions. The Commission's monitoring and evaluation systems are increasingly focused on results. They involve internal staff as well as implementing partners and external expertise. Task Managers in Delegations and Headquarters continuously monitor the implementation of projects and programmes, using the information provided by implementing partners as part of their regular reporting and including wherever possible through field visits. Internal monitoring provides valuable information on progress; it helps managers to identify actual and potential bottlenecks, and to take corrective action. In addition, external independent experts are contracted to assess the performance of EU external actions through three different systems. These assessments contribute to accountability, and to the improvement of ongoing interventions; they also draw lessons from past experience to inform future policies and actions. Such systems generally use the internationally recognised Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's evaluation criteria including (potential) impact. For instance, for development cooperation, at the project level, the Headquarters-managed Results Oriented Monitoring (ROM) system provides a brief, focused snapshot of the quality of a sample of interventions. Using a very structured, standardised methodology, independent ROM experts assess the performance of the project across the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's evaluation criteria and give recommendations on how to improve future implementation. Project-level evaluations, which are mainly managed by the EU delegation in charge of the project, deliver a more detailed, in-depth analysis and help project managers to improve ongoing interventions and prepare future ones. External, independent experts with thematic and geographic expertise are hired to conduct the analysis and gather feedback and evidence from all stakeholders, in particular the final beneficiaries. The Commission also conducts strategic evaluations of its policies, from programming and strategy to the implementation of interventions in a specific sector (such as health or education), in a country or region, or of a specific Instrument. These evaluations are an important input for the formulation of policies and the design of instruments and projects. These evaluations are all published on the Commission's website and a summary of the findings is included in the Annual Report to the Council and the European Parliament. 2.2. Management and control system(s) 2.2.1. Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed Management modes Regarding the management modes, there are no fundamental changes foreseen and the experience acquired by the Commission services and implementing actors under the predecessor programmes will contribute to better results in the future. Partner countries are still adjusting to the existing legislative framework and the ",
        "EN 6 EN implementation for INSC programmes is still in an early stage; as a result a maximum of continuity should be secured. The actions to be financed under this Regulation will be implemented under direct management by the Commission from headquarters and/or through the Union delegations and under indirect management by any of the entities listed in article 62(1) c) of the new Financial Regulation in order to better achieve the objectives of the Regulation. Concerning indirect management, as stated in Article 154 of the new Financial Regulation, such entities must ensure a level of protection of the EU\u2019s financial interests equivalent to the one under direct management. An ex ante pillar assessment of the entities' systems and procedures will be carried out, in accordance with the principle of proportionality and with due consideration for the nature of the action and the financial risks involved. Where the implementation requires so or there have been reservations expressed in Annual Activities Reports, action plans with specific mitigation measures will be defined and implemented. Besides, appropriate supervisory measures imposed by the Commission may accompany the implementation. The Instrument envisages that indirect management may also be entrusted to partner countries or the bodies they designate. Such partner country indirect management may take the form of various degrees of delegation: partial delegation whereby the Commission retains ex ante control over the partner country\u2019s decisions and executes payments on behalf of the partner country which by virtue of article 154(6)(b) of the new Financial Regulation does not require an ex ante pillar assessment. Or full delegation whereby, after an ex ante pillar assessment, the partner country can implement the action using its own assessed systems and procedures, with no ex ante control from the Commission on the partner country\u2019s implementation of the action. Internal Control architecture The internal control / management process is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with the relevant legislative and procedural framework. Effectiveness and efficiency To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations (and to mitigate the high level of risk in its external assistance environment), in addition to all the elements of the Commission wide Strategic Policy and Planning process, internal audit environment and other requirements of the Commission's Internal Control Framework, the implementing services will continue to have a tailored aid management framework in operation under all its instruments which will include: \u2013 A devolved management of the majority of external assistance by Union delegations in the field. \u2013 Clear and formalised lines of financial accountability (from the Delegated Authorising officer (Director General)) by means of a sub-delegation from the Sub- delegated Authorising Officer (Director) at headquarters to the Head of Delegation; \u2013 Regular reporting from Union delegations to headquarters (External Assistance Management Reports) including an annual Statement of Assurance by the Head of Delegation; ",
        "EN 7 EN \u2013 Provision of a substantial programme of training for staff both at headquarters and in delegations, \u2013 Significant headquarters/delegation support and guidance (including via internet); \u2013 Regular supervision visits to delegations every 3 to 6 years; \u2013 A project and programme cycle management methodology including: quality support tools for the design of the intervention, its delivery method, financing mechanism, management system, assessment and selection of any implementing partners, etc.; programme and project management, monitoring and reporting tools for effective implementation including regular external on-the-spot monitoring of projects; and significant evaluation and audit components. Simplifications will be sought by extending the use of simplified cost options and cross-reliance on audit work of partner organisations. There will be a continuation of a risk-differentiated controls approach in accordance with the underlying risks. Financial Reporting and Accounting The implementing services will continue to pursue the highest standards of accounting and financial reporting using the Commission's accruals based accounting system (ABAC) as well as external aid specific tools such as the Common Relex Information System (CRIS) and its successor (OPSYS). In relation to compliance with the relevant legislative and procedural framework, compliance control methods are set out in section 2.3 (measures to prevent fraud and irregularities). 2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them The operational environment of cooperation under this instrument is characterised by the risks of not achieving the instrument's objectives, suboptimal financial management and/or of not complying with the applicable rules (legality and regularity errors) related to: \u2013 economic/political instability and/or natural disaster that may lead to difficulties and delays in the design and implementation of interventions, particularly in fragile states; \u2013 lack of institutional and administrative capacity in partner countries that may lead to difficulties and delays in the design and implementation of interventions; \u2013 geographically dispersed projects and programmes (covering approximately many states/territories/regions) may pose logistical/resource challenges to monitoring - particularly any 'on-the-spot' follow-up of activities; \u2013 diversity of potential partners / beneficiaries with their diverse internal control structures and capacities can fragment and therefore reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of the Commission's available resources to support and monitor implementation; \u2013 poor quality and quantity of available data on the outcomes and impact of external assistance implementation in partner countries may hinder the Commission's ability to report on and be accountable for results. ",
        "EN 8 EN 2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of \"control costs \u00f7 value of the related funds managed\"), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) The internal control/management cost represent approximately 4 % of the estimated annual average of \u20ac 12.78 billion planned for the overall (operational + administrative) commitments on the expenditure portfolio financed by the General Budget of the EU and the European Development Fund for the period 2021-2027. This cost of control calculation refers only to the costs of the Commission, excluding Member States or entrusted entities. Entrusted entities can withhold up to 7 % for the administration of funds, which could partially be used for control purposes. These management costs take into account all staff at headquarters and in delegations, infrastructure, travel, training, monitoring, evaluation and audit contracts (including those launched by beneficiaries). The management / operational activities ratio could be reduced over time under the improved and simplified arrangements of the new instrument, building on changes to be introduced by the new Financial Regulation. The key benefits of these management costs are realised in terms of meeting policy objectives, efficient and effective use of resources, and the exercise of robust cost-effective preventative measures and other checks to ensure the legal and regular use of funds. While improvements in the nature and targeting of management activities and compliance checks in relation to the portfolio will continue to be pursued, these costs are globally necessary to effectively and efficiently achieve the objectives of the instruments at a minimal risk of non compliance (below 2% residual error). They are significantly less than risks involved in removing or scaling back internal controls in this high risk area. Expected level of risk of non-compliance with applicable rules The compliance objective for the Instrument is to maintain the historic level of risk of non-compliance (error rate) which is an overall residual 'net' level of error (on a multi-annual basis after all planned controls and corrections have been executed on closed contracts) of less than 2%. This has traditionally implied an estimated error range of 2-5% in terms of an annual randomised sample of transactions undertaken by the European Court of Auditors for the purposes of the annual Statement of Assurance (DAS). The Commission considers this to be the lowest risk of non- compliance achievable in relation to its high-risk environment and taking into account the administrative burden and necessary cost effectiveness of compliance controls. Where weaknesses are identified, targeted corrective measures will be implemented in the light of ensuring minimum error rates. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy. Given the high risk environment, the systems need to anticipate a significant occurrence of potential compliance errors (irregularities) in transactions and build in a high level of prevention, detection and correction controls as early as possible in the payment process.
