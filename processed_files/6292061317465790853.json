        "1 1. OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION The aim of this evaluation has been to explore the impact of the CAP measures towards the CAP general objective of ensuring a viable food production (VFP) with a focus on farm income, price stability and competitiveness of the agricultural sector. Besides examining the effectiveness, the efficiency and the relevance, the evaluation has also addressed the coherence and the EU added value of the relevant CAP measures with respect to achieving the general objective. The geographical scope of the analysis is EU28. The evaluation covers the period from 2015, starting date of implementation of the 2014-2020 CAP (2014 for the market measures under the Common Market Organisation). In order to clearly identify the effects of the policy changes, by comparing the pre- and post- CAP reform periods, longer observation periods were taken into account according to the needs of the analysis. 2. METHODOLOGY Considering the complexity and the wide range of topics under evaluation, the methodological approach combines empirical analysis, via quantitative methods and modelling, with qualitative analysis based on information and points of views from stakeholders and agents operating in the farm sector 1 and in the supply chains gathered in ten Case studies Member States. The quantitative assessment uses standard statistical approaches. The level of the analysis (regional level and farm level), the time period and the geographical coverage are, however, different according to the evaluation questions. The analysis at regional level are based on Eurostat and Clearance of Audit Trail System (CATS) data, while the analysis at farm level are based on a constant sample 2 of individual farms from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) in the years 2013 and 2015. Econometric models at farm level are used to distinguish the net income effects of decoupled direct payments, coupled direct payments, EAFRD annual payments and EAFRD support to farm investments. A prospective analysis simulating the full implementation of the new direct payments system in 2019 integrates the analysis. 3. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Before illustrating the main findings, it is important to recall that the results of the analyses may be influenced by the following elements: \uf0a7 the first year of implementation of the CAP is 2015 and, accordingly, the period of analysis of the effects of the CAP measures is of one and/or two years depending on the data source. Thus, the effects of the policy changes are not straightforward distinguishable from the effects of other variables. \uf0a7 the launching of the new CAP coincides with other events having an influence on producers choices and making the net effects of the 2013 reform less evident, in particular: the sharp decrease of the main agricultural commodities world prices (2013-2015); the introduction of import restrictions on a range of EU agricultural products by the Russian Federation in 2014; the end of the milk quota system in 2015. 3.1. EFFECTS OF THE CAP MEASURES ADDRESSING VIABLE FOOD PRODUCTION ON FARMS INCOME \uf079 FARMS INCOME LEVEL AND STABILITY During the analysed period (2010-2015), the CAP measures addressing viable food production have strongly supported farm income. At EU level, in 2015 the share of CAP support on farm income is 34,5% 3 and in particular direct payments account for around 27%. Compared to the period pre-reform (average 2010-2014), in 2015 most countries showed an increase in the contribution of direct payments to farm income particularly relevant in some Member States (Cyprus, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, Finland, Latvia, Germany and Slovakia) 4 . No Member State shows a significant decrease. Compared to the pre-reform period (average 2010-2014), income has risen after the CAP reform in about half of the Member States and decreased in the remaining countries. A substantial reduction is observed in 1 i.e. national authorities, national paying agencies, managing RD authorities, agricultural producers' unions, agricultural cooperative unions, producer organisations, national processing industry unions. 2 i.e. a sample consisting of the same farms in the two analysed years. 3 Source: Eurostat EAA, Labour Statistics and CATS database. 4 It should be stressed that the analysis using CATS data can not include complementary national direct payments (CNDP) and transitional national aid for farmers. Transitional aid is a successor of CNDP and are not considered direct payment (see DG AGRI, December 2017 \u2013 Report on the implementation of direct payment). ",
        "2 Denmark and Germany resulting from a relevant decrease of income per unit of land not compensated (Denmark) or only partly compensated (Germany) by an increase of the amount of land by unit of labour. Conversely, in Bulgaria and Romania farm income increased because the reduction of labour has more than compensated the reduction of income per unit of land . However, the evolution of income in 2015 only partially depends on policy changes. The evolution of income is rather due to: i) the evolution of the amount of labour used in agriculture (i.e. structural change) and ii) market conditions: the evolution of farm income is largely influenced by the evolution of agricultural prices, particularly negative from 2010-14 to 2015, especially for milk and cereals. A further investigation reveals that direct income support, being relatively stable over time and not correlated with the evolution of agricultural markets, allows farmers to better cope with the negative income effects caused by drops in agricultural prices. Indeed, the analysis of the effects of direct payments on income variability confirms that direct payments contribute to the stability of farms income (in absence of CAP support, income instability would increase). Besides, the income stabilizing effect of direct payments is correlated with their relative importance on average farm income and therefore it differs in magnitude among EU countries. The econometric approach (regression models developed on 2015 individual farm data used to estimate the net effect of coupled and decoupled direct payments and of EAFRD support on farm income level) shows that CAP support provided to farms by annual payments has a net positive impact on farm income. In particular, coupled and decoupled direct payments contribute to support farm income: the estimated coefficients of both payments are positive and the estimated coefficients of decoupled payments are greater than those of coupled payments. This is in line with the literature on transfer efficiency of policy support that often reports that decoupled support, regardless of its absolute amount, has a high transfer efficiency. Moreover, models highlight that farm investment support under rural development policy has an indirect and positive effect on farm income through increasing the relative amount of capital available within the farm. Considering the gradual implementation of some measures over time, the extent of the effects of the current CAP on farm income level cannot be completely measured at present. Thus, the analysis has been integrated with a prospective approach simulating the full implementation of the new direct payments system in 2019. Income levels have been estimated, for each farm, by applying to the 2015 income net of CAP support the measures and mechanisms foreseen when the reform will be fully implemented, as defined by Regulation (EU) 1307/2013. All other elements were kept constant at the 2015 level (including output values and labour use). The prospective analysis shows that most of the changes in the unitary level of direct payments and farm income foreseen by 2019 would be the result of the external convergence mechanism. In particular, the increase of national ceilings would result in a significant rise in income level for Latvia, Croatia, Lithuania and Estonia and, to a lesser extent, for Bulgaria. In other EU countries (mainly EU15) the negative impact of external convergence appears to be small in terms of reduction of support and even more in terms of income level. In the countries that applied the historical SPS model in the past and opted for the partial convergence through the tunnel model, the changes foreseen in 2019 resulting from the internal convergence mechanism would result in a shift of resources between sectors, with differentiated but limited income effects at regional level. Moreover the analysis shows that income between 2013 and 2015 is increasing more in small farms compared with large farms and the results of the prospective analysis reveal that the full implementation of the reform is expected to further increase the level of direct payments in small farms more than in large farms. \uf079 EFFECTS OF THE 2013 CAP REFORM ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF DIRECT INCOME SUPPORT External convergence appears to be effective in shifting direct income support towards farms in Member States with lower levels of support per unit of land than the EU average, reducing the disparity among Member States. The simulation of the evolution of the national ceilings foreseen in the coming years carried out at Member State level shows that the disparities of the average level of direct payment support per unit of land among EU countries will decline by almost 20% from 2014 to 2020 at EU28 level. In the Member States that, before the reform, used to grant direct payments based on the SPS historical model, internal convergence is effective in reducing the disparity of the basic payment (BPS). The results of the ",
        "3 prospective analysis reveal that this reduction will continue in the Member States that decided to gradually move towards a flat rate and to partial convergence in 2019 5 . In Member States applying the SAPS, the disparity of the amount of direct payments per unit of land increased between 2013 and 2015. This result must be contextualized considering that: i) these countries had very low levels of disparity in the pre-reform condition (SAPS Member States applied already a national flat rate per hectare before the 2013 reform, i.e. all farms received almost the same amount of direct support per ha); ii) with the 2013 CAP reform, many Member States applying the SAPS introduced the voluntary coupled support (differing according to the sector) which resulted in a differentiation of the average level of support per hectare among farms; iii) the level of disparity reached in 2015 by Member States applying the SAPS is similar in magnitude to that observed in Member States implementing the BPS. Indeed, Member States applying BPS already granted coupled direct payments before the reform and, in these countries, the internal convergence mechanism is generating a reduction of the disparity of the value of the payment entitlements of direct payment. Nevertheless, the shift of direct income support caused by the internal convergence mechanism and other measures, is found to have no relevant impact on the concentration of direct income support. Only within a few Member States the reduction of payments, particularly the capping of BPS/SAPS, has played a role in reducing the concentration of direct income support. However, it is not possible to identify such correlation in all Member States applying capping. \uf079 EFFICIENCY OF DIRECT PAYMENTS IN TARGETING THE APPROPRIATE RECIPIENTS The analysis was conducted by calculating the percentage of farms of the FADN constant sample 2013 and 2015 with an income (FNVA/AWU) higher or lower than the national labour productivity (i.e. added value of the economy/AWU, used as benchmark), in presence and in absence of support. The share of surplus out of the total CAP amount received by farms was calculated. The analysis revealed that overall, the current CAP allowed to slightly increase efficiency of direct payments: the share of farms receiving support that creates an income per unit of labour higher that the average national labour productivity (i.e. that are overcompensated) decreased from 29% in 2013 to 26% in 2015. However there is still a large share of farms that does not reach the benchmark: 71% of farms in 2013 and about 74% in 2015. Therefore a significant part of expenditure could be saved or redistributed more efficiently allowing the farms under the reference benchmark to reach it (or getting closer to it). The overcompensation is limited to 9% of the number of farms in the case of small farms and reaches more than 30% in the case of large farms, corresponding to about 34% of total support in the case of the large farms against the 8% of the total support in the case of the small farms. Therefore, it is mainly in the group of the large farms that the surplus is generated (support given to labour units that do not need or need it only partially). The efficiency of the expenditure varies according to market volatility and also according to the different levels of the national labour productivity. Between 2013 and 2015, the share of farms with an income above the benchmark and the share of expenditure surplus of the CAP support decreased also due to the role played by the decrease in prices on income formation. Moreover, the expenditure surplus depends on the (large) differences existing between the national labour productivity of the different Member States highlighting the more broad theme of the European cohesion policies. \uf079 THE ROLE OF THE NEW TARGETING ELEMENTS ON THE FARM INCOME The current CAP introduced three elements aimed at targeting direct support to specific portions of the farm population, namely the redistributive payment (small farms), the active farmer\u2019s provision and the young farmer payment (YFP). The analysis confirms that the redistributive payment has favoured income of small farms that have experienced an increase of direct income support, relative to larger farms. The implementation of the active farmer clause should not have had noteworthy effects. A quantitative assessment of the impact of the active farmer clause was not possible. However, the stakeholders analysis shows that the clause has not been effective in targeting the support, i.e. the number of beneficiaries excluded 5 i.e. target date by which flat rate and partial convergence will be achieved. ",
        "4 from direct income support is small (10.000 claimants excluded from direct payments in 2015 at EU level, Source: 2015 Report on the implementation of direct payments, DG AGRI.). As also argued by DG AGRI in the Report, this result should be read knowing how many farmers have not applied for aid anymore because of the clause and how much money these 10.000 farmers would have received (information not available). Furthermore, the management of this tool has increased the costs incurred by farmers and public administrations. Finally, concerning the third targeting element, the analysis shows that, at EU level, the young farmer payment has, so far, played a limited role in favouring the turn-over of farms management . The analysis based on the comparison of the age of the holders of the farms in the years 2013-2015 (FADN constant sample), revealed that, at EU level between 2013 and 2015, farms where a younger farmer has take-over are only 3,4%. Besides the analysis also shows that 4,2% of the total number of holdings of the constant sample benefited from the YFP. Therefore, an important share of the farms that benefited from the YFP were eligible under the retroactivity clause (farmers who have set up a holding during the 5 years preceding the first application of the YFP can also apply for the scheme 6 ). In some Member States the success of the measure is more pronounced (Austria shows a share of farms of the sample with YFP of 37%, Slovenia 12,9%, Luxembourg 8,2%, The Netherlands 7,6%, Finland 6,8%, Poland 6,3% and Croatia 6,2%). Furthermore, we found that farms managed by young holders have increased between 2013 and 2015 the relative amount of direct payments compared to the other farms that, on the contrary, have experienced a decline of the amount of support. \uf079 THE ROLE OF CAP MEASURES ON JOB MAINTENANCE AND/OR CREATION IN THE FARM SECTOR The possibility of subtraction of wage costs from the reduction of payments should have influenced the raise of salaried labour, achieved also through the simultaneous decrease in contract work. In a situation of labour downward trend, there is a process of substitution of non-salaried labour with salaried labour that accelerated in the period after the 2013 CAP reform, to a greater extent in Member States implementing the subtraction of wages costs from the reduction of the payments. The role played, in general, by direct payments and, in particular, by coupled payments on total farms labour is differentiated according to the sector and to the related ongoing trends (increase or decrease) in the use of labour. Indeed, results show that direct support encourages farm total labour increase in wine 7 , other permanent crops and milk sectors but produces a decline of labour in mixed specialist farms. In other sectors the relationship between direct payments and farm total labour is less obvious (i.e. fieldcrops, horticulture, other grazing livestock, granivores). Concerning the role of coupled direct payments, it is important to recall that farms belonging to the various sectors are generally active in several production activities. Consequently, coupled direct payments can have positive or negative effects on farms labour depending on whether the beneficiary sector of coupled support is more or less labour intensive compared to the other production activities of the farm. The analysis shows that coupled support slowdown the decrease of labour in other grazing livestock, granivores, mixed specialist farms and on the contrary slowdown the rate of increase in the fieldcrops and other permanent crops sector. In the case of milk coupled direct payments seem to accentuate labour decrease and in the horticulture and wine farms the effects are not clear-cut. A further investigation concerning the role of the EAFRD measures on job maintenance and/or creation in the farm sector, based on data presented by Member States/Regions in the Annual Implementation Reports (AIR) of June 2017 referring to the implementation up to 31/12/2016, showed that the 2020 target programmed by MS/regions for the seven-year programming period for job creation at EU level, is around 124.000 new jobs in rural areas, not directly related to agriculture (80.000 in relation to diversification actions and creation and development of small enterprises and 44.000 new jobs through LEADER groups) and about 304.000 new jobs in 6 The YFP is not granted for the years before its first application. 7 Coupled support is targeted to specific sectors/agriculture productions. Holdings are not single-crop and are classified considering their predominant production. Therefore, farms can benefit from coupled support for other productions not inherent to their predominant sector of production. This is relevant in particular for wine specialist and horticulture farms: for example, the production of grapes is not coupled but wine specialist farms produce cereals and a quite intensive livestock farming. ",
        "5 the farm sector through the creation of new farms (of which around 177.000 new farms held by young farmers and 127.000 new small farms). However, the implementation level of the measures at the end of 2016 was really limited. \uf079 RELEVANCE OF THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE \u201cFARMERS\u2019INCOME\u201d RESPECT TO THE ACTUAL NEEDS WITHIN THE EU The statistical analysis based on the calculation of the disparities between agricultural income and non- agricultural income, as well as the analysis based on the FADN constant sample showing an increase of the number of holdings with negative income (in 2013, on average at EU 28 level, 5,8% of the farms showed a negative income and in 2015 this share was 6,6%), revealed that income support was in 2013 an actual need and it continued to be during the implementation of the reform. In addition, this need has also been cited by numerous interviewees to justify the relevance of the objective. According to the stakeholders analysis, BPS/SAPS and voluntary coupled support (VCS), but also Rural Development investment support measures are the most relevant towards the agricultural income objective. However, the hierarchy of the relevance of the measures varies among the different MS. In general compulsory measures, and in particular the BPS/SAPS, are considered the most relevant measures not only for the direct impact on income, but also as elements generating positive economies. Coupled payments (voluntary measure) follow immediately. However, the field work has shown that, in some Member States (in particular in Member States where an important share of agricultural land is rented and owned by non-agricultural investitors), the basic payment (BPS/SAPS) generates unexpected effects, in particular a rise in land rents. This means that part of the support would be captured by land owners (often persons not related to the agricultural world) and not totally received by the tenant farmers. 3.2. EFFECTS OF THE CAP MEASURES ADDRESSING VIABLE FOOD PRODUCTION ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR Competitiveness is defined as the ability of a system to offer goods and services on a specific market under such conditions that buyers prefer them to the goods and services offered by competitors. Accordingly, competitiveness (of a sector or product) is a relative concept and its assessment is possible through the comparison with similar entities. Firstly, the analysis studies the competitive position of the European farm sector on the internal market and on the global market. The analysis starts from 2005 and looks in particular at the years of implementation of the current CAP to better understand the effects of specific measures under examination, in particular direct payments and certain rural development measures. \uf079 EVOLUTION OF THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF THE EUROPEAN FARM SECTOR The task of the evaluator was to study the effects of 2014-2020 CAP measures addressing EU viable food production on the competitiveness of the EU farm sector. Consequently, the analysis did not look at the total agri-food market (agricultural food and feed products, food preparations and beverage, non-edible) but focused on products whose raw materials are produced in EU and therefore concerned by the CAP measures under analysis. To assess the EU competitive position in the internal market, the degree of import penetration has been used. The share of EU imports on the EU apparent consumption was calculated in value for the period 2003-2016 and for a set of agri-food products. The analysis based on import penetration shows that the competitive position of the EU farm sector in the internal market has gradually weakened over the long run: the share of imports on internal consumption has progressively increased, showing that EU consumption is satisfied to a higher extent by imports. This deterioration has accelerated in the last two years (2015-2016), this evolution being observed in all the sectors under analysis (albeit at different levels): cereals, oilseeds, raw tobacco, sugar, vegetables, fruits, wine, olive oil, animal products. It should be noted however that the analysis presents some limitations related to the full comparability of the categories of products in terms of composition and prices, that invite to treat the results with caution. ",
        "6 The assessment of the EU competitive position in the international market distinguishes low value added products and high value added products 8 and is based on the analysis of EU data on exports (in Euro, 2003- 2016), export trends related to world trade and market shares in world exports compared to USA data (i.e. third country with an agro-food sector similar to the European agri-food sector). EU exports in value increased over the period of analysis. However, world trade increased at a higher rate. Accordingly, there has been a decrease of the Union competitive position of the products under analysis in terms of market share due to the emergence/stronger increase in exports in value of other competitors. Data show a significant and regular growth in the value of international trade from 2003 to 2016. The evolution of EU and USA exports value largely follows this global evolution showing an increase of exports in absolute terms over the period, albeit somewhat less than proportionally. Accordingly, market shares of the analysed products of both EU and USA show a slight decreasing trend, highlighting the increasing role of other international competitors (China, India, Brazil, etc.). This weakening of the EU competitive position concerned both low value added products and high value added products. This evolution continued over the two years of the current CAP implementation and EU's market shares further decreased, in total and for both categories of products (slightly more for high value added products and to a lesser extent for low value added products). Nevertheless, the evolution of the overall EU competitive position is similar to the evolution of the competitive position of its main international competitor (USA) and, in 2016, the EU maintained its second position after the USA in the world exports of the set of products considered in the analysis (13,16%).It should be noted that EU exports are characterised by a robust orientation towards high value added products and the share of high value added products on EU exports holds quite stable over time with a small increase after the implementation of the new CAP. In addition, EU high value added products and low value added products follow completely different export strategies. In the case of high value added products, the EU strategy focuses on obtaining a higher price/quality position (compared to international competition); in the case of low value added products, in some cases EU exporters use international markets to sell lower quality products that encounter difficulties to be placed in the Union market. \uf079 EFFECTS OF THE CAP MEASURES ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF EU AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS TECHNICAL QUALITY Quality improvement is one of the factors that, theoretically, contribute to improving competitiveness. In a support system mainly decoupled it can be expected that producers are more attentive to market signals and therefore also more attentive towards a demand of higher quality of agricultural products (technical quality) from buyers. The analysis concerning beef meat, cow milk and sugar beets sectors shows that the implementation of the CAP did not stimulate a noticeable and/or demonstrable effect on the quality of the studied products. However, the evolution of the technical quality of products is not directly related to direct payments but it is rather the result of long term improvement processes already in place before the implementation of the 2003 reform in the case of the beef and sheep and goat meat sector or the result of a slow process of genetic improvement of the herds in the case of cow milk or, finally, attributable to the effects of the 2006 CMO reform in the case of sugar. \uf079 EFFECTS OF THE VOLUNTARY COUPLED SUPPORT ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF SUPPORTED SECTORS The voluntary coupled support has influenced farmers' decisions and agricultural production in a generally limited way. The comparison within each specific sector of the pre- (2013-14) and post- (2015-16) periods of the CAP reform, of the group of MS implementing VCS and of the group of MS that did not to apply it, shows that coupled support seems to have played a role both on surfaces and on production of the oilseeds, protein crops and sugar beet sectors, even if in this latter case VCS seems to have only allowed to slowdown the 8 High V.A. products: 406 Cheese, 1509 Olive oil; 1601 Sausages and similar products; 1602 Other processed meat; 19 Cereals products; 20 Vegetables and fruits products; 21 Miscellaneous preparations; 2203 Beer; 2204 Wine; 2205 Vermouth; 2209 Vinegar. Low V.A. products: 01 Live animals, 02 Meat, 401 Milk and cream, 40210 Milk powder < 1.5% fat, SMP, 405 Butter and butter oil, 06 Flowers, 07 Vegetables, 08 Fruits, 10 Cereals, 12 Oil seeds, 1507 Soya-bean oil, 1508 Ground-nut oil, 1510 Olive oil, blends, 1512 Sunflower-seed oil, 1514 Colza oil, 1701 Sugar, 2304 Soya oil-cake, 2305 Ground-nut oil-cake, 2306 Other oil-cake, 2401 Tobacco (raw), 5201 Cotton (raw), 5301 Flax (raw), 5302 Hemp. ",
        "7 decrease. In the case of the animal sector, the positive effect seems limited to breeding (livestock) and to the production of live bovine animals for slaughtering. In the case of cow milk, the observed variations of livestock and production are mainly due to the abolition of the quota system. However, it should be noticed that in many cases VCS has been introduced in a context in which some MS had opted for partial decoupling in several sectors after the 2003 reform (cereals and oilseeds, beef and veal, sheep and goat, etc.), and/or some MS had chosen to grant a coupled aid under art. 68 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 to support farmers facing specific disadvantages in identified economically vulnerable or environmentally sensitive sectors (dairy, beef, sheep and goat meat). Therefore this existing background does not allow to formulate a judgment on the net effect of the implementation of the VCS (continuity of the implementation of coupled support in the period pre- and post- CAP reform) The observed effects of the VCS on farmers' decisions and agricultural production have not generated distortions of competition. Thus, the implementation of the measure did not significantly change the level playing field between Member States. This was confirmed by the stakeholders analysis. Opinions dissenting from the majority were rather limited and probably related to the existence of specific context situations. Among these, and consistently with the results of the statistical analysis, it has been mentioned that a certain influence of VCS on prices, volumes and relative competitiveness would have been observed only in the beef meat sector and, in part, in the sugar beet and protein crops sectors. In addition, in some Member States, the political decision of distributing the resources allocated to the VCS on a high number of sectors limited the effectiveness (and efficiency) of the tool respect to its aim. According to the stakeholders analysis, in these cases, the VCS failed its aim of supporting sectors undergoing certain difficulties and resulted in an extra and generalized income aid for the beneficiary farms (e.g. Italy, Romania). On the contrary the stakeholders analysis highlighted that, in other Member States, the resources allocated to the VCS have been concentrated in sectors considered strategic, making the measure more attractive to producers (e.g. protein crops in Ireland, beef and veal in Sweden, Belgium, Austria and also France). Hence, in these other cases, the implementation of the tool was actually aimed at achieving its aim of supporting sectors undergoing certain difficulties and therefore had effects on production and relative competitiveness. \uf079 EFFECTS OF EAFRD MEASURES SUPPORTING KNOWLEDGE, ADVISORY SERVICES AND COOPERATION ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR The evaluator was asked to evaluate the contribution of the 2014-2020 rural development policy to the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, and in particular the contribution of Rural Development programmes (RDPs) support to knowledge transfer (measure 1), advice (measure 2) and cooperation (measure 16). The analysis is based on data generated at programme level by the CAP common monitoring and evaluation system, specifically on output and result indicators transmitted with the Annual Implementation Reports in June 2017. For a wide selection of RDPs (86 out of 118), a careful reading of Section 7 \u201cEvaluation\u201d of these Annual Implementation Reports was also carried out. Unfortunately, the low level of implementation achieved after the first two years of programming does not make it possible to draw clear reflections or conclusions. As a matter of fact, Member States and Regions have planned to invest during the 2014-2020 programming period around 668 million euro for knowledge transfer, advice and cooperation dedicated to enhancing the viability and competitiveness of all types of agriculture (priority 2). After two years only 6.5 million euro, or 1% of the programmed amount, was spent. Implementation as measured with output indicators is in line with this low level of expenditure. \uf079 EFFECTS OF THE VOLUNTARY COUPLED SUPPORT ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE PROCESSING INDUSTRY The results of the analysis do not allow to express an unequivocal conclusion on the role played by VCS on the competitiveness of the country-systems. Indeed, the analysis based on the evolution of the production shares revealed no major changes in the competitive structure of the country-systems of the analysed sectors between the two periods (two years before and two years after the implementation of VCS). In general, the changes observed in the production shares of the group of Member States applying VCS and in the group of Member States not applying it in each specific sector are limited. In some sectors, the group of Member States implementing VCS increased their production share (seed crushing industry, beef, tomato industry) and in others cases the production shares decreased (sugar industry, rice, sheep meat, dairy industry). ",
        "8 The results within the sectors are also quite uneven: in both groups of Member States, applying/not applying the VCS, some countries improved while others worsened their production shares. The case of Germany is quite enlightening because Germany did not implement the VCS in any agricultural sector (can be considered as a counterfactual) and country-systems of all its processing sectors show a loss of production share and thus a decrease in terms of production competitiveness (seed crushing industry, dairy industry, sugar industry; slaughtering industry, both beef and sheep meat). The VCS (and above all the low level of the aid) did not produce an alteration of the industrial competitive balance but it could have permitted the maintenance of the activity of processing industries that without VCS would have had difficulties to continue their activity. \uf079 THE ROLE OF THE VOLUNTARY COUPLED SUPPORT ON JOB MAINTENANCE/CREATION IN THE PROCESSING INDUSTRY The VCS does not seem to have had an noticeable effect on the processing industries structural changes and labour force. Indeed, contrary to expectations, in the case of the three processing industry sectors under analysis (beef and sheep and goat meat, dairy and sugar industry), the group of Member States with VCS records unfavourable variations compared to the group of Member States without VCS and situations are very uneven at Member State level, more or less independently from the VCS implementation, according to background conditions generated by other more powerful drivers. \uf079 RELEVANCE OF THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE \u201cCOMPETITIVENESS\u201d WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTUAL NEEDS WITHIN THE EU The objective is relevant concerning the external competitiveness: the objective relevant in the period before the reform became critical in the period of its implementation due to unfavourable conditions on the international market (e.g. Russian ban, drop of the main agricultural commodities world prices). With regard to internal competitiveness, the relevance of the specific objective depends on the situations of the different sectors and on the different context conditions of Member States: actual needs are uneven and differentiated within sectors and among MS within the same sector. Concerning the hierarchy of relevance of the CAP measures related to the viable food production \"competitiveness\" specific objective, some EAFRD measures are judged by stakeholders as the most relevant among all the CAP measures together with the VCS, both as a result of their direct function (investments, measures encouraging innovation) and indirect function (measure for young farmers, knowledge and training, advice measures). However, the hierarchy of the relevance of the measures varies among the different MS. In addition, VCS is the only scheme of the first pillar considered to be relevant, albeit in some cases its role is judged to be more relevant with respect to the viable food production specific objective related to \u201cfarmers income \u201d . Finally, according to the results of the qualitative analysis the relevance of the viable food production \"competitiveness\" specific objective derives from the ability of Member States to integrate the different relevant measures of the first and second pillars. 3.3. EFFECTS OF THE CAP MEASURES ADDRESSING VIABLE FOOD PRODUCTION ON PRICE STABILITY \uf079 EFFECTS OF MARKET MEASURES ON THE STABILISATION OF DOMESTIC MARKET PRICES The existence of the market measures helped to limit the volatility of domestic prices of most agricultural products. In general, the volatility of EU agricultural products prices concerned by market measures is more or less strongly linked to the evolution of the benchmark international prices and to the evolution of the Euro/USD exchange rate. The combination of the two variables helps to accentuate or mitigate the volatility of the EU prices. However, for most agricultural products concerned by market measures, the analyses showed that the volatility of domestic prices is always lower than that of international prices, due (also) to the existence of the European market measures (the existence of the EU market measures seems to play a deterrent role to the adoption of those speculative activities that are one of the causes of the commodities international price volatility on the world market). In the 2014-2017 period, characterized by the world prices in USD decrease, by the decrease of the exchange rate Euro/USD by 20% and by the introduction of the Russian ban, the exceptional tools and measures implemented to face the fall of agricultural prices have been more or less effective in favouring the price ",
        "9 recovery in all analysed sectors (butter, cheese, pigmeat and fruits & vegetables), with the exception of the skimmed milk powder. In this latter case, the size of the intervention (public intervention and private storage) was insufficient and the implementation was not sufficiently rapid. Besides, the implementation of the tools rather than solving the problem moved it over time (difficulty to sell the stored products in the periods following the intervention). Moreover, the milk production reduction scheme 9 contributed to the recovery of the dairy products market (commodities and cheeses). The net effect of its implementation at EU28 level amounted to a reduction of milk production of 1,36%, significantly more important in some Member States (Ireland, Bulgaria, Portugal, Lithuania). \uf079 EFFECTS OF MARKET MEASURES ON FARMERS PRODUCTION DECISIONS Market measures did not generate structural surplus related to an opportunistic behaviour of farmers. However the awareness of the existence of a safety net may have induced milk producers to adopt production behaviours not attentive to market signals. In the case of milk producers, the observed differences in the production growth between skimmed milk powder producing countries and non-producer countries suggest that in this case the hypothesis cannot be totally denied. Moreover, in a few cases, the economic conditions offered by market measures compared to market prices resulted attractive and may have induced short term opportunistic behaviours. In the case of cow milk sector, milk prices are highly differentiated at Member States level while the intervention price is the same for all European producers. Intervention price appears attractive for the Baltic countries and, taking into account transaction costs, also in Belgium, Germany, Poland. Also in the case of some categories of fruits and vegetables/countries, the economic conditions offered by withdrawal prices were highly attractive for apples in Poland and Germany generating also short term opportunistic behaviours. \uf079 RELEVANCE OF THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE \u201cPRICE STABILITY\u201d RESPECT TO THE ACTUAL NEEDS WITHIN THE EU The specific objective \u201cprice stability\u201d was relevant before the 2013 CAP reform and it continued to be during the first two years of CAP implementation. Indeed, the analysis revealed that the variability of agricultural goods prices is always far superior compared to the variability of the non-agricultural goods prices index both before and after the 2013 CAP reform. Moreover, since price stability influences positively agricultural production stability, this specific objective is relevant towards the general objective of viable food production. However, the results of this analysis lead us to believe that the objective of price stability, even if pertinent, is to some extent contrary to the choices of a greater opening of the EU market (choices that imply \"physiologically\" a more or less broad price volatility). Safety net and crisis management tools are considered relevant but not sufficient to the achievement of the price stability objective, i.e. to limit price volatility. Market measures have a bottom threshold (intervention or withdrawal price), but not an upper threshold. Therefore, they are designed to face any fall in prices under the limits set by the regulation, but they cannot limit price volatility when prices grow. Moreover, market tools are activated only when market conditions are particularly serious (safety net). In addition, second pillar measures that stimulate agro-industrial relations are also considered relevant: in particular measures that favor agro-industrial relations (contract negotiations, supply chain agreements between agricultural and downstream operators, etc.) especially if implemented by agricultural associations (POs, Cooperatives) appropriately enhanced through specific (and equally relevant) CAP measures. 3.4. COHERENCE OF THE CAP MEASURES ADDRESSING VIABLE FOOD PRODUCTION \uf079 INTERNAL COHERENCE OF THE CAP MEASURES The assessment of the overall internal coherence of viable food production policy should be based on the acceptance that because of the multitude of objectives and national needs some measures may be coherent with some objectives and sub-objectives and inconsistent with others. 9 October 2016-February 2017. ",
        "10 Accordingly, some sub-objectives could be implemented at the expense of each other which can partially compromise their effectiveness and efficiency. This is the case of redistributive payment, where conflicting policy sub-objectives (productivity versus maintaining of farms and job) weak CAP internal coherence. Another potential internal conflict is represented by the greening measures: the green payments have environment and climate goals and represent a constraints for farming practices. However, the Evaluation study of the greening payment, financed by the European Commission, related to first period of implementation does not confirm the theory that green measures undermine farmers\u2019 income and competitiveness. In the milk sector, coupled support and market measures, namely the milk reduction scheme, show low coherence, but the amendments introduced by the Regulation (EU) 2017/2393 (cd. Omnibus Agriculture Provisions Regulation) seem to have overcame this conflict. \uf079 COHERENCE WITH THE OTHER CAP GENERAL OBJECTIVES There is an overall coherence of the CAP measures targeting the general objective viable food production with the other two general objectives of the CAP: \u201cSustainable management of natural resources and climate ac tion\u201d and \u201c Balanced territorial development\u201d. Viable food production objective seeks to reach an economically viable and competitive agriculture therefore maintaining/creating important economic activity in rural areas, thus contributing to employment and general economic welfare (poverty reduction) coherently with the general objective of a balanced territorial development. Moreover, the current CAP reform went a step further focusing on environmental issues and incorporating climate priorities in the EU agricultural policy. A number of measures targeting viable food production, both of I and II pillars, are in place to drive more sustainable production thus are coherent with the sustainability objective. \uf079 COHERENCE WITH OTHER EU POLICIES The analysis shows that the CAP measures targeting the VFP objective appear to be coherent with certain of the identified objectives of the analysed EU policies 10 and in some cases they produce synergistic effects. For example a number of viable food production measures work in parallel for reaching the targets of the EU 2020 climate & energy package: i.e. cross-compliance and the greening payment. In some other cases the CAP viable food production oriented are neutral respect the objectives of EU policies. 3.5. EFFICIENCY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES The efficiency of the administrative costs and management related to the current CAP implementation was examined on the basis of the results of the stakeholders analysis. The analysis focused on the efficiency of the CAP and of the CAP measures, of the implementation procedures and on the comparison between the efficiency of the current CAP with the efficiency of the previous CAP in terms of balance between administrative costs and benefits of the policy / measures. Concerning the efficiency of the current CAP, for most interviewees the benefits achieved are higher than the costs. Although there is a widespread awareness that a certain inefficiency is physiological due to the complexity of the CAP (highly increased), the most frequently cited critical issues link together the increase of the number of measures of the current CAP (compared to the previous CAP ) with the limited number of beneficiaries of certain measures, for which management and control (checks on the spot) require a disproportionate use of resources, the high number of measures and sectors object of the VCS decided by some Member States and the introduction of the greening payment. Furthermore, there is a prevalent agreement on the overall efficiency of the implementation procedures, although some procedures could be improved, namely those related to the implementation of the greening and to the identification/management of active farmers. With reference to the efficiency of the implementation procedures, despite a prevalent agreement on the overall efficiency, some procedures are judged inefficient, namely those related to the implementation of the greening and to the identification/management of active farmers. 3.6. THE EU ADDED VALUE OF THE CAP MEASURES 10 EU Food Safety policy, EU Development policy, EU climate policy, EU Regional policy, EU Competition policy, EU Trade policy. ",
        "11 The CAP creates EU added value contributing to the political objectives of the Treaty and of Europe 2020 and supporting the generation of a range of public goods, in particular ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers and securing food supply at reasonable prices. There is also a positive EU added value in terms of forming and developing a single market for agricultural and food products within the EU. In particular, the analysis show the EU added value of EU action addressing market regulations, especially of mechanisms dealing with market uncertain. 4. RECOMMENDATIONS On the basis of the evaluation results and the conclusions, the evaluator suggests the following recommendations: 1. Efficiency of direct payments. The analysis has revealed that, under the current direct payment system, an important share of farms (26% in 2015) receive support that produces an income per unit of labour higher than their reference benchmark (national labour productivity per unit of labour). This result suggests that part of the expenditure (33% of total direct support in 2015) could be saved or redistributed more efficiently to farmers that need it most (i.e. farms that do not reach the reference benchmark). Therefore, it seems opportune to reiterate the recommendation (that we formulated at the end of the Evaluation of the income effects of direct support in 2011) to identify assignment criteria and instruments able to redistribute in a more efficient way at least part of the direct payments expenditure. A more efficient distribution of the expenditure would also help to realign, in the Member States, the distribution of agricultural income to national labour productivity. 2. Effectiveness of decoupled direct payments. Field work has shown that, in some Member States, the basic payment (BPS/SAPS) generates unexpected effects, in particular a rise in land rents. This means that part of the support is captured by land owners (often persons not related to the agricultural world) and not totally received by the tenant farmers. If this were a widespread effect, the effectiveness (and efficiency) of the measure would be more limited, contributing to the support of land rent to the detriment of the support to farms engaged in production activities aimed at achieving the viable food production objective. This aspect has not been sufficiently investigated under the present study. However, we believe that it is worth for the Commission to give attention to this issue and possibly investigate appropriate countermeasures. 3. Effectiveness of coupled direct payments. The analysis has revealed that in some Member States, the political decision of distributing the resources allocated to the VCS to a large number of sectors has limited the effectiveness (and efficiency) of the tool with respect to its real objectives. Therefore, it is recommended to identify procedures for the Member States in order to avoid both the ineffective use of the scheme in relation to the objectives set by the legislation and the use of the scheme for objectives other than those for which it was established. On the other hand, it is recommended to the Commission to ensure that the implementation of a high intensity of coupled support in a single sector by main producer Member States does not cause the onset of artificial competitive advantages. This would be to the detriment of the principle of fair competition within the single market, and therefore to the concept of European added value. Finally, in order to avoid opportunistic behaviour from Member States, the Commission is recommended to formulate a more pertinent and verifiable definition of the concept of \"sectors or regions (\u2026) undergoing certain difficulties\" justifying the implementation of the VCS. 4. Price stability tools. The analyses carried out highlighted the relevance of the specific objective of price stability towards the stability of agricultural production, and therefore towards the general objective of viable food production. However, notwithstanding the relevance of the specific objective, the analysis highlighted that safety net and crisis management tools are insufficient to reduce price volatility. Therefore, it is recommended to the Commission to assess possible options for further promoting and / or strengthening (in synergy with the already existing tools) other instruments to cope with excessive price fluctuations. Besides the development of forward contract systems, we refer in particular to measures that allow to better develop contractual forms between producer organisations and buyers, within which, together with technical-qualitative specifications of goods and other contractual specifications, the price of goods is agreed in advance. Indeed, greater stabilisation of the price of raw materials should result in greater stabilisation of prices along the value chain, with benefits to all the players along the supply chains and to the final consumer. ",
        "12 It is important to mention that the changes introduced by Reg. (EU) 2017/2393 (the so-called Omnibus regulation) move in this direction by extending to producers, producer organisations or associations of producer organisations of all sectors, the possibility of negotiating contracts concerning the supply of agricultural products. Therefore, it is recommended that the Commission encourages Member States to effectively exploit the opportunities offered by the regulation . 5. Administrative and management efficiency. The analysis highlighted an administrative and management inefficiency related to the greening payment and the active farmer clause, for which costs do not seem proportionate to the expected benefits. Therefore: - concerning the greening payment, field work showed that the rigidity of procedures and control activities has generated inefficiencies. Therefore, the Commission is recommended to adopt more flexibility to adapt the timeframe for farmers\u2019 eligibility as a function of short -term local conditions, and more subsidiarity in designing greening measures according to national needs. - as far as the \"active farmer clause\" is concerned, field work showed that the balance between benefits and operating costs of the tool seems to be negative: a large and expensive apparatus is needed to identify and manage very few excluded people. However, the so-called Omnibus Regulation into force since 1 st January 2018 provided more flexibility on the definition of active farmers. Therefore, the Commission is recommended to closely monitor this issue and check in the short term whether or not the approved amendments have determined a more pertinent and less expensive system to manage. Finally, a consideration rather than a recommendation: the analysis of the targeting efficiency of direct payments showed that there are very large differences in labour productivity per employee (in Purchasing Power Standard, PPS) among EU Member States: in 2015 the ratio between the lowest and the highest value is 1:3,5 (in Bulgaria and Luxembourg, respectively). Between these two extremes, we find all other countries, with a certain propensity towards the lowest value for most EU13 Member States and towards the maximum value for most EU15 Member States. The results of the evaluation therefore highlight a broader scope of effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of the EU cohesion policies financed by the European structural and investment funds, to which the CAP participates directly with the EAFRD and, in addition, the 2014-2020 direct payments system financed by the EAGF, more balanced than in the past towards the most fragile economies.
