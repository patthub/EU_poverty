        "Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 requires higher shares of renewable energy and greater energy efficiency in an integrated energy system . This transformation will: \u2022 improve our health and wellbeing \u2022 create jobs and growth \u2022 generate investment and encourage innovation \u2022 address energy poverty \u2022 facilitate consumer choice \u2022 reduce dependency on energy imports and strenghten security of supply The Commission is proposing to revise seven interlinked pieces of legislation, which are central to moving towards a climate-neutral energy system : DECARBONISING OUR ENERGY SYSTEM TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS Renewable Energy Directive Energy Efficiency Directive EU Emissions Trading System Energy Taxation Directive Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive ReFuelEU Aviation FuelEU Maritime July 2021 75% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the EU comes from the energy sector ",
        "Sustainable bioenergy reinforced criteria in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy will: \u2022 Prohibit sourcing biomass for energy production from primary forests , peatlands and wetlands \u2022 No support for forest biomass in electricity-only installations as of 2026 \u2022 Prohibit national financial incentives for using saw or veneer logs, stumps and roots for energy generation \u2022 Require all biomass-based heat and power installations to comply with minimum greenhouse gas saving thresholds \u2022 Apply the EU sustainability criteria to smaller heat and power installations (equal or above 5MW) REVISING THE RENEWABLE ENERGY DIRECTIVE Stepping up the ambition for renewables in key sectors : \u2022 Annual binding increase of 1.1 percentage point renewables in heating and cooling at national level \u2022 Indicative target of 2.1 percentage points renewable energy and waste heat and cold in district heating and cooling \u2022 New 13% greenhouse gas intensity target in transport \u2022 New indicative target of a 1.1 percentage point annual increase in renewable energy use in industry \u2022 New benchmark to reach at least 49% renewable share in the energy used in buildings Boosting the deployment of and investment in renewable energy: \u2022 Measures to boost electrification , including a credit mechanism for transport \u2022 Sub-targets and certification for renewable hydrogen \u2022 Measures to facilitate renewable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) \u2022 Accelerated permitting for renewable energy projects \u2022 Promoting cross-border cooperation , including through the renewable energy financing mechanism Renewables in the EU energy mix 19.7% 32% 40% Current renewables share (in 2019) Current EU 2030 target New EU 2030 target Woody biomass should be used according to its highest economic and environmental added value in the following order of priorities: SUSTAINABLE BIOENERGY Wood-based products Extending their service life Re-use Recycle Bioenergy Disposal ",
        "REVISING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY DIRECTIVE 9% increase compared to the ambition pledged by Member States in 2020 within their National Energy and Climate Plans Introduce indicative Member State contributions to the EU-level energy efficiency target Require Member States to renovate at least 3% of the total floor area of all public buildings annually Increased annual energy savings obligation of 1.5% for all Member States Concrete measures to alleviate energy poverty and boost consumer empowerment Require each Member State to ensure 1.7% of energy savings per year in the public sector Energy Efficiency First Principle to be applied in policy and investment decisions 17.0 -17.4% 32.5% 36-39% Current energy efficiency savings for primary and final energy consumption (in 2019) Current EU 2030 non-binding target (relative to 2007 projections) New EU 2030 binding target for final and primary energy consumption ",
        "COMPLEMENTARY MEASURES IN EMISSIONS TRADING AND TRANSPORT Strengthening EU Emissions Trading System, creating separate emission trading system for buildings and transport fuels, and improving transport rules will complement the measures in the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Directives: \u00a9 European Union, 2021 Reuse of this document is allowed, provided appropriate credit is given and any changes are indicated (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license).
