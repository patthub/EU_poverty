        "3 1. INTRODUCTION The EU is a global player and the most important donor of development cooperation in the world. While there have been efforts to communicate with respect to development cooperation ever since support to partner countries began, transmission of the main messages to citizens within and outside the EU can be further enhanced. Communicating in relation to EU development cooperation is still a major challenge. First, in times of austerity, supporting partner countries through development cooperation requires increased public diplomacy. Second, communication must increasingly focus on results and impact to show citizens \u2018value for money\u2019 in a diverse world, where some countries show impressive economic growth, while others are mired in fragility and insecurity. Third, the added value of development aid at the EU level must be demonstrated with clear examples such as the Horn of Africa. Finally, the communication revolution, which has led to instant and global exchange of information, needs to better be reflected in communication strategies on EU cooperation. All in all, regarding both substance and form, the EYD2015 will be a year to show that new potential gives us all increased responsibilities and opportunities for a more interconnected and, ultimately, a better world. Organising the European Year of Development in 2015 (EYD2015) will require a significant additional effort, but it will be an opportunity to mobilise a Europe-wide momentum among both policy-makers and EU citizens at large. The EYD2015 can generate public awareness and place the EU\u2019s role in international development in the spotlight. The year 2015 will be a pivotal year for development: it is the last year for reaching the collectively agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the year in which major decisions will have to be taken on the future framework that will replace the MDGs. Discussions on what should follow the current international framework for development have already begun, led by the UN and involving a wide range of stakeholders. The same year will also be the appropriate time for a review of the EU\u2019s change of paradigm through its new policy framework for development, the \u2018Agenda for Change\u2019, as this will herald the implementation of a new generation of external action financial instruments under the financial perspectives 2014-2020. It is the time when we should be able to communicate the practical results of this new policy to the wider public. Strong public commitment is needed to help achieve the target of channelling 0.7 % of the Gross National Product into development funding 1 . 1 This refers to the repeated commitment of the world\u2019s governments to commit 0.7 % of rich-countries\u2019 gross national product (GNP) to official development assistance. ",
        "4 2. EUROPEAN YEARS 2.1. Definition The aim of a European Year (EY) is to inform the broadest possible audience about a particular EU policy and to direct the attention of Member States (MS) towards it, with a view to changing attitudes or behaviours. EYs can raise awareness and increase public support as well as spread good practice and encourage policy changes. EYs have been organised since 1983. The various decisions taken on previous EYs usually include two components: 1) EYs as a communication tool; and 2) EYs as a means of launching pilot actions. The work on a EY does not only include the year in which the EY actually takes place, but spans several years. Hence, the decision establishing the EY needs to be adopted well in advance. Preparatory measures need to be launched. Actual implementation takes place during the year itself, and closure and evaluation the year after. 2.2. Previous evaluation of results of European Years Experience with previous EYs has shown that: \u2022 EYs are an efficient tool for putting European issues on the political agenda. \u2022 Broad participation within a limited timeframe has helped to harness political support and to pave the way for more wide-ranging political commitments. \u2022 Some EYs have generated new EU legislation and action. \u2022 Several EYs have left people with lasting memories and have changed behaviour. 2 3. POLICY CONTEXT OF THE EYD2015 In 2000 the international community undertook to take practical steps to fight poverty by 2015. The UN General Assembly adopted the MDGs which were to be achieved by 2015. 3 Without doubt, the participation of most of the international community in a global collective action around a limited set of goals, together with the setting up of processes such as the Monterey process on financing for development, or the Aid Effectiveness Agenda, has contributed to build a momentum for development over the last 13 years. Two years ahead of the 2015 deadline, it has to be underlined that significant progress has been made for some MDGs: the objective to halve poverty has been reached before 2015. However, some other key MDGs remain off track and significant steps are needed if they are to be reached by 2015. 2 As examples: The need for all Europeans to learn a second language or for women to attend annual preventive mammography. 3 http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ ",
        "5 Discussions on the post-2015 framework have started. The Communication \u2018A decent life for all, ending poverty and giving the world a sustainable future\u2019, 4 aims at addressing the shortcomings of the current development framework as well as proposing a common approach to bring together poverty eradication and sustainable development concerns in an overarching international framework. This Communication builds on the 2011 Communication \u2018Increasing the impact of EU Development Policy: an Agenda for Change\u2019 5 which led to a major shift in direction in EU development policies. 4. PROBLEM ANALYSIS 4.1. The main challenges Despite the fact that efforts have been made to communicate on development cooperation ever since it came into existence, communicating on EU development cooperation is still a particular challenge: \u2022 While the EU is the biggest donor of Official Development Aid (ODA) in the world, EU citizens often lack a real understanding of why development aid is still needed and what development policies at the EU level can bring. This requires proper communication at all levels, outlining the positive changes achieved and making the case for continued support. \u2022 In a rapidly changing world, information is needed on how an outward-looking Europe can help to ensure global sustainability. The inter-linkages between development, climate change, food security, biodiversity and other issues are vital for our development partners but require further awareness raising among European citizens. \u2022 Development policies have been through a paradigm shift over the last years. Rather than the traditional donor-beneficiary relationship, development policies today opt increasingly for an equal-footing approach with partner countries to address global challenges of mutual interest. \u2022 Being informed is the first step on the way to taking the initiative to act, and in general EU citizens are keen to understand how they can make a difference. Policy coherence for development is a particular challenge and opportunity in this connection. It is important to communicate that development is about more than aid. \u2022 The EU needs to ensure public support for its commitment to achieve the 0.7 % of Gross National Income (GNI) for development funding, particularly in the context of the prolonged global financial crisis. \u2022 The importance of development cooperation differs among Member States. The EYD2015 offers a possibility for better information in all Member States. 4 COM(2013) 92 final, \u2018A decent life for all, ending poverty and giving the world a sustainable future\u2019. 5 COM(2011) 637 final, \u2018Increasing the impact of EU Development Policy: an Agenda for Change\u2019. ",
        "6 \u2022 Information about sometimes complex EU development cooperation has to compete with a range of other topics, which often have a more direct and immediate impact on EU citizens\u2019 daily lives. \u2022 The role of the EU as a global player and vector for change is important if there is to be continued support for EU development policy. There needs to be coordination with MS and other donors in development cooperation in cases such as the Sahel region, the Horn of Africa. Aid effectiveness, and its positive effects, is a field largely unknown to citizens, and needs to be presented in clearer, less technical, terms. 4.2. Current initiatives at EU level The EU has already taken various initiatives to promote development policies and to inform citizens about its development cooperation. The intention is to use existing initiatives to the largest extent possible for the EYD2015: \u2022 General and specific press and media relations are promoted (including press conferences, Commission journalists\u2019 seminars and press trips). \u2022 Commission staff are regularly invited by various stakeholders to give presentations and to talk about EU development policies and cooperation (Member States, academia, NGOs, foundations, etc.). \u2022 The European Development Days, which are organised once a year, are Europe\u2019s premier forum on international affairs and development cooperation, with thousands of visitors. \u2022 Several campaigns have taken place on development during the last years. Some of the most successful ones were the \u2018I fight poverty\u2019 music competition and on-line community and \u2018Young reporters against poverty\u2019 in 2010. \u2022 Kapuscinski Development Lectures are organised in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and major universities, giving students in the field of development cooperation the chance to hear lectures from a well-known academic or political figures. \u2022 The Lorenzo Natali Prize, which is awarded by the Commission, is the public recognition of journalists who contribute through their investigative work to the cause of development, democracy and human rights. Over the past 20 years, the prize has established its reputation and brand, as well as registering a steady increase in the number of participants (from 451 participants in 2004 to 1, 357 in 2011.) The concept of the prize is currently being evaluated with a view to making it even more relevant and focused. \u2022 The External Cooperation Info point provides information on the work of the various departments of the Commission dealing with external relations. It is also used for special events, presentations and visits from universities. \u2022 The Development Education and Awareness Raising (DEAR) programme aims at giving every person in Europe access to information on global development concerns ",
        "7 and their local and personal relevance, thus enabling them to enact their rights and responsibilities as citizens of an interdependent and rapidly changing world. DEAR plays a key role in mobilising EU citizens in relation to development. DEAR implements its actions through Non-State Actors (NSA) and Local Authorities (LA) in EU Member States and acceding countries. \u2022 TR-AID (Transparent Aid) is an interactive website developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC). It publishes historic as well as up-to-date data relating to development and humanitarian aid, thus facilitating the dissemination of information to the wider public. The website will be available at the end of 2013. \u2022 The Practitioners\u2019 Network for European Development Cooperation is an informal open platform for exchanging experience and good practice among European public development agencies and institutions. The Network is open to bilateral and EU implementing agencies and all institutions which directly implement official development cooperation. The Practitioners\u2019 Network creates opportunities for collaboration and synergies at implementation level. It also provides feedback on European development policies from the perspective of practitioners. \u2022 Results orientation is a vital way of showcasing development cooperation. The EU Results Expert Group, launched in 2011, is an important instrument for sharing experiences at EU level on result-oriented approaches and on more efficient ways of communicating and reporting on results. \u2022 Printed material like the Annual Report gives a comprehensive overview of the EU\u2019s development and external assistance policies and their implementation. The brochure of 2010 contains information about the EU\u2019s contribution to achieving the MDGs. \u2022 Research and coordination work in the context of the initiative \u201cMobilising European Research for Development Policies\u201d including the annual European Report on Development (ERD), which is drafted along with a network of academics and EU Member States development researchers. \u2022 Numerous studies on EU development policy and implementation such as \u201cAssessing EU Actions on the MDG\u201d, \u201cPublic policies in support of inclusive growth in developing countries\u201d or a study on blending and private sector development. \u2022 The results of research on topics of major relevance for development have been supported through the EU Research Framework Programmes and in future will be supported through the new EU Framework Programme on Research and Innovation, Horizon 2020 (2014-2020). \u2022 The Commission\u2019s website provides information about EU development policies and activities. \u2022 The Commission has accounts in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Dailymotion. \u2022 The capacity4dev.eu website is an interactive platform set up by the Commission to increase knowledge through an exchange of practices on effective international cooperation. ",
        "8 \u2022 EU Delegations play an important role in informing people about EU policies, EU development policies and the bilateral programme with partner countries. Delegations have press and information correspondents in charge of communication and they run their own websites. In 2012 DEVCO and EEAS published an Information and Communication Handbook for EU Delegations. \u2022 Active cooperation with relevant line DGs will be reinforced in the framework of EYD2015. 4.3. Need for further action Ongoing initiatives at EU level are described under point 4.2. However, given the magnitude of the challenges described, more needs to be done. Under the EYD2015 the challenges must be clearly identified and focused on specific target groups. As the recent Eurobarometer has shown, Europeans have a clear interest in partner countries. 6 Support for poor people in partner countries is consistently high (85 %). Despite the current economic climate, more than six out of ten Europeans think that aid to partner countries should be increased. In all, 53 % of Europeans indicate that they know nothing about where EU aid goes. Moreover, 44 % are not aware where their country\u2019s bilateral development aid goes either. In terms of personal commitment, the Eurobarometer shows a slight decrease in the number of Europeans willing to spend more money on products to help people in partner countries (from 47 % in 2011 to 44 % in 2012). Generally speaking, however, the main findings of this Eurobarometer show that EU citizens have a positive attitude towards development aid, although they believe there is room for further improvement. It also shows that the perception and importance of development cooperation differs across the EU. 5. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this initiative will be: \u2022 to inform EU citizens about EU development cooperation and showcase the results that the European Union can already achieve as the biggest aid donor in the world and what it is capable of achieving by drawing on the combined strength of its Member States and its institutions; \u2022 to stimulate the active interest of European citizens in development cooperation, making them aware of their responsibilities and opportunities as regards policy formulation and implementation; \u2022 in a changing and increasingly inter-dependent world, to raise awareness about the role of EU development cooperation, to the extent that it brings a wide range of benefits not only to recipients but also to EU citizens. The main messages to be transmitted should reflect the contents of the recent Communications \u2018Increasing the impact of EU Development Policy: an Agenda for Change\u2019 6 Special Eurobarometer 392, \u2018Solidarity that spans the globe: Europeans and development aid\u2019, October 2013. . ",
        "9 and \u2018A decent life for all, ending poverty and giving the world a sustainable future\u2019. The EYD2015 will adopt a broad approach to communicating about EU aid in the world, including EU development cooperation and humanitarian aid. The Member States, their regional and local authorities, social partners and civil society should be involved as far as possible. 6. DESIGN OF THE EUROPEAN YEAR 2015 The EYD2015 will use already existing structures and activities. Whenever possible, existing structures and activities should be brought under the overarching label of the EYD2015. The activities will focus on improving communication about existing development cooperation and will involve the stakeholders mentioned under chapter 5. Additionally, pilot actions could be launched within the meaning of Article 54(2)(a) of the Financial Regulation applicable to the General Budget of the Union. All the activities should be as close as possible to, and easily understandable by, citizens within and outside the EU as appropriate. Specific target groups will be addressed to increase the impact, including youth. 7. STRATEGIC PARTNERS The EYD2015 will mobilise a wide range of stakeholders to increase the visibility of the Year to the largest extent possible, with the relevant Commission departments and the European External Action Service (EEAS). A series of Commission DGs involved in policies inextricably linked with development policy (DG ECHO, DG TRADE), the EEAS as well as DGs whose outputs have an impact on development policy (DG CLIMA, DG ENV, DG COMM, DG EAC, DG EMPL, DG MARE, DG EMP, DG ENER,DG AGRI, DG SANCO, DG CNECT, DG RTD, DG JRC, DG HOME) can combine forces to boost the outreach of the EYD2015, but also to create a pool of resources which may provide wider funding and outreach options for various activities. However, coherence is crucial to achieving an impact. Line DGs that express interest will be pro-actively associated in the planning and implementation of EYD2015. EU Delegations will play a crucial role in promoting the EYD2015, especially by collecting information on EU cooperation and by disseminating information to the citizens of partner countries. Headquarters will work closely with staff in EU Delegations. European Parliament The European Parliament is one of the main initiators of the EYD2015. In October 2012 Parliament requested that the year 2015 be designated as the EYD. In July 2012 this proposal ",
        "10 was included in the Parliamentary Resolution of July 2012 on the Agenda for Change: the future of EU development policy. 7 The designation of the Year is the subject of a joint decision by the Parliament and the Council. The contents of the decision will define, in broad terms, the activities to be performed and the objectives to be reached. European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) was the first body to propose designating 2015 as the EYD on the occasion of the 23 rd session of the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The Committee of the Regions (CoR) also supported the initiative. Both the EESC and the CoR are consultative bodies which directly reflect wider public opinion and hence ensure the link between external action and European societies. Moreover, they provide consultative opinion on development-related issues and will be consulted on the legislative proposal. Both will play an important role in promoting the EYD2015 in the Member States. Member States Collectively, the EU continues to provide around half of global Official Development Assistance (ODA). The Member States are key players in the area of development in the world. Naturally, they are our main partners for the organisation of the EYD2015 and are crucial for its success outside Brussels. Coordination will be the responsibility of the governments of the EU Member States and other relevant development actors such as citizens, social partners, the private sector, the academic world as well as Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and Non-State Actors (NSAs). Member States will be invited to play a leading role in the design and implementation of the EYD2015. As partners, their role will be to adapt the European approach to national requirements and to organise activities at Member State level. They need to be involved from the start. Civil Society Organisations and Local Authorities Working with CSOs and LAs will be essential for the organisation of the EYD2015, and they have already expressed a strong interest. CSOs and LAs will have different roles. They are both actors and beneficiaries. As actors, it will be important for them to engage locally with citizens and to be a channel of communication on the EYD2015 towards those citizens. They will provide important feedback on citizens\u2019 information needs with respect to development policies. At the same time, they benefit from EU-funded programmes which could be used to obtain further information. 7 Report on the Agenda for Change: the future of EU development policy of 16 July 2012 on the 2012/2002/INI \u2014 rapporteur Goerens. ",
        "11 The Commission is in contact with CONCORD, one of the main promoters of the EYD2015. The Policy Forum on Development (PFD), which was set up as a result of the Structured Dialogue, is the appropriate platform for presenting the EYD2015 to CSOs and LAs. The main purpose of the PFD is to offer CSOs and LAs from the EU and partner countries, as well as European institutions, a multi-stakeholder space for dialogue on development issues at EU headquarters level. It meets twice a year. The DEAR programme will help to launch calls for proposals directed towards CSOs and LAs under the EYD2015. International Organisations The EU works closely with the International Organisations (IO) active in the area of development, in particular with the United Nations, the OECD, the World Bank Group and the other International Finance Institutions. The close cooperation with IO could be used to give the planned EYD2015 further leverage. The EYD2015 would provide the opportunity to showcase our work with international organisations, explain to EU citizens why we act jointly and give due visibility to the results achieved on the ground. Working with IO can also be used to show global interdependence. The fact that 2015 will be the watershed for reaching the MDGs will help to focus international interest on development topics. For the UN, 2015 will be important in terms of communicating on the MDG post 2015. This will add leverage to the organisation of the EYD2015, as it will help to highlight the MDG post 2015 discussion. Other stakeholders Other important stakeholders with whom the EU has a close relationship, such as non-EU bilateral donors, social partners, the private sector and international foundations, can be involved as necessary. 8. POSSIBLE ACTIVITIES As mentioned in chapter 6, the EYD2015 aims to use existing structures and activities. Stakeholders in development should be mobilised whenever possible. Chapter 4.2 gives an overview of already existing initiatives that could be continued and focused under the EYD2015. Annex 3 contains a non-exclusive overview of additional, partially new, initiatives. The final list of activities will need to be the result of a consultative process. The following list is neither exhaustive nor binding. The main activities to be envisaged with strategic partners will use existing fora to promote the EYD2015, involve them in the process and organise a limited number of focused events. New and innovative partnerships should be sought. ",
        "12 Internally An \u2018Inter-service group of the EYD2015\u2019 will be established involving the relevant Commission departments and the EEAS to keep them updated and obtain support when required. \u2022 The social media accounts of the Commission can be used as communication platforms (with a view to launching thematic \u2018weeks\u2019, each one dealing with a particular EU internal policy aspect as a vector for development). Those DGs could be responsible for delivering theme-related content during \u2018their\u2019 week. \u2022 An inventory of possible events that could come under the EYD banner (using its design visuals and receiving the promotional material of the EYD) could be established with a view to a demonstration of policy coherence for development in practice. \u2022 Commission representations and offices within the EU will be fully involved in the EYD2015. \u2022 Initiatives and events encouraging cultural expression, diversity and intercultural dialogue would be an effective means of engaging citizens in the EU and developing countries throughout EYD2015, and promoting culture as a vector of democratisation, rights and growth. EU Delegations will: \u2022 disseminate information about the EYD2015 in partner countries; \u2022 obtain information from EU Delegations to be fed into the design of the EYD2015 (successful case studies, successful cases of joint programming, delegated cooperation, etc.); \u2022 help to involve partner countries\u2019 citizens in the EYD2015. With EP, EESC and the CoR These European institutions will be instrumental in the success and outreach of the Year. Various activities are possible: \u2022 identification of Members of the European Parliament particularly involved in development issues who could participate in a series of conferences; \u2022 organisation of \u2018thematic weeks\u2019; \u2022 involvement of European Parliament offices in the EU; \u2022 participation in European Development Days; \u2022 action through joint parliamentary meetings (in particular the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly). AGORA is the leading portal for the parliamentary development community and can be used for dissemination purposes. ",
        "13 With Member States Activities with Member States will be of utmost importance in turning the EYD2015 into a success story, the aim being to adapt the EYD2015 to local conditions and thus bring it close to EU citizens. Fora for presenting EYD2015 and obtaining support from the Member States: \u2022 Network of Communication officers of the EU and the Member States: This group could become the main supporting structure for the coordination of activities with the Member States. As the Member States themselves are certainly planning campaigns and initiatives for 2015, a link with the EYD2015 should be sought quickly. \u2022 EU28 Development DGs meetings: This forum brings together the Directors-General for Development of all the Member States, the EIB and the Council secretariat twice a year for joint reflection and forward planning. At the next meeting the EU Member States should be persuaded to play an active role in the EYD 2015. \u2022 Possible activities in EU Member States: A call for proposals could be launched for projects to be implemented by the Member States to improve communication on EU development cooperation. \u2022 Member States should be encouraged to include their own national activities under the EYD2015 label wherever relevant. \u2022 There should be an agreement with all interested Member States on a \u2018back to school\u2019 initiative focused on the topic of development. \u2022 Primary schools could be asked to organise discussions on the issue of sustainable development (prepare a specific kit for teachers to equip them with adequate tools and messages). \u2022 Mobilise the staff of the Commission departments and the EEAS as \u2018development ambassadors\u2019 to give presentations or attend discussions in schools. Specific training may be needed, especially if this is also chosen as a cross-cutting theme for the general \u2018back to school\u2019 exercise run every year. \u2022 Extend the \u2018back to school\u2019 initiative to \u2018back to university\u2019 for the EYD2015 (either a one-off action or the start of more regular involvement of Commission staff in discussions with students, also after 2015). The Kapuscinski Development Lectures are important in this respect. \u2022 If there is agreement on organising a topic around post-2015 goals, Member States could be asked to become a sponsor/ambassador for a goal. Member States would then take the lead in preparing activities around \u2018their\u2019 goal that could be used in different countries. 8 8 Will be possible only if a reviewed post-2015framework has been agreed upon. ",
        "14 With Civil Society Organisations and Local Authorities \u2022 The DEAR 2013 Call for Proposals will envisage that projects selected from this call will implement a number of activities in the context of the EYD2015. \u2022 The Policy Forum for Development (PFD) will be used as a platform to inform participants about the EYD2015 and to involve LAs and CSOs actively in the process. There is also expected to be a considerable multiplier effect via members of the PFD. A working group may be established within the PFD, with a balanced representation of CSOs and LAs from the various regions, to reflect on what targeted measures may be taken in each region to highlight the EYD2015. \u2022 In addition, successful projects that have been implemented in each region could be identified (with the assistance of EU Delegations) and highlighted by the PFD members in the course of their representation activities (in the EU and partner countries). \u2022 The implementation of the action will depend on which projects are selected through the upcoming Call for Proposals, which will ensure that project implementation during 2015 includes numerous activities for the EYD2015. \u2022 In addition, DEAR stakeholders and other relevant NSA-LA projects will be mobilised. With International Organisations As the EU actively works with and funds international organisations, it will be possible to reach a wider audience and maximise visibility through them. \u2022 A high-level event should be organised with IO in Brussels on the theme of EYD2015. \u2022 There should be joint communication efforts to promote the MDG post-2015 agenda. \u2022 Current policy dialogues with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank (WB) and Regional Development Banks (RDBs), as well as the UN, should normally build up joint action and increased momentum for the EU to host a Partners Summit in 2015 at the highest level (launch side event). \u2022 At the first possible opportunity and at the latest by the October 2013 IMF/WB Annual Meetings, there should be a communication to IMF, WB and Regional Development Banks from the EU\u2019s highest level about the intention to organise the EYD2015. \u2022 Communication activities and events should be arranged in the context of the High Level meetings of ECOSOC in 2015 and the UNGA69 in 2015. The possibility of organising an event with UN House in Brussels (UN organisations represented in Brussels) could be explored. Communication activities and events could be organised with OECD-DAC in Paris in the framework of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) High Level Meeting/Senior Level Meeting or the OECD Global Forum. \u2022 The Commission has proposed to co-chair in 2015 the annual meeting of Learn4dev, a network of donors and IOs active in development cooperation, focused on learning, training and knowledge management. ",
        "15 As part of a wider approach the EYD2015 should also be linked to the World Humanitarian Summit in 2015 and the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in 2015. The World Expo 2015 in Milan on the theme \"Feeding the Planet: Energy for Life\" could be an excellent communication platform for the European Year for Development Cooperation. 9. RISKS AND ASSUMPTIONS Assumption Risks Assessment Increased visibility of EU development cooperation and of the impact of EU development policies on citizens\u2019 daily lives Level of visibility remains the same An information and communication campaign is planned. The Commission as well as the other EU institutions have a wide range of instruments at their disposal for providing information about and promoting EU development cooperation. They can be applied in a much more target-oriented way in the framework of the EYD2015 Citizens will react positively and play an active role in organising the EYD2015 Risk of exaggerated expectations regarding the impact of the EYD2015 Lack of commitment of citizens in some Member States Activities directed towards citizens are not appropriate. No change of behaviour Closely involve Member States and CSO/LA. Clear communication on expected results of the EYD2015. Offer tool kits to address information needs in different Member States. Offer examples of how personal commitment can have an impact Increased interest of media Limited cooperation from the media or even negative results of cooperation with the media Publications, requests from media, positive examples of development EU Member States will react positively and will actively participate in organisation of the EYD2015 Lack of political support in some Member States Political support for the EYD2015 in most of the Member States as it coincides with MDG year 10. COST IMPLICATIONS The EYD2015 will be based on existing structures and instruments and enhance their effectiveness by integrating them into a coherent framework. The flexibility for annual priority-setting based on the budget of the Commission provides a sufficient financial margin for running the EYD2015 (EUR 15 million, including costs for the preparatory actions).

        "16 The indicative amounts provided on the required financial resources of the EYD2015 as shown in Annexes 1 and 2 are for information only. The financial leverage effect will be produced through the momentum created. 11. IMPLICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO HUMAN RESOURCES Enough staff for the preparation, implementation and follow up of EYD 2015 will have to be provided. The human resources needed for the coordination team to organise the EYD2015 will be covered by the DG already assigned to the management of the action and/or will be redeployed within the DG taking into account the possibility that additional allocations may be granted to the managing DG within the annual allocation procedure. Additional external staff will be required in 2014/2015 for evaluation, monitoring and reporting. The numbers and type of staff proposed in the table reflect the lessons learnt from previous European Years. 12. MONITORING AND EVALUATION Monitoring and evaluation are clearly an obligation, as well as a policy goal for DEVCO. Reporting will be consistent with the specific objectives and indicators highlighted in chapter 4.2. Although the design of the monitoring framework will mainly be the responsibility of the Commission, specialised expertise may be sought. The concept of the monitoring framework will be established along with the final designation of the year. Essential data collection will start in advance of the event. The specific and the operational objectives of the EYD2015 will both be monitored by precise indicators, as referred to indicatively in Annex 3. A report to the College might be drafted. The Commission must be able to report to the EU institutions in 2016 on the results achieved in relation to its objectives. ",
