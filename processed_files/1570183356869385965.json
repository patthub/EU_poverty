It has an impact on people's every day lives. While much has been achieved, the hard reality is that living as we do, in a period of profound and rapid socio economic change, we must constant ly face up to fresh demands and chal lenges. The Commission's new social action programme 1995-97 seeks to address the dynamic nature of today's Europe. It builds upon and takes forward the achievements of the past while proposing a strategy to meet new needs and challenges. It sets out an important and substantial agenda in the social sphere for the coming years. It is not a static 'blue-print' but rather a rolling programme which is flexible and open enough to cater for the accelerating pace of social change. Employment and the fight against unemployment is, of course, the centrepiece of the programme. Access to sustainable employment for all our citizens is our number one objective. It is fundamental to improv ing the quality of life and preserving the key features of the European social model. We want to give you regular up dates and views on the social action programme as it unfolds. So we have decided to launch the first Social Europe Magazine. Here you will find a summary of the social action programme and we will return to it in future issues.

        "European Social Fund Targeting unemployment At the forefront of the European Union's fight to combat unemployment and social problems, the European Social Fund is a fundamental financial tool in shaping the life and future of hundreds of thousands of Europe's citizens. Here follows a brief presentation. The objectives of the European Social Fund (ESF) as clearly set out in Arti cle 123 of the Treaty instituting the European Community are to 'render the employment of workers easier and to increase their geographical and occupational mobility', as well as to 'facilitate their adaptation to indus trial change and to changes in pro duction systems, in particular through vocational training and re training'. Its task is therefore to take positive action on both the supply and demand side of the labour market. The European Social Fund does not, however, act alone. On the contrary, it is very much a part of the Euro pean Union's overall strategy to re duce inequality and to give all of Eu rope's regions and citizens an equal chance. As such, the ESF comple ments the work of the European Ag ricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, the European Regional Devel opment Fund and the Financial Instru ment for Fisheries Guidance. Togeth er, these comprise the Union's 'Structural Funds' which, in the years 1994 to 1999, will be allocated ECU 156 billion in order to facilitate the essential adjustments required to stimulate the growth and competitive ness of all areas of the European economy, including employment. During these six years, the European Social Fund will have a working bud get of ECU 47 billion. In other words, it will have the resources in keeping with the (considerable) scale of its am bitions. It will be active in many areas of structural policy, contributing to the development of regions which are lag ging behind ('Objective 1'), the eco nomic reconversion of declining indus trial areas (Objective 2'), the economic diversification of rural areas ('Objec tive 5b') and the development and structural adjustment of sparsely pop ulated areas (Objective 6'). Under Objectives 3 and 4, the ESF can intervene throughout the European Union in order to combat the condi tions which underlie long-term unem ployment and - better still - in order to prevent these conditions arising in the first place. Objective 3 clearly defines four stra tegic objectives for the ESF: to facil itate integration into working life of people threatened by long-term un employment; to help young people looking for work to enter the labour market; to promote the integration into working life of people at risk of being excluded from the labour mar ket; to promote equal opportunity between men and women on the labour market. Well-aimed actions The fight against long-term unemploy ment and exclusion from the labour market is based on the awareness that certain vulnerable population groups - young people, women, dis abled or elderly people in particular - require specific measures to encour age integration or reintegration into working life, or to protect them against the loss of employment. The various ESF schemes are adapted to individual cases and local conditions, but form part of an 'integration route'. They take account of the fact that a range of very diverse schemes are required in order to supplement the support provided for traditional forms of training. The ESF may there fore support measures such as vo cational preparation, advice, retrain ing, the acquisition of professional experience and schemes to assist geographical and occupational mobil ity. The ESF may also take indirect Reintegration into working life: ECU 47 billion between 1994 and 1999 for the European Social Fund ^i*^ c SociaEurope Q ",
        "action, such as by promoting care services to assist those with depen dent children or elderly or sick peo ple. In brief, the ESF opts for a flex ible approach which seeks to involve all the individuals concerned. Objective 3' also requires the ESF to strike at the root of the evil. But how? The point of departure must be basic education and initial training - which is precisely the aim of 'Youth- start' which seeks to ensure that all young people under 20 years of age have access to a recognized form of education and training. The ESF iden tifies two key concerns: firstly, to stop young people from entering the la bour market without any qualifica tions; secondly, to improve the qual ity of initial training and education and, at the same time, make it easi er for young people to acquire train ing and find employment. The ESF can therefore cofund initial training schemes anywhere in the Union. In less-favoured regions this may be ac companied by schemes to improve the quality of teaching, either in terms of training for teachers or by setting up networks bringing together schools and companies. Another priority field of action for the Social Fund is Objective 4 which seeks to adapt workers to industrial changes and new production systems. In this area, the ESF concentrates principally on model actions with a multiplier effect. The aid therefore supplements the companies' own ef forts, concentrating, in particular, on small businesses which often have to opt for on-the-job training. Also related to this, the ESF funds studies on emerging labour market trends, assistance with conversion and training, and the creation of net works. It also contributes to schemes deigned to improve and develop train ing systems. Future plans include a project to set up recognized continu ous training centres and the promo tion of distance learning using elec tronic means. The latter allows workers to gain access to informa tion on a flexible basis in accordance with their individual needs and de sires - of particular benefit to small businesses. A question of method A partnership between the European Commission, the Member States and the actors in the field lies at the ba sis of any ESF scheme. In this bottom-up process, it is the Member States which first draw up a plan, in accordance with the rules governing the Structural Funds. The programming is the result of a three-stage process which deter mines how the resources are ulti mately to be allocated. First of all, the Member State submits a plan set ting out a strategy and precise objec tives. Subsequently, the Community Support Framework identifies the pri orities and the sums required. Final ly, the Member States submit re quests for funds which are approved (or not) by the Commission, thus giv ing rise to the operational pro grammes. The operational programmes receive 90% of the available resources, most of the rest going to transnational Community initiatives. One example of the latter is the Employment initia tive which includes NOW (equal op portunities for women), Horizon (com batting exclusion) and Youthstart. Another example is the ADAPT initia tive which is entirely devoted to the 'human resources' aspect of indus trial change. The Charleroi region Neighbourhood networks As a region in difficulty, the Belgian province of Hainat.it recently qualified for aid under Objective 1 of the European Social Fund. Specifically, the plan involved setting up networks in two districts of Charleroi in order to give a much-needed boost to the area. People have to live there, so they have to work there ... for their own fulfilment. In cooperation with CPAS-Forem (Social assistance centre - placement centre for the unemployed) and the Charleroi 'Employment University', the experience allowed 24 trainees to receive training in bricklaying. The course was aimed at the long-term unemployed and those receiving minimum social security benefit or the 'minimex', while seeking to obtain a balance between the two categories. Candidates had to be aged under 30, preferably unskilled or with only limited skills. The 'Neighbourhood network' experience began on 1 September 1994 in Marchienne-Docherie and Dampr\u00e9my and involved a six-month period of social training. But it also serves as a useful model for this whole region which was once prosperous due to its heavy industry but is now depressed. The Walloon region, part of the Belgian federal state, has drawn up an ambitious programme designed to result in the creation of 50 neighbourhood development offices. It would be unable to provide the financing without the assistance of the ESF. The social worker, the master craftsman and the six or seven apprentices who form the basic unit are destined to be the ultimate purveyors of this experience. First Charleroi, then ... Europe?

        "European Year of Lifelong Education and Training Learning, a source of personal fulfilment 'We must return to the 40-hour week ... 20 hours of work and 20 hours to prepare for the future' .... Fanciful as it may seem, this comment is indicative of the current in-depth inquiry into the role of education and training in fast-changing European societies. The European Community has designated 1996 'European Year of Lifelong Education and Training' with the aim of stimulating a wide-ranging debate, involving everybody from the individual citizen to the politician, on developments which are going to shape Europe in the 21st century. 'How and for what purpose should we educate and train?' Although the ques tion may not be new, the employment cri sis and challenges and opportunities of the information society render it more pressing than ever before - and with a pertinence which extends far beyond edu cational and training circles alone. But one thing is certain: there is a need for fundamental changes to the educational systems in the Member States. This is one of the main conclusions of the Euro pean Commission's 'White Paper' on growth, competitiveness and employ ment. There are several reasons for this, but of crucial importance is the fail ure to suitably prepare for a labour mar ket which demands new and constantly evolving qualifications. Many signs - stu dent demonstrations, dysfunctions on the labour market, etc. - show that stu dents, people following training in gen eral, and sometimes the teachers and trainers themselves, are beginning to doubt the usefulness of knowledge which they see as too academic and out of step with day-to-day reality and the needs of the economic world. All your life: the European Commission sees training as a continuous process requiring a complete change of thinking More fundamentally, Europe's tradi tional educational and training systems are largely based on the idea that the education provided in schools is intended to 'train the fu ture worker'. This period of learning is limited in time and seeks to build up a 'knowledge capital' which is valid for the rest of the individual's life. Such an approach is clearly ill-suited to an age in which full employment and a 'job for life' are no longer the norm and when technological devel opments and the growing demand for high level, polyvalent qualifications inevitably mean that all knowledge must be systematically up-dated while also stimulating a debate on a reduction in working hours. Lifelong training But that is not all. We are in fact en tering an age of change in the very concept of knowledge and the means by which it is acquired. The classic approach is based on a sharp divi sion between knowledge and know- how and between the teacher and the pupil. The school, long regarded as the sole source of knowledge, teach es its pupils who are allocated a pas sive role. But today we are seeing a rapid increase in both the sources of knowledge and the means of acquir ing it. The role of the teacher or train er is also changing: the omniscient teacher who imparts his knowledge is being replaced by the trainer who is increasingly becoming a kind of guide to gathering and critically ana lysing the vast amount of information on offer. SociaEurope Q V ",
        "It is at precisely this point in time that Europe's progressive entry into the 'information society' and the large- scale introduction of new information and communication technologies are radically changing the means of ac quiring the knowledge which is now available to everybody and from so many different sources. Television, data processing, telematics, distance study and global communication net works such as Internet could, in the future, allow each individual to large ly acquire whatever knowledge he wants on his own initiative, with no limitations in time or space, benefit ting from this democratically-available knowledge as a source of personal fulfilment throughout his life. Provided that everybody has the skills required to use these new methods and has ready access to them, edu cation and training stand to play a vi tal role in ensuring equal opportunity in this on-going revolution. Although there is no lack of clear-cut arguments for fundamental change to Europe's educational and training systems, the ways to bring about this change have not yet been clearly de fined. Hence the importance of stud ies, initiatives in the field and inno vative projects which will provide the raw material for the conferences, seminars, exchanges of experience and good practices, etc. which the Commission will be promoting throughout 1996. The Commission's principal contribu tion to the debate will be based on its current inquiries into the concept of 'lifelong training' which are wide ly reflected in the new Socrates and Leonardo programmes and the ef forts of the European Social Fund in its current stage. Learning is viewed as a continuous 'lifelong' process with each individual being responsible for alternating periods of work and training, or their combination in the form of on-the-job training, in order to acquire new professional skills or for personal fulfilment. Such an approach to learning also supposes a radical change of thinking which may seem very ambitious. At a time when some of the corner stones which guarantee the stability of European democracies are being called into question, this develop ment deserves - at the very least - to be thoroughly debated.

Private, family and working lives Three lives in one The European Commission is seeking to promote the emergence of new forms of work organization which are adapted to the needs of today's society. In particular, it has set up the 'families and work' network and is working to achieve a Europe-wide collective agreement on parental and family leave. Action, on all fronts. 'All areas of life have to be recon ciled. The individual exists!', thun ders Mich\u00e8le Tierlinck, principal administrator at the Employment, In dustrial Relations and Social Affairs Directorate-General (DG V) of the European Commission, where she heads the 'families and work' net work. 'Families and work' was set up in June 1994 for a three-year period, following in the footsteps of the 'childcare and actions to reconcile family and working life' network and the coordination group on positive actions. Its 15 members are all human resources experts in the var ious Member States. Its task? To t\u00edfv Q SociaEurope ",
        "identify 'good practices' in work or\u00ad ganization in the European Union, such as job\u00adsharing, part\u00adtime work, working hours based on annual to\u00ad tals, sabbatical leave, etc. On this basis, it then promotes the exchange of experiences all over Europe in or\u00ad der to ensure that a happy balance between private, family and working life does not remain the privilege of the few. 'This is an example of the value of the European Union', stress\u00ad es Mich\u00e8le Tierlinck: 'making sure everybody gets to hear about innova\u00ad tive practices'. European Prize for Social Innovation The idea may be ambitious, but on 19 June 1995 in Stockholm the very first European Prize for Social Inno\u00ad vation was awarded to eight compa\u00ad nies and organizations for adopting schemes \u00ad such as flexible working hours and services for families \u00ad which allowed their workers to achieve a better balance between the commitments of family and work. This is to be followed up with the publica\u00ad tion, twice a year, of a newsletter on new forms of work organization. Over to the social partners Even if most countries of the Euro\u00ad pean Union now recognize the valid\u00ad ity of notions of parental leave or spe\u00ad cial leave for family reasons, the Council has never adopted the Direc\u00ad tive. But that does not mean that the Commission has given up the fight to reconcile the family and work. 'We have relaunched the initiative on the basis of the Protocol on social policy (annexed to the Treaty on European Union)', stresses John Darcy, charged with the mission at DG V. The Commission has consulted the social partners on the need to act on the vast subject of 'conciliation'. The aim? To arrive at a collective agree\u00ad ment which would govern parental and family leave throughout Europe. The social partners have generally shown themselves to be quite favour\u00ad ably disposed towards the Commis\u00ad sion's consultation document. Nego\u00ad tiations have already begun and an agreement could be concluded before next winter \u00ad the first of its kind in the history of the European Community. But the Commission is not content to simply promote the transfer and spread of existing good practices, im\u00ad portant as this may be. It also seeks to be a driving force in defining the future shape of work organization in Europe. As long ago as 1983, a proposal for a Directive on parental and family leave was submitted to the Council of Ministers. Among other things, this granted young fathers and mothers the right to at least three months' leave in order to look after a young child. It was therefore designed to provide a fairer division of family responsibilities between men and women. Tomorrow's Europe: by the end of 1995, a collective agreement could settle the problem of parental and family leave at European level SociaEurope \u03c6 \u00bfcia ",

They are linked via a computerized system which allows them to communicate through electronic messaging and gives them access to two data banks. The first includes job offers on the European market and the second.- circulated via 'Info 92', the Commis sion's database - provides full details of living and working conditions in the different EEA countries. Both these databases are available in the Euro pean Union's 11 official languages. 'EURES fills a gap', explains Richard Menu. More than 3 000 job offers The Euro-advisers feed information directly into the 'jobs' database, act ing at the request of employers for whom the nationality of candidates is not an issue. These very detailed job offers generally permit a very pre cise identification of the ideal candi date. The job offers may be circulat ed throughout the network member countries orto certain countries only. They can then be consulted by any one who is interested, with the as sistance of the Euro-adviser. Facilitating contact: 350 Euro-advisers bring together job-seekers and foreign employers The Euro-adviser's role is then to fa cilitate contact between a potential candidate and the foreign employer. In order to make the expatriation pro cess easier, the Euro-adviser con sults the living and working conditions database for all useful information on exercising the occupation in the host country, such as administrative for malities for expatriation, cost of liv ing, tax system, holidays, sickness benefit, school system, etc. During the first five months, more than 3 000 job offers have been fed into the EURES network and pro cessed by Euro-advisers. In addition, there are the many unsolicited re quests for information from Euro peans who, without being offered a particular job, have nevertheless de cided to try their luck in finding em ployment in another EEA country. There is a clear demand for this kind of service', observes Jacques Brame, member of the French Confederation of Christian Workers and trade union Euro-adviser for the 'HNFK' cross- border EURES covering Hainaut(B), Nord-Pas-de-Calais (F), Flandre occi dentale (F) and Kent (UK). 'Whenever we are faced with questions or prob lems which we can't settle ourselves, we always try to put the candidate into contact with someone else in the network who is in a position to sort it out. That is the strength of EURES.' 5 ^^ SociaEurope Q * \u00a3 v ",
        "The media and European integration Journalists with social commitment ! Whether through its Information and Public Relations Directorate-General or its Social Affairs 'DG', the European Commission - always at the forefront of the struggle to maintain and redefine a European social model - makes every effort to encourage these journalists, photographers, film-makers and cartoonists who continue to give coverage to social affairs, sometimes against considerable opposition. Dublin, April 1995: 25 students of journalism from throughout the Euro\u00ad pean Union worked flat out for 10 days on a multilingual magazine en\u00ad tirely devoted to inequality, exclusion and social differences in Europe. Lille, February 1995: 86 journalists, plus photographers and film-makers, of 16 nationalities, held a three-day debate on the subject of social Europe. Brussels, May 1994: around 30 jour\u00ad nalists, head teachers and lecturers in journalism, together with experts from all the Member States, looked at ways of improving training for journalism stu\u00ad dents, and in particular, in the field of social reporting. Throughout Europe, from June 1992 to June 1993, students from 40 schools of journalism entered the first European social journalism competition for the best articles on the fight against social exclusion. Winning entries were pub\u00ad lished in a magazine, magnificently illustrated with large black and white photographs. And what do all these events have in common? Yes, they were all organized by the European Commission and, more particularly, by the Directorate-General for Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs - 'DG V' for the initiated - and in most cases in cooperation with the Directorate-General for Information - 'DG X' - and the European Journalists' Training Association (EJTA). Budding journalists: long the poor relation in the media world, so\u00ad cial journalism is back with a vengeance - due to unemployment and exclusion Fifteen editions of Euroreporter mag\u00ad azine have already been produced by students at EJTA-affiliated schools of journalism, covering a range of sub\u00ad jects. The idea for them to report on social exclusion originated back in May 1994, at a meeting between the EJTA, DG X and DG V. Before putting pen to paper, students first investigated the situation in their own country in the field of poverty, unemployment, social inequality, the homeless, non-governmental organ\u00ad izations and access to services. They also looked at the real impact of the third Community programme against poverty which ends this year. Fifty students in the field With any luck, the 50 students involved in this project (25 from the Dublin school of communication and the rest from schools in other Member States) will remain in contact and retain their enthusiasm for social issues through\u00ad out their professional careers! An enthusiasm which was certainly shared by the journalists who met in Lille in February 1995. Responding to an appeal from the European Jour\u00ad nalists Association (a branch of the European Movement) which organized the seminar for the European Com\u00ad mission, the older brothers and sis\u00ad ters of the 'Euroreporter' students rubbed shoulders for three days with activists from the non-profit-making sector. These are the people behind the thousands of local schemes which run every year on state-subsidized housing estates throughout Europe, often with the assistance of the European Community, but who we rarely read about in our newspapers or see on our TV screens. w%t*r \u03bd \u03c6 SociaEurope ",
        "'Journalists have a fundamental role to play in these initiatives,' explains the President of the Foundation for Human Progress, Pierre Calarne, the event's co-organizer. 'They can kill them off in two ways: either by ignor\u00ad ing them altogether or by showering them with too much praise. On the other hand, well-judged reporting can permit contacts between schemes and show that something is being done'. The journalists were also able to meet a number of politicians, in par\u00ad ticular, women politicians: Martine Aubry, former French Employment Minister, Simone Veil, the then So\u00ad cial Affairs Minister, and Marie- Christine Blandin, President of the Regional Council of Nord-Pas-de- Calais. is part of the reason why social is\u00ad sues do not receive the same kind of media coverage in all Member States. But one thing is certain: the social sphere is in crisis everywhere and needs redefining. It is in this redefin\u00ad ing that the European Commission has a major role to play. A first step is to encourage the exchange of in\u00ad formation between Member States, whether in the form of statistics or interesting practices. It is therefore only logical for the European Commis\u00ad sion to encourage journalists work\u00ad ing in the Member States who are interested in social issues to come together to exchange information, compare working methods and con\u00ad tribute to this crucial task of redefin\u00ad ing a European social model. Redefining the European social model Social Europe is central to the Eu\u00ad ropean identity - even if it has long been the poor relation in Europe\u00ad an integration. The deep commit\u00ad ment of Europe's citizens to their social model was effectively con\u00ad firmed by the correspondence ex\u00ad changed with the social partners and non-governmental organiza\u00ad tions in preparing the Green Paper on the future of Europe's social policy, adopted by the European Commission in 1993. It is a so\u00ad cial model which combines eco\u00ad nomic competitiveness and social solidarity, legislative action and collective agreements. The reason why it has been so dif\u00ad ficult to act in this area at Euro\u00ad pean level is that social policy lies at the crossroads of politics and the non-profit-making sector. It is therefore deeply rooted in the his\u00ad tory and traditions of the Member State. This applies to such an ex\u00ad tent that the very term 'social' does not have the same meaning or the same connotations in all countries or in all languages. This What category?

        "European social policy A new action programme for 1995-97 It was on 12 April last year that Commissioner Padriag Flynn revealed the contents of the new 'medium-term action programme' which will frame European social policy through to 1997. Succeeding the 1989 social action programme which was launched after the governments of 11 of the 12 Member States adopted a Charter of fundamental Community social rights for workers, the document identifies a range of priorities: employment, equality between men and women, public health, the participation of all citizens in social policy and a strengthening of the European Commission's analysis and research capacity. In addition, the 'Consolidation' chapter covers health and safety at work and the right to work. Human resources: investing in an educated and well-trained labour force, a key element of the European Union's strategy Designed to be both comprehensive and flexible, this new programme is the culmination of a wide-ranging in\u00ad quiry initiated in 1993 with the pub\u00ad lication of the Green Paper on the fu\u00ad ture of European social policy and continued in the White Paper which laid down a framework for the devel\u00ad opment of this area of policy. These two documents placed job creation at the centre of economic and social development, affirming, on the one hard, that there could be no social progress in Europe without competitiveness and, on the other hand, no lasting economic growth without taking into account the so\u00ad cial dimension. A total of 55 million people are currently living below the poverty line in the 15 Member States of the European Union. Employment, the number one priority Employment is the number one pri\u00ad ority. Although the prime responsibil\u00ad ity for job creation lies with the individ\u00ad ual Member States, the Community also has a role to play in identifying structural obstacles to job creation and making suggestions to help States to overcome them. The pro\u00ad gramme thus concentrates on 'ob\u00ad servation and monitoring mecha\u00ad nisms' for employment systems and on closer cooperation between the national authorities (meetings of of\u00ad ficials, joint research programmes), the social partners and European in\u00ad stitutions. The Commission also stresses the crucial role of the Structural Funds (regional and agricultural) and in par\u00ad ticular the European Social Fund in promoting employment.

        "ment of human resources is of course one of the key elements in creating jobs. In this respect, the recent adop\u00ad tion of the Leonardo programme (im\u00ad plementation of a vocational training policy) and Socrates programme (cooperation in the field of education) should permit a better integration of young people into working life. The Commission is also interested in creating a European labour market. It has already announced several pro\u00ad posals designed to facilitate the free movement of workers throughout the Union (transfer of pension rights, right of residence, recognition of diplomas, etc.). Equality between men and women is also central to this new action pro\u00ad gramme. A fourth action programme on equality is to enter into force in 1996. to be gained from exchanges and in- depth dialogue at European level. Between now and 1997 the Commis\u00ad sion will be endeavouring to stimu\u00ad late the debate by producing com\u00ad munications and recommendations for medium-term consideration. Finally, the Commission will continue to support the efforts of the Member States in formulating and implement\u00ad ing their policy of improving public health. The action programme an\u00ad nounces new proposals on diseases linked to pollution, accidents and in\u00ad jury, and rare diseases, plus the im\u00ad plementation of proposals pending on cancer, AIDS, infectious diseases and the advertising of tobacco products. At the same time, the Commission has started negotiations with the European social partners on possible measures in areas such as reconcil\u00ad ing family and working life, equal pay, women in decision-making, dignity at work, etc. For society as a whole The Commission does not look upon social policy as something solely of interest to workers. It concerns so\u00ad ciety as a whole. This is why the new programme widens the approach to problems common to all the Mem\u00ad ber States, such as the funding and operation of systems of social pro\u00ad tection, poverty, exclusion, racism and xenophobia and the integration of immigrants. Although the princi\u00ad pal political responsibility in these areas lies with the national, region\u00ad al or even local authorities, the Un\u00ad ion can play a valuable role in pro\u00ad moting Europe-wide cooperation between the Member States, the so\u00ad cial partners and all the actors in\u00ad volved.

        "Integration and equal opportunities for disabled people Good intentions are not enough Several of the Commission's programmes, initiatives or actions directly concern disabled people. But Helios, set up by DG V, is the only Community programme which is exclusively devoted to disabled people. This article offers a number of thoughts plus additional information on the aim of the Helios programme, defined as: to promote the integration of and equal opportunities for people with disabilities. It then reviews the proposals of the Commission's social action programme for disabled people. Finally, the box on page 16 briefly presents the structure of the Helios programme. A whole range of special services, with very substantial differences de\u00ad pending on the country, are more or less successfully provided in order to meet the needs of disabled people. These include special medical ser\u00ad vices, schools for disabled children, small adapted buses reserved for the transport of disabled people, and in\u00ad stitutions. All these services consti\u00ad tute clear progress on the total ex\u00ad clusion previously experienced by certain categories of disabled peo\u00ad ple. Having said this, the fact remains that these services continue to keep the disabled person in a world apart. They meet certain needs of the dis\u00ad abled person and try to provide indi\u00ad vidual solutions, thus allowing the disabled person to adapt to society \u00ad but all the while society is failing to adapt to the disabled person. Dis\u00ad abled persons are therefore in danger of being citizens in a class of their own rather than fully\u00adfledged citizens in mainstream society. Even when it comes to employment, the preferred solution is often segregation, through sheltered workshops. The same start in life The concept of integration is a means of breaking free of this segre\u00ad gation. Integration allows disabled people, including those with mental disability, to develop their true po\u00ad tential and to participate in econom\u00ad ic life (employment), social life and cultural life; they are entitled to con\u00ad sciously chosen social and affective relations. Integration requires the community (the State, the region, the municipality) to recognize the pres\u00ad ence of disabled people and the con\u00ad ditions necessary for them to partici\u00ad pate fully in the life of this community. This also means overcoming one of the major obstacles to the integra\u00ad tion of disabled people, namely the attitudes of fear and rejection on the part of other citizens. When you en\u00ad roll a disabled child at a mainstream school, you often come up against negative reactions among other par\u00ad ents. To this very day in Europe, to varying degrees depending on the country, disabled people still some\u00ad times experience the attitudes and behaviour of rejection, including phys\u00ad ical violence. At the same time, the disabled person himself is responsible for his own integration. He or she must have the will to integrate, while at the same time we must respect and accept the decision of those who pre\u00ad fer to live in isolation or only to fre\u00ad quent other disabled people. It is easy to understand such a decision when you think about the countless difficul\u00ad ties and 'blunders' which disabled people have to shrug off every day of their lives, such as the h\u00e9mipl\u00e9gie who, after 30 years, is tired of well\u00ad intentioned people who meet her for the first time advising her to 'look af\u00ad ter herself'. Over the past 30 years, a more radi\u00ad cal concept has been gaining ground in Europe: equal opportunity. It is of\u00ad ten applied to relations between men and women, but it should also be ap\u00ad plied to other social distinctions such as disability, colour of skin and na\u00ad tionality. Equal opportunity implies that society takes into account the specific needs of disabled people. Equal opportunity: a principle which applies to everybody, including disabled people \u03bd \u03c6 SociaEurope ",
        "Integration versus segregation: attitudes of fear and rejection on the part of other citizens are one of the major obstacles to the integration of disabled people Services, cultural activities, informa\u00ad tion, education and work must all be accessible to disabled people. The needs of all citizens are of equal im\u00ad portance and it is on this basis that society must develop, with access to public places and transport for people with reduced mobility, hous\u00ad ing designed for independent living, the inclusion of disabled children in mainstream education (with the nec\u00ad essary adaptations to teaching methods and materials), the promo\u00ad tion of employment for disabled peo\u00ad ple in a mainstream environment, etc. The disabled person must have the same rights and opportunities as other citizens: all citizens must have the same start in life. But does this mean we need anti-discrimination laws (modelled on the Disabilities Act in the USA)? This is a keenly- debated issue among Helios pro\u00ad gramme partners and among dis\u00ad abled people and their associations in Europe. The concept of equal opportunity is changing. While in most of its docu\u00ad ments the Commission applies it solely to relations between men and women, in the social exclusion chap\u00ad ter of the White Paper entitled 'Euro\u00ad pean social policy, a way forward for the Union', equal opportunity is con\u00ad sidered for the first time as a princi\u00ad ple which applies to everybody, in\u00ad cluding disabled people. In this same White Paper, the Commission express\u00ad es the essential idea that, at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, the new European Union Treaties should include specific reference to the fight against all forms of discrimination, whether based on race, religion, age or disability. After 1996 Last April, the Commission pub\u00ad lished its 'Social action programme for the medium term, 1995-97' 1 which, in a sense, sets out the work\u00ad ing objectives inherent in the 'Euro\u00ad pean social policy, a way forward for the Union' White Paper. This pro\u00ad gramme includes a number of refer\u00ad ences to the integration of disabled people and announces several spe\u00ad cific measures: - as the Helios programme expires in 1996 and in the light of the 1995 inter\u00ad im report, the Commission will be orga\u00ad nizing wide-ranging consultations on pos\u00ad sible future action in the field of disabled people; \u2022 in 1996, following on from the Essen European Council 2 , the Commission will concentrate on the question of the em\u00ad ployment of disabled people and the po\u00ad tential of new technologies and commu\u00ad nication systems; \u2022 again on these two subjects, in 1997 the Commission will be submitting pro\u00ad posals after consulting the European For\u00ad um on Disabled People and in the light of other analyses carried out by the Member States. -On the subject of equal opportunity; \u2022 the Commission has announced a com\u00ad munication on measures to be taken to eliminate discriminatory obstacles still facing disabled people (latter half of 1995); \u2022 the Commission will be submitting to the European Parliament and Council of Min\u00ad isters a proposal for a recommendation concerning the implementation of U N reg\u00ad ulations to ensure equal opportunity for disabled people (1996) 3 . We should remember in this respect that, in its White Paper on social pol\u00ad icy, the Commission took the view that the next review of the Treaties (1996 Intergovernmental Conference) should consider including specific ref\u00ad erence to the fight against discrimina\u00ad tion on the grounds of religion, race, age or disability. -The Commission has also announced: a proposal for a Council Decision to set up a permanent consultation forum for organizations of disabled people, mod\u00ad elled on the European forum on disabled people set up under the Helios II pro\u00ad gramme.

        "European companies manifesto Big bosses act against exclusion Seventeen million unemployed. Fifty-five million below the poverty line. Almost five million trapped in poor hous\u00ad ing conditions ... These are the figures so often quoted on the subject of social exclusion in Europe. A phenomenon which nobody can ignore - neither public authorities nor private companies. But is the fight against exclusion real\u00ad ly the business of ... businessmen? Yes, according to a group of some 20 businessmen who met in Brussels on 10 January last at the invitation of former President of the European Commission Jacques Delors. They launched a 'European Manifesto' undertaking 'to join in the effort to pre\u00ad vent and combat exclusion'. The doc\u00ad ument was subsequently officially signed at a conference in London on 11 and 12 May. 'A refusal to integrate the excluded is like placing a time bomb beneath our prosperity', explains one of the signa\u00ad tories to the declaration. Exclusion brings enormous direct and indirect social costs which in turn bring in\u00ad creased costs to companies and re\u00ad duce their markets. 'The notion of be\u00ad ing an efficient company operating in the midst of a surrounding wasteland is inconceivable', stresses one busi\u00ad ness manager, while Jacques Delors stressed the importance of the 'enter\u00ad prise citizen' in our societies. Five fields of action The companies manifesto does not of course have any binding force. It simply proposes five fields of ac\u00ad tion, five general working principles in which employment plays a major role. 1. Promoting integration into working life Companies are requested to set aside any prejudices against the long-term unemployed when taking on new work\u00ad ers. They are also requested to avoid the practice of 'over-qualification' - which means the automatic rejection of less qualified workers in favour of those with the highest qualifications. 2. Helping to improve vocational training Qualifications help avoid unemploy\u00ad ment while retraining and continuous training ward off the danger of redun\u00ad dancy. Training is the responsibility of society as a whole, the educational system and the company. There should also be cooperation between these three poles, states the manifesto. 3. Preventing redundancies This declaration by European business managers calls for 'managed restruc\u00ad turings'. The document argues for the full use of all the available options in terms of working hours and salaries in order to avoid 'shock redundancies'. 'We cannot undertake never to have to shed any jobs, as that would mean accepting a loss of competitiveness', says one business manager. 'But what is important is to provide accompany\u00ad ing measures for anyjob losses which are necessary'. 4. Promoting the creation of new jobs and new companies There is certainly no shortage of What is his story? Companies must make full use of all the available options in terms of working hours and salaries in order to avoid shock redundancies devices: from hiving off to technologi\u00ad cal support for small and medium- sized enterprises, including the crea\u00ad tion of proximity services... 5. Helping achieve solidarity in vulnerable districts and among the most vulnerable population groups Successful experiences exist in this area too. In Lyon, for example, com\u00ad panies are working with the ATD Quart monde association in order to train and employ people on the minimum social security benefit. In Antwerp, companies have won the support of the local authorities and the chamber of commerce in setting up a network known as 'working with risk groups' which include the unemployed, immi\u00ad grants, the unskilled, etc. Identifying original practices The manifesto against social exclusion was officially adopted at the London conference in May. The meeting also discussed follow-up measures at some length. The long-term objective is to set up national 'teams' in order to en\u00ad sure the continued dynamism of the process described in the declaration. Each team will draw up a two-year pro\u00ad gramme with the aim of identifying orig\u00ad inal and successful practices in the fight against exclusion waged by com\u00ad panies. The teams will mobilize and en\u00ad courage companies, especially SMEs, so that they can develop transnational programmes. A European network will also be set up, together with a data bank on the fight against exclusion, with the support of the European Com\u00ad mission. This network will disseminate information throughout the Member States, carry out research, assist the national teams and raise funds for their benefit. SociaEurope \u03c6 ",
        "Europe's ageing population The Commission up to the future A report on demography does not perhaps make the light\u00ad est of reading. And the European Commission's survey to highlight the Union's demographic make-up is admittedly no exception to the rule. But it does make interesting reading, and serves to bring us firmly back down to earth... In accordance with the Treaty on European Union, in December 1994 the European Commission published its first annual report on the demo\u00ad graphic situation in the European Un\u00ad ion. The object was to highlight the principal social and economic conse\u00ad quences of the population profile. It is this profile which can shed light on the increasing socioeconomic dys\u00ad functions in the European Union. Consequently, it can fuel the essen\u00ad tial debate on the future of Europe's population, ensuring that the policies implemented are in line with the prin\u00ad cipal long-term trends at work in so\u00ad ciety, a factor which is obviously cru\u00ad cial to their success. The 'mosaic' of European society seems to be increasingly ill at ease with itself. Unemployment, exclusion and intolerance are destroying the so\u00ad cial fabric in all Member States, whilst simultaneously weakening the foundations of European integration. The European Commission therefore saw this as a subject of key impor\u00ad tance. The more troubled the waters, the more vital the need to steer a firm course... Overturning our preconceptions Its interest was certainly well placed! The report - backed up by the figures - effectively challenges some of the preconceived ideas which provide the raw material of populist appeals. One The new consumers: the demand generated by elderly people for care and leisure services, and also education, could revitalize the services sector such example is the myth that many of our problems are attributable to the continuing excessive inflow of im\u00ad migrants into the Union - when in fact the foreign population amounts to just 2% of the total. In all likelihood, the net migrational balance will re\u00ad main at virtually zero between now and the year 2025. All Member States are showing the same trend in this area, namely the end of emi\u00ad gration, controlled immigration and the creation of a permanent commu\u00ad nity of foreign extraction. Although this admittedly poses certain prob\u00ad lems of integration and exclusion, it is not something which is going to have any impact on the structure of European societies. We should not, for example, expect any 'rejuvenation' of Europe's population. The European Community in fact shows a quite distinctive 'top-heavy' age struc\u00ad ture, a slow rate of demographic growth and more pronounced ageing than in most developed countries and in the East. In all Member States, the per\u00ad centage of the population aged over 60 is constantly increasing. Represent\u00ad ing 20.7% in 1990, they are set to represent 21.5% in the year 2000 and 26.4% by 2020. At the same time as elderly people are increasing in absolute numbers, their relative importance is growing due to falling birth rates and increased life expec\u00ad tancy. We could be tempted to believe that this trend presents a problem for Eu\u00ad rope. But this is not the way to look at it, concludes the report. First of all, because an old society is not nec\u00ad essarily a society of 'old fogies'. Sec\u00ad ondly, because an ageing population does not only bring disadvantages. 100 million elderly people Elderly people - who already number more than 100 million in Europe to\u00ad day - comprise a section of society which plays a vital role in stimulating the services sector, by virtue of their demand not only for health and lei\u00ad sure services, but for education too. The demand generated by these new consumers could give a totally new direction to Western economies in an increasing number of sectors. The new jobs this could create in the cul\u00ad tural and services industries could offset, in full or in part, the losses registered in traditional sectors, and especially in the industrial sectors most threatened by automation. Another factor to be borne in mind is the professional and other experi\u00ad ence, in terms of knowledge or know- how, which these elderly people have to offer. \u03c6 SociaEurope ",
        "Are we prepared ? So much for the facts. The question is, can European society afford not to face up to ageing as an inevitable aspect of its development? Should it not be looking at ways of adapting to it? Because this phenomenon does not only affect the labour market, economic systems and systems of social protection. It also has a direct bearing on Community policy. Demographic trends could alone gen\u00ad erate sufficient pressures to desta\u00ad bilize the creation of the single mar\u00ad ket. How, for example, are we to continue to ensure economic growth with a declining working population? Why is it that social security systems are under such pressure - is it be\u00ad cause of a difficult economic climate, a shifting balance between contribu\u00ad tors and beneficiaries, or require\u00ad ments linked to convergence criteria? These are the kind of questions which prompted the Directorate- General for Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs of the European Commission to award pri\u00ad ority importance to a report on the ageing phenomenon and its conse\u00ad quences. It will not be easy, but is it not precisely the task of the Commis\u00ad sion to highlight future challenges and assist the Member States in act\u00ad ing in full knowledge of the facts? The fight against poverty Statistics, an essential tool 'Poverty figures at the end of the eighties'. The purely factual title does not really do justice to the ambitious goal set by the European Commission for a vast survey carried out in 1989, the results of which were published by the Statistical Office of the European Communities in December 1994. The object: to define a methodology which permits an analysis of the living conditions of underprivileged groups throughout the European Union. The reason: because any effective policy to combat social exclusion must be based on comparable and reliable statistics on the size and composition of Europe's 'populations at risk'.We put three questions to senior officials at the 'Household Living Conditions' unit who are responsible for following up the survey for Eurostat. What definition of poverty did you apply for this survey? The definition currently applied by the European Union is based on the Coun\u00ad cil Decision of 19 December 1989: 'We understand by poor people those indi\u00ad viduals, families and groups of persons whose resources (material, cultural and social) are so low that they are ex\u00ad cluded from the minimum acceptable ways of life in the Member State in which they live'. This definition of rel\u00ad ative poverty places the emphasis on the gap between the lower stratum of society and the rest of society. From poverty to social exclusion: research must be widened to include all the non-monetary indicators However, this statistical survey can only take into account the economic aspect of the nation of poverty. Like other surveys carried out by Eurostat in the field of poverty, it is principally based on the 'household budgets sur\u00ad vey' (HBS) as this is the most compre\u00ad hensive source of information on households which is available in all the Member States. Thus, by very defini\u00ad tion, the notion of poverty which results is limited to material aspects. SociaEurope \u03c6 :,flf ",
        "What are the main lessons to be learned from this survey? The survey, carried out by Erasmus University in Rotterdam, gives infor\u00ad mation on the size and characteris\u00ad tics of the poor population in the 12 countries of the European Union at the end of the 1980s. The size of the phenomenon allows us to identify four groups of countries: a small pro\u00ad portion of the population is underpriv\u00ad ileged in Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg; an average proportion in France, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Spain; a large proportion in Greece and Italy and a very high proportion in Portugal. Among all the factors liable to cause a household to fall into poverty, two are particularly crucial: the employ\u00ad ment situation of the head of house\u00ad hold and the type of household. The inactivity of the head of household, usually due to unemployment, is a major cause of poverty. Among re\u00ad tired people, the older and the more isolated they are, the more vulner\u00ad able they are. We also see that the likelihood of poverty significantly de\u00ad creases when at least one member of the household - no matter which one - is working. As to the type of house\u00ad hold, in all countries we find that pov\u00ad erty is most common in families with four or more children and, most of\u00ad ten, in one-parent families where the head of household is a woman. New non-financial indicators The Council gives a definition of poverty which is not purely economic. Do you intend to take these cultural and social dimen\u00ad sions into account, and if so how? In the course of the successive Eu\u00ad ropean programmes to combat pover\u00ad ty, the European Commission has widened the notion of poverty to that of social exclusion described as a process linked, in particular, to access to the labour market. The in\u00ad itial emphasis was on analysing pov\u00ad erty from the point of view of the in\u00ad sufficiency of financial resources. Research into social exclusion must now be extended to all non-financial indicators in order to cover the mul\u00ad tidimensional aspect (state of health, education, etc.), the dynamic aspect (understanding the process of social exclusion) and the spatial aspect (analysis at district rather than house\u00ad hold level, highlighting access to transport for example). In defining these new and essential indicators, Eurostat will be able to draw on the results of the House\u00ad holds Panel. This is a new survey, launched in 1994, which while con\u00ad centrating on income will also provide comparable data on indebtedness, sociability, health, education, immi\u00ad gration, etc. The first results will be available later this year. Also, a study group on the homeless is to be set up charged with looking at methods of acquiring a better knowledge of this population. Descent into poverty: the employment situation of the head of household and the type of family (single parent or four or more children), two factors which play a major role ^ \u03bd \u03c6 SociaEurope ",
        "Health and safety of workers An economically sound investment The lack of health, hygiene and safety regulations brings extra costs for the business community. Although protection measures may be expensive, their absence proves even more costly! Such is the conviction which underlies - and justifies - the European Commission's decision to present its 4th action programme in this field ... When, in an attempt to conserve fish resources, the European Union tried to reduce the diameter of fishing nets, its actions had some unexpected reper\u00ad cussions. Previously, nets had been held in place between the sides of the fishing bridge. Following the Commis\u00ad sion's ruling, the nets became narrow\u00ad er and could therefore unroll on the fish\u00ad ing bridge. The crew who walked on these nets when handling the catch now lost their balance and serious ac\u00ad cidents resulted. This decision there\u00ad fore had implications for the safety of workers at sea. New technologies, new pathologies This example, among others, including the effects of the Seveso Directive, il\u00ad lustrates why it is so important to en\u00ad sure that European policies are coher\u00ad ent. The safety of workers does not only depend on decisions taken in the field of social policy but also on decisions tak\u00ad en in the area of industrial policy, agricul\u00ad ture, transport, consumer policy, or even external affairs. This example and others such as the re\u00ad sults of the Seveso Directive underline the need for coherent European policies. Workers' safety depends not only on de\u00ad cisions taken within social policy but also for industrial, agricultural, transport, consumer and even foreign policy. The European Commission must also respond to the technological changes of these closing years of the millenni\u00ad um. In the early days of the Commu\u00ad nity, the 'Committee on health and safe\u00ad ty in the mining industries' effectively met the concerns of the time. Miners suffered from a number of complaints, such as pneumoconiosis, anthracosis and silicosis. Public opinion had also been shocked by mining accidents, such as the catastrophe of the Bois du Cazier in Charleroi. Today, the growth of the services sec\u00ad tor and technological innovation are also bringing their own pathologies. Cordless telephones, for example, are not as innocent as they may seem and studies are being carried out into the possible impact of their sound waves on the human body. Computer screens can have detrimental effects on the eyesight... stress is recognized as a 'modern' illness... and environmental protection can pose a threat to the very people who are responsible for it... The Commission pays particular atten\u00ad tion to small businesses. There are two reasons for this. First of all, rela\u00ad tively more industrial accidents occur in small businesses. Secondly - and this also explains why these accidents oc\u00ad cur - small businesses tend to be less well equipped in providing a high level of protection for their staff. Already Watch your eyes! The growth of the services sector and technologi\u00ad cal innovation are bringing their own pathologies overburdened with administrative work and often struggling to ensure the very survival of his company, the small busi\u00ad nessman finds himself alone facing a huge task. He does not have a legal department, study office or safety de\u00ad partment at his disposal like major companies, making it so much more difficult for him to keep up to date on legal provisions in the field of workers protection. The emphasis on information It is for these reasons that the Com\u00ad mission attaches priority importance to information. Every effort is made to ensure that information is circulated as widely as possible using the avail\u00ad able supports. Legal measures are not in themselves sufficient - the law means nothing if people are not aware of it. There then comes the need to effec\u00ad tively convince the small businessman of the need to provide proper protec\u00ad tion for his workers. The human aspect is of course paramount: the aim is to avoid accidents or negative effects on the health of workers. However, both SociaEurope \u03c6 ",
        "micro\u00ad and macro\u00adeconomic studies have shown that in addition to the hu\u00ad man cost, there is also an economic cost. It may be expensive to provide adequate protection for workers, but not as expensive as the risk of failing to do so. The cost to the business man\u00ad ager of providing a high standard of pro\u00ad tection for his workers will, in the long run, save losses incurred through sick\u00ad ness absence or even disablement. These are the principal areas covered by the 4th Community programme which is to be approved by the Com\u00ad mission in June (after this edition of So\u00ad cial Europe Magazine goes to press. We will return to this 4th programme in our next issue). Never again! Measures to protect workers may be expensive but not as expensive as the risks of ignoring them Free movement of workers No employment borders Any Community citizen is free to move to another Member State of the Union of which he is not a national in order to take up employment there. We take a close look at 'Employment Europe' in the company of Jos\u00e9\u00adJavier Paniagua, principal administrator at the Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs Directorate\u00adGeneral of the European Commission. Laid down in Article 48 of the Trea\u00ad ty of Rome, explained in Council Regulation 1612/68, and given a wide interpretation by the Court of Justice... the right of workers to free\u00ad dom of movement within the Euro\u00ad pean Union is more or less total. The only exceptions to the rule are jobs in the public service and which involve the safeguarding of the gen\u00ad eral interests of the State or public authorities. Member States may \u00ad on a case by case basis \u00ad reserve these jobs exclusively for their own nationals. Each country is also entitled to lim\u00ad it access to employment for reasons of public order, public security and public health. However, in this case too, any exclusion must be justified on an individual basis. Any national of a European Union Member State is entitled to seek em\u00ad ployment in another Member State. He or she has six months in which to do so and, in the view of the Court of Justice, this period may be extend\u00ad ed if the individual can establish at the end of it that he still has a 'rea\u00ad sonable' chance of finding a job in the host country. The individual must also have taken the necessary steps to find employment, such as register\u00ad ing as a job\u00adseeker. Looking for employment Job\u00adseekers who are receiving un\u00ad employment benefit in their country of origin are also free to travel to another Member State. However, they are only guaranteed three months continued benefit in the country in which they are looking for work. This benefit is paid by the country of origin. What then happens when an individ\u00ad ual finds a job in the host country? Whether working for himself or an employer, he can immediately start work. If the expected term of employ\u00ad ^ %^ \u03bd \u03c6 SociaEurope ",
        "ment is less than three months, there are no particular formalities to fulfil. In other cases, he must sim\u00ad ply apply for a residence permit from the authorities in the host country, which they are bound to provide once employment is found. Right to remain in the host country If the worker has a temporary em\u00ad ployment contract of more than three months but less than 12 months, the residence permit will be issued for the period of this em\u00ad ployment contract. If several tempo\u00ad rary employment contracts run con\u00ad secutively and the total period exceeds 12 months, the worker will then be subject to the same system as if he had a single contract run\u00ad ning for more than 12 months. He will then receive a five\u00adyear resi\u00ad dence permit, issued either free of charge or at the same price as an identity card for nationals of that country. This permit is automatically renewable. Jos\u00e9\u00adJavier Paniagua points out one practical point: the residence per\u00ad mit does not grant the worker any new rights, but simply recognizes ex\u00ad isting rights. If a worker fails to ap\u00ad ply for a residence permit, for exam\u00ad ple, the host country authorities may perhaps impose a fine, but under no circumstances can they deny him the social benefits to which he is normally entitled. Equal treatment The simple fact of working in the host country gives the expatriate worker the right to equal treatment with nationals of that country. This equal treatment covers conditions of access to employment \u00ad a correct knowledge of the host country lan\u00ad guage or languages cannot always be demanded \u00ad as well as living and working conditions such as trade un\u00ad ion rights, social and fiscal benefits, access to teaching and training. The worker may be accompanied by dependent ascendants, spouse, de\u00ad scendants and the ascendants and descendants of the spouse, irrespec\u00ad tive of their nationality. The worker's descendants must be dependent and aged under 21. The spouse and chil\u00ad dren of the migrant worker are all en\u00ad titled to work in the host country, again irrespective of nationality. Family grouping The worker enjoys the same social protection as nationals of the host country. Subject to certain condi\u00ad tions, he also has the right to remain in this country after having ceased any professional activity, as do the members of his family, who are also entitled to remain in the event of his death. If when renewing the residence per\u00ad mit it is established that the worker has been unemployed in the host country for more than 12 months, the authorities do, however, have the right to limit the period of validity of the new residence permit to one year. After this year, the worker who is still unemployed can, in theory, be re\u00ad quested to leave the host country. The need for clarification Despite the aforementioned guaran\u00ad tees, an individual seeking to travel within the Union in search of employ\u00ad ment does encounter certain obsta\u00ad cles. The original regulation providing for the free movement of workers within the Community dates back to 1968 and has never ben modified by the EU Council of Ministers, despite the Commission's proposals. As a re\u00ad sult, Community legislation is some\u00ad times too restrictive in practice and fails to take account of Europe's changing lifestyles. Mr Paniagua be\u00ad lieves that the right to family grouping should be extended to include non\u00ad married partners, non\u00addependent as\u00ad cendants and all of a worker's chil\u00ad dren, regardless of status or age. Another point is that the national au\u00ad thorities and courts are often un\u00ad aware of the very broad interpreta\u00ad tion the Court of Justice has given to Community legislation in this area. Since 1968! Workers enjoy almost total freedom of movement within the European Union SociaEurope \u03c6 ",
