        "DIRECTIVES DIRECTIVE 2009/72/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EURO\u00ad PEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu\u00ad nity, and in particular Article 47(2) and Articles 55 and 95 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ) OJ C 211, 19.8.2008, p. 23. ( Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ) OJ C 172, 5.7.2008, p. 55. ( Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 3 ) Opinion of the European Parliament of 18 June 2008 (not yet pub\u00ad lished in the Official Journal), Council Common Position of 9 January 2009 (OJ C 70 E, 24.3.2009, p. 1) and Position of the European Par\u00ad liament of 22 April 2009 (not yet published in the Official Journal). Council Decision of 25 June 2009. ( Whereas: (1) The internal market in electricity, which has been progres\u00ad sively implemented throughout the Community since 1999, aims to deliver real choice for all consumers of the European Union, be they citizens or businesses, new busi\u00ad ness opportunities and more cross-border trade, so as to achieve efficiency gains, competitive prices, and higher standards of service, and to contribute to security of sup\u00ad ply and sustainability. (2) Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity ( 4 ) OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 37. ( a contribution towards the creation of such an internal mar\u00ad ket in electricity. (3) The freedoms which the Treaty guarantees the citizens of the Union \u2014 inter alia, the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide ser\u00ad vices \u2014 are achievable only in a fully open market, which enables all consumers freely to choose their suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their customers. (4) However, at present, there are obstacles to the sale of elec\u00ad tricity on equal terms and without discrimination or dis\u00ad advantages in the Community. In particular, non- discriminatory network access and an equally effective level of regulatory supervision in each Member State do not yet exist. (5) A secure supply of electricity is of vital importance for the development of European society, the implementation of a sustainable climate change policy, and the fostering of competitiveness within the internal market. To that end, cross-border interconnections should be further developed in order to secure the supply of all energy sources at the most competitive prices to consumers and industry within the Community. (6) A well-functioning internal market in electricity should provide producers with the appropriate incentives for investing in new power generation, including in electricity from renewable energy sources, paying special attention to the most isolated countries and regions in the Communi\u00ad ty\u2019s energy market. A well-functioning market should also provide consumers with adequate measures to promote the more efficient use of energy for which a secure supply of energy is a precondition. (7) The Communication of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018An Energy Policy for Europe\u2019 highlighted the importance of completing the internal market in electric\u00ad ity and of creating a level playing field for all electricity undertakings established in the Community. The Commu\u00ad nications of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled \u2018Prospects for the internal gas and electricity market\u2019 and \u2018Inquiry pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 into the European gas and electricity sectors (Final Report)\u2019 showed that the present rules and measures do not provide the necessary framework for achieving the objective of a well-functioning internal market. 5 5 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 t n a c i f i n g i s a e d a m s h ) 4 , ) 3 , ) 2 , ) 1 ",
        "(8) In order to secure competition and the supply of electric\u00ad ity at the most competitive price, Member States and national regulatory authorities should facilitate cross- border access for new suppliers of electricity from differ\u00ad ent energy sources as well as for new providers of power generation. (9) Without effective separation of networks from activities of generation and supply (effective unbundling), there is an inherent risk of discrimination not only in the operation of the network but also in the incentives for vertically inte\u00ad grated undertakings to invest adequately in their networks. (10) The rules on legal and functional unbundling as provided for in Directive 2003/54/EC have not, however, led to effective unbundling of the transmission system operators. At its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, the European Council therefore invited the Commission to develop leg\u00ad islative proposals for the \u2018effective separation of supply and generation activities from network operations\u2019. (11) Only the removal of the incentive for vertically integrated undertakings to discriminate against competitors as regards network access and investment can ensure effec\u00ad tive unbundling. Ownership unbundling, which implies the appointment of the network owner as the system operator and its independence from any supply and pro\u00ad duction interests, is clearly an effective and stable way to solve the inherent conflict of interests and to ensure secu\u00ad rity of supply. For that reason, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 10 July 2007 on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market ( 1 ) OJ C 175 E, 10.7.2008, p. 206. ( dling at transmission level as the most effective tool by which to promote investments in infrastructure in a non- discriminatory way, fair access to the network for new entrants and transparency in the market. Under ownership unbundling, Member States should therefore be required to ensure that the same person or persons are not entitled to exercise control over a generation or supply undertaking and, at the same time, exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator or transmission system. Conversely, control over a transmission system or trans\u00ad mission system operator should preclude the possibility of exercising control or any right over a generation or supply undertaking. Within those limits, a generation or supply undertaking should be able to have a minority sharehold\u00ad ing in a transmission system operator or transmission system. (12) Any system for unbundling should be effective in remov\u00ad ing any conflict of interests between producers, suppliers and transmission system operators, in order to create incentives for the necessary investments and guarantee the access of new market entrants under a transparent and efficient regulatory regime and should not create an overly onerous regulatory regime for national regulatory authorities. (13) The definition of the term \u2018control\u2019 is taken from Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EC Merger Regulation) ( 2 ) OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1. ( (14) Since ownership unbundling requires, in some instances, the restructuring of undertakings, Member States that decide to implement ownership unbundling should be granted additional time to apply the relevant provisions. In view of the vertical links between the electricity and gas sectors, the unbundling provisions should apply across the two sectors. (15) Under ownership unbundling, to ensure full independence of network operation from supply and generation interests and to prevent exchanges of any confidential information, the same person should not be a member of the managing boards of both a transmission system operator or a trans\u00ad mission system and an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply. For the same reason, the same person should not be entitled to appoint members of the managing boards of a transmission system operator or a transmission system and to exercise control or any right over a generation or supply undertaking. (16) The setting up of a system operator or a transmission operator that is independent from supply and generation interests should enable a vertically integrated undertaking to maintain its ownership of network assets whilst ensur\u00ad ing effective separation of interests, provided that such independent system operator or such independent trans\u00ad mission operator performs all the functions of a system operator and detailed regulation and extensive regulatory control mechanisms are put in place. (17) Where, on 3 September 2009, an undertaking owning a transmission system is part of a vertically integrated under\u00ad taking, Member States should therefore be given a choice between ownership unbundling and setting up a system operator or transmission operator which is independent from supply and generation interests. (18) To preserve fully the interests of the shareholders of verti\u00ad cally integrated undertakings, Member States should have the choice of implementing ownership unbundling either by direct divestiture or by splitting the shares of the inte\u00ad grated undertaking into shares of the network undertaking and shares of the remaining supply and generation under\u00ad taking, provided that the requirements resulting from own\u00ad ership unbundling are complied with. 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 6 5 / 1 1 2 L . ) 2 - n u b n u p i h s r e n w o o t d e r r e f e r ) 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union L 211/57 (19) The full effectiveness of the independent system operator or independent transmission operator solutions should be ensured by way of specific additional rules. The rules on the independent transmission operator provide an appro\u00ad priate regulatory framework to guarantee fair competition, sufficient investment, access for new market entrants and the integration of electricity markets. Effective unbundling through the independent transmission operator provisions should be based on a pillar of organisational measures and measures relating to the governance of transmission sys\u00ad tem operators and on a pillar of measures relating to investment, connecting new production capacities to the network and market integration through regional coopera\u00ad tion. The independence of the transmission operator should also, inter alia, be ensured through certain \u2018cooling- off\u2019 periods during which no management or other rel\u00ad evant activity giving access to the same information as could have been obtained in a managerial position is exer\u00ad cised in the vertically integrated undertaking. The indepen\u00ad dent transmission operator model of effective unbundling is in line with the requirements laid down by the European Council at its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007. (20) In order to develop competition in the internal market in electricity, large non-household customers should be able to choose their suppliers and enter into contracts with sev\u00ad eral suppliers to secure their electricity requirements. Such customers should be protected against exclusivity clauses the effect of which is to exclude competing or complemen\u00ad tary offers. (21) A Member State has the right to opt for full ownership unbundling in its territory. Where a Member State has exercised that right, an undertaking does not have the right to set up an independent system operator or an indepen\u00ad dent transmission operator. Furthermore, an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply cannot directly or indirectly exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator from a Member State that has opted for full ownership unbundling. (22) Under this Directive different types of market organisation will exist in the internal market in electricity. The measures that Member States could take in order to ensure a level playing field should be based on overriding requirements of general interest. The Commission should be consulted on the compatibility of the measures with the Treaty and Community law. (23) The implementation of effective unbundling should respect the principle of non-discrimination between the public and private sectors. To that end, the same person should not be able to exercise control or any right, in violation of the rules of ownership unbundling or the independent sys\u00ad tem operator option, solely or jointly, over the composi\u00ad tion, voting or decision of the bodies of both the transmission system operators or the transmission systems and the generation or supply undertakings. With regard to ownership unbundling and the independent system opera\u00ad tor solution, provided that the Member State in question is able to demonstrate that the requirement is complied with, two separate public bodies should be able to control gen\u00ad eration and supply activities on the one hand and transmis\u00ad sion activities on the other. (24) Fully effective separation of network activities from sup\u00ad ply and generation activities should apply throughout the Community to both Community and non-Community undertakings. To ensure that network activities and supply and generation activities throughout the Community remain independent from each other, regulatory authori\u00ad ties should be empowered to refuse certification to trans\u00ad mission system operators that do not comply with the unbundling rules. To ensure the consistent application of those rules across the Community, the regulatory authori\u00ad ties should take utmost account of the Commission\u2019s opin\u00ad ion when the former take decisions on certification. To ensure, in addition, respect for the international obliga\u00ad tions of the Community, and solidarity and energy secu\u00ad rity within the Community, the Commission should have the right to give an opinion on certification in relation to a transmission system owner or a transmission system operator which is controlled by a person or persons from a third country or third countries. (25) The security of energy supply is an essential element of public security and is therefore inherently connected to the efficient functioning of the internal market in electricity and the integration of the isolated electricity markets of Member States. Electricity can reach the citizens of the Union only through the network. Functioning electricity markets and, in particular, the networks and other assets associated with electricity supply are essential for public security, for the competitiveness of the economy and for the well-being of the citizens of the Union. Persons from third countries should therefore be allowed to control a transmission system or a transmission system operator only if they comply with the requirements of effective separation that apply inside the Community. Without prejudice to the international obligations of the Commu\u00ad nity, the Community considers that the electricity trans\u00ad mission system sector is of high importance to the Community and therefore additional safeguards are neces\u00ad sary regarding the preservation of the security of supply of energy to the Community to avoid any threats to public order and public security in the Community and the wel\u00ad fare of the citizens of the Union. The security of supply of energy to the Community requires, in particular, an assess\u00ad ment of the independence of network operation, the level of the Community\u2019s and individual Member States\u2019 depen\u00ad dence on energy supply from third countries, and the treat\u00ad ment of both domestic and foreign trade and investment in energy in a particular third country. Security of supply N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 should therefore be assessed in the light of the factual cir\u00ad cumstances of each case as well as the rights and obliga\u00ad tions arising under international law, in particular the international agreements between the Community and the third country concerned. Where appropriate the Commis\u00ad sion is encouraged to submit recommendations to negoti\u00ad ate relevant agreements with third countries addressing the security of supply of energy to the Community or to include the necessary issues in other negotiations with those third countries. (26) Non-discriminatory access to the distribution network determines downstream access to customers at retail level. The scope for discrimination as regards third-party access and investment, however, is less significant at distribution level than at transmission level where congestion and the influence of generation or supply interests are generally greater than at distribution level. Moreover, legal and func\u00ad tional unbundling of distribution system operators was required, pursuant to Directive 2003/54/EC, only from 1 July 2007 and its effects on the internal market in elec\u00ad tricity still need to be evaluated. The rules on legal and functional unbundling currently in place can lead to effec\u00ad tive unbundling provided they are more clearly defined, properly implemented and closely monitored. To create a level playing field at retail level, the activities of distribu\u00ad tion system operators should therefore be monitored so that they are prevented from taking advantage of their ver\u00ad tical integration as regards their competitive position on the market, in particular in relation to household and small non-household customers. (27) Member States should encourage the modernisation of dis\u00ad tribution networks, such as through the introduction of smart grids, which should be built in a way that encour\u00ad ages decentralised generation and energy efficiency. (28) In the case of small systems it may be necessary that the provision of ancillary services is ensured by transmission system operators interconnected with small systems. (29) To avoid imposing a disproportionate financial and admin\u00ad istrative burden on small distribution system operators, Member States should be able, where necessary, to exempt the undertakings concerned from the legal distribution unbundling requirements. (30) Where a closed distribution system is used to ensure the optimal efficiency of an integrated energy supply requir\u00ad ing specific operational standards, or a closed distribution system is maintained primarily for the use of the owner of the system, it should be possible to exempt the distribu\u00ad tion system operator from obligations which would constitute an unnecessary administrative burden because of the particular nature of the relationship between the dis\u00ad tribution system operator and the users of the system. Industrial, commercial or shared services sites such as train station buildings, airports, hospitals, large camping sites with integrated facilities or chemical industry sites can include closed distribution systems because of the specia\u00ad lised nature of their operations. (31) Authorisation procedures should not lead to an adminis\u00ad trative burden disproportionate to the size and potential impact of electricity producers. Unduly lengthy authorisa\u00ad tion procedures may constitute a barrier to access for new market entrants. (32) Further measures should be taken in order to ensure trans\u00ad parent and non-discriminatory tariffs for access to net\u00ad works. Those tariffs should be applicable to all system users on a non-discriminatory basis. (33) Directive 2003/54/EC introduced a requirement for Mem\u00ad ber States to establish regulators with specific compe\u00ad tences. However, experience shows that the effectiveness of regulation is frequently hampered through a lack of inde\u00ad pendence of regulators from government, and insufficient powers and discretion. For that reason, at its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, the European Council invited the Com\u00ad mission to develop legislative proposals providing for fur\u00ad ther harmonisation of the powers and strengthening of the independence of national energy regulators. It should be possible for those national regulatory authorities to cover both the electricity and the gas sectors. (34) Energy regulators need to be able to take decisions in rela\u00ad tion to all relevant regulatory issues if the internal market in electricity is to function properly, and to be fully inde\u00ad pendent from any other public or private interests. This precludes neither judicial review nor parliamentary super\u00ad vision in accordance with the constitutional laws of the Member States. In addition, approval of the budget of the regulator by the national legislator does not constitute an obstacle to budgetary autonomy. The provisions relating to the autonomy in the implementation of the allocated budget of the regulatory authority should be implemented in the framework defined by national budgetary law and rules. While contributing to the independence of the national regulatory authority from any political or eco\u00ad nomic interest through an appropriate rotation scheme, it should be possible for Member States to take due account of the availability of human resources and of the size of the board. (35) In order to ensure effective market access for all market players, including new entrants, non-discriminatory and cost-reflective balancing mechanisms are necessary. As soon as the electricity market is sufficiently liquid, this N E 8 5 / 1 1 2 L ",
        "should be achieved through the setting up of transparent market-based mechanisms for the supply and purchase of electricity, needed in the framework of balancing require\u00ad ments. In the absence of such a liquid market, national regulatory authorities should play an active role to ensure that balancing tariffs are non-discriminatory and cost- reflective. At the same time, appropriate incentives should be provided to balance the in-put and off-take of electric\u00ad ity and not to endanger the system. Transmission system operators should facilitate participation of final customers and final customers\u2019 aggregators in reserve and balancing markets. (36) National regulatory authorities should be able to fix or approve tariffs, or the methodologies underlying the cal\u00ad culation of the tariffs, on the basis of a proposal by the transmission system operator or distribution system opera\u00ad tor(s), or on the basis of a proposal agreed between those operator(s) and the users of the network. In carrying out those tasks, national regulatory authorities should ensure that transmission and distribution tariffs are non- discriminatory and cost-reflective, and should take account of the long-term, marginal, avoided network costs from distributed generation and demand-side management measures. (37) Energy regulators should have the power to issue binding decisions in relation to electricity undertakings and to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties on electricity undertakings which fail to comply with their obligations or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties on them. Energy regulators should also be granted the power to decide, irrespective of the application of competition rules, on appropriate measures ensuring customer benefits through the promotion of effective com\u00ad petition necessary for the proper functioning of the inter\u00ad nal market in electricity. The establishment of virtual power plants \u2014 electricity release programmes whereby electricity undertakings are obliged to sell or to make avail\u00ad able a certain volume of electricity or to grant access to part of their generation capacity to interested suppliers for a certain period of time \u2014 is one of the possible measures that can be used to promote effective competition and ensure the proper functioning of the market. Energy regu\u00ad lators should also be granted the power to contribute to ensuring high standards of universal and public service in compliance with market opening, to the protection of vul\u00ad nerable customers, and to the full effectiveness of con\u00ad sumer protection measures. Those provisions should be without prejudice to both the Commission\u2019s powers con\u00ad cerning the application of competition rules including the examination of mergers with a Community dimension, and the rules on the internal market such as the free move\u00ad ment of capital. The independent body to which a party affected by the decision of a national regulator has a right to appeal could be a court or other tribunal empowered to conduct a judicial review. (38) Any harmonisation of the powers of national regulatory authorities should include the powers to provide incentives to electricity undertakings, and to impose effective, pro\u00ad portionate and dissuasive penalties on electricity undertak\u00ad ings or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties. Moreover, regulatory authorities should have the power to request relevant information from electricity undertakings, make appropriate and sufficient investiga\u00ad tions and settle disputes. (39) The internal market in electricity suffers from a lack of liquidity and transparency hindering the efficient allocation of resources, risk hedging and new entry. There is a need for enhancement of competition and security of supply through facilitated integration of new power plants into the electricity network in all Member States, in particular encouraging new market entrants. Trust in the market, its liquidity and the number of market participants needs to increase, and, therefore, regulatory oversight of undertak\u00ad ings active in the supply of electricity needs to be increased. Such requirements should be without prejudice to, and compatible with, existing Community law in relation to the financial markets. Energy regulators and financial mar\u00ad ket regulators need to cooperate in order to enable each other to have an overview over the markets concerned. (40) Prior to the adoption by the Commission of Guidelines defining further the record-keeping requirements, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators estab\u00ad lished by Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establish\u00ad ing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators ( 1 ) See page 1 of this Official Journal. ( (the \u2018Agency\u2019), and the Committee of European Securities Regulators (the \u2018CESR\u2019), established by Commission Deci\u00ad sion 2009/77/EC ( 2 ) OJ L 25, 29.1.2009, p. 18. ( mission in regard to their content. The Agency and the CESR should also cooperate to investigate further and advise on whether transactions in electricity supply con\u00ad tracts and electricity derivatives should be subject to pre- or post-trade transparency requirements and, if so, what the content of those requirements should be. (41) Member States or, where a Member State has so provided, the regulatory authority, should encourage the develop\u00ad ment of interruptible supply contracts. (42) All Community industry and commerce, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and all citizens of the Union that enjoy the economic benefits of the internal market 9 5 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 - m o C e h t e s i v d a d n a r e f n o c d l u o h s , ) 2 ) 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 should also be able to enjoy high levels of consumer pro\u00ad tection, and in particular household customers and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises should also be able to enjoy public service guarantees, in particular with regard to security of supply and reasonable tariffs, for reasons of fairness, competitiveness and, indi\u00ad rectly, to create employment. Those customers should also have access to choice, fairness, representation and dispute settlement mechanisms. (43) Nearly all Member States have chosen to ensure competi\u00ad tion in the electricity generation market through a trans\u00ad parent authorisation procedure. However, Member States should ensure the possibility to contribute to security of supply through the launching of a tendering procedure or an equivalent procedure in the event that sufficient elec\u00ad tricity generation capacity is not built on the basis of the authorisation procedure. Member States should have the possibility, in the interests of environmental protection and the promotion of new infant technologies, of tender\u00ad ing for new capacity on the basis of published criteria. Such new capacity includes, inter alia, electricity from renewable energy sources and combined heat and power. (44) In the interests of security of supply, the balance between supply and demand in individual Member States should be monitored, and such monitoring should be followed by a report on the situation at Community level, taking account of interconnection capacity between areas. Such monitor\u00ad ing should be carried out sufficiently early to enable appro\u00ad priate measures to be taken if security of supply is compromised. The construction and maintenance of the necessary network infrastructure, including interconnec\u00ad tion capacity, should contribute to ensuring a stable elec\u00ad tricity supply. The maintenance and construction of the necessary network infrastructure, including interconnec\u00ad tion capacity and decentralised electricity generation, are important elements in ensuring a stable electricity supply. (45) Member States should ensure that household customers and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, enjoy the right to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at clearly comparable, transparent and reasonable prices. In order to ensure the maintenance of the high standards of public service in the Community, all measures taken by Member States to achieve the objec\u00ad tive of this Directive should be regularly notified to the Commission. The Commission should regularly publish a report analysing measures taken at national level to achieve public service objectives and comparing their effectiveness, with a view to making recommendations as regards mea\u00ad sures to be taken at national level to achieve high public service standards. Member States should take the necessary measures to protect vulnerable customers in the context of the internal market in electricity. Such measures may dif\u00ad fer according to the particular circumstances in the Mem\u00ad ber States in question and may include specific measures relating to the payment of electricity bills, or more general measures taken in the social security system. Where uni\u00ad versal service is also provided to small enterprises, mea\u00ad sures to ensure that such universal service is provided may differ according to whether they are aimed at household customers or small enterprises. (46) Respect for the public service requirements is a fundamen\u00ad tal requirement of this Directive, and it is important that common minimum standards, respected by all Member States, are specified in this Directive, which take into account the objectives of consumer protection, security of supply, environmental protection and equivalent levels of competition in all Member States. It is important that the public service requirements can be interpreted on a national basis, taking into account national circumstances and subject to the respect of Community law. (47) It should be possible for Member States to appoint a sup\u00ad plier of last resort. That supplier may be the sales division of a vertically integrated undertaking, which also performs the functions of distribution, provided that it meets the unbundling requirements of this Directive. (48) It should be possible for measures implemented by Mem\u00ad ber States to achieve the objectives of social and economic cohesion to include, in particular, the provision of adequate economic incentives, using, where appropriate, all existing national and Community tools. Such tools may include liability mechanisms to guarantee the necessary investment. (49) To the extent to which measures taken by Member States to fulfil public service obligations constitute State aid under Article 87(1) of the Treaty, there is an obligation under Article 88(3) of the Treaty to notify them to the Commission. (50) The public service requirements, including as regards the universal service, and the common minimum standards that follow from them need to be further strengthened to make sure that all consumers, especially vulnerable ones, are able to benefit from competition and fair prices. The public service requirements should be defined at national level, taking into account national circumstances; Commu\u00ad nity law should, however, be respected by the Member States. The citizens of the Union and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, should be able to enjoy public service obligations, in particular with regard N E 0 6 / 1 1 2 L ",
        "to security of supply, and reasonable prices. A key aspect of supplying customers is access to objective and transpar\u00ad ent consumption data. Thus, consumers should have access to their consumption data and associated prices and services costs so that they can invite competitors to make an offer based on those data. Consumers should also have the right to be properly informed about their energy con\u00ad sumption. Prepayments should reflect the likely consump\u00ad tion of electricity and different payment systems should be non-discriminatory. Information on energy costs provided to consumers frequently enough will create incentives for energy savings because it will give customers direct feed\u00ad back on the effects of investment in energy efficiency and change of behaviour. In this respect, full implementation of Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use effi\u00ad ciency and energy services ( 1 ) OJ L 114, 27.4.2006, p. 64. ( reduce their energy costs. (51) Consumer interests should be at the heart of this Directive and quality of service should be a central responsibility of electricity undertakings. Existing rights of consumers need to be strengthened and guaranteed, and should include greater transparency. Consumer protection should ensure that all consumers in the wider remit of the Community benefit from a competitive market. Consumer rights should be enforced by Member States or, where a Member State has so provided, the regulatory authorities. (52) Clear and comprehensible information should be made available to consumers concerning their rights in relation to the energy sector. The Commission should establish, after consulting relevant stakeholders including Member States, national regulatory authorities, consumer organisa\u00ad tions and electricity undertakings, an accessible, user- friendly energy consumer checklist providing consumers with practical information about their rights. That check\u00ad list should be provided to all consumers and should be made publicly available. (53) Energy poverty is a growing problem in the Community. Member States which are affected and which have not yet done so should therefore develop national action plans or other appropriate frameworks to tackle energy poverty, aiming at decreasing the number of people suffering such situation. In any event, Member States should ensure the necessary energy supply for vulnerable customers. In doing so, an integrated approach, such as in the framework of social policy, could be used and measures could include social policies or energy efficiency improvements for hous\u00ad ing. At the very least, this Directive should allow national policies in favour of vulnerable customers. (54) Greater consumer protection is guaranteed by the availabil\u00ad ity of effective means of dispute settlement for all consum\u00ad ers. Member States should introduce speedy and effective complaint handling procedures. (55) It should be possible to base the introduction of intelligent metering systems on an economic assessment. Should that assessment conclude that the introduction of such meter\u00ad ing systems is economically reasonable and cost-effective only for consumers with a certain amount of electricity consumption, Member States should be able to take this into account when implementing intelligent metering systems. (56) Market prices should give the right incentives for the devel\u00ad opment of the network and for investing in new electricity generation. (57) Promoting fair competition and easy access for different suppliers and fostering capacity for new electricity genera\u00ad tion should be of the utmost importance for Member States in order to allow consumers to take full advantage of the opportunities of a liberalised internal market in electricity. (58) With a view to creating an internal market in electricity, Member States should foster the integration of their national markets and the cooperation of system operators at Community and regional level, also incorporating iso\u00ad lated systems forming electricity islands that persist in the Community. (59) The development of a true internal market in electricity, through a network connected across the Community, should be one of the main goals of this Directive and regu\u00ad latory issues on cross-border interconnections and regional markets should, therefore, be one of the main tasks of the regulatory authorities, in close cooperation with the Agency where relevant. (60) Securing common rules for a true internal market and a broad supply of electricity accessible to all should also be one of the main goals of this Directive. To that end, undis\u00ad torted market prices would provide an incentive for cross- border interconnections and for investments in new power generation while leading, in the long term, to price convergence. (61) Regulatory authorities should also provide information on the market to permit the Commission to exercise its role of observing and monitoring the internal market in elec\u00ad tricity and its short, medium and long-term evolution, 1 6 / 1 1 2 L n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 o t s r e m u s n o c p l e h l l i w ) 1 ",

National regulatory authorities should report to the competition authorities and the Com\u00ad mission those Member States in which prices impair com\u00ad petition and proper functioning of the market. (62) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the creation of a fully operational internal electricity market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can there\u00ad fore be better achieved at Community level, the Commu\u00ad nity may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.

CHAPTER II GENERAL RULES FOR THE ORGANISATION OF THE SECTOR Article 3 Public service obligations and customer protection 1. Member States shall ensure, on the basis of their institu\u00ad tional organisation and with due regard to the principle of sub\u00ad sidiarity, that, without prejudice to paragraph 2, electricity undertakings are operated in accordance with the principles of this Directive with a view to achieving a competitive, secure and environmentally sustainable market in electricity, and shall not discriminate between those undertakings as regards either rights or obligations. 2. Having full regard to the relevant provisions of the Treaty, in particular Article 86 thereof, Member States may impose on undertakings operating in the electricity sector, in the general eco\u00ad nomic interest, public service obligations which may relate to security, including security of supply, regularity, quality and price of supplies and environmental protection, including energy effi\u00ad ciency, energy from renewable sources and climate protection. Such obligations shall be clearly defined, transparent, non- discriminatory, verifiable and shall guarantee equality of access for electricity undertakings of the Community to national consum\u00ad ers. In relation to security of supply, energy efficiency/demand- side management and for the fulfilment of environmental goals and goals for energy from renewable sources, as referred to in this paragraph, Member States may introduce the implementation of long-term planning, taking into account the possibility of third parties seeking access to the system. 3. Member States shall ensure that all household customers, and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises (namely enterprises with fewer than 50 occupied persons and an annual turnover or balance sheet not exceeding EUR 10 million), enjoy universal service, that is the right to be supplied with elec\u00ad tricity of a specified quality within their territory at reasonable, easily and clearly comparable, transparent and non- discriminatory prices. To ensure the provision of universal ser\u00ad vice, Member States may appoint a supplier of last resort. Member States shall impose on distribution companies an obligation to connect customers to their network under terms, conditions and tariffs set in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 37(6). Nothing in this Directive shall prevent Member States from strengthening the market position of the household, small and medium-sized consumers by promoting the possibili\u00ad ties of voluntary aggregation of representation for that class of consumers. The first subparagraph shall be implemented in a transparent and non-discriminatory way and shall not impede the opening of the market provided for in Article 33. 4. Member States shall ensure that all customers are entitled to have their electricity provided by a supplier, subject to the sup\u00ad plier\u2019s agreement, regardless of the Member State in which the supplier is registered, as long as the supplier follows the applicable trading and balancing rules. In this regard, Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that administrative proce\u00ad dures do not discriminate against supply undertakings already registered in another Member State. 5. Member States shall ensure that: (a) where a customer, while respecting contractual conditions, wishes to change supplier, the change is effected by the operator(s) concerned within three weeks; and (b) customers are entitled to receive all relevant consumption data. Member States shall ensure that the rights referred to in points (a) and (b) are granted to customers in a non-discriminatory manner as regards cost, effort or time. 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 4 6 / 1 1 2 L , ) 1 ",

Where financial compensation, other forms of compensa\u00ad tion and exclusive rights which a Member State grants for the ful\u00ad filment of the obligations set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 are provided, this shall be done in a non-discriminatory and trans\u00ad parent way. 7. Member States shall take appropriate measures to protect final customers, and shall, in particular, ensure that there are adequate safeguards to protect vulnerable customers. In this con\u00ad text, each Member State shall define the concept of vulnerable customers which may refer to energy poverty and, inter alia, to the prohibition of disconnection of electricity to such customers in critical times. Member States shall ensure that rights and obli\u00ad gations linked to vulnerable customers are applied. In particular, they shall take measures to protect final customers in remote areas. They shall ensure high levels of consumer protection, par\u00ad ticularly with respect to transparency regarding contractual terms and conditions, general information and dispute settlement mechanisms. Member States shall ensure that the eligible cus\u00ad tomer is in fact able easily to switch to a new supplier. As regards at least household customers, those measures shall include those set out in Annex I. 8. Member States shall take appropriate measures, such as for\u00ad mulating national energy action plans, providing benefits in social security systems to ensure the necessary electricity supply to vul\u00ad nerable customers, or providing for support for energy efficiency improvements, to address energy poverty where identified, includ\u00ad ing in the broader context of poverty. Such measures shall not impede the effective opening of the market set out in Article 33 or market functioning and shall be notified to the Commission, where relevant, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 15 of this Article. Such notification may also include measures taken within the general social security system. 9. Member States shall ensure that electricity suppliers specify in or with the bills and in promotional materials made available to final customers: (a) the contribution of each energy source to the overall fuel mix of the supplier over the preceding year in a comprehensible and, at a national level, clearly comparable manner; (b) at least the reference to existing reference sources, such as web pages, where information on the environmental impact, in terms of at least CO 2 emissions and the radioactive waste resulting from the electricity produced by the overall fuel mix of the supplier over the preceding year is publicly available; (c) information concerning their rights as regards the means of dispute settlement available to them in the event of a dispute. As regards points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph with respect to electricity obtained via an electricity exchange or imported from an undertaking situated outside the Community, aggregate figures provided by the exchange or the undertaking in question over the preceding year may be used. The regulatory authority or another competent national author\u00ad ity shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the information provided by suppliers to their customers pursuant to this Article is reliable and is provided, at a national level, in a clearly compa\u00ad rable manner. 10. Member States shall implement measures to achieve the objectives of social and economic cohesion and environmental protection, which shall include energy efficiency/demand-side management measures and means to combat climate change, and security of supply, where appropriate. Such measures may include, in particular, the provision of adequate economic incen\u00ad tives, using, where appropriate, all existing national and Commu\u00ad nity tools, for the maintenance and construction of the necessary network infrastructure, including interconnection capacity. 11. In order to promote energy efficiency, Member States or, where a Member State has so provided, the regulatory authority shall strongly recommend that electricity undertakings optimise the use of electricity, for example by providing energy manage\u00ad ment services, developing innovative pricing formulas, or intro\u00ad ducing intelligent metering systems or smart grids, where appropriate. 12. Member States shall ensure the provision of single points of contact to provide consumers with all necessary information concerning their rights, current legislation and the means of dis\u00ad pute settlement available to them in the event of a dispute. Such contact points may be part of general consumer information points. 13. Member States shall ensure that an independent mecha\u00ad nism such as an energy ombudsman or a consumer body is in place in order to ensure efficient treatment of complaints and out- of-court dispute settlements. 14. Member States may decide not to apply the provisions of Articles 7, 8, 32 and/or 34 insofar as their application would obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the obligations imposed on electricity undertakings in the general economic interest and insofar as the development of trade would not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Community. The interests of the Community include, inter alia, competition with regard to eligible customers in accordance with this Directive and Article 86 of the Treaty. 15. Member States shall, upon implementation of this Direc\u00ad tive, inform the Commission of all measures adopted to fulfil uni\u00ad versal service and public service obligations, including consumer protection and environmental protection, and their possible effect on national and international competition, whether or not such measures require a derogation from this Directive.

The Commission shall establish, in consultation with rel\u00ad evant stakeholders including Member States, the national regula\u00ad tory authorities, consumer organisations, electricity undertakings and, building on the progress achieved to date, social partners, a clear and concise energy consumer checklist of practical informa\u00ad tion relating to energy consumer rights. Member States shall ensure that electricity suppliers or distribution system operators, in cooperation with the regulatory authority, take the necessary steps to provide their consumers with a copy of the energy con\u00ad sumer checklist and ensure that it is made publicly available. Article 4 Monitoring of security of supply Member States shall ensure the monitoring of security of supply issues. Where Member States consider it appropriate, they may delegate that task to the regulatory authorities referred to in Article 35. Such monitoring shall, in particular, cover the balance of supply and demand on the national market, the level of expected future demand and envisaged additional capacity being planned or under construction, and the quality and level of main\u00ad tenance of the networks, as well as measures to cover peak demand and to deal with shortfalls of one or more suppliers. The competent authorities shall publish every two years, by 31 July, a report outlining the findings resulting from the monitoring of those issues, as well as any measures taken or envisaged to address them and shall forward that report to the Commission forthwith. Article 5 Technical rules The regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall ensure that technical safety criteria are defined and that technical rules establishing the minimum tech\u00ad nical design and operational requirements for the connection to the system of generating installations, distribution systems, directly connected consumers\u2019 equipment, interconnector circuits and direct lines are developed and made public. Those technical rules shall ensure the interoperability of systems and shall be objective and non-discriminatory. The Agency may make appro\u00ad priate recommendations towards achieving compatibility of those rules, where appropriate. Those rules shall be notified to the Com\u00ad mission in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services ( 1 ) OJ L 204, 21.7.1998, p. 37. ( Article 6 Promotion of regional cooperation 1. Member States as well as the regulatory authorities shall cooperate with each other for the purpose of integrating their national markets at one or more regional levels, as a first step towards the creation of a fully liberalised internal market. In par\u00ad ticular, the regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall promote and facilitate the coop\u00ad eration of transmission system operators at a regional level, including on cross-border issues, with the aim of creating a com\u00ad petitive internal market in electricity, foster the consistency of their legal, regulatory and technical framework and facilitate inte\u00ad gration of the isolated systems forming electricity islands that per\u00ad sist in the Community. The geographical areas covered by such regional cooperation shall include cooperation in geographical areas defined in accordance with Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009. Such cooperation may cover other geographical areas. 2. The Agency shall cooperate with national regulatory authorities and transmission system operators to ensure the com\u00ad patibility of regulatory frameworks between the regions with the aim of creating a competitive internal market in electricity. Where the Agency considers that binding rules on such cooperation are required, it shall make appropriate recommendations. 3. Member States shall ensure, through the implementation of this Directive, that transmission system operators have one or more integrated system(s) at regional level covering two or more Member States for capacity allocation and for checking the secu\u00ad rity of the network. 4. Where vertically integrated transmission system operators participate in a joint undertaking established for implementing such cooperation, the joint undertaking shall establish and imple\u00ad ment a compliance programme which sets out the measures to be taken to ensure that discriminatory and anticompetitive conduct is excluded. That compliance programme shall set out the specific obligations of employees to meet the objective of excluding dis\u00ad criminatory and anticompetitive conduct. It shall be subject to the approval of the Agency. Compliance with the programme shall be independently monitored by the compliance officers of the verti\u00ad cally integrated transmission system operators. CHAPTER III GENERATION Article 7 Authorisation procedure for new capacity 1. For the construction of new generating capacity, Member States shall adopt an authorisation procedure, which shall be con\u00ad ducted in accordance with objective, transparent and non- discriminatory criteria. 2. Member States shall lay down the criteria for the grant of authorisations for the construction of generating capacity in their territory. In determining appropriate criteria, Member States shall consider: (a) the safety and security of the electricity system, installations and associated equipment; 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 6 6 / 1 1 2 L . ) 1 ",
        "(b) the protection of public health and safety; (c) the protection of the environment; (d) land use and siting; (e) the use of public ground; (f) energy efficiency; (g) the nature of the primary sources; (h) the characteristics particular to the applicant, such as techni\u00ad cal, economic and financial capabilities; (i) compliance with measures adopted pursuant to Article 3; (j) the contribution of the generating capacity to meeting the overall Community target of at least a 20 % share of energy from renewable sources in the Community\u2019s gross final con\u00ad sumption of energy in 2020 referred to in Article 3(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ( 1 ) OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 16. ( an (k) the contribution of generating capacity to reducing emissions. 3. Member States shall ensure that specific authorisation pro\u00ad cedures exist for small decentralised and/or distributed generation, which take into account their limited size and potential impact. Member States may set guidelines for that specific authorisation procedure. National regulatory authorities or other competent national authorities including planning authorities shall review those guidelines and may recommend amendments thereto. Where Member States have established particular land use permit procedures applying to major new infrastructure projects in gen\u00ad eration capacity, Member States shall, where appropriate, include the construction of new generation capacity within the scope of those procedures and shall implement them in a non- discriminatory manner and within an appropriate time-frame. 4. The authorisation procedures and criteria shall be made public. Applicants shall be informed of the reasons for any refusal to grant an authorisation. Those reasons shall be objective, non- discriminatory, well-founded and duly substantiated. Appeal pro\u00ad cedures shall be made available to the applicant. Article 8 Tendering for new capacity 1. Member States shall ensure the possibility, in the interests of security of supply, of providing for new capacity or energy efficiency/demand-side management measures through a tender\u00ad ing procedure or any procedure equivalent in terms of transpar\u00ad ency and non-discrimination, on the basis of published criteria. Those procedures may, however, be launched only where, on the basis of the authorisation procedure, the generating capacity to be built or the energy efficiency/demand-side management measures to be taken are insufficient to ensure security of supply. 2. Member States may ensure the possibility, in the interests of environmental protection and the promotion of infant new tech\u00ad nologies, of tendering for new capacity on the basis of published criteria. Such tendering may relate to new capacity or to energy efficiency/demand-side management measures. A tendering pro\u00ad cedure may, however, be launched only where, on the basis of the authorisation procedure the generating capacity to be built or the measures to be taken, are insufficient to achieve those objectives. 3. Details of the tendering procedure for means of generating capacity and energy efficiency/demand-side management mea\u00ad sures shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union at least six months prior to the closing date for tenders. The tender specifications shall be made available to any interested undertaking established in the territory of a Member State so that it has sufficient time in which to submit a tender. With a view to ensuring transparency and non-discrimination, the tender specifications shall contain a detailed description of the contract specifications and of the procedure to be followed by all tenderers and an exhaustive list of criteria governing the selection of tenderers and the award of the contract, including incentives, such as subsidies, which are covered by the tender. Those speci\u00ad fications may also relate to the fields referred to in Article 7(2). 4. In invitations to tender for the requisite generating capac\u00ad ity, consideration must also be given to electricity supply offers with long-term guarantees from existing generating units, pro\u00ad vided that additional requirements can be met in this way. 5.

Member States may allow for derogations from points (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 until 3 March 2013, provided that trans\u00ad mission system operators are not part of a vertically integrated undertaking. 5. The obligation set out in paragraph 1(a) shall be deemed to be fulfilled in a situation where two or more undertakings which own transmission systems have created a joint venture which acts as a transmission system operator in two or more Member States for the transmission systems concerned. No other undertaking may be part of the joint venture, unless it has been approved under Article 13 as an independent system operator or as an inde\u00ad pendent transmission operator for the purposes of Chapter V. 6. For the implementation of this Article, where the person referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 is the Member State or another public body, two separate public bodies exercis\u00ad ing control over a transmission system operator or over a trans\u00ad mission system on the one hand, and over an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply on the other, shall be deemed not to be the same person or persons. 7. Member States shall ensure that neither commercially sen\u00ad sitive information referred to in Article 16 held by a transmission system operator which was part of a vertically integrated under\u00ad taking, nor the staff of such a transmission system operator, is transferred to undertakings performing any of the functions of generation and supply. 8. Where on 3 September 2009, the transmission system belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking a Member State may decide not to apply paragraph 1. In such case, the Member State concerned shall either: (a) designate an independent system operator in accordance with Article 13; or (b) comply with the provisions of Chapter V. 9. Where, on 3 September 2009, the transmission system belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking and there are arrangements in place which guarantee more effective indepen\u00ad dence of the transmission system operator than the provisions of Chapter V, a Member State may decide not to apply paragraph 1. 10. Before an undertaking is approved and designated as a transmission system operator under paragraph 9 of this Article, it shall be certified according to the procedures laid down in Article 10(4), (5) and (6) of this Directive and in Article 3 of Regu\u00ad lation (EC) No 714/2009, pursuant to which the Commission shall verify that the arrangements in place clearly guarantee more effective independence of the transmission system operator than the provisions of Chapter V. 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 n o i n U n a e p o r u E e h t f o l a n r u o J l a i c i f f O N E 8 6 / 1 1 2 L r t \u2018 s m e t e h d , ) 1 ",

Where certification is requested by a transmission system owner or a transmission system operator which is controlled by a person or persons from a third country or third countries, the regulatory authority shall notify the Commission. The regulatory authority shall also notify to the Commission without delay any circumstances that would result in a person or persons from a third country or third countries acquiring control of a transmission system or a transmission system operator. 2. The transmission system operator shall notify to the regu\u00ad latory authority any circumstances that would result in a person or persons from a third country or third countries acquiring con\u00ad trol of the transmission system or the transmission system operator. 3. The regulatory authority shall adopt a draft decision on the certification of a transmission system operator within four months from the date of notification by the transmission system operator. It shall refuse the certification if it has not been demonstrated: (a) that the entity concerned complies with the requirements of Article 9; and (b) to the regulatory authority or to another competent author\u00ad ity designated by the Member State that granting certification will not put at risk the security of energy supply of the Mem\u00ad ber State and the Community. In considering that question the regulatory authority or other competent authority so des\u00ad ignated shall take into account: (i) the rights and obligations of the Community with respect to that third country arising under international law, including any agreement concluded with one or more third countries to which the Community is a party and which addresses the issues of security of energy supply; N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 ",

The regulatory authority shall notify the decision to the Commission without delay, together with all the relevant infor\u00ad mation with respect to that decision. 5. Member States shall provide for the regulatory authority or the designated competent authority referred to in paragraph 3(b), before the regulatory authority adopts a decision on the certifica\u00ad tion, to request an opinion from the Commission on whether: (a) the entity concerned complies with the requirements of Article 9; and (b) granting certification will not put at risk the security of energy supply to the Community. 6. The Commission shall examine the request referred to in paragraph 5 as soon as it is received. Within a period of two months after receiving the request, it shall deliver its opinion to the national regulatory authority or, if the request was made by the designated competent authority, to that authority. In preparing the opinion, the Commission may request the views of the Agency, the Member State concerned, and interested par\u00ad ties. In the event that the Commission makes such a request, the two-month period shall be extended by two months. In the absence of an opinion by the Commission within the period referred to in the first and second subparagraphs, the Commis\u00ad sion shall be deemed not to raise objections to the decision of the regulatory authority. 7. When assessing whether the control by a person or persons from a third country or third countries will put at risk the secu\u00ad rity of energy supply to the Community, the Commission shall take into account: (a) the specific facts of the case and the third country or third countries concerned; and (b) the rights and obligations of the Community with respect to that third country or third countries arising under interna\u00ad tional law, including an agreement concluded with one or more third countries to which the Community is a party and which addresses the issues of security of supply. 8.

Article 13 Independent system operator 1. Where the transmission system belongs to a vertically inte\u00ad grated undertaking on 3 September 2009, Member States may decide not to apply Article 9(1) and designate an independent sys\u00ad tem operator upon a proposal from the transmission system owner. Such designation shall be subject to approval by the Commission. 2. The Member State may approve and designate an indepen\u00ad dent system operator only where: (a) the candidate operator has demonstrated that it complies with the requirements of Article 9(1)(b), (c) and (d); (b) the candidate operator has demonstrated that it has at its dis\u00ad posal the required financial, technical, physical and human resources to carry out its tasks under Article 12; (c) the candidate operator has undertaken to comply with a ten- year network development plan monitored by the regulatory authority; (d) the transmission system owner has demonstrated its ability to comply with its obligations under paragraph 5. To that end, it shall provide all the draft contractual arrangements with the candidate undertaking and any other relevant entity; and (e) the candidate operator has demonstrated its ability to com\u00ad ply with its obligations under Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 including the cooperation of transmission system operators at European and regional level. 3.

When developing the transmission system, the independent system operator shall be responsible for planning (including authorisa\u00ad tion procedure), construction and commissioning of the new infrastructure. For this purpose, the independent system operator shall act as a transmission system operator in accordance with this Chapter. The transmission system owner shall not be respon\u00ad sible for granting and managing third-party access, nor for invest\u00ad ment planning. 5. Where an independent system operator has been desig\u00ad nated, the transmission system owner shall: (a) provide all the relevant cooperation and support to the inde\u00ad pendent system operator for the fulfilment of its tasks, includ\u00ad ing in particular all relevant information; (b) finance the investments decided by the independent system operator and approved by the regulatory authority, or give its agreement to financing by any interested party including the independent system operator. The relevant financing arrangements shall be subject to approval by the regulatory authority. Prior to such approval, the regulatory authority shall consult the transmission system owner together with the other interested parties; (c) provide for the coverage of liability relating to the network assets, excluding the liability relating to the tasks of the inde\u00ad pendent system operator; and (d) provide guarantees to facilitate financing any network expan\u00ad sions with the exception of those investments where, pursu\u00ad ant to point (b), it has given its agreement to financing by any interested party including the independent system operator. 6. In close cooperation with the regulatory authority, the rel\u00ad evant national competition authority shall be granted all relevant powers to effectively monitor compliance of the transmission sys\u00ad tem owner with its obligations under paragraph 5. Article 14 Unbundling of transmission system owners 1. A transmission system owner, where an independent sys\u00ad tem operator has been appointed, which is part of a vertically integrated undertaking shall be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision making from other activi\u00ad ties not relating to transmission.

Article 15 Dispatching and balancing 1. Without prejudice to the supply of electricity on the basis of contractual obligations, including those which derive from the tendering specifications, the transmission system operator shall, where it has such a function, be responsible for dispatching the generating installations in its area and for determining the use of interconnectors with other systems. 2. The dispatching of generating installations and the use of interconnectors shall be determined on the basis of criteria which shall be approved by national regulatory authorities where com\u00ad petent and which must be objective, published and applied in a non-discriminatory manner, ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market in electricity. The criteria shall take into account the economic precedence of electricity from available generating installations or interconnector transfers and the tech\u00ad nical constraints on the system. 3. A Member State shall require system operators to act in accordance with Article 16 of Directive 2009/28/EC when dis\u00ad patching generating installations using renewable energy sources. They also may require the system operator to give priority when dispatching generating installations producing combined heat and power. 4. A Member State may, for reasons of security of supply, direct that priority be given to the dispatch of generating instal\u00ad lations using indigenous primary energy fuel sources, to an extent not exceeding, in any calendar year, 15 % of the overall primary energy necessary to produce the electricity consumed in the Mem\u00ad ber State concerned. 5. The regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall require transmission system operators to comply with minimum standards for the mainte\u00ad nance and development of the transmission system, including interconnection capacity. 6. Transmission system operators shall procure the energy they use to cover energy losses and reserve capacity in their sys\u00ad tem according to transparent, non-discriminatory and market- based procedures, whenever they have such a function. 7. Rules adopted by transmission system operators for balanc\u00ad ing the electricity system shall be objective, transparent and non- discriminatory, including rules for charging system users of their networks for energy imbalance. The terms and conditions, includ\u00ad ing the rules and tariffs, for the provision of such services by transmission system operators shall be established pursuant to a methodology compatible with Article 37(6) in a non- discriminatory and cost-reflective way and shall be published. Article 16 Confidentiality for transmission system operators and transmission system owners 1. Without prejudice to Article 30 or any other legal duty to disclose information, each transmission system operator and each transmission system owner shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of car\u00ad rying out its activities, and shall prevent information about its own activities which may be commercially advantageous from being disclosed in a discriminatory manner. In particular it shall not disclose any commercially sensitive information to the remaining parts of the undertaking, unless this is necessary for carrying out a business transaction. In order to ensure the full respect of the rules on information unbundling, Member States shall ensure that the transmission system owner and the remain\u00ad ing part of the undertaking do not use joint services, such as joint legal services, apart from purely administrative or IT functions.

Those procedures shall be subject to the approval of national regulatory authorities. 2. The transmission system operator shall not be entitled to refuse the connection of a new power plant on the grounds of possible future limitations to available network capacities, such as congestion in distant parts of the transmission system. The trans\u00ad mission system operator shall supply necessary information. 3. The transmission system operator shall not be entitled to refuse a new connection point, on the ground that it will lead to additional costs linked with necessary capacity increase of system elements in the close-up range to the connection point. CHAPTER VI DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OPERATION Article 24 Designation of distribution system operators Member States shall designate or shall require undertakings that own or are responsible for distribution systems to designate, for a period of time to be determined by Member States having regard to considerations of efficiency and economic balance, one or more distribution system operators. Member States shall ensure that distribution system operators act in accordance with Articles 25, 26 and 27. Article 25 Tasks of distribution system operators 1. The distribution system operator shall be responsible for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the distribution of electricity, for operating, main\u00ad taining and developing under economic conditions a secure, reli\u00ad able and efficient electricity distribution system in its area with due regard for the environment and energy efficiency. 2. In any event, it must not discriminate between system users or classes of system users, particularly in favour of its related undertakings. 3. The distribution system operator shall provide system users with the information they need for efficient access to, including use of, the system. 4. A Member State may require the distribution system opera\u00ad tor, when dispatching generating installations, to give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources or waste or producing combined heat and power. N E 9 0 0 2 . 8 . 4 1 ",
        "Official Journal of the European Union 14.8.2009 5. Each distribution system operator shall procure the energy it uses to cover energy losses and reserve capacity in its system according to transparent, non-discriminatory and market based procedures, whenever it has such a function. That requirement shall be without prejudice to using electricity acquired under con\u00ad tracts concluded before 1 January 2002. 6. Where a distribution system operator is responsible for bal\u00ad ancing the distribution system, rules adopted by it for that pur\u00ad pose shall be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, including rules for the charging of system users of their networks for energy imbalance. Terms and conditions, including rules and tariffs, for the provision of such services by distribution system operators shall be established in accordance with Article 37(6) in a non-discriminatory and cost-reflective way and shall be published. 7. When planning the development of the distribution net\u00ad work, energy efficiency/demand-side management measures or distributed generation that might supplant the need to upgrade or replace electricity capacity shall be considered by the distribution system operator. Article 26 Unbundling of distribution system operators 1. Where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision making from other activi\u00ad ties not relating to distribution. Those rules shall not create an obligation to separate the ownership of assets of the distribution system operator from the vertically integrated undertaking. 2. In addition to the requirements under paragraph 1, where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall be independent in terms of its organisation and decision-making from the other activities not related to dis\u00ad tribution. In order to achieve this, the following minimum crite\u00ad ria shall apply: (a) those persons responsible for the management of the distri\u00ad bution system operator must not participate in company structures of the integrated electricity undertaking respon\u00ad sible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to-day operation of the generation, transmission or supply of electricity; (b) appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that the pro\u00ad fessional interests of the persons responsible for the manage\u00ad ment of the distribution system operator are taken into account in a manner that ensures that they are capable of act\u00ad ing independently; (c) the distribution system operator must have effective decision- making rights, independent from the integrated electricity undertaking, with respect to assets necessary to operate, maintain or develop the network. In order to fulfil those tasks, the distribution system operator shall have at its dis\u00ad posal the necessary resources including human, technical, physical and financial resources. This should not prevent the existence of appropriate coordination mechanisms to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the parent company in respect of return on assets, regulated indi\u00ad rectly in accordance with Article 37(6), in a subsidiary are protected. In particular, this shall enable the parent company to approve the annual financial plan, or any equivalent instrument, of the distribution system operator and to set global limits on the levels of indebtedness of its subsidiary. It shall not permit the parent company to give instructions regarding day-to-day operations, nor with respect to indi\u00ad vidual decisions concerning the construction or upgrading of distribution lines, that do not exceed the terms of the approved financial plan, or any equivalent instrument; and (d) the distribution system operator must establish a compliance programme, which sets out measures taken to ensure that discriminatory conduct is excluded, and ensure that obser\u00ad vance of it is adequately monitored. The compliance pro\u00ad gramme shall set out the specific obligations of employees to meet that objective. An annual report, setting out the mea\u00ad sures taken, shall be submitted by the person or body respon\u00ad sible for monitoring the compliance programme, the compliance officer of the distribution system operator, to the regulatory authority referred to in Article 35(1) and shall be published. The compliance officer of the distribution system operator shall be fully independent and shall have access to all the necessary information of the distribution system operator and any affiliated undertaking to fulfil his task. 3. Where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, the Member States shall ensure that the activities of the distribution system operator are monitored by regulatory authorities or other competent bodies so that it can\u00ad not take advantage of its vertical integration to distort competi\u00ad tion. In particular, vertically integrated distribution system operators shall not, in their communication and branding, create confusion in respect of the separate identity of the supply branch of the vertically integrated undertaking. 4. Member States may decide not to apply paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 to integrated electricity undertakings serving less than 100 000 connected customers, or serving small isolated systems. Article 27 Confidentiality obligation of distribution system operators Without prejudice to Article 30 or any other legal duty to disclose information, the distribution system operator must preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of carrying out its business, and shall prevent informa\u00ad tion about its own activities which may be commercially advan\u00ad tageous being disclosed in a discriminatory manner.

Member States may provide for national regulatory authori\u00ad ties or other competent authorities to classify a system which dis\u00ad tributes electricity within a geographically confined industrial, commercial or shared services site and does not, without preju\u00ad dice to paragraph 4, supply household customers, as a closed dis\u00ad tribution system if: (a) for specific technical or safety reasons, the operations or the production process of the users of that system are integrated; or (b) that system distributes electricity primarily to the owner or operator of the system or their related undertakings. 2. Member States may provide for national regulatory authori\u00ad ties to exempt the operator of a closed distribution system from: (a) the requirement under Article 25(5) to procure the energy it uses to cover energy losses and reserve capacity in its system according to transparent, non-discriminatory and market based procedures; (b) the requirement under Article 32(1) that tariffs, or the meth\u00ad odologies underlying their calculation, are approved prior to their entry into force in accordance with Article 37. 3. Where an exemption is granted under paragraph 2, the applicable tariffs, or the methodologies underlying their calcula\u00ad tion, shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with Article 37 upon request by a user of the closed distribution system. 4. Incidental use by a small number of households with employment or similar associations with the owner of the distri\u00ad bution system and located within the area served by a closed dis\u00ad tribution system shall not preclude an exemption under paragraph 2 being granted. Article 29 Combined operator Article 26(1) shall not prevent the operation of a combined trans\u00ad mission and distribution system operator provided that operator complies with Articles 9(1), or 13 and 14, or Chapter V or falls under Article 44(2). CHAPTER VII UNBUNDLING AND TRANSPARENCY OF ACCOUNTS Article 30 Right of access to accounts 1. Member States or any competent authority they designate, including the regulatory authorities referred to in Article 35, shall, insofar as necessary to carry out their functions, have right of access to the accounts of electricity undertakings as set out in Article 31. 2. Member States and any designated competent authority, including the regulatory authorities, shall preserve the confiden\u00ad tiality of commercially sensitive information. Member States may provide for the disclosure of such information where this is nec\u00ad essary in order for the competent authorities to carry out their functions. Article 31 Unbundling of accounts 1. Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the accounts of electricity undertakings are kept in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3. 2. Electricity undertakings, whatever their system of owner\u00ad ship or legal form, shall draw up, submit to audit and publish their annual accounts in accordance with the rules of national law concerning the annual accounts of limited liability companies adopted pursuant to the Fourth Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 based on Article 44(2)(g) ( * ) The title of Directive 78/660/EEC has been adjusted to take account of the renumbering of the Articles of the Treaty establishing the Euro\u00ad pean Community in accordance with Article 12 of the Treaty of Amsterdam; the original reference was to Article 54(3)(g).

Electricity undertakings shall, in their internal accounting, keep separate accounts for each of their transmission and distri\u00ad bution activities as they would be required to do if the activities in question were carried out by separate undertakings, with a view to avoiding discrimination, cross-subsidisation and distortion of competition. They shall also keep accounts, which may be con\u00ad solidated, for other electricity activities not relating to transmis\u00ad sion or distribution. Until 1 July 2007, they shall keep separate accounts for supply activities for eligible customers and supply activities for non-eligible customers. Revenue from ownership of the transmission or distribution system shall be specified in the accounts. Where appropriate, they shall keep consolidated accounts for other, non-electricity activities. The internal accounts shall include a balance sheet and a profit and loss account for each activity. 4.

Member States shall ensure the implementation of a system of third party access to the transmission and distribution systems based on published tariffs, applicable to all eligible customers and applied objectively and without discrimination between system users. Member States shall ensure that those tariffs, or the meth\u00ad odologies underlying their calculation, are approved prior to their entry into force in accordance with Article 37 and that those tar\u00ad iffs, and the methodologies \u2014 where only methodologies are approved \u2014 are published prior to their entry into force. 2. The transmission or distribution system operator may refuse access where it lacks the necessary capacity. Duly substantiated reasons must be given for such refusal, in particular having regard to Article 3, and based on objective and technically and economi\u00ad cally justified criteria. The regulatory authorities where Member States have so provided or Member States shall ensure that those criteria are consistently applied and that the system user who has been refused access can make use of a dispute settlement proce\u00ad dure. The regulatory authorities shall also ensure, where appro\u00ad priate and when refusal of access takes place, that the transmission or distribution system operator provides relevant information on measures that would be necessary to reinforce the network. The party requesting such information may be charged a reasonable fee reflecting the cost of providing such information. Article 33 Market opening and reciprocity 1. Member States shall ensure that the eligible customers comprise: (a) until 1 July 2004, the eligible customers as specified in Article 19(1) to (3) of Directive 96/92/EC. Member States shall publish by 31 January each year the criteria for the defi\u00ad nition of those eligible customers; (b) from 1 July 2004, all non-household customers; (c) from 1 July 2007, all customers. 2. To avoid imbalance in the opening of electricity markets: (a) contracts for the supply of electricity with an eligible cus\u00ad tomer in the system of another Member State shall not be prohibited if the customer is considered as eligible in both systems involved; and (b) where transactions as described in point (a) are refused because the customer is eligible in only one of the two sys\u00ad tems, the Commission may, taking into account the situation in the market and the common interest, oblige the refusing party to execute the requested supply at the request of the Member State where the eligible customer is located. Article 34 Direct lines 1. Member States shall take the measures necessary to enable: (a) all electricity producers and electricity supply undertakings established within their territory to supply their own pre\u00ad mises, subsidiaries and eligible customers through a direct line; and (b) all eligible customers within their territory to be supplied through a direct line by a producer and supply undertakings. 2. Member States shall lay down the criteria for the grant of authorisations for the construction of direct lines in their territory. Those criteria shall be objective and non-discriminatory. 3. The possibility of supplying electricity through a direct line as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not affect the possibility of contracting electricity in accordance with Article 32. 4. Member States may issue an authorisation to construct a direct line subject either to the refusal of system access on the basis, as appropriate, of Article 32 or to the opening of a dispute settlement procedure under Article 37. 5. Member States may refuse to authorise a direct line if the granting of such an authorisation would obstruct the provisions of Article 3. Duly substantiated reasons shall be given for such refusal.
