        "With 62.5 out of 100 points , Malta ranks 15th in the EU on the Gender Equality Index. Its score is 4.9 points lower than the EU\u2019s score. Between 2005 and 2017, Malta\u2019s score increased by 6.5 points (+ 2.4 points since 2015). Malta is progressing towards gender equality. Its ranking is the same as in 2005. Malta\u2019s scores are higher than the EU\u2019s scores in all domains, except the time and power domains. In the power domain, Malta\u2019s score is the lowest (32.2 points) of all. Malta\u2019s score is highest in the domain of health (92.1 points), which places it in the top three in the EU. Since 2005, Malta\u2019s scores have improved the most in the domains of work (+ 12.5 points) and money (+ 12.2 points). Progress has been slower in the domains of health (+ 1.4 points), knowledge and time (+ 3.4 points). Between 2005 and 2017, Malta improved its Index score, but had a lower score than the EU throughout the entire period. Malta moved towards gender equality at a faster rate than the EU average, decreasing its distance to the EU\u2019s score over time. 1 100 EL HU SK RO PL LT HR CZ CY BG LV EE PT MT IT AT DE EU-28 SI LU ES BE IE NL UK FI FR DK SE MT 62.5 EU 67.4 Full inequality Full equality 2017 2005 \u25b2 Increase since 2005 \u25b2 5.4 \u25b2 6.5 Each year we score EU Member States and the EU as a whole to see how far they are from reaching gender equal- ity. The Index uses a scale of 1 to 100, where 1 is for total inequality and 100 is for total equality. The scores are based on the gaps between women and men and levels of achievement in six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health. Two additional domains are integrated into the Index but do not have an impact on the final score. The domain of intersecting inequalities highlights how gender inequalities manifest in combination with age, dis/ability, country of birth, education and family type. The domain of violence against women measures and analyses women\u2019s experiences of violence. In addition to providing a snapshot into the Index scores, the Gender Equality Index 2019 includes a thematic focus on work-life balance.

        "Work Malta\u2019s score in the domain of work is 73.3, showing progress of 12.5 points since 2005 (+ 2.3 points since 2015), with significant improvement in the sub-domain of participation. The employment rate (of people aged 20-64) is 63 % for women and 86 % for men. With the overall employment rate of 75 %, Malta has reached its national EU 2020 employment target of 70 %. The full-time equivalent (FTE) employment rate rose for women (from 25 % to 40 %) and for men (from 64 % to 65 %) between 2005 and 2017. The gender gap decreased, but remains the largest in the EU. The gap is much higher among couples with children (39 percentage points (p.p.)). The FTE employment rate is 56 % for women and 95 % for men. The gender gap in FTE em- ployment rates decreases with increases in education levels: from 36 p.p. among women and men with low levels of education to 7 p.p. among those with high levels of education. Around 25 % of women work part-time, compared to 7 % of men. On average, wom- en work 36 hours per week and men work 41 hours. Despite Malta ranking second in the EU in the sub-domain of segregation, the uneven concentration of women and men in different sectors of the labour market remains an issue: 30 % of women work in education, health and social work, compared to 10 % of men. Money Malta\u2019s score in the domain of money is 82.5, showing progress of 12.2 points since 2005 (+ 0.1 points since 2015), driven by improvements in the financial situations of both women and men. Mean monthly earnings almost tripled for women and men between 2006 and 2014, but the gender gap persists: women earn 15 % less than men. The gender gap is even wider among couples with children (women earn 27 % less) and among people aged 50-64 (women earn 30 % less). The gender gap in earnings is also much big- ger among people with high level of education (30 %). The risk of poverty increased from 2005 to 2017: 17 % of women (+ 3 p.p.) and 15 % of men (+ 2 p.p.) are at risk. People facing the highest risk of poverty are: single women (32 %); couples without children (25 %); people aged 65 and over (26 % of women and 23 % of men); people born outside Malta (24 %); people with low edu- cation (23 %); and people with disabilities (23 %). Inequalities in income distribution increased among women and among men between 2005 and 2017. Women earn on average 88 cents for every euro a man makes per hour, resulting in a gender pay gap of 12 %. The gender pension gap is 44 %. Knowledge Malta\u2019s score in the domain of knowledge is 65.8, with a 3.4-point increase since 2005 (+ 0.6 points since 2015). Malta has dropped four positions since 2005 and ranks 10th in the EU. While the sub-domain of attainment and participation has advanced, the sub-domain of segregation has gone backwards. The share of women tertiary graduates increased (from 9 % to 19 %) between 2005 and 2017. For men, increases in tertiary attainment have progressed at a slower pace (from 11 % to 19 %). The gender gap in attainment is highest between lone parents (13 p.p.) and single women and men (10 p.p.) and in both cases, there are more men tertiary graduates. Malta reached its national EU 2020 target of having 33 % of people aged 30-34 obtain ter- tiary education. The current rate is 34 % (37 % for women and 32 % for men). Participation in lifelong learning increased for both women (from 12 % to 16 %) and for men (from 13 % to 15 %) between 2005 and 2017. Malta has lost its leading position and ranks fourth in the EU in the sub-domain of segre- gation. The uneven concentration of women and men in different study fields in tertiary education remains a challenge. Around 49 % of women students and 28 % of men stu- dents study education, health and welfare, or humanities and art. \u25b2 21.7 \u25b2 1.7 73.1 73.5 Participation Segregation and quality of work 73.3 \u25b2 12.5 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25b2 21.4 \u25bc 1.9 74.4 91.4 Financial resources Economic situation 82.5 \u25b2 12.2 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 \u25b2 15.3 \u25bc 11.2 65.9 65.8 Attainment and participation Segregation 65.8 \u25b2 3.4 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 ",
        "Time Malta\u2019s score in the domain of time has not changed since the last edition of the Index, because new data is not available. The next data update for this domain is expected in 2021. More frequent time-use data would help to track progress in this domain. In the domain of time, Malta\u2019s score is 64.2, with decreasing gender inequalities in the distribution of time spent on care activities and a lower involvement of both women and men in social activities. Women take on more responsibilities in family care: 42 % of women care for and educate their family members for at least one hour per day, compared to 25 % of men. Among women and men in couples with children, women are much more involved in daily care activities (85 %) than men (58 %). Around 81 % of women do cooking and housework every day for at least one hour, compared to only 37 % of men. Similar shares of women (25%) and men (26 %) participate in sporting, cultural or leisure activities outside the home. Nearly the same proportion of women (10 %) and men (11 %) are involved in voluntary or charitable activities, with participation for both decreasing since 2005. Power Malta\u2019s score in the domain of power is 32.2, with a 4.4-point increase since 2005 (+ 4.8 points since 2015). It is Malta\u2019s lowest score across all domains. Malta ranks 22nd in the EU in the domain of power. There are significant improvements in the sub-domain of social power, while the situation has slightly worsened in the sub-domain of economic power. In the sub-domain of political power, the share of women ministers has decreased (from 18 % in 2005 to 12 % in 2018). The share of women members of parliament rose (from 9 % in 2005 to 15 % in 2018). The current share of women among members of local councils is 22 %. Progress in economic power went backwards, driven by a drop in the share of women on the board of the central bank (from 25 % to 15 %), between 2005 and 2018. Women\u2019s representation on boards of the largest publicly listed companies improved over the same time (from 3 % to 9 %). In the sub-domain of social power, women make up 40 % of board members of research-funding organisations, 29 % of publicly owned broadcasting organisations, and 7 % of board members of the highest decision-making bodies of national Olympic sports organisations. Health Malta\u2019s score in the domain of health is 92.1, with a 1.4-point increase since 2005 (+ 0.3 points since 2015). Malta ranks third in the EU in the health domain. Gender equality in health status and access to health services has slightly improved. There is no new data for health behaviour. The overall level of health satisfaction increased for women (from 69 % to 74 %) and for men (from 74 % to 77 %) between 2005 and 2017. Malta has the sixth highest health satisfaction rate in the EU. Health satisfaction increases with a person\u2019s level of education and decreases in proportion to their age. The gender gap is especially wide between single women and men (41 % and 58 %). Life expectancy increased for both women and men between 2005 and 2016. Women on average live three years longer than men (84 years compared to 81 years). Malta has the third lowest percentage in the EU for unmet medical needs, and the fifth lowest percentage for unmet dental needs. Only 1 % of women and 0 % of men report unmet needs for medical examinations (compared to 5 % and 4 % in 2005), and only 2 % of women and 1 % of men report unmet dental needs (compared to 5 % and 4 % in 2005). Women and men with disabilities report slightly higher unmet needs for dental care (6 % and 5 %), compared to women and men without disabilities (3 % and 2 %). \u25b2 12.5 \u25bc 5.6 69.0 59.8 Care activities Social activities 64.2* \u25b2 3.4 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 * Scores not updated since 2017 edition. \u25b2 1.4 \u25bc 3.9 \u25b2 17.9 32.9 24.0 42.2 Political Economic Social 32.2 \u25b2 4.4 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 \u25b2 2.6 \u2014 \u25b2 2.0 96.2 81.7* 99.6 Status Behaviour Access 92.1 \u25b2 1.4 \u25b2 increase since 2005 * Scores not updated since 2017 edition.

        "Violence Violence against women is both a consequence and cause of persisting gender inequalities in the areas of work, health, money, power, knowledge and time. In con- trast to other domains, the domain of violence does not measure differences between women\u2019s and men\u2019s situ- ations but examines women\u2019s experiences of violence. For this reason, the domain of violence is not captured in the calculations of the Gender Equality Index. Instead, it is calculated as a separate composite measure of three aspects: prevalence, severity and disclosure of violence against women. The calculation of scores relied on the 2014 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights survey data results. No EU-wide survey on gender-based violence has been carried out since then. Until the com- pletion of the next survey, the scores cannot be updated. Malta signed and ratified the Council of Europe Con- vention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) in November 2014. The domain of violence presents updated data on three additional indicators to help monitor femicide, female genital mutilation and trafficking in human beings. However, not all Member States collect such data and improvements in data collection are necessary. Malta recorded two women victims of intentional homi- cide by an intimate partner in 2016. Malta does not pro- vide data on women victims of intentional homicide by a family member. EIGE\u2019s estimates show that 39 % to 57 % of 486 girls (in the resident migrant population) are at risk of female genital mutilation. Statistics on trafficking in human beings are gathered and reported. There were 16 registered women victims of trafficking in human beings in 2016. Comparable data, disaggregated by sex, is essential to the development of EU-wide strategies on preventing and eliminating violence against women across Member States. Thematic focus on work-life balance Gender Equality Index 2019 focuses on work-life balance \u2014 an issue of high political importance in the EU. In addi- tion to work-life balance related indicators captured by the Index (e.g. in the domains of work, time and knowledge), the thematic focus presents additional indicators \u2014 a work-life balance scoreboard (WLB scoreboard). The WLB scoreboard cuts across three broad areas: paid work, unpaid work (care) and education and training. It presents 15 indicators in six specific areas of concern: parental leave policies; caring for children and childcare services; informal care for older persons and persons with disabilities and long-term care services; transport and infrastructure; flexi- ble working arrangements; and lifelong learning. Parental leave policies Parental leave helps parents balance their caring duties and work life. However, it is often unavailable to potential parents, as their eligibility might be dependent on criteria such as whether a person is in paid work; whether they are an employee or self-employed; the sector in which they work; the length of service; or whether leave is accessible to same-sex couples or migrants. Changes in the labour mar- ket, such as the spread of atypical forms of employment (e.g. temporary contracts and on-demand work, bogus self-employment and voucher-based work) have increased concerns about parents\u2019 access to leave, especially in cases where it is based on definitions of traditional standard em- ployment. In 2016, 43 % of women and 12 % of men aged 20-49 (po- tential parents) were ineligible for parental leave in Malta. Unemployment or inactivity was the main reason for the ineligibility in the case of 86 % of women. The remaining 14 % of women were ineligible due to an inadequate length of employment. In Malta, same-sex parents are not eligible to take parental leave. Among the employed population, 12 % of women and 9 % of men were ineligible for parental leave. ",
        "Informal childcare and childcare services As the number of dual-earning and single-parent families grows, new needs for childcare services appear. High-quality, available, accessible and affordable childcare services are es- sential to allow parents to stay in or join the labour market and reduce the gender gap in employment. In Malta, 60 % of all informal carers of children are women. Overall, 67 % of women are involved in caring for or educating their children or grandchildren at least several times a week, compared to 54 % of men. Compared to the EU average (56 % of women and 50 % of men), more women and men are involved in caring for or educating their children or grandchil- dren in Malta. The gender gaps are wider among women and men working in the public sector (89 % and 55 %) and within the 20-49 age group (95 % and 69 %). Malta has reached both Barcelona targets to have at least 33 % of children below the age of three and 90 % of children between the age of three and school age in childcare. Over- all, 37 % of children below the age of three are under some kind of formal care arrangements, and 15 % of children this age are in formal childcare for at least 30 hours a week. For- mal childcare is provided for 91 % of children from the age of three to the minimum compulsory school age (62 % are in formal childcare for at least 30 hours a week). Around 18 % of women and men report unmet needs for formal childcare services, which is the third highest in the EU. Couples with children are more likely to report higher unmet needs for formal childcare services in Malta (20 %), compared to lone mothers (11 %). Informal care for older persons and persons with disabilities and long-term care services Available, accessible, and affordable care services and infra- structure are crucial if people with caring responsibilities are to maintain a healthy balance between their care duties and work life. This is especially relevant for women, who are often more engaged than men in both formal and informal care of older persons and/or persons with disabilities. In light of emerging demographic trends, such as ageing societies, low- er birth rates and consequently the decline of the working-age population, the need for formal and informal long-term care services has become more important than ever. Most informal carers of older persons and/or persons with disabilities in Malta are women (69 %). The shares of women and men involved in informal care of older persons and/or people with disabilities several days a week or every day are 19 % and 9 %. The proportion of women involved in informal care is 4 p.p. higher than the EU average, while the involve- ment of men is 1 p.p. lower. About 28 % of women and 16 % of men aged 50-64 take care of older persons and/or persons with disabilities, in comparison to 15 % of women and 4 % of men in the 20-49 age group. Around 22 % of women carers of older persons and/or persons with disabilities are employed, compared to 40 % of men combining care with professional responsibilities. There are also fewer women than men infor- mal carers working in the EU. However, the gender gap is wid- er in Malta than in the EU (18 p.p. compared to 14 p.p. for the EU). In the 50-64 age group, 25 % of women informal carers work, compared to 41 % of men. Around 23 % of women and 19 % of men in Malta report unmet needs for professional home care services. Transport and infrastructure Access to affordable and quality public infrastructure, including care facilities, educational facilities, health ser- vices and transportation impacts women\u2019s and men\u2019s op- portunities to balance paid work with other activities. The uneven division of caring duties and household tasks be- tween women and men influences the ways in which they use or need certain types of transport and infrastructure. Time spent commuting is a good indication of whether ex- isting public infrastructure helps or hinders women and men in juggling their everyday activities. In Malta, women and men spend around the same amount of time commuting to and from work (around 43-44 minutes per day). Single men tend to spend more time commut- ing than single women, and men travel to and from work for longer than women in a couple with children. Couples without children spend a greater amount of time commut- ing compared to couples with children, with women in a couple without children travelling around 49 minutes per day and men in a couple without children commuting for 41 minutes. Women who work part-time spend less time com- muting than men, but those in full-time work have longer commuting times than men. Women working part-time travel 35 minutes from home to work and back, while men working part-time commute for 39 minutes; for women and men working full-time, commute times are 46 minutes and 44 minutes, respectively. Generally, men are more likely to travel directly to and from work, whereas women make more multi-purpose trips, to fit in other activities, such as school drop-offs or grocery shopping. ",

If carefully designed \u2014 keeping in mind the differ- ent needs of women and men \u2014 flexible working arrange- ments can make it easier to balance work and family life. They can also support people with caring responsibilities to enter the labour market as full-time employees. Around 72 % of both women and men are unable to change their working-time arrangements. Access to flexible working arrangements is lower in Malta than in the EU, where 57 % of women and 54 % of men have no control over their work- ing-time arrangements. The private sector provides more flexibility over working time to both women and men (67 % and 66 % have no control over their working-time arrange- ments), compared to the public sector (83 % and 85 %). Even though there are more women than men working part- time in Malta, fewer women (24 %) than men (41 %) part-time workers transitioned to full-time work in 2017. The gender gap is wider than in the EU, where 14 % of women and 28 % of men moved from part-time to full-time work. Lifelong learning Constant advances in technology require workers to upskill continuously and stay up-to-date with new developments and technologies over the course of their careers. Lifelong learning is also a catalyst for gender equality as it gives women and men greater choice in their work options and more opportunities to achieve their full potential. Insuffi- cient financial resources and time-related barriers such as conflicts with work schedules and/or family responsibilities can prevent access to lifelong learning for both women and men. Lifelong learning can help women to re-enter the labour market after career breaks due to care responsibil- ities. Malta has around the EU average participation rate in life- long learning (11 %), with a narrow gender gap (2 p.p.). Women (aged 25-64) are more likely to participate in education and training than men, regardless of their employment status, with the biggest difference between employed women (16 %) and employed men (10 %). Con- flicts with work schedules are a greater barrier to partici- pation in lifelong learning for men (61 %) than for women (59 %). Family responsibilities are reported as a barrier to engagement in education and training for 61 % of women, compared to 35 % of men. Both work schedules and family responsibilities are more of an obstacle to lifelong learning in Malta than in the EU overall. In the EU, 38 % of women and 43 % of men report their work schedule to be an ob- stacle and 40 % of women and 24 % of men report that family responsibilities hinder their participation in lifelong learning.
