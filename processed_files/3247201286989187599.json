        "With less than a year to go before the next European elections, the debate on the kind of European Union that we want in the short, medium and long term is a central issue that political leaders must tackle in active cooperation with the business world, because dialogue and negotiation are two of our main currencies. In fact, one of the main conclusions of the high-level conference that the CEOE and Group I of the EESC held in Madrid on June 21 was the belief that achieving a more cohesive and competitive European Union was fundamental to generating greater growth, employment and well-being. This is an achievement that actively defends the essential values on which the EU is based and which are more relevant than ever. We are talking here about the rule of law, democracy, freedom (including free enterprise) and solidarity in all its forms. Therefore, more and better Europe must remain, without a doubt, the overall aim that guides any decision, focus or policy at EU level in order to ensure that the European Union is a genuine project for a common future, in which the expectations of businesses and individuals are fulfilled. Moreover, in a context in which populism and disaffection among the public steer much of the debate, we must not forget that the European Union, notwithstanding its shortcomings, is still our best asset. \u00a9 S h u tt e r s t o c k / R a w p i x e l . c o m ",
        "About the author: Patricia C\u00edrez Miqueleiz Vice-President of the Employers\u2019 Group Confederation of Employers and Industries of Spain (CEOE) We are facing a large number of challenges at the moment, both internally and globally; however, it is undeniable that we will only overcome these challenges if we clearly commit to the strengths of the European project. As a result, the European institutions and Member States must, on the basis of mutual trust, act in a more coordinated, consensual and, above all, faster and less bureaucratic way. This involves prioritising and focusing on what is really important, as well as providing mechanisms that allow us to anticipate and deal with unprecedented situations, such as what we are experiencing with the migration crisis. From a business perspective, the two main priorities are, without a doubt, on the one hand, to deepen the European internal market, avoiding fragmentation and anticipating the appearance of new obstacles for any company or sector. This is something that must necessarily be translated into simpler, better quality European legislation that is proportionate to the stated aim, and with an implementation process that does not foster regulatory divergences. The other priority is to achieve stronger economic and monetary union, for which it is essential to complete the Banking Union with a European deposit guarantee scheme, as well as providing European mechanisms to better manage future asymmetric shocks, with convergence as the ultimate aim. In addition, we must make progress in creating a true political union because, at the end of the day, this is the one thing that can have the greatest effect on economic performance and, therefore, on the daily lives of people and businesses. These are two major priorities, and in order to achieve them we also need to extend the necessary structural reforms of our national economies, adopt in good time a multi-year financial framework that supports investment and innovation and defend our open trade policy against protectionist tendencies. It goes without saying that we also need to finalise, correctly and in a timely fashion, the UK-EU withdrawal agreement, so that the transitional period which is fundamental for business development can take place. The current challenges, although numerous, are neither new nor insurmountable. What is currently lacking - and what we are asking for from political leaders - is greater cohesion, unity, ambition and openness to the business values of which we are proud, since they act as a catalyst for our progress. These values are: initiative, creativity, audacity, confidence, innovation, adaptability and commitment to the agreed objectives. Only in this way can the EU have a successful future. In the coming months (the second semester of 2018), during which Austria will take on the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, we must come together to make a permanent commitment to reform and change, based on continual dialogue that prioritises a return to unity of action not only on the part of the Member States but also of the European institutions. As the Austrian Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, recently said, we must all ensure that the leitmotiv of the European Union, \"United in diversity\", is not replaced by tolerated division. ",
        "Less bureaucracy, better regulation, standing strong against protectionism and completing Economic and Monetary Union \u2013 this is some of the action needed to shape the future of Europe. While citizens often forget about the benefits the EU brings, with all its flaws the Union remains our biggest asset. These are the main conclusions of the conference entitled \"The Future of the European Union \u2013 employers' perspectives\" held in Madrid on 21 June. \"We need a more consistent and less bureaucratic EU and we have to make an effort to be closer to Europe's citizens, especially young people.\" This was the message from Jos\u00e9 Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez, Vice-President of the Confederation of Employers and Industries of Spain (CEOE), in his opening speech. Values such as freedom, democracy and the free movement of people were, he said, part of the DNA of the EU. If we forgot about them, we would lose the EU. Employers' Group President Jacek Krawczyk said employers not only cared deeply about the future of the EU, but wanted to influence it \u2013 by supporting a stable macroeconomic environment, by promoting entrepreneurship and by boosting trade. He also stressed that Europe's companies played an important role in shaping the future of the EU \u2013 by generating income, by creating jobs and by keeping the EU economy rolling. We should not be afraid to continue building a united Europe and to act with unity and solidarity. Nor should we be afraid to say loud and clear what business needed in order to operate. The future of the EU? \u2013 Only in a global context! In her keynote speech, Soraya Rodr\u00edguez, the president of the Spanish parliament's Joint Committee for the EU, argued that debate on the future of Europe must be put in the global context, as the Union was facing numerous global challenges, such as the migration crisis. She emphasised that migration should also be addressed over the long term \u2013 by helping the countries of origin in their development. Isabel Colina, Deputy Director General for European Integration and European General Affairs in the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation, listed a number of areas where action would determine the future of Europe. This included adjusting EU external policy to current developments, boosting trade (with Japan, Mercosur countries and others) and supporting innovative EU industrial policy. The internal market \u2013 how to increase business opportunities The conference comprised two panels, with the first discussion focused on shaping the internal market to increase business opportunities and citizens' satisfaction in the future EU-27. Jos\u00e9 Luis Kaiser from Spain's Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism noted the role of trade in boosting growth and the challenges that global trade was currently facing. We were witnessing, he said, a growing number of protectionist measures, with the EU on the verge of a trade war with the US. In a time of unrest, it was more important than ever for Europe to uphold international rules and champion modern trade agreements. Hubert Gambs from the European Commission's DG Grow said the United Kingdom was one of the greatest advocates of the Single Market and someone should take over that role after Brexit. Emphasising the importance of completing the single market in services, he added that digitalisation offered numerous opportunities to simplify administration and reduce bureaucracy. ",
        "Marcos Casado, General Secretary of ANGED (Spanish Association of Large Retail Companies), spoke of the changing reality for retailers and the impact that regulation had on the EU competitive advantage. He complained that business was struggling with legislation that is not adapted to the digital era. Bernardo Aguilera, Director of Economic and European Affairs at CEOE, gave concrete examples of regulatory burdens that Spanish companies faced on a daily basis. Business needed fewer and clearer rules, he argued, to be able to operate more efficiently. Economic and Monetary Union \u2013 still a lot to be done The second panel was devoted to deepening the EMU to create genuine opportunities for business and increase competitiveness and growth in the EU. Paz Guzm\u00e1n from the Permanent Representation of the European Commission in Spain briefed participants on the current state of play and the roadmap for upcoming initiatives to deepen the EMU. Despite the progress in improving the EMU in recent years, Rafael Dom\u00e9nech, Head Economist of Macroeconomic Analysis at BBVA Research, thought the present architecture was not enough to deal properly with any future crisis and cope with the challenges of the ongoing digital revolution. A new EMU architecture should avoid a future sovereign debt crisis and give euro area members at least the same room for manoeuvre as non-euro countries in their economic policies. \"Our reforms are too slow and not courageous enough to address incoming challenges,\" argued Miguel Otero-Iglesias from Elcano Royal Institute of International and Strategic Studies. \"We are trying to repair a flat in a building that is collapsing. The world order we know is shaking.\" The future of the EU? \u2013 Employers are part of the solution! Between the two panels came the keynote speech from Julio Linares, board member of Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland Holding AG and Telef\u00f3nica Brasil and chairman of the CEOE's Committee on the Digital Society. Either Europe would be digital or it would not be at all, he said. The EU had to speed up digitalisation as a matter of urgency because competitiveness and growth in jobs were at stake. In her concluding remarks, the CEOE secretary general Ana Plaza affirmed: \"The EU, with all its defects and flaws, remains our best asset. Employers want to contribute to enhancing the way the Union operates.\" President Krawczyk seconded the remarks: \"The European Union is going from crisis to crisis, but especially today, when the global order we know is shaking, we must remain united and take ambitious and courageous action. Employers are part of the solution, not of the problem.\" The event was held jointly by the Confederation of Employers and Industries of Spain (CEOE) and the Employers' Group of the European Economic and Social Committee. In the afternoon, Employers' Group members had the pleasure of meeting Ana Pastor, President of the Congreso de Los Diputados (the Spanish parliament), and presenting her with the outcome of the conference.

        "About the author: Ulrich Samm Member of the Employers\u2019 Group Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres AI brings challenges in the areas of responsibility, liability, security, data protection and privacy. Problems will arise in particular if AI-based systems are used to make decisions. Many people fear that AI, using opaque algorithms and without any further human interaction, could make decisions directly affecting their personal affairs (e.g. applications, finances, health, contracts, consumption). To address this, the Commission aims to develop ethical guidelines for AI and has set up a High-level Expert Group, in which the EESC is a participant. The concept of AI is not exactly defined and is used in different ways. At the event on 18 June, the participants made it clear that even machines without AI in the narrow sense (programs capable of learning) can make decisions using complex algorithms and must therefore be taken into consideration. There is no difference in terms of ethical requirements and it therefore seems reasonable to use AI as a generic term (or jargon) for the most advanced stage of digitalisation when developing ethical guidelines. Only in this way do the Commission\u2019s various initiatives make sense. A principle that has already been formulated in various EESC opinions should be a keystone of the EU's ethical guidelines: machines must always be controlled by people . It follows from this that there must be no machines that take relevant decisions without human interaction. The criticism is often made that the USA and China are currently investing significantly more in AI than Europe. We should, however, make a distinction here, particularly as the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) highlights a clear difference in terms of fundamental rights. \uf0b7 China is massively promoting AI, inter alia in order to carry out comprehensive surveillance of its population and to establish a rating system using highly opaque methods. This is clearly in breach of European values. \uf0b7 The USA's strengths are based on commercially highly successful companies such as Google, Facebook etc., which use their customers\u2019 data mainly to generate advertising revenue. The GDPR will in future offer support to European customers using these services. \uf0b7 Europe is particularly strong in the area of automation and robotics. Using the definition set out above, investment in these areas should be included in AI but is generally not, which means that EU investment in this field is underestimated. The application of European values in the development of AI could one day be a competitive advantage, when people become increasingly aware of third-party data usage methods (USA) and the surveillance potential of AI systems (China). The greatest dangers of AI, however, are not in the field of security or data protection but, as suggested by Eric Horvitz of Microsoft Research Labs, in the field of \u201cfake news\u201d. The new technologies make it possible to fake images, film, language and text perfectly in every imaginable form. The more widely available AI becomes, the greater the potential serious threat to our democracy. The European Commission has launched a broad Artificial Intelligence (AI) initiative for Europe based on its political priorities. It was in this connection that a joint EESC-Commission AI Stakeholder Summit took place on 18 June, which addressed critical issues in the development and implementation of AI. The general objective is to use AI to benefit humanity, to seize the opportunities, to eliminate the risks and to keep Europe competitive through coordinated action. This has an impact on jobs, work organisation and training, and in particular the need for lifelong learning. \u00a9 S h u tt e r s t o c k / B l u s k y s t u d i o ",
        "The second half of this term is a rather special period: a new European Parliament will be elected in spring 2019, a new European Commission will be appointed towards the end of 2019 and the ongoing Brexit negotiations will have a considerable impact on the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the next financial period. All these events and processes will influence the work not only of the SOC Section, but also of the Committee as a whole. The SOC section priorities, which were drawn up together with the SOC bureau, reflect those of the EESC president for this half of the term and are in tune with the overall themes of the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights , the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development , the transition to a digitalised society and the need to mainstream gender equality, youth, the fight against poverty and the protection of the most vulnerable . The section will continue to monitor the process launched by the Commission of strengthening Europe's social dimension with the adoption and proclamation of a European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR) in 2017 and the White Paper on the future of the social dimension of Europe. The EPSR is a reference point for reforms aiming at upward social convergence and it promotes the identification of best practices in various fields, with both of these aspects being based on sound economic development. The section's work can facilitate mutual learning and help to improve understanding between different groups in society and different countries. The section will follow up initiatives in this area, such as \u2013 in cooperation with the European Semester group \u2013 the social scoreboard as the main instrument for measuring progress with the implementation of the EPSR as an essential step towards consolidating the European economic and social model and guaranteeing social inclusion, social investment, social innovation and access to social services. As far as the transition to a digitalised society is concerned, artificial intelligence, robots and the platform economy are fundamentally changing the world of work. Beyond employment issues, consideration needs to be given to the ethical, social and legal aspects of the interactions between human beings and machines. Trying to find a consensus on how transitions can be managed and ensuring that nobody is left behind are key issues for the section and ones which go beyond our sphere of competence to encompass other sections and permanent bodies within the EESC. The section's three pillars \u2013 employment, social affairs and citizenship \u2013 provide the headings for a more detailed description of its priorities, which are intertwined, interdependent and best addressed in a holistic approach. Employment Innovation, competitiveness, growth and employment go hand in hand. Within the context of the implementation of the EPSR, the section will examine \u2013 through its work in the Labour Market Observatory, its groups on disability rights, Roma inclusion, immigration and integration and through own initiative opinions - the causes of inequality and how to address them, working conditions, with quality work as a priority objective, the promotion of productivity and well-being at work, fair mobility, the role of the social partners, workers' involvement and participation, transitions from school to work and from job to job and respective active labour market instruments, the mobilisation of the unemployed and helping them to join the labour market. The SOC section will contribute to the fight against unemployment (in particular youth and long-term unemployment) and will respond to further follow-up initiatives in this area by looking at the political and financial instruments, including social investment, that are needed to support measures in this area. The section will continue working on further initiatives under the new skills agenda and will strive to detect and promote innovative policies. The section will comment on the annual employment report and the employment guidelines in cooperation with the European Semester group and will update its earlier work on a job-quality index. Social affairs The section will continue to focus on the social aspects of globalisation and the future of work in the digital era , which are major factors in addressing challenges such as skills and competences, life-long learning, social security and inequality, which provide the background for the implementation of the EPSR and on which it has drafted a growing body of opinions at the request of Council presidencies. In the light of the new EU vision of a \"European Education Area\" and the concepts of \"rethinking education\" and the \" knowledge ",
        "The participants focused on the role and significance of the Black Sea region and the Danube Strategy, as well as possible new types of cooperation between the Black Sea region and the Danube region. There was a specific focus on cooperation in the field of tourism covering issues such as training programmes, non-traditional forms of tourism and the sustainable development of tourism infrastructure. The exchange of good practices is important and beneficial for all of the countries involved. The best practices as regards developing the marketing and promotion of regional projects and environmentally friendly new tourist destinations will help in implementing the Danube Strategy in future. The participants also underlined the potential of small, family and traditional businesses and their importance for boosting development and economic growth. The participants stressed the importance of an integrated approach, which is particularly beneficial in policy areas such as tourism, the environment, transport and security. Such an Macro-regional cooperation is part of the process of strengthening democracy in the EU, and of strengthening bottom-up initiatives. Such cooperation is a positive catalyst, defending and complementing the EU's fundamental values. This is one of the conclusions from the conference on the \"Role and significance of the Black Sea region and its connection with the Danube Strategy\". The conference took place on 14 and 15 June in Albena, Bulgaria. approach generates interactions and synergies and allows innovative joint projects to develop. The conference welcomed the proposals from local authority representatives for a joint initiative among the municipalities from the Northern Black Sea region and the Danube region from Bulgaria and Romania aimed at drawing up joint project proposals in the framework of the future cross-border operational programme between the two countries in the field of tourism, energy and infrastructure. The event was co-organised by the Bulgarian Industrial Association, in cooperation with the Association of the Organisations of Bulgarian Employers, and the Employers' Group of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), under the aegis of the minister for the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Lilyana Pavlova. About the author: Christa Schweng Member of the Employers\u2019 Group President of SOC Section Austrian Federal Economic Chamber (WK\u00d6) society\" , the section will endeavour to play a proactive role in this field and to fine-tune the relevant policy initiatives. The aim here is to ensure that in the future, no opportunities will be lost in the world of digital transformation and that, through proper education and training, skills mismatches (under- or over- qualification) will be reduced. At the same time, the aim is also to ensure that a human-centred approach is followed, recognising the intrinsic values of education in contributing to culture and humanity more broadly. Along with the Committee's permanent bodies, the section will work towards an inclusive society by raising awareness of the specific needs of disadvantaged groups, such as people with disabilities, Roma and migrants. It will contribute to the integration of migrants through awareness-raising and its annual hosting of the European Migration Forum . Citizenship The section will contribute to the EESC's efforts to draw on the potential of culture and shared values as a unifying and mobilising force for Europe . The European social model, subsidiarity and sustainability are key components of European cultural heritage and culture can help overcome the current systemic, political and identity crisis in Europe. The mandate of the newly created Group on fundamental rights and the Rule of Law and its working procedures, as well as the role of the EESC in monitoring these issues, are still subject to discussion and a clarifying decision by the EESC Bureau. With its remit for citizenship, the section will contribute to the EESC's activities to mobilise citizens , and especially first-time voters, to exercise their right to vote in the upcoming EP elections . It will also address the threat of the shrinking space for civil society and its organisations. ",

Volvo's Director for EU Public Affairs, Karl Pihl, and Product Manager for Trucks, Philippe Jacquemyns, warmly welcomed the Transport Category members. Together they discussed Volvo's organisation and business areas, as well as its main core values, namely safety, environmental care and quality. Members learned more about the company's vision of zero emissions from trucks and engaged in a discussion on alternative fuels as a vital factor for the future. Volvo's representatives also stressed the company's steps towards renewable energy \u2013 in 2007, the Ghent factory became the first CO 2 -neutral vehicle assembly plant in the world, which was the first milestone towards the company's ambitious plan to make the entirety of its global operations climate- neutral by 2025. On the topic of mobility within cities, members discussed the path towards electro-mobility and full electrification and looked at different types of vehicles that are gradually lowering CO 2 emissions: hybrid buses (30%-40% energy reduction), electric hybrid buses (60% energy reduction), and full electric buses (80% energy reduction). Volvo's representatives made the case for automation and encouraged everyone to believe in technology. The company's progress towards automation was presented using the following five-step scale: no feet, no hands, no eyes, no head, no driver. Members then took a guided tour of the plant where they could see in real time how trucks are put together on the assembly line. Gaining hands-on experience of one of the biggest heavy-duty truck manufacturers in the world \u2013 the members of the Transport Category visited Volvo Trucks in Ghent on 27 June.
