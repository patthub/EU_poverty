It analyses the 172 responses of mainly large firms from a subsample of 1000 EU-based companies in the 2012 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard. These 172 companies are responsible for R&D investment worth \u20ac 62 billion, constituting around 41% of the total R&D investment by the 1000 EU Scoreboard companies. The main conclusion is that, between 2013-15, the responding companies expect to increase their R&D investments by 2.6% on average per year. Due to decreased expectations in the automobiles & parts sector, this is a third lower than in the previous survey. For some sectors, the expected R&D investment changes have increased compared to our previous surveys: electronic & electrical equipment (9% p.a. over the next three years), general industrials (7%), construction & materials (7%), pharmaceuticals & biotechnology (4%), and technology hardware & equipment (4%). The responding companies carry out a quarter of their R&D outside the EU. Their expectations for R&D investment for the next three years show continued participation of European companies in the global economy, in particular growth opportunities in emerging economies, while maintaining an R&D focus in the EU. Two thirds of the European companies in the sample chose their home country as the most attractive location for R&D, and identified the US, Germany, China and India as the most attractive locations outside their home country. Knowledge-sharing, human resources, proximity to other company sites and market demand make countries attractive for R&D activities. Comparing the attractiveness for R&D activities of the surveyed companies among eight EU countries, quality of R&D personnel and knowledge-sharing opportunities with universities and public organisations are most frequently stated among the top three. Comparing the attractiveness of the EU to the US, geographic proximity is leading before knowledge sharing opportunities and R&D personnel. Comparing the attractiveness of the EU to the one of China and India, for the EU geographic proximity to other company sites and technology poles & incubators is a factor for attractiveness. For China and India proximity to suppliers is making these countries attractive. ",

        "K e y F i n d i n g s 5 This report presents the main findings of the eighth survey on industrial Research & Development (R&D) investment trends. It analyses the 172 responses of mainly large firms from a subsample of 1000 EU-based companies in the 2012 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard 1 . In total, the 172 responding companies are responsible for R&D investment of almost \u20ac 62 billion. This is equivalent to around 41% of the total R&D investment by the 1000 EU Scoreboard companies. The main findings of the survey are as follows: R&D investment expectations Between 2013-15, the responding companies expect to increase their R&D investments by 2.6% on average per year. Due to decreased expectations in the automobiles & parts sector, this is a third lower than in the previous survey. 1 These are 405 EU-based companies of the world top 1500 companies in the 2012 Scoreboard and 595 additional companies from the EU with an R&D investment.above 5.26 million Euros in 2011. Seven companies in the automobiles & parts sector, constituting 40% of the R&D investment of the sample, expect their R&D investment to stagnate between 2013- 15. This concerns mainly their R&D investments in the EU and compares to much more robust growth observed in our previous surveys (5%). In contrast, the overall expectations of all the other companies in the sample show a more positive outlook for industrial R&D at exactly the same global level as in past year\u2019s survey (4%). For some sectors, the expected R&D investment changes have increased compared to our previous surveys: electronic & electrical equipment (9% p.a. over the next three years), general industrials (7%), construction & materials (7%), pharmaceuticals & biotechnology (4%), and technology hardware & equipment (4%).

The EU-based companies in the sample carry out a quarter of their R&D outside the EU, similar to our previous surveys. The largest share of R&D investment outside the EU is in the US and Canada (10%), followed by rest of the world (5%), China (4%), Japan (2%), other European countries (2%), and India (1%). Altogether, the shares of R&D investment carried out in China and India remain at a stable 5%, which is relatively low in the light of globalisation. Their expectations for R&D investment for the next three years involve the continued participation of European companies in the global economy, in particular growth opportunities in emerging economies, while maintaining an R&D focus in the EU. Low expectations for R&D in the EU (1% p.a. in 2013- 15) are due to the outlook of seven automobiles & parts companies constituting 40% of the total sample R&D. Their expectations are substantially lower than in the past: a 0.4% reduction p.a. in 2013-15 compared to a 5% increase observed in the previous surveys. The decrease of R&D investment expectations in the EU, which seems to be linked to the decrease of production and sales in Europe (see Figure 2 below), will only be partly compensated for by the expected R&D investment increase in expanding markets like China and India. The expectations from the automobiles & parts sector for R&D in the EU contrast with much higher growth expectations for the non-EU regions, especially China and India. Without these seven companies, the expected R&D investment growth in the EU would be somewhat higher (3% p.a. over the next three years). Much higher R&D investment increases are also expected in some non-EU countries: India (15%), China (9%), US and Canada (6%). Country attractiveness for R&D Two thirds of the European companies in the sample state their home country as the most attractive location for R&D. The US, Germany, China and India are as the most attractive locations outside the home country. As in earlier surveys, two out of three respondents consider their home country the most attractive location for R&D. Of all locations outside the company\u2019s home country, the US is preferred, followed by Germany, China, and India. These four countries were also the most preferred in the three previous surveys. In addition to these observations for locating R&D investment, the US, Germany, China and India were the most attractive for outsourcing R&D to other companies. Knowledge-sharing, human resources, proximity to other company sites and market demand make countries attractive for R&D activities. For the countries where companies have the largest volumes of R&D activities, the respondents state that knowledge- sharing and collaboration opportunities with universities and public research organisations, quality and quantity of R&D personnel in the labour market, proximity to other company sites, and innovation demand in terms of market size make these countries attractive.

        "K e y F i n d i n g s 7 innovation demand via product market regulation and public procurement were not as relevant for R&D attractiveness. Knowledge-sharing and collaboration opportunities are not only an important factor of country attractiveness for companies. They are widely recognised as a priority issue in many Member States and for completing the European Research Area (ERA). However, a recent report on the ERA\u2019s progress shows that public research organisations and Universities still tend to put more emphasis on developing capacities and skills than the corresponding knowledge transfer strategies. Comparing the attractiveness for R&D activities of the surveyed companies among eight EU countries, quality of R&D personnel and knowledge-sharing opportunities with universities and public organisations are most frequently stated among the top three. These are followed closely by proximity to technology poles & incubators (Sweden, Austria and Denmark) and quantity of R&D personnel (France, Italy and Poland). Geographic proximity to other company sites is attractive for R&D in Germany and the UK, and public R&D support via fiscal incentives in France and Spain. The factors that make countries less attractive for R&D are: innovation demand (via product market regulation (Finland, UK and Italy), public procurement (Belgium and Poland), market size (Austria and Denmark), market growth (France), and public R&D support (via fiscal incentives (Germany and Sweden) and via financing other non-R&D investments (Spain and Italy)). Comparing the attractiveness of the EU to the US, the proximity factor is ahead of knowledge sharing opportunities and R&D personnel. The respondents considered the US a more attractive site for R&D activity than the EU especially in terms of market size and growth, whereas the quality of R&D personnel in the labour market stood out in the EU. Market growth and public procurement are factors rated higher for the US than for the EU. Public R&D support, especially fiscal incentives, financing other (non-R&D) investments and loans and guarantees, are the lowest rated factors of attractiveness for both the EU and US. Comparing the attractiveness of the EU to that of China and India, for the EU geographic proximity to other company sites and technology poles & incubators is a factor for attractiveness. For China and India, proximity to suppliers is making these countries attractive. For EU countries, quality of R&D personnel, knowledge sharing opportunities, IPR issues and public R&D support stand out as factors for attractiveness. For China and India, quantity and cost of R&D personnel, and market size and growth are determinant for attractiveness. While these aspects may not be surprising, it should be emphasised that they correspond to actual cases of considerable R&D activity by leading companies in these countries. R&D and innovation R&D within the company is the most important component of innovation, followed by training and market research related activities for new product introduction. As observed in our previous surveys, R&D is critical for innovation for more than 98% of the respondents. Training is the second most relevant component. These two together emphasise the importance of generating internal R&D knowledge as key to innovation. They are followed by market research and related activities for new product introduction, and acquisition of new machinery & equipment. Purchase or licensing of IPRs and other knowledge is of relevance mainly for high R&D intensity sectors. R&D outsourcing to public organisations and companies inside EU countries is generally perceived as more relevant than doing this outside EU countries. However, countries like China or India play an important role for outsourcing in high R&D intensity sectors. Collaboration and knowledge sourcing The respondents report an average of 110 collaboration agreements per company, around 20% of which were new in 2012. Companies from high R&D intensity sectors report the lowest share of new collaboration agreements in 2012 (14%), compared to companies from the medium (22%) and low (27%) R&D intensity sectors. The distribution of collaboration agreements as a source of knowledge is very similar to that of R&D investment in general. The 48 responses from EU companies concentrate 75% of collaboration agreements with other firms in EU countries, followed by the US, China and India. Companies in high R&D intensity sectors stated the lowest share of collaboration agreements in the EU (57%), compared to the medium (65%) and low R&D intensity companies (78%). ",

        "1 I n t r o d u c t i o n 9 Investment in research and innovation is at the heart of Europe 2020, the European Union\u2019s ten-year growth strategy. 2 The aim of this is not only to overcome the crisis which continues to afflict many EU economies, but to address the shortcomings of its growth model and create the conditions for a different type of growth that is smarter, more sustainable and more inclusive. Five key targets have been set for the EU to achieve by the end of the decade in the areas of education, research and innovation, social inclusion and poverty reduction, and climate/energy. In practical terms, this includes seven \u2018Flagship Initiatives\u2019 providing a framework through which the EU and national authorities mutually reinforce their efforts in areas supporting Europe 2020. One of them is the Innovation Union flagship, 3 which includes a 3% EU headline target for Research & Development (R&D) investment intensity. 4 R&D investments from the private sector, however, not only play a key-role for the Innovation Union Flagship, but also other relevant Europe 2020 initiatives such as the \u201cIndustrial Policy 5 \u201d, the \u201cDigital Agenda\u201d and the \u201cNew Skills for New Jobs\u201d Flagships. The present survey is part of the Industrial Research and Innovation Monitoring and Analysis (IRIMA) initiative, 6 which supports policymakers in these initiatives and monitors progress towards the 3% headline target. The survey complements IRIMA\u2019s core activity, the EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard, 7 which analyses private R&D 2 See: European Commission: Europe 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth: http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/index_en.htm. 3 The Innovation Union flagship aims at strengthening knowledge and innovation as drivers of future growth by re-focusing R&D and innovation policies for the main challenges society faces, such as climate change, energy and resource efficiency, health and demographic change. 4 This target refers to the EU\u2019s overall (public and private) R&D investment approaching 3% of GDP (see: http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/targets_en.pdf). 5 The Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era flagship aims at improving the business environment, notably for SMEs, and supporting the development of a strong and sustainable industrial foundation for global competition. 6 See: http://iri.jrc.ec.europa.eu/. The activity is undertaken jointly by the Directorate General for Research (DG RTD C, see: http://ec.europa.eu/research/index.cfm?lg=en) and the Joint Research Centre, Institute of Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS, see: http://ipts.jrc.ec.europa.eu/activities/research-and-innovation/iri.cfm). 7 The Scoreboard is published annually and provides data and analysis on companies from the EU and abroad investing the largest sums in R&D (see: http://iri.jrc.ec.europa. eu/scoreboard.html). investments based on the audited annual accounts of companies and shows ex-post trends. The present survey is an additional instrument addressing the Scoreboard companies which collects ex-ante expectations and qualitative statements. Under the IRIMA predecessor activities, seven previous surveys 8 have been undertaken to gather information from EU companies on the factors and issues influencing R&D investment by firms. The present survey focuses on the R&D investment expectations for 2013, R&D location strategies, the relationship between R&D and innovation, and R&D knowledge sharing activities. R&D investment in the surveys refers to the total amount of R&D financed by the company, regardless of where or by whom it was performed. This excludes R&D financed by governments or other companies as well as the companies\u2019 share of any associated company or joint venture R&D investment. It includes research contracted out to other companies or public research organisations, e.g. universities. The survey reports what each responding company states as its particular financial commitment to R&D. This is different from the official statistical concept, Business Expenditure on R&D (BERD), which provides a geographical perspective. 9 The questionnaire was sent to the CEO or previous year\u2019s contact person of the 1000 European companies which appear in the 2012 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard and to five industrial associations for distribution among their members. A total of 172 responses, equivalent to a response rate of 17.2%, 10 were received. These 172 companies are responsible for a total global R&D investment of \u20ac 62 billion, which corresponds to 41% of the total R&D investment by the 1000 European Scoreboard companies. 8 See: http://iri.jrc.ec.europa.eu/survey.html 9 BERD includes R&D financed by the company itself as well as R&D performed by a company but funded from other sources. Official BERD figures comprise R&D carried out by the companies physically located in a given country or region (including foreign- owned subsidiaries), regardless of the source of funding. 10 See: Annex A: The Methodology of the 2012 Survey. 1 Introduction ",

This is diff erent from our previous surveys 11 R&D intensity is the ratio between R&D investment and net sales. An individual company may invest a large overall amount in R&D but have a low R&D intensity if net sales are high (as is the case of many oil & gas producers, for example). For the groupings see: Annex A: The Methodology of the 2012 Survey. where most R&D investment in the survey sample came from high R&D intensity companies.

Among the respondents, there are 8 medium-sized companies mainly in high R&D intensity sectors. Out of the large companies in the sample, 56 had between 251 and 5,000 employees, 64 between 5,000 and 30,000 employees and 44 more than 30,000 employees. Consequently, this survey differs from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), which uses a different sampling technique and also addresses small and medium-sized firms. 12 Similarly to our previous surveys, the response rate of repeating participants was more than 50%. 13 12 The CIS uses stratified sampling for at least 3 size classes (small, medium and large enterprises) across all EU Member States. 13 Out of the 172 responding companies, 91 had participated in the previous two surveys (past year 104 out of 187), 62 in the previous three, 44 in the previous four, 24 in the previous five, 20 in the previous six, 12 in the previous seven surveys and 7 in the previous eight surveys.

The decrease in expectations is due to seven out of the nine companies in the automobiles & parts sector which provided R&D expectations and constitute 40% of the R&D investment of the sample. Their outlook was signifi cantly lower than previous expectations (-0.7% p.a. for 2013-15 vs. around 5% in our two previous surveys, respectively). Without the automobiles & parts sector, the overall R&D investment expectations would be at the same level as that observed in last year\u2019s survey (4%).

The latter is in the low R&D intensity group, while all the former are in the medium R&D intensity group. In the high R&D intensity group, expected R&D investment changes from pharmaceuticals & biotechnology (4.4%) and technology hardware & equipment (3.6%) are slightly above those of last year\u2019s survey but below those of two years ago.

For seven of these, expectations are substantially lower than in the past: a 0.4% reduction p.a. in 2013-15 compared to a 5% increase observed in the previous survey. The decrease of R&D investment expectations in the EU, which seems to be linked to the decrease of production and sales in Europe (see Figure 6 below) 17 , will only be partly compensated for by the expected R&D investment increase in expanding markets like China and India. As shown in Figure 7 below for China, their expected R&D investment changes are in-line to the expected vehicle sales outlook for the next few years. 17 See Roland Berger: \u201cRightsizing Europe \u2013 The European car crisis and implications for automotive suppliers\u201d, March 2013 http://www.rolandberger.com/media/pdf/ Roland_Berger_Automotive_Supplier_Europe_E_20130328.pdf Figure 6: Growth of R&D investment and passenger vehicle production and sales in Western Europe -20% -15% -10% -5% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 2015e 2014e 2013e 2012* 2011* 2010* 2009* 2008* c h a n g e s p . a . automobiles & parts R&D investment of the surveyed companies production of passenger vehicles in Western Europe sales of passenger vehicles in Western Europe Note: e expected growth for the companies in the 2013 Survey * past R&D investment growth of the surveyed companies in the Scoreboard production of passenger vehicles incl. light commercial vehicles Source: European Commission JRC-IPTS (2013) and Roland Berger: \u201cRightsizing Europe \u2013 The European car crisis and implications for automotive suppliers\u201d, March 2013 Figure 7: Growth of R&D investment of EU Scoreboard and Survey companies and passenger vehicle production in China 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 2015e 2014e 2013e 2012 i n d e x 2 0 1 2 = 1 0 0 automobiles & parts in China R&D investment of the 9 surveyed companies in China passenger vehicles sales outlook in China Note: e expected Source: European Commission JRC-IPTS (2013) and Roland Berger: \u201cRightsizing Europe \u2013 The European car crisis and implications for automotive suppliers\u201d, March 2013 ",

Battelle\u2019s estimations refer to R&D funding, which has a slightly diff erent defi nition compared to R&D investment as defi ned here. 19 See: \u201cThe Industrial Research Institute\u2019s 2013 R&D Trends Forecast\u201d, Research- Technology Management, January-February 2013 The comparison of R&D investment growth expectations collected in our past surveys with the past R&D investment trends observed in the Scoreboard is shown in Figure 8. For most of the previous years, the trends of the R&D investment expectations reported in our past surveys were in line with the actual follow-up trends observed in the Scoreboards. The trends anticipated in the survey since 2007 have been statistically signifi cant. 20 The upcoming 2013 Scoreboard is scheduled to be released in November 2013. 21 20 Using two-sample t-tests with unequal variances between the trends for each of the fi ve data points, the trends were statistically signifi cant at least at the 98% level. 21 For the latest EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard see: http://iri.jrc.ec.europa. eu/reports.htm.

The current distribution in terms of shares of total R&D investment in each of the seven world regions is displayed in Figure 9 below. The EU-based companies in the sample carry out a quarter of their R&D outside the EU (24%). This is a similar share compared to those observed in our previous surveys until 2011. The largest share of R&D investment outside the EU is in the US and Canada (9.8%), followed by rest of the world (4.8%), China (3.6%), Japan (1.9%), other European countries (1.6%), and India (1.4%). Taken together, the shares of R&D investment carried out in China and India are in total 5%, which is the same level as in our previous surveys. Considering their rising share of global production and GDP, the shares in China and India remain relatively low in the light of globalisation. In addition, the location distribution of R&D investment per sector groups is also similar to that seen in previous surveys. The medium R&D intensity sector accounts for the largest share of R&D investment within the EU (82.5%), mainly due to companies from the automobiles & parts sector. Companies in high R&D intensity sectors, where Europe is already under-represented in relation to the US, 22 are the most internationalised companies outside the EU. Twenty per cent of their R&D investment is in the US and Canada which, as in most of our previous surveys, is mainly due to pharmaceuticals & biotechnology companies. 22 In the Scoreboards, the R&D investment share of high R&D intensity sectors is almost twice that of the EU for US companies, mainly due to pharmaceuticals & biotechnology and ICT-related sectors (see: The 2012 EU R&D Investment Scoreboard). 3 R&D Investment Location Figure 9: Distribution of R&D investment by world region and sector group Note: The figure refers to 136 out of the 172 EU companies in the sample, weighted by R&D investment.

As the automobiles & parts sector has an important eff ect on the level of expectations, the medium R&D intensity category is shown both with and without this sector. The distribution of growth expectations is similar to what can be observed in our previous surveys. Relatively low growth is expected for R&D investment in the EU (1.2% p.a. over the next three years, a similar level to that of our 2008 survey). Without the seven companies in the automobiles & parts sector, the expected R&D investment growth in the EU would be higher (2.9% p.a. over the next three years). Much higher growth is expected for the non-EU world regions: India (14.9%), China (9%), and the US and Canada (6.4%). Expectations for Japan, the rest of the world and other European countries lie at 2% or lower and are combined with a relatively low share in total R&D investment, which makes them more sensitive to sample composition. The expectations for the rest of the world are also lower than those observed in our 2010 survey (20%). In high R&D intensity sectors, pharmaceuticals & biotechnology and soft ware & computer services are the drivers of expectations in the US and Canada, China and India. For the medium R&D intensity sectors, general industrials and electronic & electrical equipment are drivers for expectations in the EU, which on the other hand suff er from stagnation of expectations in automobiles & parts companies. Companies from that sector, on the other hand, are expecting signifi cant R&D investment increases in other European countries and India.

        "3 R & D I n v e s t m e n t L o c a t i o n 19 In case the above pattern of R&D investment expectations materialises, this would lead to a future reduction of R&D investment shares in the EU together with growing shares in the US and Canada, China and India (Figure 11). Generally higher percentages of R&D investment growth outside the EU have been observed in four of our six previous surveys within a similar range 23 and can be considered a trend. In these past surveys, the highest growth was repeatedly expected for China and India, followed by the US and Canada, while other world regions remained at a more modest level. The decreasing shares of R&D invested in the EU occur within an overall increase in R&D investment amounts in all 23 The only exception was the 2008 survey, where R&D investment was expected to stagnate due to the impact of the economic and financial crisis in autumn 2008. world regions over the coming years. The expected nominal investment increases in the EU are of a similar magnitude to those outside the EU (around \u20ac1.2 bn over three years). In other words, the expected R&D investment growth is not distributed according to the existing R&D investment distribution in 2012, but around half in the EU and the other half outside. This has also been observed in our previous surveys and reflects the increasing participation of European companies in the global economy, and in particular emerging economies, while they retain their R&D focus in the EU. It also indicates that the gap between R&D invested by the surveyed companies in the EU and countries like China and India has not widened significantly. Figure 11: R&D investment shares in 2012 and expected in 2015, by world region Note: The figure refers to 111 out of the 172 EU companies in the sample, weighted by R&D investment and after elimination of outliers.

Countries currently considered the most attractive R&D location The respondents were asked to state the three most attractive locations for the company\u2019s R&D, without the need to refer to actual R&D sites. In this context, two thirds of the respondents considered their home country the most attractive location. This is a slightly higher share than that observed in our previous surveys. 24 The result of the ranking of the most attractive country for the company\u2019s R&D is shown in Figure 12 below. On the one hand, France and The Netherlands are the EU countries where the attractiveness index is higher for companies for which it is not the home country. On the other, Finland, Denmark, and Belgium were mentioned only by respondents for which that country is the home country. Outside the home country, the US, Germany, China and India were considered the most attractive location for R&D. These four countries were also the top four in our previous surveys although with varying preferences amongst them. A few respondents mentioned that the home country (inside the EU) remains the main location, while expansion to countries like China or India is a way to tap into growing growth opportunities outside the EU. 24 As observed in the 2010 and 2008 surveys, more than two-thirds of the respondents considered their home country as the most attractive location for R&D. 4 Country Attractiveness for R&D Figure 12: Most attractive countries for the company\u2019s R&D Note: * Based on an attractiveness index for 143 responses out of the 172 companies in the sample: countries ranked as most attractive with 3 points, as 2nd most attractive with 2 points, and as 3rd most attractive with 1 point.

This question allows for a pairwise comparison of the actual R&D sites. Similar to the observations above, nine out of ten respondents stated their home country to be one of the two with the highest volume of R&D activity (Figure 14). The biggest EU countries and the US are the countries where the respondents have the highest volumes of R&D activities. They are followed by those EU countries which are the most frequent home-base, and, as non-EU countries playing an important role for R&D investment expansion, China and India.

Above average attractiveness was stated for knowledge- sharing and collaboration opportunities with universities and public research organisations, quality and quantity of R&D personnel in the labour market, proximity to other company sites, and innovation demand in terms of market size. Knowledge-sharing and collaboration opportunities are not only an important factor in country attractiveness, but also widely recognised as a priority issue in many Member States 25 Innovation is the introduction of new or significantly improved products, services or processes. and for completing the European Research Area (ERA). 26 However, a recent report on the ERA\u2019s progress shows that public research organisations and universities still tend to put more emphasis on developing capacities and skills than the corresponding knowledge transfer strategies. 27 Quality and quantity of R&D personnel in the labour market rated clearly before labour costs. For the other factors that were not so determinant for R&D attractiveness, innovation demand was not deemed to make a country attractive for R&D via product market regulation or public procurement. Public R&D support seemed more relevant to the low R&D intensity sector, whereas IPR issues were more relevant for the medium and high R&D intensity sectors. 26 See the 2013 European Research Area Progress Report, pp.29 http://ec.europa.eu/ research/era/pdf/era_progress_report2013/era_progress_report2013.pdf 27 See the Knowledge Transfer Study 2010-2012, http://www.knowledge-transfer- study.eu/home/ Figure 15: Attractiveness of the two countries with the highest volume of R&D activities Note: The factors are grouped by the average relevance of the major items in the survey.

This section addresses the question of whether there are differences between those two countries. For the majority of the responding companies, the country with the highest volume of R&D activities is the home country (Country A: 134 out of 172). The country with the second highest volume of R&D activities in 36 cases is the home country (Country B). Only two companies report none of the two countries in neither of these two positions. On average, the majority of the respondents state that Country A (country with the highest volume of R&D activities) is more attractive than Country B (country with the second highest volume). This applies for almost all categories addressed (R&D support, geographic proximity, R&D personnel and IPR issues). It is especially pronounced with respect to collaboration and knowledge sharing (with Universities and other public institutions and also with other firms). That is particularly the case for low R&D intensity firms, but less for medium or high R&D intensity ones. However, the picture changes when it comes to innovation demand. The market with the second highest volume of R&D activities (Country B) is more attractive with respect to market growth and market size than the market with the highest R&D activities (Country A). In particular, companies from high R&D intensity sectors evaluate Country B as more important than Country A. Similar results are found for companies from medium R&D intensity sectors. For firms in low R&D intensity sectors, however, Country A (the market with the highest volume of R&D activities) is more important than Country B. Companies from high R&D intensity sectors view public R&D support as the most relevant asset of Country A compared with Country B. Companies from medium R&D intensity sectors assess collaboration and knowledge sharing as the most relevant characteristic, followed by public R&D support and R&D personnel. Companies from low R&D intensive sectors perceive collaboration & knowledge sharing as a very important characteristic of the most important R&D market.

This picture changes for firms in high R&D intensity sectors. These companies value market research inside the European Union (57.4%) as slightly less relevant than related activities in non-EU countries (59.6%). Firms across all sector groups value the acquisition of new or highly improved machinery, equipment and software within the European Union higher than acquisition from outside (non-EU) countries. This preference for internal acquisition is stronger for companies from low R&D-intensity sectors. Design is rated significantly higher by firms in medium R&D- intensity sectors than in high and low R&D-intensity sectors (60.9% vs. 34.8% and 23.8% respectively). Purchasing or licensing Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and know-how is indicated as more important for company\u00b4s innovations by firms\u2019 in high R&D-intensity sectors (both from in- and outside the EU, with a slight preference for intra-EU transactions). Companies from low and medium- high R&D intensity sectors reveal a lower relevance and favour more intra-EU activities. While firms in low, medium and high R&D-intensive sectors report a similar level of relevance for outsourcing efforts to public organisations in non-EU countries (23.3%, 16.9%, and 20.8%, respectively), differences remain when it comes to outsourcing efforts to public organisations within the European Union. These efforts are very important for companies from low R&D-intensity sectors (55.8%), but less relevant for those from medium (45.8%) and high R&D- intensity sectors (39.9%).

Comparing different outsourcing opportunities, those R&D efforts that are outsourced to companies within Europe (40.7%) are more substantial than those activities that are outsourced towards non-European countries (25.6%). That is particularly true for companies from low and medium R&D-intensity sectors. Those from low R&D-intensity sectors also state that outsourcing R&D to European companies (41.9%) is significantly more important than for non-European companies (16.3%). However, for firms from high R&D-intensity sectors, the difference between the two regions (towards companies within Europe versus non- European countries) remains rather small (43.8% vs. 39.6%). An interesting point resulting from this matter is the higher preference that companies in high R&D intensive sectors give to R&D outsourcing to public organisations and companies outside the EU, as compared with other firms that value more outsourcing activities within the EU. This is consistent with the results shown in section 4 (Figure 13), where we see the important role that certain non-EU countries like US, China and India play as R&D outsourcing location. ",
        "6 I n t e l l e c t u a l P r o p e r t y R i g h t s 33 The Commission\u2019s Innovation Union contains commitments for promoting openness and capitalising on Europe\u2019s creative potential by increasing the flows of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) via collaboration and outsourcing. Therefore, our survey questionnaire addressed R&D collaboration agreements by quantity and distribution among different world regions. Participants were asked to state the number of R&D collaboration agreements they have with other companies as well as to report the particular number of agreements signed in the year 2012. Firms responding to this question (Figure 21), state an average of 110 collaboration agreements per company. Of these, around 20% were new in 2012. Comparing firms of different R&D-intensity sector groups, companies from high R&D-intensity sectors report a higher number of total R&D collaboration agreements, followed by low and medium R&D-intensity firms. The sector with the highest number of R&D collaboration agreements is the pharmaceuticals & biotechnology sector (216; high R&D intensity), followed by the electronic & electrical equipment sector (157; medium R&D intensity). The lowest numbers are reported for banks (low R&D intensity). This picture changes when focusing on the specific agreements for the year 2012. Here, companies from low R&D-intensity sectors report the highest number for the year 2012, followed by those from medium R&D-intensity sectors. Companies in high R&D-intensity sectors report the lowest number of agreements for the year 2012. 6 Intellectual Property Rights Figure 21: Number of R&D collaboration agreements with other firms and number of new agreements in 2012 Note: Only for sectors with at least five responses.

That question was answered by 106 respondents (Figure 22). The distribution of collaboration agreements as a source of knowledge is very similar to that of R&D investment in general. The respondents, all from EU-based companies, concentrate 75% of collaboration agreements with other firms in EU countries, followed by the US, China and India. Companies from high R&D intensity sectors reported the lowest share of collaboration agreements in the EU (57%) compared to the medium (65%) and low R&D intensity ones (78%). The sector with the highest share of knowledge sourcing efforts within the EU is forestry & paper and industrial metals & mining (low R&D intensity). Knowledge-sourcing from other European countries accounts only for a small share (<5%). Companies from construction & Materials (low R&D intensity) reported the highest share. The second most significant source are agreements with firms from the US and Canada. These knowledge-sourcing efforts are in particular relevant for companies from high R&D-intensity sectors (>20%), followed by medium and low R&D-intensity ones. Companies in the technology hardware & equipment and pharmaceuticals & biotechnology (high R&D intensity) report the highest average shares. For Japan and China the results report that these countries are more important for firms from medium R&D-intensity sectors than those of high or medium R&D-intensity ones. That picture changes in the case of India, where companies from high R&D-intensity sectors value this country more than their counterparts from medium or low R&D-intensity sectors. This higher share is mainly driven by companies from the pharmaceuticals & biotechnology sector. With respect to the rest of the world as a knowledge source, the respondents stated that it is more important for companies from medium and for low R&D-intensity sectors than those from high R&D-intensity sectors. In particular, companies from industrial metals & mining companies (low R&D intensity) showed the highest share, followed by those in industrial engineering (medium R&D intensity).

        "7 A n n e x A : T h e M e t h o d o l o g y o f t h e 2 0 1 3 S u r v e y 35 Background and Approach The EU R&D surveys stem from the European Commission\u2019s \u201c3% Action Plan\u201d back in 2002 established to implement and monitor the 3% R&D investment intensity target of the Lisbon strategy. At that time, empirical evidence on private- sector R&D was scarce and official statistics on R&D and innovation, and some occasional country-specific statistics, were the main sources of these data. 32 A mapping of available trans-national data sources on industrial R&D 33 from the European Commission, OECD and European industry associations, showed that data on business enterprise R&D essentially drew upon retrospective surveys and were based on differing approaches. Statistical offices generally collect R&D data in the form of Business R&D Expenditure (BERD), which defines R&D from a top-down perspective. Private data sources and surveys by industrial associations existed but were rarely published, and there was a shortage of qualitative and forward-looking information on industrial R&D. The perspective taken in most of these surveys did not permit cross-sector comparisons at a European level and policy making in this area was usually based on results of analysis based on partial or incomplete data. In order to improve the understanding of industrial R&D and innovation in the EU and to identify medium and long-term policy implications, the European Commission established the Industrial Research and Innovation Monitoring and Analysis (IRIMA) 34 initiative, jointly carried out by the 32 See the results of the European Science and Technology Observatory (ESTO) study: \u201cMapping Surveys and other Data Sources on Industrial R&D in the EU-25 countries\u201d, Seville, June 2004. 33 See the results of the JRC-IPTS study: \u201cDescription of Information Sources on Industrial R&D data: European Commission, OECD and European Industry Associations\u201d, Seville, July 2004. 34 The rationale for the IRIMA activities emerged in the context of the European Commission\u2019s \u201c3% Action Plan\u201d established to implement and monitor the 3% R&D investment intensity target of the Lisbon strategy (\u201cInvesting in research: an action plan for Europe\u201d (COM, 2003)) and in further Communications of the Commission (\u201cMore Research and Innovation \u2013 Investing for Growth and Employment \u2013 A common approach\u201d, COM (2005) 488 final, \u201cImplementing the Community Lisbon Programme: A policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing \u2013 Towards a more integrated approach for industrial policy\u201d, COM (2005) 474 final). European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC) - Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) and the Directorate General for Research - Directorate C, Research and Innovation. The overall purpose of this project is to monitor and analyse industrial R&D and innovation activities in order to support the implementation and monitoring of the European research and innovation agenda (the Innovation Union flagship, set in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy aiming at a smarter, greener and more inclusive economy). The evidence gathered also contributes to policy-making in other relevant Europe 2020 flagship initiatives such as the \u201cIndustrial Policy\u201d, the \u201cDigital Agenda\u201d and the \u201cNew Skills for New Jobs\u201d ones. The present survey tackles the information gap identified above through an approach at the European level by gathering qualitative information on factors and issues surrounding and influencing companies\u2019 current and prospective R&D investment strategies. The survey complements other R&D investment related surveys and data collection exercises (e.g. Innobarometer, Eurostat data collection and other on- going surveys). Link to the R&D Investment Scoreboards The EU R&D survey is part of the Industrial Research and Innovation Monitoring and Analysis (IRIMA) initiative 35 and complements the EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard. 36 The Scoreboard is the main IRIMA product and serves as a tool for the European Commission to monitor and analyse 35 See: http://iri.jrc.ec.europa.eu/. The activity is undertaken jointly by the Directorate General for Research (DG RTD C, see: http://ec.europa.eu/research) and the Joint Research Centre, Institute of Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS, see: http:// ipts.jrc.ec.europa.eu/activities/research-and-innovation/iri.cfm). 36 The Scoreboard is published annually and provides data and analysis on the largest R&D investing companies in the EU and abroad (see: http://iri.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ research/scoreboard.htm). 7 Annex A: The Methodology of the 2013 Survey ",

While the Scoreboard is based on the audited annual accounts of companies and therefore looks at trends ex-post, the Survey improves the understanding of the Scoreboard companies by collecting (ex-ante) information. In addition to forward-looking perspectives on future investments, issues such as location strategies, drivers and barriers to research and innovation activities, or perception of policy support measures are addressed with a questionnaire agreed between JRC-IPTS and DG-RTD. The Survey makes efficient use of the direct contacts established with the European Scoreboard companies by adding-on to the Scoreboard mailing when the report is officially released. Methodology Outliers were detected by analysing the distribution of the dataset in scatter and boxplots and defining upper and lower quartiles ranges around the median, according to the variable(s) analysed. To maintain the maximum information in the data, outliers were eliminated only in extreme cases and after assessing the impact on the result. 37 One-year growth is simple growth over the previous year, expressed as a percentage: 1yr growth = 100*((C/B)- 1); where C = current year amount and B = previous year amount. 1yr growth is calculated only if data exist for both the current and previous year. At the aggregate level, 1yr growth is calculated only by aggregating those companies for which data exist for both the current and previous year. Three-year growth is the compound annual growth over the previous three years, expressed as a percentage: 3yr growth = 100*(((C/B)^(1/t))-1); where C = current year amount, B = base year amount (where base year = current year - 3), and t = number of time periods (= 3). 3yr growth is calculated only if data exist for the current and base years. At the aggregate level, 3yr growth is calculated only by aggregating those companies for which data exist for the current and base years. Unless otherwise stated, the weighted figures presented in this report are weighted by R&D investment. To improve response rates, the following measures were taken in the course of the survey cycle: 1. The questionnaire was revised and streamlined with a view towards keeping it as short and concise as possible and minimise the burden for the respondent. The 37 For the systematic detection of outliers, an adjusted methodology from the NIST/ SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods was applied, see: http://www.itl.nist.gov/ div898/handbook/prc/section1/prc16.htm 2013 questionnaire has a rather high number of items compared to its predecessors due to the coverage of country comparisons in questions 6 to 8. 2. The questionnaire was sent together with the Scoreboard report to take advantage of this occasion as a door- opener. 3. The cover-letter presented a figure and table with a benchmarking analysis of the company addressed compared to its peers in the same sector. 4. As well as physically sending the questionnaire to each company, an online site was provided to facilitate data entry via the European Commission\u2019s Interactive Policy-Making (IPM) tool, 38 where a Word version of the questionnaire was downloadable for offline information input. 5. The questionnaire was emailed to the respondents of previous surveys, together with a link to the electronic copy of the latest analysis. 6. The questionnaire was emailed to five industrial associations (EFPIA - European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations 39 , Europabio - The European Association for Bioindustries 40 , digitaleurope - The voice of the European digital technology industry 41 , The European Roundtable of Industrialists 42 and plasticseuorpe - Association of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe 43 ) for distribution among their members. 7. The contact database was continuously improved. Respondents who had already participated in previous surveys, or their substitutes in cases where they had left their position, were priority contacts. Returned questionnaires and reminder mailings were resent using the latest contact information on the internet or by contacting the company directly via email or phone. 8. The response rate is closely followed on a regular basis during the implementation. If necessary, measures for improving the response rate are applied, e.g. by adjusting the number of reminders, allowing more time for questionnaire reception, following up selected candidates by e-mail and phone or searching support from former survey participants 9. Personal contact, mostly by phone, was made with several dozen companies when the deadlines were close, especially for those which had participated in the past. The response rate has been steadily high over the past five years, taking full advantage of the familiarity of the EU 38 See: http://ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/ipm/index_en.htm 39 http://www.efpia.eu/ 40 http://www.europabio.org/ 41 http://www.digitaleurope.org/ 42 http://www.ert.eu/ 43 http://www.plasticseurope.org/ ",

R&D Investment Definition The objective of the survey is to address R&D investment, and not R&D expenditure, due to its direct link to the Innovation Union headline target of 3% R&D intensity for overall R&D investment of a country as a share of GDP. To make the survey as easy to complete as possible and to maximise the response rate, only a short definition of R&D investment, which is as close as possible to accounting standards, is provided in the survey. 45 The definition refers mainly to R&D as reported in the company\u2019s most recent accounts. The definition used in the survey is thus closely related to the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 38 \u201cIntangible Assets\u201d, 46 based on the OECD \u201cFrascati\u201d manual, 47 and the definition used in the EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboards. Composition of the Responses The 172 responses were classified according to the ICB 48 described in the questionnaire. Sector classifications 44 The response rate of the present survey is 17.2%, slightly lower compared to those of the last three surveys (18.7% (2012), 20.5% (2010) and 18.5% (2009)) due to an almost one-month shorter response period. Compared to the first survey in 2005, the number of responses received per day of the response period has almost doubled, which is a sign of the increasing familiarity of the Scoreboard companies with the survey activity. 45 See Annex B 46 See http://www.iasplus.com/standard/ias38.htm 47 See \u201cProposed Standard Practice for Surveys on Research and Experimental Development: Frascati Manual\u201d, OECD, Paris, 2002, http://www1.oecd.org/publications/ e-book/9202081E.PDF 48 ICB Industry Classification Benchmark (see: http://www.icbenchmark.com/docs/ ICB_StructureSheet_120104.pdf) of individual companies were cross-checked with the Scoreboards. The sectors were combined into three groups according to their average R&D intensities in the Scoreboard: \u2022 High (more than 5%) R&D intensity (49 companies) : pharmaceuticals & biotechnology, technology hardware & equipment, software & computer services, health care equipment & services, and leisure goods. \u2022 Medium (between 2 and 5%) R&D intensity (78 companies) : industrial engineering, chemicals, aerospace & defence, electronic & electrical equipment, automobiles & parts, general industrials, fixed line telecommunications, food producers, alternative energy, household goods & home construction, oil equipment, services & distribution, other financials, personal goods, beverages, and tobacco. \u2022 Low (less than 1%) R&D intensity (45 companies) : industrial metals & mining, construction & materials, banks, electricity, oil & gas producers, gas, water & multi- utilities, industrial transportation, forestry & paper, mining, and mobile telecommunications.

Among the 172 respondents there were 8 medium-sized companies mainly in the high R&D intensity sectors (according to the European Commission\u2019s SME definition, see: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/enterprise_ policy/sme_definition/index_en.htm). Among the large companies in the sample, 56 had between 251 and 5,000 employees, 64 between 5,000 and 30,000 employees and 44 more than 30,000 employees. The average net sales and employee numbers in the figure are inversely proportional to the R&D intensity of the sector group. The average number of R&D employees is considerably larger in high and medium than in the low R&D intensity sector. This is the result of the high share of R&D employees in large companies that responded from technology, hardware & equipment and pharmaceuticals & biotechnology (high R&D intensity), automobiles & parts, industrial engineering, chemicals and aerospace & defence (medium R&D intensity) sectors.

It analyses the 172 responses of mainly large firms from a subsample of 1000 EU-based companies in the 2012 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard. These 172 companies are responsible for R&D investment worth \u20ac 62 billion, constituting around 41% of the total R&D investment by the 1000 EU Scoreboard companies. The main conclusion is that, between 2013-15, the responding companies expect to increase their R&D investments by 2.6% on average per year. Due to decreased expectations in the automobiles & parts sector, this is a third lower than in the previous survey. For some sectors, the expected R&D investment changes have increased compared to our previous surveys: electronic & electrical equipment (9% p.a. over the next three years), general industrials (7%), construction & materials (7%), pharmaceuticals & biotechnology (4%), and technology hardware & equipment (4%). The responding companies carry out a quarter of their R&D outside the EU. Their expectations for R&D investment for the next three years show continued participation of European companies in the global economy, in particular growth opportunities in emerging economies, while maintaining an R&D focus in the EU. Two thirds of the European companies in the sample chose their home country as the most attractive location for R&D, and identified the US, Germany, China and India as the most attractive locations outside their home country. Knowledge-sharing, human resources, proximity to other company sites and market demand make countries attractive for R&D activities. Comparing the attractiveness for R&D activities of the surveyed companies among eight EU countries, quality of R&D personnel and knowledge-sharing opportunities with universities and public organisations are most frequently stated among the top three. Comparing the attractiveness of the EU to the US, geographic proximity is leading before knowledge sharing opportunities and R&D personnel. Comparing the attractiveness of the EU to the one of China and India, for the EU geographic proximity to other company sites and technology poles & incubators is a factor for attractiveness. For China and India proximity to suppliers is making these countries attractive. ",
