        "# 4 Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action In 2007 the European Commission launched a new approach aimed at addressing some of the challeng- es facing fisheries-dependent communities. Between 2007 and 2013, 312 local multi-actor partnerships referred to as Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) were formed in 21 Member States. These groups were able, for the first time, to use the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) to promote local development . The challenge for these groups was to create new opportunities for jobs and growth by launching alternative or complementary activities. This approach is known as Axis 4 of the EFF. For the 2014-2020 period, this approach has been extended to cover all European Structural and Investment Funds under the umbrella of Community-Led Local Development (CLLD). Hence, FLAG work involves much more than just providing financial support to individual pro- jects . Their activities aim to create new linkages between local actors, in order to provide strategic orientation for the development of the territories that they cover. FLAGs are responsible for reach- ing out towards potential beneficiaries who may not be able to receive support from mainstream funding sources. Ultimately these efforts of the FLAG are only fully successful if they enable and equip project promoters to deliver innovative high quality projects that are coherent with the FLAG\u2019s strategy. As the EFF implementation period draws to a close, it is timely to review what has been achieved through projects financed by Axis 4 in fisheries ar- eas across the EU. An exhibition of 42 projects supported by Axis 4 forms a central element of the \u201cSailing towards 2020\u201d event. C H A P T E R 1 Sailing towards 2020 The 2015 conference \u201cSailing towards 2020: Com- munity-Led Local Development in coastal commu- nities\u201d, organised by the European Commission\u2019s Directorate General for Fisheries and Maritime Af- fairs (DG MARE), together with the Fisheries Areas Network (FARNET), involves FLAGs, EFF Managing Authorities and other stakeholders to look back at the achievements of Axis 4 since 2007 and explore the new challenges and opportunities of the 2014- 2020 period. 9 500 projects, but also much more Between 2007 and mid-2014, the FLAGs had sup- ported approximately 9 500 projects. These were implemented by a wide range of local promoters, including fishermen, businesses, civil society or- ganisations and local governments. A 2014 study 1 for DG MARE indicates that these FLAG projects produced significant employment results (esti- mated to include as many as 8 000 new jobs creat- ed and 12 500 existing jobs safeguarded). 1 http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/documentation/studies/axis-4/ index_en.htm ",
        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 5 FLAGs across the EU were been invited to pro- pose their most interesting projects supported by Axis 4 for this exhibition and around 200 projects were submitted. The 42 projects selected for the exhibition provide a taste of the diversity of initia- tives across Europe. They have been grouped into eight clusters, representing some of the most common types of projects supported by FLAGs from around the EU. These are: > Shortening supply chains; > Adding value locally to fisheries products; > Enhancing the environment; > Improving the image of fisheries; > Linking fisheries with tourism; > Developing new activities from fisheries; > Making fisheries areas attractive; and > Investing in people. These projects illustrate many of the positive ef- fects the FLAGs can have locally such as bringing together different actors and helping create jobs and new sources of income. FLAG activities have also helped the voice of fisheries communities to be heard as well as supporting groups that are traditionally hard to reach, such as the long-term unemployed. In the next programming period, FLAGs will benefit from this experience to help generate projects of an even higher quality. About this brochure The following chapters present an overview of each of the 42 projects featured in the conference exhibition, followed by an analysis of how these projects have contributed to the development of their fisheries areas. The final chapter presents a reflection on the new challenges and opportuni- ties of the new period and on the types of CLLD projects that may be supported by FLAGs under the EMFF 2014-2020. This brochure is primarily addressed to partic- ipants at the \u201cSailing towards 2020\u201d event, but it may also be relevant for organisations or individu- als interested in the community-led local develop- ment. Stakeholders (FLAGs, Managing Authorities, project promoters) may use it as a source of inspi- ration for future projects; and these EFF project ex- amples could also interest wider audiences, such as researchers, evaluators, NGOs and/or the media. The FARNET Support Unit would like to express its thanks to all FLAGs and project promoters for their good will and patience in answering questions con- cerning the projects selected for the exhibition .

        "# 8 Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action Shortening Supply Chains Selling fish to the final consumer with the minimum number of intermediaries is a way for fishing crews and aquaculture producers to retain a larger share of the income derived from their labour. It can also help reconnect the public with this traditional activity by building relationships between fisheries businesses and consumers, as well as improve the visibility of the fisheries sector. Supporting shorter supply chains can therefore lay the foundations for more sus- tainable livelihoods for fishing families in the long term. Realising this potential, many FLAGs across the EU have used Axis 4 to support projects aiming to facilitate sales of locally caught fish, either directly by fishing crews or through the fish auction, depending on the national legal requirements. The projects in this cluster present a number of options open to fishermen to shorten the existing supply chain. They range from direct sales from a family-run fishing boat, including home delivery, to creating a \u201cfish shop\u201d in a traditional fishing boat in a busy city centre. Other projects have achieved cooperation between neighbouring fishermen\u2019s associations to market their fish on a common online platform. Fur- ther interesting examples featured below involve encouraging restaurants and food stores to purchase fish directly from their local auction. Cooperation between fishing businesses emerges from many of these examples as a key success factor for shortening the supply chain. Together, the projects illustrate how investing in short circuit marketing can increase fishermen\u2019s incomes and volume of sales, as well as developing new and more solid customer bases.

        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 9 Fish All Days allows customers to buy fresh fish directly from the boat \u2013 or have it delivered to their doorstep. By combining more traditional educational and promotional campaigns with the use of new technology and social media, a trawler from Molfetta in Italy has developed a loyal network of customers. The family fishing company, Facchini Pesca, was suffering from poor prices for its catch at the lo- cal wholesale auction. The project consisted of equipping the family boat to be able to sell their fish directly to the consumer. Health and safety rules were prioritised by the project, which also involved equipping the company van to transport fish in refrigerated conditions. This was followed by substantial work to promote the company\u2019s di- rect sales service and raise awareness among the local population of the health benefits of eating traceable and quality, local fish . Actions included the development of flyers and place mats for lo- cal restaurants; a website with information and prices of fish caught by Facchi- ni Pesca and the use social media to promote the product.

        "# 10 Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action The Thorup beach fishermen\u2019s guild (Thorupstrand Kystfisker- laug) has converted a traditional fishing boat into a floating fish shop and obtained authorisation to moor it in the heart of Copen- hagen. This is giving the fishing guild\u2019s products a special entry point to the Danish capital\u2019s affluent market. After setting up a guild to buy up privatised fish quotas to ensure that fishing opportunities would remain in the hands of its local commu- nity, the Thorupstrand fishermen improved the marketing of their catch by selling their fish di- rectly using one of their reconverted boats as a unique selling place. They moor this boat in the heart of Copenha- gen, offering an amazing showcase for the Thorupstrand products. The fish is brought directly by truck to Copenhagen and is some of the freshest you can find in the capital, as Thorupstrand boats only work daily trips. The guild has hired a chef to manage the shop, which in addition to whole fresh fish also offers fillets, fresh fish burgers and other small dishes prepared in the guild\u2019s processing plant.

        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 11 The Costa da Morte FLAG from Spain brought together nine Cof- rad\u00edas (fishermen\u2019s associations), involving more than 500 Gali- cian fishermen and shellfish producers, to develop and pilot an online sales platform. Rivalry and competition between the numerous cofrad\u00edas in Galicia is common place. However, a lack of cooperation within the fisheries sector severely undermines the competitiveness of their operations. This project piloted a \u201cshop window\u201d of Galician seafood and aimed to strengthen the bargaining position of local fishermen thanks to increased critical mass, achieved through cooper- ation. Such collaboration allowed direct market- ing of their collective catch to a range of new customers all across Spain. Cus- tomers (individuals or professionals, such as restaurants) can place orders by phone or on-line and depend on a fixed price for the local products. The plat- form groups the orders and commissions one of the participating Cofrad\u00edas to buy back some of its fishermen\u2019s catch within the limit of the maximum price agreed. Shipment is then handled by the sales platform. Loestamospescando. com provides its customers with a \u201cbuyer\u2019s seat\u201d at the auction, ensuring a fairer price to the fishermen and a diversified customer base. The project was successfully trialled for one year, under the management of the FLAG, before responsibility for operations was transferred to the cofrad\u00edas themselves.

The project de- veloped a brand and awards stars to restaurants that commit to buying their fish directly from their local auction. In many coastal areas, restaurants tend to pur- chase their fish from wholesalers, prioritising price and convenience rather than whether fish is sourced locally. In order to increase the consump- tion of fresh local fish in the area\u2019s restaurants, the Association of Fishing Guilds from the Ebro Delta coordinated an initiative to encourage restau- rants to register as buyers at the fish auction of their local guild. Results have diversified the Association\u2019s buyer base and increased the amount of their fish being purchased directly. Project actions introduced a certification system to guarantee the origin of local fish. Restaurants were also awarded one, two or three stars, depending on the quantity of fish purchased directly from the local auction.

        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 13 Through the development of an innovative short supply chain delivery system of local seafood, Axis 4 has helped a Portuguese company to bridge the gap between customers and small-scale fishermen, whilst also encouraging sustainable fishing practices in the Sesimbra area. The Portuguese SME, Fixe em Casa , has devel- oped a marketing scheme that combines a range of short supply chain selling techniques to mar- ket the catch of selected fishermen who comply with specific sustainability criteria. Axis 4 support enabled the company to scale up its online sales, acquire a sustainability label and develop inno- vative packaging to preserve and promote the quality of its fish. Households can order local fish online at a specially designed website and Fixe em Casa will collect orders, li- aise with the fishermen to purchase the fish in the Sesimbra auction (all fish sales in Portugal must go through auction) and deliver it directly to the con- sumer\u2019s home.

        "# 14 Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action Adding Value Locally Fishing communities can increase the value of their local catch in a number of ways. Options include using new handling techniques to improve prod- uct quality, or processing the raw material into more convenient or gourmet products. Further opportunities can be found by focusing on marketing fish- eries products through innovative packaging and promotion. FLAGs\u2019 support for adding value activities can ensure that communities retain a larger share of the eco- nomic benefits that can be generated from their local resource. Modern consumer habits, such as the popularity of ready-to-eat products and new culinary experiences (as well as growing trends towards quality and traditional local products), mean that there is considerable potential in supporting projects that add value to local fish. Projects in this cluster illustrate a diverse collection of activities that FLAGs have supported. These range from preparation of live crabs supplying Asian communities resident in Europe, to improved cooking and cooling technologies for extending product shelf-lives. Such reaching out to new local markets also sits at the heart of a newly set-up cooperative that fillets and freezes local fish for public canteens. This is followed by an example of an artisanal processing enterprise that has revived the local canning tradition to develop a series of hand-made gourmet products. Other projects in the cluster promote new fresh and smoked organic carp products. A marketing campaigns launched by a producer organisation to rebrand and promote traditional seafood products is also featured. Innovation, quality and direct access to locally caught fish are key elements of these projects. A D D I N G V A L U E L O C A L L Y ",
        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 15 Local shrimp from Belgium can be offered fresh for a longer period, and without using preservatives, through the use of a newly devel- oped fresh value chain. By improving cooking and cooling proce- dures, Flemish fishermen have enhanced shelf life significantly, in- creasing the competitiveness of their small-scale coastal fisheries. Often hand-peeled abroad, most Belgian shrimps have undergone a long trip before returning to be sold on the local market. This requires exten- sive use of preservatives and sometimes freez- ing. Fresh, locally caught shrimps are available to consumers, but mostly in their unpeeled form and with a shelf life of just 4 days as they are tra- ditionally cooked and cooled on-board using un- treated sea water. In Flanders, the FLAG supported a project to develop an optimised boiling and cooling process (with close control of temperature, water quality\u2026) based on research funded under Axis 3 of the EFF. A prototype plant was built and installed on land and the new process has significantly increased the natural shelf life of fresh local shrimp. This adds value and makes them more competi- tive without using preservatives. In parallel, a new method of peeling shrimps, using an air blaster machine, is allowing this to be done locally, thus keeping the value chain in the community.

Two local specialists in aquaculture and fish pa- thology spotted an opportunity to develop a new business following the expansion of blue crabs in their area. Although there were some local fish- ermen who would catch and sell the species, the market for blue crab was poorly developed. With Axis 4 support, Blue Crab P.C. was set up and premises equipped in an old fish tavern in the town of Chalastra. The site itself is comprised of three departments: a fish, crustaceans and shellfish conditioning department; a deep freeze department for octopus, cuttlefish and crabs; and a preparation unit for sauces and light seafood dishes. Their flagship product is live blue crab which is caught using traditional methods and supplied to Asian communities in 6 different EU countries. Blue Crab P.C. works with approximately 25 fish- ermen who are now catching this local sea-species, as well as fish and other shellfish, which they bring to be conditioned and processed. In a second phase, Blue Crab P.C. is developing sauces and ready-made seafood dishes, largely for the Greek market.

This has been accompanied by work to create a common identity for their organic carp products. Marketing of the products has been carried out jointly, and a small group of local fish farmers oversee the quality of the fish. The project also involved the design and production of consumer brochures and equipment to participate in relevant trade fairs to enable the producers to promote their products. The project has led to organic self-service food shops being supplied with this organic carp product for the first time in Germany.

Vianapesca\u2019s members had previously experi- enced challenges linked to low profitability of fishing caused by product distribution difficulties and low sales value. In response, the Producer Or- ganisation (PO) developed a commercial strategy to boost sales of marketable fish products and consolidate a commercial network at national level. The core component of the marketing cam- paign involved explaining the nutritional and heritage value of traditional canned products through re-designed packaging and promotional material. In 2013, the project leveraged enough visibility that, in partnership with other Portuguese POs, Vianapesca could open \u201cloja das conservas\u201d, a traditional canned fish store selling a range of lo- cal products in Lisbon. The following year, their marketing campaign led to a dedicated \u201cPortuguese canned fish\u201d aisle being opened in a gourmet grocery in Paris.

        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 21 Enhancing the Environment The fisheries sector has been criticised for the negative impact of its activities on the environment. However, thanks to their profes- sional knowledge, fishermen can also play an important role as stewards of the maritime and inland water environment and many FLAGs have supported the sector to undertake this task, often with the involvement of scientists and other relevant experts. More- over, FLAGs, as local partnerships, are often uniquely positioned to foster cooperation between local stakeholders and thus help overcome conflicts of interests linked to the use of coastal ecosystems. Most of the projects in this cluster show how fishermen have been supported in their efforts to manage the environment and fish resource in a sustainable way. This includes projects facilitating the reporting of catches, monitoring a conservation area to prevent illegal fishing, bringing local actors together to develop a common river management plan, as well as designing and testing seal-safe fishing gear. The cluster also involves a project to certify sustainably caught fish, as well as the development of new, en- vironmentally-friendly technology to improve the quality of lake water. All of these projects highlight the important role that FLAGs can play in enhancing the environment through promoting sustainable practices, raising awareness and encouraging joint action.

        "# 22 Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action TELECAPECHE is an e-technology system from France that simpli- fies the reporting of local shellfish catches and help local fisheries and aquaculture committees to adopt suitable management meas- ures by providing them with real-time data on the state of stocks. French shellfish harvesters must declare their catches on a monthly basis to the government office in charge of maritime affairs. However, inefficient procedures meant that data was not processed and available for local fisheries and aquaculture committees in a timely manner. This complicated the management of stocks in the context of dwindling resources. Axis 4 supported the development and trial of an electronic system whereby shellfish harvesters can input their captures directly online or report them by SMS. As well as being a real time-saver for fishermen, the project gives the fisheries and aquaculture committees up-to-date knowledge about fish stocks. This means that they can detect problems with stocks quickly and introduce relevant measures, such as closing or repopulating certain areas, much quicker than in the past.

A Swedish FLAG project has successfully demon- strated how effective partnership approaches can be used to im- plement such territorial planning tools. Prior to the FLAG project, no coherent manage- ment plan was in place for the Nyk\u00f6ping River from South East Sweden. Furthermore, there was a lack of consensus among different interests groups (fisheries and tourism operators) about how to manage the river resource in a mutually beneficial and sustainable manner. The local FLAG was able to address these issues by bringing to- gether public and private sector stakeholders to establish a common agreement. An environmental consultancy firm facilitated the work which used communication tools effectively to secure a balance be- tween socio-economic and environmental interests. Positive outcomes have improved working relations between key players and led to a comprehensive framework of solutions for managing the Nyk\u00f6ping river, whilst also laying the groundwork for future FLAG activities.

FLAG support has helped fishermen to improve the quality and val- ue of their catch through an integrated package of actions, ranging from improving the environ- mental sustainability of their fishing activity to improving handling practices and sales. Getting local fish certified by Sweden\u2019s most renowned sustainability label, KRAV, was a central part of this work. This is a lengthy process requiring sig- nificant research to collect data on the fish stocks in question. Action was also needed to ensure compliance of fishing gear and vessels used, as well as fish handling processes.

Knowledge gaps remain about the challenges faced by the sector, the value and opportunities it represents, or simply the way that fishing and the supply chain works. Indeed, the image of fisheries is often associated primar- ily with negative impacts on the environment. Nevertheless, public interest in where our food comes from, and how it is produced, is increasing. Improving the image of fisheries is, therefore, a priority for many FLAGs, which seek to reconnect fisheries professionals and citizens. The examples in this cluster aim to give visibility to the fisheries sector and promote the value of fish as a quality product. Some of the featured projects have also contributed to creating jobs and opening new markets for fisheries products. They include projects such as making landing points and fish auctions physically more accessible and attractive to visitors, as well as promotional campaigns of the fisheries sector, through media, education and festivals. Further examples highlight the importance of facilitating contacts between the fisheries sector and other business sectors, as well as investing in training future chefs who can be influential in making fish more attractive. Finally, one innovative project has used a specially designed video game to raise awareness about the challenges faced by fisheries sector pro- fessionals among the young and tech-savvy. With aging fishermen a concern in many FLAG areas, and a younger generation increasingly exposed to convenience foods, it is not surprising that many projects in this theme target young people for a long-term impact.

Moreover, a growing trend for new and \u201cauthentic\u201d experiences and gastronomy has allowed many FLAGs to create linkages between fisheries and the tourism industry, by capitalising on and promoting the fisheries-related assets of their area. In many cases, fishermen are directly involved in offering services and products to tourists, in other cases they may benefit indirectly. Projects in this cluster illustrate the key elements necessary to develop successful fisheries-related tour- ism. Activities include: pesca-tourism trips to watch fishermen and aquaculture producers at work; a coastal angling site stocked with live fish caught by local fishermen; and guided tours of carp farming fa- cilities. Other projects feature a fish restaurant set up by a local fisherman and bed-and-breakfast accom- modation in a fishing family\u2019s home.

        "# 42 Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action Developing New Activities from Fisheries The challenge of creating jobs and finding new sources of sustainable income for fisheries communities cannot be addressed by fishing activities alone. While many fisheries areas have decided to take advantage of blue growth oppor- tunities such as the tourism potential in their areas (see Cluster 5 on Linking Fisheries with Tourism), some FLAGs have found other opportunities to create additional sources of income in fisheries communities and maintain the viability of their local economy. Innovation is an important local development tool that Europe\u2019s fishing and coastal communities can make good use of via support from the FLAGs\u2019 expertise and funding incentives. Results of such projects can not only create and safeguard jobs but they can also inspire others to venture into innovative areas, thereby further helping to reinforce the long-term economic viability and sustainability of coastal communities. FLAG-funded diversification activities can be initiated by representatives of the fisheries sector, as well as by other actors, such as local SMEs. The key challenge is to ensure that the fisheries community can benefit from the investment. The projects supported by FLAGs often link traditional skills with modern industries targeting new markets. The projects in this cluster range from the production and mending of fishing nets (which can be a starting point for a wider range of products using similar skills) to a boat repair workshop and sand extraction for shellfish production. These projects have generated employ- ment benefits and secured new market opportunities. They have also facilitated the work of professional fishermen and strengthened local linkages.

Axis 4 has enabled him and his family to diversify their business and develop a new service for their fel- low producers. Much like land farming, the traditional way of producing cockles in the Ria Formosa involves patient and precise soil restoring processes. These are required in order to provide a substrate of ideal structure and composition for the cock- les to grow. To achieve this, shellfish farmers need to mix sand and gravel in ideal proportions and frequently need to add one or another, which requires lengthy and heavy extraction and trans- port operations. To transform this challenge into an opportunity, Nuno Russo decided to design a specially adapted boat, fitted with a crane and a transport barge, which eases production operations. This has enabled him to launch a new business to extract and transport sand for other producers in the area, whom are now benefiting from this new service that represents an innovative revenue stream for Nuno.

        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 47 Making Fishing Areas Attractive Increasing the attractiveness of fisheries areas (for work, leisure and tourism) as well as and improving quality of life in these communities is a priority for many FLAGs. This is especially the case in more remote and less developed areas which can struggle to ensure their products and services are competitive, and that their communities remain viable. In other areas which have undergone strong development, fishing ports and infrastructure have sometimes become run down and the inhabitants dependent on them cut off from the economic development around them. Addressing these issues often involves considerable investments in physical or social infrastructure. However, combined with well-designed support to busi- ness development and job creation, these types of investments can boost the attractiveness of fisheries areas, helping to avoid population decline and safeguard a viable future locally. Projects in this cluster range from investments to restore a slipway (thus maintaining the economic viabil- ity of life on a small island) to modernising a fishing harbour (in order to improve facilities for fishermen and water based activities). Other projects include the development of regular events to bring a town\u2019s fishing tradition back to the heart of the local harbour. An innovative method of raising funds for local infrastructure is also featured. The success of these projects depends primarily on the strong support of the local community and the focus on an investment which is not an end in itself, but which can kick-start further development processes.

It is also set to become more attractive for other sectors. Oiu is a small fishing village on the north shore of Lake Vortsjarv with around 20 nearby professional fishermen. Due to lack of infrastructure and amen- ities on the lake, conditions for fishermen operat- ing here were once very difficult. Upgrading and installing the necessary infrastructure seemed the obvious choice to support professional fishermen and the local community. This project was proposed by the fishermen themselves, and the modernised facilities have improved their quality of life as well that for the surrounding com- munity.

Such actions recognise that people are a key asset of any bottom-up, community-led development and for a successful fisheries sector, equipped for future challenges. Each example in this cluster shows the personal story of an individual, or a group of individuals, whose life has been changed as a result of FLAG support.

These 42 projects were selected to be an illustrative rather than representative sample and should be viewed primarily in the spe- cific context of their area and the local develop- ment strategy. However, they confirm that FLAGs can play a particularly important role in creating jobs and wealth in the community, mobilising lo- cal actors and creating linkages, promoting inno- vative actions, mobilising funding and adapting support to the local context. THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN CLUSTERED INTO EIGHT THEMES: 1. Shortening supply chains 2. Adding value locally 3. Enhancing the environment 4. Improving the image of fisheries 5. Linking fisheries with tourism 6. Developing new activities from fisheries 7. Making fisheries areas attractive 8. Investing in people 2 These figures are roughly compatible with the information obtained in the Axis 4 study quoted above, where 488 projects were expected to maintain 1 016 FTE jobs, while 498 projects were expected to create 687 FTE jobs (based on responses from 71 FLAGs who replied to the question).

        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 59 Projects focusing on \u201cLinking fisheries with tour- ism\u201d stand out as those with the highest potential of creating jobs, although these are mainly sea- sonal (projects in this cluster helped create nine permanent and 256 seasonal jobs, while a further 102 jobs were maintained). \u201cInvesting in people\u201d (40 permanent jobs and three seasonal) and \u201cAdd- ing value locally\u201d (15 permanent and 24 seasonal jobs) were the next highest categories in terms of job creation (see Fig. 1). For 17 of the projects in the exhibition, estimated figures were available for the amount of addition- al income generated for the project promoter as a result of the Axis 4 support (e.g. in increased sales). These 17 projects saw a total investment of \u20ac2 mil- lion (of which \u20ac1 million was from the EFF) and resulted in an additional income of almost \u20ac1.5 million by December 2014. Impacts on income generated have been highest in the \u201cShortening supply chains\u201d cluster (on av- erage, \u20ac111 300 additional income generated per project for an average project cost of \u20ac83 600), followed by the clusters, \u201cAdding value locally\u201d (on average \u20ac59 000 per project for an investment of \u20ac194 000) and \u201cDeveloping new activities from fisheries\u201d (\u20ac52 000 additional revenue generated following an investment of \u20ac80 000) (see Fig. 2). 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 250 000 200 000 150 000 100 000 50 000 0 Fig. 1.

        "# 60 Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action Fostering social co- hesion and inclusion: mobilising local actors and creating linkages Most of the 42 projects in the exhibition were implemented by actors from the fisheries sector. These included fisheries businesses (e.g. fishing companies and fish processing plants) and fisher- ies organisations (e.g. associations of fishermen). A relatively high proportion of projects were ini- tiated and implemented directly by the FLAGs, for example, the \u201cMillennium Tuna Route\u201d (project 28), set up by the Cadiz Estrecho FLAG in southern Spain to develop and promote the fisheries herit- age and activities along its coast. Fig. 3 illustrates the number of projects implemented by benefi- ciary type 3 . A number of the projects target population groups that are typically hard to reach, including women, the unemployed and young people. For instance the South Finland FLAG has supported a young woman to successfully take over her fathers\u2019 fishing business (project 37) while the Cornwall FLAG (UK) has helped 24 unemployed young people find work in fisheries and related sectors (project 38). As many as 280 different entities have been in- volved in developing these 42 projects. Hence, the impact of FLAG projects goes far beyond the or- ganisation or institution that officially received the grant . On average, each project created linkages between seven different actors in- volved in its implementation. The project promoters have also been successful in involving fishing crews and the local fisheries community in different ways, sometimes as project promoters or partners, but also as users, clients or final beneficiaries. For instance, the project 3 \u201cLoestamospescando\u201d, developed by the Costa da Morte FLAG, has enabled 500 fishermen from nine fishing associations (cofrad\u00edas) to sell their fisher- ies products online, directly to the final consumer. In the eight projects for which such information was available, the total number of fishermen ben- efiting from the actions supported stood at 967. 3 Some projects involved beneficiaries of several types, so the total number is higher than 42.

        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 61 Promoting innovative actions Many of the project promoters supported have developed new responses to the challenges fac- ing fisheries areas. In at least seven projects, for example, the use of information technologies plays a key role. These range from on-line sales to e-monitoring of captures, promoting local fisher- ies and even fundraising. Some examples involve the development of prototypes, for instance the optimising of boiling and cooling equipment for local shrimp in the Belgian FLAG (project 6) or an environmentally-friendly and cost-effective water purification system supported by a Polish FLAG (project 17). Several projects also actively involve the research community. The 42 projects have an impressive record of de- veloping new businesses. They have supported the creation of 36 companies and 88 products and services. They have also helped project promot- ers reach 56 new markets. The six projects in the cluster, \u201cAdding value locally\u201d, were particularly ef- fective in this area, creating 30 new products and opening up 15 new customer markets. Mobilising financial resources On average, the projects in the exhibition each saw an investment of approximately \u20ac115 000, though the total project investment varies significantly between themes (Fig. 4). The largest projects are in the \u201cAdding value locally\u201d and \u201cLinking fish- eries with tourism\u201d clusters (averaging \u20ac194 000 and \u20ac156 000 respectively), while \u201cAttractive fish- eries areas\u201d projects are the smallest (on average \u20ac67 000), despite the inclusion of infrastructural investment projects in this cluster. While part of these investments come from EFF Axis 4, the 42 projects have also mobilised signifi- cant amounts of public and private contributions, indeed for every \u20ac1 invested from the EFF, an ad- ditional investment of \u20ac1.25 from other public and/or private sources was levered in. Moreover, further funding has been mobilised in follow-on projects. For example, a environmental project in Finland (project 15) led to the subsequent devel- opment of a \u20ac5 million LIFE-funded project and, in France, a study financed by Axis 4 resulted in a \u20ac700 000 investment to set up a cooperative pro- cessing plant (project 9). 250 000 200 000 150 000 100 000 50 000 0 Fig. 4.

        "# 62 Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action Promoting the cultural heritage of the area Most fisheries areas, including inland, have a rich heritage of culture and tradition which not only create direct economic benefits, but can also strengthen the sense of local identity and pride in the area and its fisheries profession. Highlight- ing the importance and attractiveness of this heritage can help counter some of the negative demographic trends affecting fisheries. Examples include the development of a series of pesca-tour- ism activities to raise awareness of what the local fishing activity involves and how it contributes to the character of the area (see project 23), the Home Harbour project (project 35) which adds to the visibility of the fisheries sector by bringing ac- tors together around the regeneration of the local harbour or the Millennium Tuna Route (project 28), mentioned above. Adapting support in a flexible way to the needs of the area The examples featured in the exhibition show the great diversity of Axis 4 projects. The amount of support ranges from \u20ac1 500 (project 34) to near- ly \u20ac300 000 (project 28). EFF flexibility means that FLAGs can help beneficiaries fund conventional business development projects (such as opening a fish restaurant or a net-making workshop), as well as more complex activities (such as studies, the development of new products, training, or men- toring and coaching). FLAG support can involve grants for infrastructural investment as well as covering the salary of a community officer \u2013 but support can also be brought in other, non-finan- cial forms, such as animation, coaching or bringing different partners together. Overall conclusions from this analysis of the 42 exhibition projects underscore the clear benefits that FLAGs can provide to their communities. EFF co-financing has been an extremely useful tool for supporting a wide variety of locally-led devel- opment projects in coastal and fisheries commu- nities throughout Europe. Concerted efforts by the FLAGs have ensured that EU funding can be managed locally to provide positive impacts for a broad full spectrum of stakeholders. ",
        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 63 A qualitative leap forward Since its establishment six years ago, Axis 4 has enabled local partnerships and their staff to gain a wealth of experience in implementing a new approach that might have seemed unrealistic or even utopian compared to the more traditional forms of sectoral and top down approaches for fisheries areas. Today, the added value of the territorial partner- ship is greatly appreciated by many stakeholders. Partners have learned to listen to one another and to understand expectations and requirements be- yond the boundaries of their own organisation. Through FLAG consultations and meetings, dif- ferences of opinion have also, progressively, given way to shared visions and collective territorial pro- jects. Jointly designing and implementing local development strategies has also given partners important opportunities for shared learning. FLAG employees have played a crucial role. FLAG managers and staff members arrived with very different profiles, from fisheries experts who knew little about other areas of activity, to territorial de- velopment specialists who were not always famil- iar with the fisheries sector. Throughout this peri- od, their skills have been strengthened and in the 21 Member States involved there is now a pool of over 500 professionals with expertise in territorial development in fisheries areas. The elements are now in place to facilitate a quali- tative leap forward, a step which is also supported by the orientation of the EMFF, and the opening up of CLLD to all ESI funds. C H A P T E R 4 A new stage with new challenges More targeted strategies The preparation of local development strategies by local groups was also a new departure in most of the FLAG territories in the first programming period, and the strategies produced were rela- tively traditional. In general, they followed the main objectives of the EFF (2007-2013). Namely: strengthening the competitiveness of the fisheries sector; adding value to fisheries products; diversi- fication; and enhancing the environment and local heritage. This initial phase of local development has enabled actions to be kick-started and a large number of individual projects to be implemented. However, in many areas we may now be reaching the limits of what can be achieved by individual actions. We have to ask ourselves: is there room for another new fish restaurant? Is it necessary to en- courage the creation of more fisheries museums? Such decisions can of course only be made locally, but in some areas there is already a risk of over-ca- pacity, unless the product or service offers new growth potential or fills a niche market. After several years of operation, FLAGs now have a better understanding of their areas\u2019 strengths and weaknesses and should be focusing on designing more targeted and more sophisticated strategies, which can maximise the added value of the terri- torial development approach. ",
        "# 64 Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action New challenges, new responses Competitiveness, added value and diversification obviously remain important goals, but the context has changed and new challenges have emerged, such as: > The local consequences of changes in European fisheries policy This may require the FLAG to respond through projects that will help to address the effects of the discard ban, such as the project financed by the Huelva FLAG featured in the FARNET video, \u201cFishmeal from fish waste\u201d. Other challenges involve the transition to the Maximum Sustain- able Yield and the possible short-term increase in competition for fishing quotas, which a fisher- men\u2019s guild from Denmark has tried to address by enabling fishermen to get extra income from their catch (see project 2). Additional options, such as helping fishermen to become increasing- ly involved in the protection of marine resourc- es, also exist (see the Cap Roux project 13). > Addressing \u201cblue growth\u201d and unleashing the innovation potential of coastal areas which, in many regions, are facing significant population increase \u2013 resulting in strong competition for resources between the territory\u2019s multiple uses. Here one can expect activities that help fish- ermen develop innovative products, such as the Portuguese FLAG which facilitated contact between fishermen, researchers and industry to study the potential of using the swimming crab in bio-medicine (see FARNET Good Prac- tice #19). To help fishermen benefit from blue growth opportunities, FLAGs may have to launch activities aimed at raising the profile of local fisheries actors and improving their im- age (see Cluster no. 4). > The shift towards low-carbon and a more cli- mate-resilient economy, and its impact on coastal resources and areas. FLAGs can play a role in stimulating projects here that, for example, promote the use of re- newable energy in fishing vessels, as a French FLAG has done, bringing together researchers, fishermen and sunflower producers. See on FAR- NET\u2019s cooperation page. > The absolute necessity to create employment and to combat poverty, with job insecurity and unemployment having increased significantly in many territories. Many projects supported by FLAGs aim to devel- op skills and ensure sustainable livelihoods for the members of fisheries communities. For in- stance projects 8 (creating jobs for unemployed women in canning fish products in Spain), 34 (maintaining a job on a remote Irish island) and 38 (getting young unemployed people into com- mercial fishing in Cornwall). These challenges and the imperative they present for innovative local solutions provides an opportu- nity for FLAGs to respond positively in developing and implementing their new local development strategies. ",
        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 65 More differentiation The development of strategies that are more fo- cused on local specificities may result in a greater diversity of approaches. Some FLAGs will concen- trate most of their resources on the fisheries sector (e.g. in areas where there is still significant scope for such activities) while others will focus more generally on the opportunities provided by coast- al development and blue growth. Regardless of their focus, each FLAG will be seek- ing to encourage and support the projects that secure the best future for their territory, in terms of its sustainable development, and the creation of employment and social cohesion. In doing so, they will also take account of actions likely to be developed by other local players under other strat- egies and funds. More resources and better coordination At this stage, it is difficult to know exactly how much of the EMFF will be dedicated to CLLD and the sustainable development of areas dependent on fisheries and aquaculture. On the basis of indi- cations to date, it is anticipated that the funding mobilised may be significantly higher than that available under the EFF. The common approach to CLLD across the ESI funds also opens up the opportunity for FLAGs to be involved in multi-fund local development. This could contribute to a better mobilisation of the other ESI funds and improved coordination be- tween the various financing options. Where such multi-funded approaches are possible, this should result in integrated coastal development strate- gies that could cover all relevant sectors of activity in the area. Associated outcomes may therefore accord appropriate importance to the fisheries sector in terms of its economic activity, identity, heritage and governance. A greater emphasis on collective action Amongst the 42 projects selected for the confer- ence, there is a high number that involve more than a single beneficiary or entity. These include: sixteen projects implemented by organisations or bodies that have a collective character, including fishing associations, cooperatives, training cen- tres, environmental associations, local develop- ment agencies, local authorities etc.; and eight projects where the beneficiary is the FLAG itself. In addition, some of the 18 projects implemented by private entrepreneurs also involve other actors from the fisheries community. It is anticipated that this \u201ccollective\u201d approach will be strengthened in the future as: > Individual actions are more effective when they are \u201cconnected\u201d to other local actions, e.g. in or- der to develop and achieve their full potential, to access certain markets and to become com- petitive, or to develop new activities. Forty fishermen, selected on the basis of their ad- herence to environmental criteria, are involved in the \u201cO melhor peixe do mondo\u201d (the best fish in the world) project, which is supported by the FLAG in Alem Tejo, Portugal. The project enables the direct sale of fish or sales via organic food shops (project 5). Cooperation facilitated by the Thessaloniki FLAG, Greece, has opened the na- tional and international market for fresh blue crab, with 25 fishermen involved (project 7). ",
        "# 66 Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action > The importance of \u201ccommon assets\u201d or \u201ccommon goods\u201d principles are in the process of being re-established. For example, in Spain the pro- fessional fishing organisations, the \u201ccofrad\u00edas\u201d, have been responsible for centuries for manag- ing common maritime resources. This notion of \u201ccommon goods\u201d has today once again become prominent as pressure on natural resources, water quality, the environment and landscapes intensifies. At the initiative of the East Finland FLAG, fish- ermen, conservationists and scientists have teamed up to protect a valuable natural asset (the ringed seal) and the livelihoods of local fishermen by developing seal-safe fish traps (project 15). The development of collective actions is often best facilitated by the FLAG partners or employees. Due to the greater share of FLAGs\u2019 budgets that can be devoted to animation and promotion under CLLD, FLAGs will be able to become much more \u201cproac- tive\u201d and create linkages between different actors and types of activities. The fisheries sector had lost its high profile in the coastal town of Simrishamn until the South Baltic FLAG in Sweden set up a series of events to address this. Actions focused on a festival, which is now held annually for two weeks, and includes activi- ties for children, boat visits, direct sales of fish, cu- linary recipes, etc. (project 35). More innovation An even greater importance will be attached to in- novation in this new 2014-2020 phase. In particu- lar, the rapid development of new technologies will open up opportunities for the fisheries sector, as well as for the development of new activities. Social innovation will also be required to address the problems facing many territories. The renovation of Annan Harbour in the UK is be- ing enabled thanks to support from the FLAG, but also through the contribution of 45 private do- nors mobilised through web-based participatory \u2018crowd funding\u2019 mechanisms (project 36). A focus on young people and women Young people and women often face particular challenges in the employment market and are sometimes difficult to engage through traditional methods. FLAGs have already been successful in targeting these groups and the increased resourc- es FLAGs will be able to devote to community ani- mation under CLLD should help to ensure greater levels of participation in the future partnerships. With the support of seven Andalusian FLAGs, 200 women from fisheries communities have been brought together to explore a future as entrepre- neurs. As a result, some of them have already man- aged to set up their own businesses (project 39a). Moreover, a total of 24 young unemployed people have found work in fishing and fishing related sec- tors thanks to a skills acquisition scheme support- ed by the Cornish FLAG (project 38). ",
        "Sailing towards 2020: Axis 4 in action # 67 Enhanced cooperation Cooperation between territories can deliver add- ed value for projects of a certain size, which re- quire a certain critical mass or complementarity, or exchange of knowledge or skills to succeed. As de- veloping such cooperation is quite complicated, this was relatively rare during the 2007-2013 pe- riod. However, the Axis 4 approach and FLAGs are now more mature and the opportunity to benefit through cooperation should be greater in future. Poland is one of the European countries with the lowest levels of fish consumption. Two Polish FLAGs, in collaboration with six culinary vocation- al schools, organised training courses for students and teachers to enable them to increase their knowledge of fish and methods of preparation and processing (project 20b). Raising the bar This new context and the challenges and oppor- tunities that it presents requires FLAGs to build on their experience and develop more focused, inno- vative and better integrated strategies, which are locally grounded and responsive to local circum- stances. We wish you a smooth passage towards 2020 when we will meet up again to showcase the re- sults of this next part of the journey. ",
