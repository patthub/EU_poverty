        "FOREWORD by the President of the European Parliament In 2013, the European Parliament is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Sakharov Prize. This book, which has been published to mark this historic occasion, traces the history of the Sakharov Prize, the nominees and the winners, from it inception to the present day. Ever since it was founded, the European Parliament has played an active role in defending human rights and fundamental freedoms. In its resolutions it strongly condemns every breach of those values all over the world. The Sakharov Prize \u2013 the brainchild of French MEP Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Deniau \u2013 was established in 1988. It is a striking symbol of Parliament\u2019s commitment to human rights. In awarding the prize each year, Europe pays tribute to individuals and organisations demonstrating a wholehearted commitment to standing up for the universal values officially recognised by the United Nations. Sakharov Prize winners are often symbols of non-violent struggle against dictatorships or discrimination. In awarding them the prize for freedom of thought, the European Parliament is also honouring all those people \u2013 known and unknown \u2013 who are engaged in the struggle for a fairer, more humane society. As Andrei Sakharov himself said, peace, progress and human rights are insolubly linked to one another: it is impossible to achieve one if the other two are ignored. 5 FOREWORD ",

        "INTRODUCTION Out of its concern to affirm the European Community\u2019s commitment to democracy, the European Parliament has always espoused the cause of protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. From the beginning of the 1970s, particularly following the Helsinki Final Act (1975), human rights issues were being raised with increasing frequency. Nonetheless, it was only after the first direct elections to the European Parliament, in 1979, that the development and defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms became one of the priorities of the new democratically elected assembly. The Committee on Political Affairs, founded in 1984, was responsible for human rights problems in third countries 1 . In this work, the Committee was assisted by a Subcommittee on Human Rights, likewise set up in 1984. However, as from the first parliamentary term, the previous Committee on Political Affairs had already had a working group on human rights. Believing that it was important to draw attention to human rights violations and to condemn them publicly, Parliament spoke out more and more frequently. Each year from the beginning of the 1980s, the Committee on Political Affairs drew up a report on human rights in the world and the development of a common policy on the subject. Moreover, the number of resolutions adopted in this field doubled between the first and the second parliamentary terms 2 : the plenary debates were long and animated. Parliament felt that there was an urgent need to respond to the alarming human rights situation around the world. 1 Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, 4th edition, June 1987, p. 121. 2 The archives contain 142 human rights resolutions adopted during the first parliamentary term, and 289 adopted during the second. 7 INTRODUCTION ",

        "CHAPTER I The European Parliament and Andrei Sakharov Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov, a Soviet nuclear physicist and strong defender of democracy and human rights, was certainly one of the most important political dissidents in the former Soviet Union. Mr Sakharov was a joint inventor of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, who was concerned about the consequences his work might have for humanity and became aware of the dangers inherent in the nuclear arms race. Therefore, in 1967, he wrote to the Soviet authorities asking them to accept the US proposal to abandon their antimissile defences, but these calls were ignored. In 1968, Mr Sakharov wrote his essay Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom . This text, in which he stressed that \u2018intellectual freedom is essential to human society\u2019, was disseminated clandestinely in the Soviet Union, as a samizdat publication . In 1970, Mr Sakharov participated in the foundation of the Committee on Human Rights in the USSR. The European Parliament followed Mr Sakharov\u2019s life with interest from the 1970s onwards. When he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1975, the European Parliament, which was very happy about this, welcomed the news at its plenary sitting of 13 November 1975. In parallel, Parliament strongly condemned the refusal by the Soviet authorities to issue Mr Sakharov with a visa to enable him to travel to Oslo to receive the Nobel Prize in person. 3 In 1979, Mr Sakharov was arrested by the Russian authorities and ordered to live in the city of Gorki 4 , 400 km from Moscow. Parliament responded immediately, adopting a resolution condemning the decision of the Soviet authorities and calling for an immediate end to the exile of the Sakharovs 5 . The European Parliament was concerned about the health of Mr Sakharov and his wife throughout the period of their isolation. Following the publication of an official communiqu\u00e9 by Heinrich B\u00f6ll, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972, concerning the deterioration in Mr Sakharov\u2019s health, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Soviet Government to \u2018lift immediately the exile 3 Resolution of the European Parliament of 13 November 1975 on the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Andrei Sakharov, OJ C 280, 8 December 1975, p. 42. 4 Now Nijni Novgorod. 5 Resolution of the European Parliament of 15 February 1980 on the arrest of the scientist Andrei Sakharov, OJ C 59, 10.3.1980, p. 55. 9 CHAPTER I THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND ANDREI SAKHAROV ",

In addition, during the May 1984 part-session, having got wind of a hunger strike by Mr Sakharov, Parliament adopted a resolution reiterating its call for Mr Sakharov and his wife to be allowed to leave the Soviet Union 7 . At its plenary sitting of 26 July 1984 8 , the European Parliament debated a motion for a resolution on Andrei Sakharov. The text had been tabled by Mr Formigoni and others (PPE) 9 and proposed, inter alia, that a seat be left vacant in the Chamber of the European Parliament for Andrei Sakharov and thus, symbolically, for all those, anywhere in the world, who suffered for their ideas.

        "CHAPTER II The creation of the Sakharov Prize 1. The proposal by Mr Deniau and the parliamentary report (1984-1985) During this debate of 26 July 1984, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Deniau spoke. This new French Member did not support the idea of an empty seat but, on behalf of the Liberal and Democratic Group (L) 11 , put forward an alternative idea. Taking up an idea which had in fact already been put forward by two of his Italian colleagues, Mr Gawronski and Mr Bettiza 12 , he said that he personally wished that Parliament should take the opportunity to create a European Parliament prize to be known as the \u2018European Andrei Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament\u2019. It would be awarded each year in relation to topics which corresponded precisely to the campaigns of Andrei Sakharov 13 . In November 1984, Mr Deniau proposed, on behalf of his group (L), establishing \u2018the Sakharov Prize\u2019 of the European Parliament to promote, in particular, freedom of debate and inquiry 14 . The proposed prize was to be awarded each year to a study or work dealing with one of the following topics: (i) the development of East-West relations in the light of the Helsinki Final Act 15 , (ii) protection of freedom of scientific inquiry, (iii) defence of human rights, (iv) government practices in the light of the letter of Constitutions 16 . The European Parliament referred the text to the Committee on Political Affairs as the committee responsible and, for an opinion, to the Committee on Youth, Culture, Education, Information and Sport 17 . At its meeting of 19 December 1984, the Committee on Political Affairs decided to draft a report on the basis of this motion for a resolution 18 and, in January 1985, Mr Deniau was appointed rapporteur for it 19 . The Committee on Youth decided not to deliver an opinion. The report proposed the conditions for the award of the prize. In order for the Sakharov Prize to become a genuine European symbol, the Committee on Political Affairs attached three prerequisites to it. Firstly, the idea was to recognise not a person but a work written about a specific subject. Secondly, the winner of the prize would have to be chosen by a two-thirds majority within the Committee on Political Affairs, and 11 See annex II \u2013 political groups in the European Parliament since July 1984. 12 Jas Gawronski and Vincenzo Bettiza, Italian Members belonging to the Liberal and Democratic Group (L).

        "lastly, it should be the President of the European Parliament in person who presented the prize. The Committee on Political Affairs adopted the motion for a resolution in its entirety on 31 October 1985 by 9 votes to 2 with 3 abstentions. 20 On 12 December 1985, the rapporteur presented his explanatory statement orally in plenary. He stressed the importance of the creation of a specifically European prize devoted to the cause of freedom of thought and bearing the name of Andrei Sakharov. Mr Deniau took the view that the duty and responsibility of the freely elected European Parliament was to defend fundamental freedoms and to stress the strength of a human being, who had the choice as to whether to say yes or no. 21 Why was the name Sakharov chosen? As Mr Deniau mentioned, both in the report and in his speech in plenary, Andrei Sakharov was a European citizen who was the personification of freedom of thought and expression and who had decided, because of his convictions and his conscience, to renounce all the material advantages and all the honours which were open to him. According to the rapporteur, the choice of a figure such as Sophocles, Erasmus or Montaigne \u2013 all illustrious examples of freedom of thought \u2013 would not convey as effectively the role and meaning of the work of the European Parliament. 22 Some members of the Communist and Allies Group (COM) tabled amendments 23 seeking, in particular, to give the prize the name of Nelson Mandela to promote the defence of political freedoms and to help combat racism. During the debate, the Socialist Group (S), represented by Mr Saby, expressed itself in favour of the name of the Sakharov Prize, saying that it would not be right to oppose one struggle to another. To the socialists, the struggle for human rights was one and indivisible. On behalf of the PPE Group, Mr Habsburg said that Andrei Sakharov had become an important symbol of integrity and courage, being persecuted not only for his opinions but also because he was Jewish. Mr Verbeek, of the Rainbow Group (ARC), who opposed the resolution, considered that the prize should be genuinely open to all, be given an impartial name and be awarded by an independent jury. 24 Only the amendment tabled by Mr Seefeld of the Socialist Group was adopted when the vote was taken in plenary. It inserted in the resolution the condition that a prize bearing the name of Mr Sakharov could only be created if Mr Sakharov himself agreed. 25 On 13 December 1985, the European Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution in its entirety, by rollcall vote, by 94 votes to 31 with 15 abstentions 26 . 20 Report on behalf of the Committee on Political Affairs on the creation of a Sakharov Prize, p. 3, PE2 AP RP/POLI.1984 A2- 0137/85 0010. 21 European Parliament debates of 12 December 1985, No 2-333/281-282. 22 Report A2-0137/85, p. 5; European Parliament debates of 12 December 1985, No 2-333/281-282. 23 Amendments nos 1-8, PE2 AP RP/POLI.1984 A2-0137/85 0020. 24 European Parliament debates of 12 December 1985, No 2-333/282. 25 Amendment no 9, PE2 AP RP/POLI.1984 A2-0137/85 0020. 26 OJ C 352, 31.12.1985, pp. 282, 304, 323. 25 YEARS OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE: THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT UPHOLDING FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 16 ",

        "2. The creation of the prize (1986-1988) 2.1. Development of the award procedure On 26 February 1986, the Committee on Political Affairs held its first exchange of views on the award of the Sakharov Prize 27 . At its meeting of 23 April 1986, the Political Affairs Committee appointed Jas Gawronski, of the LDR Group, rapporteur, to draw up a note on the procedure for awarding the Sakharov Prize. The note was to serve as a basis for discussion. 28 Mr Gawronski\u2019s note drew on the resolution adopted on 13 December 1985, which had stated that candidates must submit a study or work concerning one of the topics indicated. This meant that charity work and political activities were excluded. Among the proposed details, Mr Gawronski suggested that the works should be written in a Community language, preferably English or French, and by authors residing in one of the Member States. The Subcommittee on Human Rights would then select three works that it would submit to the Committee on Political Affairs, which, acting by a two-thirds majority, would make a recommendation to the President of the European Parliament. The prize, to be worth 1 000 ecus, and a collection of selected works by Mr Sakharov, would be presented to the prize-winner at a brief public ceremony at the European Parliament in Strasbourg or held by the Committee on Political Affairs in Brussels. 29 In October 1986, a number of amendments were proposed by members of the Committee on Political Affairs (Mr Penders of the PPE group and Mr Gawronski himself) concerning, inter alia, the length of the work (approximately 10 000 words, and not more than 15 000), the amount of the prize (5 000 ecus) and the setting in which it was to be presented (a plenary sitting). 30 During the meeting of the Committee on Political Affairs of 16 December 1986, the amended note was adopted unanimously, and on 19 January 1987, the Chair of the Committee on Political Affairs, Mr Formigoni, forwarded it to the President of the European Parliament 31 . 2.2. Agreement of Mr Sakharov At the meeting of 4 February 1987, the Bureau discussed the action to be taken on the resolution concerning the creation of the Sakharov Prize and considered it desirable to make sure in advance that Mr Sakharov was in agreement 32 . 27 Minutes of the Committee on Political Affairs of 26 February 1986, p. 7, PE2 AP PV/POLI.1984 POLI-19860226 0020. 28 Minutes of the Committee on Political Affairs of 23 April 1986, p. 7, PE2 AP PV/POLI.1984 POLI-19860423 0010. 29 Notice to Members of 12 June 1986, PE2 AP PV/POLI.1984 SCDH-19860625 0050. 30 Amendments to the note on the \u2018Sakharov Prize\u2019, PE2 AP PV/POLI.1984 SCDH-19860625 0060. 31 Minutes of the Committee on Political Affairs of 16 December 1986, p. 4, PE2 AP PV/POLI.1984 POLI-19861216 0010.

        "Lord Bethell, a former vice-chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights (1984- 1986), immediately contacted Mr Sakharov, forwarding to him a message from the new President of the European Parliament, Lord Plumb. A favourable reply from Mr Sakharov in April 1987 approved the establishment of a prize bearing his name. Moreover, he supported the creation of the prize, stating that he considered it useful, \u2018since it will once again attract attention to the human rights problem and will encourage people who have made a contribution to this end\u2019. Mr Sakharov also wished to be informed about the works by various proposed candidates. 33 On 12 May 1987, having learned of Mr Sakharov\u2019s favourable reply, the Bureau agreed in principle that the Sakharov Prize should be established. It also decided that the practical arrangements for the holding of the competition should be governed by rules to be adopted by the Bureau, on a proposal by the Committee on Political Affairs. 34 2.3. Development of the Statute of the Sakharov Prize Following the meeting of the Committee on Political Affairs of 25 May 1987, the committee\u2019s secretariat drew up a note outlining the main subjects raised during the discussion. The note stated that the term \u2018work\u2019 must be interpreted in the broadest possible sense, as referring to all the activity undertaken in the fields identified by the resolution of 13 December 1985. The prize could be awarded to organisations as well as to individuals. 35 At the meeting of 23 June 1987 in Berlin 36 , the Committee on Political Affairs decided to instruct its Chair, Mr Ercini, to prepare a draft Statute for the award of the prize, which should be duly substantiated and legally well-founded. The draft would be submitted to the Committee on Political Affairs at its meeting in September in Copenhagen and then to the Bureau of the European Parliament. However, the subject was not included in the agenda in Copenhagen. It was only on 24 November 1987 that discussion of the Sakharov Prize resumed within the Committee on Political Affairs 37 . On that occasion, the members received a document drawn up by Mr De Gucht, Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, concerning the procedures for awarding the Sakharov Prize, and a draft Statute drawn up by the European Parliament\u2019s Legal Service 38 . In his document, Mr De Gucht observed that it was vital to reach an agreement quickly so that the first Sakharov Prize could be awarded in 1988. In fact, according to Mr Gawronski\u2019s proposal, the prize was already to be awarded for the first time in 1987. The committee decided, at its meeting of 24 November 1987, to make 4 January 1988 the deadline for receipt of observations on these two documents. 33 Letter of 10 April 1987 from Mr Sakharov to Lord Bethell [English Translation], PE2 OD PV/BURE BURE-19870512 0140. 34 Minutes of the Bureau of 12 May 1987, p. 14, PE2 OD PV/BURE BURE-19870512 0010. 35 Minutes of the Committee on Political Affairs of 25 May 1987, p. 3, and notice to the members of the Committee on Political Affairs of 26 May 1987, PE2 AP PV/POLI.1984 POLI-19870525 0010 and 0020. 36 Minutes of the Committee on Political Affairs of 23 June 1987, p. 5, PE2 AP PV/POLI.1984 POLI-19870623 0010. 37 Minutes of the Committee on Political Affairs of 24 November 1987, p. 7, PE2 AP PV/POLI.1984 POLI-19871124-PM 0010. 38 Notices to Members of the Committee on Political Affairs of 29 October 1987 (available only in Greek) and 11 November 1987, PE2 AP PV/POLI.1984 POLI-19871124-PM 0050 and 0060. 25 YEARS OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE: THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT UPHOLDING FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 20 ",
        "Amendments to the draft Statute were proposed by members of the Committee on Political Affairs and of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, and by the European Parliament\u2019s human rights adviser. Suggestions were made with a view to a solution which would be broader and more flexible than in the document drafted by the Legal Service. Firstly, the prize should not be reserved solely for individuals or organisations based in Europe. No geographical restriction should be imposed, as limiting the prize to the EEC would be contrary to the aims of the resolution 39 . Secondly, it should be possible to select not only \u2018written works\u2019 but also notable activities or achievements in the field of human rights. Other changes concerning the power of nomination, the selection procedure and the organisation of voting were made. It was proposed that only Members of the European Parliament should be permitted to propose candidates, but opinions differed as to the number of Members that should be required to nominate a candidate. The political group coordinators in the Committee on Political Affairs finally proposed that 25 Members should be required, and this proposal was accepted. At its meeting of 23 March, the Committee on Political Affairs decided to forward all these observations to the Legal Service so that it could draw up a draft definitive Statute, in accordance with the guidelines given to it by the Committee on Political Affairs. The text would then have to be forwarded to the bureau of the Committee on Political Affairs and finally sent to the President of the European Parliament. The final draft Statute drawn up by the Legal Service was submitted on 20 April 1988. On 18 May, following its adoption by the committee\u2019s bureau, Mr Planas, Chair 40 of the Committee on Political Affairs, forwarded it to the President of the European Parliament. The President decided that the draft should be put to the enlarged Bureau for a final decision. 41 On 2 June 1988 42 , the enlarged Bureau decided to set up a working group 43 to devise a procedure for awarding the prize. After having received information from the working group on the application of the Statute 44 , the enlarged Bureau adopted the Statute on 6 July 1988 and decided that the deadline for proposing candidates for 1988 should be 15 September 1988. However, a final important amendment was made to the Statute: the Committee on Political Affairs was to consider the candidacies and propose three candidates in alphabetical order, from among whom the enlarged Bureau would choose the final prize-winner. 45 39 Notice to the members of the Committee on Political Affairs of 11 November 1987, PE2 AP PV/POLI.1984 POLI-19871124-PM 0060. 40 Acting. 41 Letter of 18 May 1988 from Mr Planas, acting Chair of the Committee on Political Affairs, to Lord Plumb, PE2 P2 265/DHOM DHOM-1987-090 0030. 42 Minutes of the enlarged Bureau of 2 June 1988, p. 9, PE2 OD PV/BURE BUEL-19880602 0010. 43 Comprising the Vice-Presidents Mr Alber (PPE), Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo (S) and Mr Musso (RDE). 44 Document of the Working Group on the Sakharov Prize of 16 June 1988, PE2 OD PV/BURE BUEL-19880706 0060. 45 Minutes of the enlarged Bureau of 6 July 1988, pp. 10-11, PE2 OD PV/BURE BUEL-19880706 0010. 21 CHAPTER II THE CREATION OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE ",
        "2.4. Run-up to the first award of the Sakharov Prize On 3 March 1988, Lord Plumb, President of the European Parliament, wrote to Mr Sakharov to provide information about the procedure in progress: at the time, the Committee on Political Affairs was still drafting the Statute. This was to be sent to Mr Sakharov once it had been adopted. Lord Plumb expected the first prize to be awarded in December 1988 and therefore invited Mr Sakharov, if circumstances so permitted, to present the prize to the winner in person at a public ceremony in Strasbourg. 46 In his letter of 7 July 1988 to Mr Ercini, Chair of the Committee on Political Affairs, Lord Plumb asked him to take all necessary steps to enable the prize to be presented for the first time in December 1988 47 . On the same date, the secretariat of the Bureau informed Members of the European Parliament of the 15 September 1988 deadline, adding that every candidacy must have the support of at least 25 Members 48 . 46 Letter of 3 March 1988 from Lord Plumb to Mr Sakharov, PE2 P2 265/DHOM DHOM-1987-090 0030. 47 Letter of 7 July 1988 from Lord Plumb to Mr Ercini, PE2 P2 272/COMP POLI.1984-040 0090. 48 Notice to Members of 7 July 1988, PE2 OD PV/BURE BUEL-19880706 0220. 25 YEARS OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE: THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT UPHOLDING FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 22 ",

        "CHAPTER III The Statute of the Sakharov Prize Between its first adoption, on 6 July 1988, and the substantial amendments to it adopted on 15 May 2003, the Statute of the Sakharov Prize remained virtually unaltered for 15 years. On 22 November 1989, the amount of the prize was raised from 5 000 to 15 000 ecus, after which it remained unchanged for 10 years. On 30 July and 26 October 1999, Elmar Brok, the new Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, wrote to Mrs Nicole Fontaine, the newly elected President of the European Parliament, to propose to the Conference of Presidents that the amount be revised, now that it had remained the same for a decade. 49 At its meeting of 9 March 2000 50 , the Conference of Presidents decided to recommend that the Bureau increase the amount of the prize to 50 000 euros, and on 7 September of the same year 51 instructed the Secretary-General to increase it to 50 000 euros with effect from the year 2000. In addition, by letter of 26 June 2001 52 , Mr Brok proposed several major amendments to the Statute of the Sakharov Prize. The aim of these was to ensure a large majority for the winner of the annual prize, underlining Parliament\u2019s support for the cause. They also sought to update the text of the Statute in the light of current \u2018political realities\u2019. The Conference of Presidents held over its consideration of these proposals until 2002, and then until 2003 53 . Finally, at its meeting of 15 May 2003 54 , it adopted most of the amendments with immediate effect. However, the minimum number of Members required in support of a candidacy remained 25, rather than the 32 proposed. The amendments to point 7 concerning the procedure for voting in the Committee on Foreign Affairs were also rejected 55 . The following table makes it possible to compare the original text of the Statute (first column) and the amended version of May 2003 (second column): 49 Letter of 30 July 1999 from Mr Brok, Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, to Mrs Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, PE5 OD PV/CPRG CPRG-19991028 0025. Mr Brok observed that the sum of 50 000 euros would be more compatible with the prestige and dignity of the prize, would compensate for the decline in its value due to inflation and maintain a certain comparability with prizes awarded by other bodies. 50 Minutes of the Conference of Presidents of 9 March 2000, p. 27, PE5 OD PV/CPRG CPRG-20000309 0010. 51 Minutes of the Conference of Presidents of 7 September 2000, p. 25, PE5 OD PV/CPRG CPRG-20000907 0010.

        "CHAPTER IV The financing of the Sakharov Prize In its resolution of 13 December 1985 on the creation of a Sakharov Prize 61 , the European Parliament declared \u2018its readiness to provide the necessary funds from its own budget to finance the prize and the administration involved\u2019. In the initial years, the Sakharov Prize was paid for using the budget heading reserved for the financing of cultural initiatives of European interest, as proposed by the Bureau at its meeting of 4 February 1987 62 . Since 1995, the remarks on the heading have indicated that it is primarily intended to finance the Sakharov Prize. 63 The following little table shows how the budget headings covering expenditure associated with the Sakharov Prize have developed (the prize money itself, the travel and subsistence expenses of the winner and his family, the cost of the medal and other ancillary expenses).

        "CHAPTER V A quarter of a century of the Sakharov Prize 1. Annual procedure In accordance with the Statute of the Sakharov Prize, the European Parliament awards the Sakharov Prize each year. The annual procedure is as follows. In June or July, the Conference of Presidents 64 adopts the timetable proposed by the secretariat of the Bureau for the award of the Sakharov Prize. The timetable adopted is immediately communicated to Members. In general, the deadline for proposing candidates to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 65 is in mid-September. Then the Committee on Foreign Affairs considers the candidacies in the second half of September or in October. After the vote in committee, a list of three names, placed in alphabetical order, is submitted to the Conference of Presidents. The latter chooses the final winner in October or November. The award ceremony is held during the December part-session in Strasbourg. The President of the European Parliament presents the prize to the winner or his representative. The formal sitting is followed by a press conference attended by the winner and the President of the European Parliament. 64 The enlarged Bureau until 1994. 65 The Committee on Political Affairs until 1992. 37 CHAPTER V A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE ",
        "2. The winners of the Sakharov Prize over the years 1988 In 1988, seven candidates were proposed to the secretariat of the Committee on Political Affairs: Larisa Bogoraz, the International Human Rights Association, Nelson Mandela, Anatoly Marchenko, Nathan Sharansky, Mordechai Vanunu and Roald Zelichenok 66 . At its meeting of 27 September 1988, having held a vote by secret ballot, the Committee on Political Affairs adopted a list of three candidates which it forwarded to the President, Lord Plumb 67 : \u2022 Nelson Mandela, symbol of the struggle against apartheid, convicted of \u2018treason\u2019 and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1988, he had been in prison for 25 years and had systematically refused to be released conditionally, as he believed that freedom was not something to be obtained by barter: only a free man could negotiate. \u2022 Anatoly Marchenko, a Soviet dissident and member of the Moscow Helsinki Group (1975), who had spent more than 20 years in prison or internal exile and who had died in December 1986 at the age of 48, in Chistopol prison, as a result of a hunger strike. In his book My Testimony 68 , Mr Marchenko was the first person to report on the camps and prisons in the post-Stalin period. \u2022 Roald Zelichenok, a Soviet refuznik and author of many scientific works whose life had become very difficult after applying for an emigration visa in 1978 and who had been arrested in 1985 for \u2018slander\u2019. He committed himself to pressurising the Soviet authorities to find a solution to the problems associated with the emigration of Jews. 69 As the Statute of the Sakharov Prize stipulates, the Committee on Political Affairs may seek the opinion of Mr Sakharov on candidacies 70 . In an undated document 71 , in Russian, signed by Mr Sakharov and addressed to the Sakharov Prize Committee, the physicist proposed that the prize be awarded posthumously to Anatoly Marchenko 72 . Mr Sakharov stressed that the life and work of Mr Marchenko bore witness to the non- violent struggle for justice and a search for transparent and complete truth. At its meeting of 26 October 1988 73 , the enlarged Bureau decided to award the prize jointly to Nelson Mandela and Anatoly Marchenko. It also reiterated its wish for the laureates to receive the prize at the December 1988 part-session.

        "there was not enough time for this, as the process of contacting the prizewinners and their representatives would take several weeks 74 . Furthermore, neither the laureates\u2019 representatives nor Mr and Mrs Sakharov were able to confirm that they could attend the December part-session. On 1 December 1988, the enlarged Bureau decided, on a proposal from the President, Lord Plumb, that the full prize money would be awarded to both laureates 75 . At its meeting of 18 January 1989 76 , the enlarged Bureau noted Lord Plumb\u2019s announcement that the Sakharov Prize would be presented to the laureates\u2019 representatives at the February 1989 part-session. The minutes of the meeting of the enlarged Bureau of 27 January 1989 77 specified a date and time for the ceremony: 15 February 1989 at 15.00. Acting on a proposal from the Committee on Political Affairs, the President also invited Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Deniau \u2013 the former MEP who had originally proposed the creation of the Sakharov Prize 78 \u2013 to the ceremony. As the invitation did not reach him in time, Mr Deniau sent Lord Plumb a telegram 79 stating how sorry he was that he would not be able to attend and thanking all his colleagues who had successfully put his initiative into practice. At a formal sitting in Strasbourg on 15 February 1989, the inaugural Sakharov Prize \u2013 a gilded bronze medal, a commemorative scroll and a cheque for 5 000 ecus \u2013 was presented to members of the two laureates\u2019 families. Mr Marchenko\u2019s widow, Larisa Borgoraz \u2013 herself a human rights activist \u2013 received the prize on behalf of her husband. Their two sons also attended the ceremony. The prize awarded to Nelson Mandela \u2013 who at the time was incarcerated at Pollsmoor Prison \u2013 was presented to his 14-year- old grandson, Mandla Mandela 80 . The President of Parliament had of course invited Mr Sakharov, by means of an official invitation in writing and during the President\u2019s visit to Moscow. Parliament was keen for Mr Sakharov to present the inaugural prize bearing his name to the laureates 81 . Mr Sakharov\u2019s strenuous programme of engagements, however, including official meetings and an election campaign in Moscow, meant that he was unable to attend the inaugural award ceremony. In his address at the formal sitting, the President of the European Parliament, Lord Plumb, stated that the inaugural award ceremony was \u2018a most unusual event from 74 See correspondence between the President\u2019s Cabinet and the various addressees, PE2 P2 265/DHOM DHOM-1987-090 0010. 75 Minutes of the enlarged Bureau of 1 December 1988, p. 12, PE2 OD PV/BURE BUEL-19881201 0010. 76 Minutes of the enlarged Bureau of 18 January 1989, p. 3, PE2 OD PV/BURE BUEL-19890118 0010. 77 Minutes of the enlarged Bureau of 27 January 1989, p. 5, PE2 OD PV/BURE BUEL-19890127 0010. 78 Letter of 29 September 1988 from Mr Ercini, Chair of the Committee on Political Affairs, to Lord Plumb, President of the European Parliament, PE2 P2 272/COMP POLI.1984-040 0090.

        "Parliament\u2019s point of view\u2019. The President gave a brief summary of the history of the prize before moving on to describe the laureates and introduce their representatives. He expressed regret at the fact that Mr Sakharov was unable to attend the historic occasion, but stated that \u2018[e]ven if he is not present he has conveyed his hope that he could be with us on a future occasion, perhaps as a fellow parliamentarian\u2019. 82 Nelson Mandela, who was released from prison in February 1990, came to address a formal sitting of the European Parliament on 13 June 1990. He outlined the political situation in South Africa and emphasised that his country had not yet undergone the \u2018profound and irreversible changes\u2019 necessary to put an end to the apartheid system, and stated that the struggle had to continue. Mr Mandela thanked the European Parliament for having awarded him the Sakharov Prize in 1988, stating: \u2018We take this as a challenge that we should remain true to the vision we all share of a world free of war and free of poverty and suffering. We take it as a challenge above all to have the courage to fight for justice and peace.\u2019 83 The Nobel Peace Prize 1993 was awarded jointly to Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk.

        "Letter from Andrei Sakharov, Laureate of the Nobel Peace Prize, to the Sakharov Prize Committee Translation Subject: Proposal I hereby propose that the Sakharov Prize be posthumously awarded to Anatoly Tikhonovich Marchenko. It was in Marchenko\u2019s renowned book entitled \u2018My Testimony\u2019 that the camps and prisons of the post-Stalin period were discussed for the first time. The book helped to give rise to the human rights movement in the Soviet Union and endow it with a firm moral belief in the non-violent struggle for justice and aspirations for the truth to be revealed in its entirety. The book led the repressive apparatus to unleash their wrath upon its author. The remainder of Marchenko\u2019s life, until his tragic death in Chistopol prison, saw him pay dearly for his indefatigability and strong moral code. One of the charges levelled against Marchenko during his final conviction was that he had spoken out in my defence. Marchenko\u2019s heroic life and his works represent an enormous contribution to the causes of democracy, humanism and justice.

        "On the basis of the proposals by the Committee on Political Affairs, the enlarged Bureau decided at its meeting of 22 November 1989 90 to award that year\u2019s Sakharov Prize to Alexander Dub\u010dek. At the same meeting, the enlarged Bureau also decided to increase the prize money to 15 000 ecus and to present the laureate with a large European Parliament gold medal. The award ceremony for the 1989 Sakharov Prize was held on 17 January 1990, in the presence of Mr Dub\u010dek and his wife. Three people addressed the formal sitting: Parliament\u2019s Secretary-General Enrico Vinci, who read out the text concerning the award of the prize, President Bar\u00f3n Crespo and the laureate, Alexander Dub\u010dek. One important person was not at the ceremony, however. The man after whom the European Parliament\u2019s Prize for Freedom of Thought was named had died the previous month in Moscow. Mr Sakharov had made it clear that he wished to attend the award ceremony, but because he was unsure whether he would be able to make it, he had prepared a message in advance. President Bar\u00f3n Crespo wound up his address by reading out the moving message that Mr Sakharov himself had written on 10 December 1989, just four days before he died 91 . Mr Dub\u010dek was awarded the Sakharov Prize at time of historic political change in Czechoslovakia. On 22 November 1989, the day the European Parliament had decided to award him the prize, Mr Dub\u010dek was still a citizen deprived of his human rights in his country. The Velvet Revolution was already under way, however, and just a few days later, on 28 November, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia decided to relinquish its hold on political power in the country. At the end of December, Mr Dub\u010dek was elected President of the new Federal Assembly. V\u00e1clav Havel was elected President of the Republic. So when Mr Dub\u010dek addressed the European Parliament 92 as the winner of the 1989 Sakharov Prize, he was also speaking in his new capacity of president of his country\u2019s parliament. His thoughts at this historic time were with the people of Czechoslovakia, who had taken their destiny into their own hands: \u2018now, as I receive the Sakharov Prize, my thoughts are for those who have earned the right to the renewal and change currently taking place. Even during the most difficult moments of their history, the nations which make up my country have never ceased to feel that they are part of humanity\u2019s great struggle for freedom.\u2019 In the 20 years between the Prague Spring and the Velvet Revolution \u2018the ideals of freedom, sovereignty and social justice remained alive\u2019. Mr Dub\u010dek had a busy schedule during his visit to the European Parliament 93 . He met the President of Parliament, Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo, as well as the Commission President 90 Minutes of the enlarged Bureau of 22 November 1989, p. 21, PE3 OD PV/BURE BUEL-19891122 0010. 91 Speech by Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo, European Parliament debates of 17 January 1990, No 3-385/174-176.

At its meeting of 17 December 1990 95 , the Committee on Political Affairs considered the nominations put forward by political groups and MEPs. Three nominations which had been received after the deadline were not accepted: those of Adam Dema\u00e7i, who had been nominated by Mr Vandemeulebroucke on behalf of the ARC Group, and Chico Mendes and Aziz Nesin, who had been nominated by Mr Ephremidis, on behalf of the Left Unity (CG) Group. The latter two nominations were also rejected on the grounds that they were put forward by the same signatories. The Committee on Political Affairs submitted the names of the three candidates that had obtained the most votes to the Bureau: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s (15 votes), Fang Li Zhi (9 votes) and Aung San Suu Kyi (9 votes) 96 . On 22 January 1991 97 , the enlarged Bureau decided to award the 1990 Sakharov Prize to Aung San Suu Kyi. On 30 May 1991 98 , the President of the European Parliament informed the enlarged Bureau that it was by no means certain that Aung San Suu Kyi had received the letter informing her that she had been awarded the Sakharov Prize.

        "refused to cooperate in any way 99 . The President pointed out that he was nevertheless determined to continue his efforts to secure the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. On a proposal from the President, the enlarged Bureau unanimously decided to present the prize to one of Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s close relatives 100 . In line with the wishes of the laureate\u2019s family 101 , the Sakharov Prize was presented to Kim Aris, Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s younger son, at a formal sitting held on 10 July 1991, in the presence of his father and Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s husband, Michael Aris. In his address, President Bar\u00f3n Crespo emphasised a number of the impressive aspects of Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s personality. The daughter of an assassinated national hero, her loyalty to her people and her commitment to the basic values of democracy and human rights are key features of her life. Instead of choosing to live with her family outside her country, she devotes her life to the struggle for freedom and democracy in Burma. She is deeply committed to non-violence and, under terrible pressure, has learned to live without fear. 102 The Sakharov Prize was awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi in 1990, the year in which her party, the National League for Democracy, scored a resounding victory in the elections in Burma. The party was not able to take power in the country, however, which remained in the hands of the military junta. On 14 May 1992, Aung San Suu Kyi wrote to Mr Klepsch, President of the European Parliament 103 , thanking the European Parliament for awarding her the Sakharov Prize and expressing her belief that all the honours bestowed upon her were honours for the people of her country. The prize money was donated to the Burmese fund for health and education. Over the years, various presidents of Parliament tried to invite Aung San Suu Kyi to the European Parliament during her rare periods of freedom to receive the Sakharov Prize in person 104 . Finally, in June 2012, she was allowed to visit Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, which she had been awarded in 1991. 99 European Parliament debates of 10 July 1991, No 3-407/195-196. 100 Minutes of the enlarged Bureau of 30 May 1991, p. 5, PE3 OD PV/BURE BUEL-19910530 0010. 101 Letter of 11 June 1991 from Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo, President of Parliament, to Mr Aris, SG 04EV B1920/ACT-MAN MAN-250 0080. 102 European Parliament debates of 10 July 1991, No 3-407/195-196. 103 Letter of 14 May 1992 from Aung San Suu Kyi to Mr Klepsch, President of the European Parliament, PE3 AP RP/POLI.1992 A3-0056/93 0570. 104 See for example the letter of 20 September 1995 from Mr H\u00e4nsch to Aung San Suu Kyi, PE4 P1 C40/MEMB ESPA-1994-070 0110, and the letter of 22 April 2003 from Mr Cox to Aung San Suu Kyi, PE5 OD PV/CPRG CPRG-20030605 0240. 59 CHAPTER V A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE ",

        "1991 A week after the Sakharov Prize ceremony for Aung San Suu Kyi, the enlarged Bureau set a deadline of 30 September for the submission of nominations for the 1991 prize 105 . Seven nominations were put forward by political groups or Members 106 : \u2022 Adem Dema\u00e7i, Kosovo Albanian writer and Chairman of the Kosovar Human Rights Council, nominated by the PPE, LDR, Green and ARC groups, and by Alexander Langer (Green) and others. Mr Dema\u00e7i spent 28 years in prison for his untiring efforts to defend the rights of Albanians in Kosovo and to reconcile the rights of Albanians with those of other ethnic minorities in Kosovo. \u2022 Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, nominated jointly by the GUE/NGL Group for their work in bringing democracy to the Soviet Union. \u2022 Nancy Gracey, the co-founder of the organisation FAIT \u2013 Families against Intimidation and Terrorism in Northern Ireland, nominated by the CG Group for her work against paramilitary violence. \u2022 Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, nominated by the LDR Group 107 . \u2022 Laszl\u00f3 T\u00f6k\u00e9s, the bishop from Transylvania (Romania), nominated by the PPE Group for his vital contribution to change in Romania and his work to safeguard minority rights. \u2022 Terry Waite, the adviser to the Catholic Church in Britain and negotiator for the release of hostages in Libya, who was himself held hostage for several years in Lebanon, nominated by the Socialist Group. \u2022 Wei Jingsheng, the editor of the journal \u2018Explorations\u2019, who had been imprisoned in China since 1979 on account of his work to promote human rights in that country, nominated by the DE Group. At its meeting on 6 November 1991 108 , the Committee on Political Affairs voted on the award of the 1991 Sakharov Prize. The following nominees received the most votes: Adem Dema\u00e7i (7 votes), Laszl\u00f3 T\u00f6k\u00e9s (12 votes) and Terry Waite (14 votes). Following a vote by secret ballot, the enlarged Bureau 109 decided to award the 1991 Sakharov Prize to Adem Dema\u00e7i, who received 9 of the 17 votes cast, as against 8 for Terry Waite. For the first time, the award ceremony for the Sakharov Prize was held during the December part-session. This scheduling, which had been discussed several times since the early exchanges of views on the introduction of the prize, subsequently became the tradition. 105 Minutes of the enlarged Bureau of 18 July 1991, p. 14, PE3 OD PV/BURE BUEL-19910718 0010. 106 Notice to the members of the Committee on Political Affairs of 8 October 1991, PE3 AP PV/POLI.1989 POLI-19911014 0020. 107 No arguments provided in support of this nomination. 108 Minutes of the Committee on Political Affairs of 6 November 1991, p. 5, PE3 AP PV/POLI.1989 POLI-19911106 0010.

        "In his speech, Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo paid tribute to \u2018the integrity of a man who for over three decades\u2019 had \u2018opposed an authoritarian and intolerant regime\u2019 and who had served a long prison sentence for political reasons. Mr Dema\u00e7i gave his speech in Albanian and, as was noted by the President, this was the first time that a speech had been made in that ancient language in the European Parliament. 110 Mr Dema\u00e7i began by emphasising the importance of free speech as the first step towards democracy, saying that \u2018without freedom of speech there is no dialogue, without dialogue truth cannot be found, and without truth progress is impossible\u2019. He described the very difficult living conditions that existed, among places, in Kosovo, which had \u2018become an immense prison where Albanians lack even minimal security\u2019 and in Croatia, despite the Hague Peace Conference on Yugoslavia. In the name of all the young people killed in the wars in Yugoslavia and \u2018in the name of mothers and fathers, not just Albanians, but also Serbs and Montenegrins, Croats and Bosnians, Hungarians and Macedonians\u2019, he wished to convey a message of peace and unity among peoples. 111 110 Speech by Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo, European Parliament debates of 10 December 1991, No 3-412/83-84. 111 Speech by Mr Dema\u00e7i, European Parliament debates of 10 December 1991, No 3-412/84-85. 65 CHAPTER V A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE ",

The President noted that the commitment shown by these mothers was not just about defending the human rights of their relatives, but also those of people throughout the world. 117 Mrs de Bonafini thanked the European Parliament for awarding them the Sakharov Prize, which they accepted on behalf of their children \u2018who were the first to struggle for freedom\u2019, saying that they also wished to share it with all their support groups. They also wanted to share the prize with mothers who had disappeared while looking for their children.

        "Oslobo\u0111enje had become a symbol of tolerance and multi-ethnic cooperation and of freedom of expression and of the press. The newspaper was awarded the Sakharov Prize in the 50th year of its existence. During the war it had continued to appear every day, despite its offices being in permanent danger and lacking material resources. Mr Dizdarevi\u0107 emphasised that all the work which had been done for Oslobo\u0111enje had been \u2018aimed at defending and preserving a Bosnia-Herzegovina that is multi-ethnic, multinational, cosmopolitan and tolerant\u2019. He added that it was continuing to fight to prevent the partition of its peoples, which its staff was doing \u2018as Sarajevans, Bosnians and Herzegovinians, as individuals whose past is one of a communal life, with all its wealth of variety and diversity\u2019. 124 124 Speech by Mr Dizdarevi\u0107, European Parliament debates of 14 December 1993, No 3-440/100-101. 25 YEARS OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE: THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT UPHOLDING FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 72 ",

Mr Zana had been imprisoned as a result of the testimony he had given before the European Parliament\u2019s Sub-Committee on Human Rights in 1992. Nominated by Claudia Roth and Alexander Langer (V) and others. At its meeting on 12 October 1994 126 , the Committee on Foreign Affairs had decided only to submit nominations of individuals to the Conference of Presidents. Hence, rather than submitting a joint nomination for Mr and Mrs Zana, only the nomination of Leyla Zana would be submitted. Most votes were cast for Taslima Nasreen (19 votes), Sebastian Arcos Bergnes (13 votes) and Leyla Zana (12 votes). The names of the three nominees were forwarded to the Conference of Presidents 127 . Following an exchange of views, the Conference of Presidents 128 decided to award the 1994 Sakharov Prize to just one nominee, rather than two 129 , and thus decided, following a fresh vote, to award the prize to Mrs Taslima Nasreen. Nevertheless, the President of the European Parliament was called upon to contact the Cuban authorities 125 Communication to the Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy of 27 September 1994, PE4 AP PV/POLI.1994 POLI-19941004 0030.

In witnessing all the suffering around her, she had been unable to remain silent, and had \u2018paid a price for not being silent\u2019, having to leave her country after being threatened by Islamic fundamentalists. She emphasised that the fact the European Parliament had awarded her the prize would give her encouragement in her struggle for \u2018freedom of speech\u2019, and for \u2018dignity and equal status for women\u2019. 131 130 Speech by President H\u00e4nsch, European Parliament debates of 15 December 1994, No 4-455/251. 131 Speech by Mrs Taslima Nasreen, European Parliament debates of 15 December 1994, No 4-455/251-252. 25 YEARS OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE: THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT UPHOLDING FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 76 ",

She wrote: \u2018Those in favour of war and violence could put us behind bars for some time yet, but they will be unable to stem the development and the internationalisation of our peaceful fight to enable the Kurdish and Turkish peoples to live together on equal and brotherly terms in Turkey, within the framework of democracy and the mutual respect for rights and the separate identity of each people\u2019. 139 As had been decided at the Conference of Presidents 140 , the formal sitting for the award of the Sakharov Prize took place at the part-session in January 1996. Although the President of the European Parliament sent letters and telegrams to the Turkish authorities, they refused to allow Mrs Zana to leave prison in Ankara to accept the prize she had been awarded in person. The award was collected on her behalf by her husband, Mehdi Zana. Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, who had actively supported Leyla Zana in her campaigning, was a special guest at the award ceremony. Leyla Zana had conveyed a long message to the European Parliament in writing 141 . In that message she expressed her gratitude for the efforts that Parliament had tried to make to secure her release and said she was moved to have been awarded the prize bearing the name of Andrei Sakharov, who during the course of his life had repeatedly alerted public opinion to the fate of the Kurds in Iraq, in Iran and in Turkey. However, she criticised the decision MEPs had taken to ratify the Customs Union with Turkey 142 even though the Turkish Government had not met their demands for fundamental democratic reforms. In his speech, President H\u00e4nsch paid tribute to Mrs Zana, who was a symbol of the peaceful struggle to ensure the rights and dignity of the Kurdish People. He pointed out that Parliament had on many occasions debated the issue of the rights of the Kurds in Turkey, including when assenting to the agreement on customs union on 13 December 1995. He explained that Parliament had given its assent because it \u2018wanted to extend a hand of friendship to those in Turkey who are committed to democratic reforms, who seek conciliation within Turkey and who want to go on opening their country to Europe and its values\u2019. 143 After finally being released in June 2004, Mrs Zana gave her acceptance speech to the European Parliament in person at a formal sitting in Brussels on 14 October 2004 144 . Nearly ten years had passed since she had been awarded the Sakharov Prize.

Leyla Zana chose to give her speech in Turkish and in Kurdish. As had been the case in 1991, when she had spoken in Kurdish during her oath-taking ceremony in the Turkish National Assembly, she wanted to draw attention to the fact that \u2018peoples, languages and cultures can co-exist in a brotherly fashion\u2019. She expressed her desire for a peaceful solution under which the name and identity of the Kurdish people were recognised within Turkish sovereign territory. 81 CHAPTER V A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE ",

The letter stressed the fact that, to avoid \u2018political gameplaying\u2019, the prize should be awarded to a nominee who \u2018could be endorsed by a large majority of people\u2019.

As had happened with several previous prizewinners, Mr Wei Jingsheng was refused permission by the Chinese authorities to go to Strasbourg. Mrs Shanshan Wei- Blank therefore represented her brother at the ceremony. In his speech 155 , Mr H\u00e4nsch said that in awarding the Sakharov Prize to Wei Jingsheng the European Parliament was paying tribute to \u2018his struggle for freedom of opinion and of the press, respect for human rights and for the introduction of democracy in China\u2019. The President outlined his tireless fight which had begun with a dazibao 156 posted on the \u2018Democracy Wall\u2019 in Peking and which was never ending, as Mr Wei Jingsheng was not afraid to make his ideas known either in his own country or abroad. This struggle had cost him long years in prison, but as he himself said: \u2018I offer up this life to the struggle for democracy in China\u2019. Mrs Shanshan Wei-Blank thanked the European Parliament on her brother\u2019s behalf and added that her brother saw the Sakharov Prize as \u2018an act of encouragement and support on the part of the European people, not just for himself but for the entire human rights movement in China\u2019 157 .

During its meeting of 8 October 1997 159 , the Committee on Foreign Affairs considered the nominations. The President, Mr Gil-Robles, was informed of the results of the vote 160 : Mrs Salima Ghezali received 24 votes, Bishop Franjo Komarica 19 votes and Mrs Eleni Foka 7 votes. The Conference of Presidents examined the nominations during its meeting on 23 October 1997 161 .

The award ceremony was held in Strasbourg on 17 December 1997. During his speech, Mr Gil-Robles, President, recalled that Mrs Ghezali had spoken in spring 1996 at a meeting of the European Parliament\u2019s Subcommittee on Human Rights.

To mark the fact that this was a commemorative year, previous prizewinners had been invited to attend the ceremony. Some were able to attend, others were not. Leyla Zana, whose prison sentence had been extended, was one of those unable to attend.

In his speech as the winner of the Sakharov Prize 171 , Mr Rugova spoke of the situation in Kosovo. In his view, only Kosovo\u2019s independence could guarantee peace and stability in that part of Europe. He hoped that one day Kosovo would also take its place in the European Parliament, which had been one of the first major international institutions to react to the situation in Kosovo and had given the people of the country the strength to stand firm.

        "Ghazzawi and Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan, and Dom Zacarias Kamwenho. Mrs Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, was informed of the result 187 . The Conference of Presidents had a long discussion on the list of nominees shortlisted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs 188 . Several group chairs were in favour of awarding the prize jointly to Mr Izzat Ghazzawi and Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan, whose nomination had received an absolute majority of votes in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and to Dom Zacarias Kamwenho, a man of peace from an African country ravaged by war for more than 25 years. The discussion revolved around the question of whether the Sakharov Prize could be awarded to two nominees. The President recalled that, with the sole exception of the first year in which it was awarded, the prize had only ever been given to one nominee at a time. The way in which Article 7 of the Statute is worded does, in fact, indicate that the prize can only be awarded to one person or organisation (\u2018one winner\u2019 in the singular). Following a vote, the Conference of Presidents decided to award the 2001 Sakharov Prize to Mr Izzat Ghazzawi and Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan, and to Dom Zacarias Kamwenho. This was the first time that the European Parliament conferred the Sakharov Prize on three prizewinners. The award ceremony was held in Strasbourg during the sitting of 12 December 2001, and was attended by the three prizewinners and their relations. Addressing the Palestinian and Israeli winners of the prize, Mrs Fontaine emphasised their courage and dignity, the fact that in the face of \u2018the worst injustice of all, the loss of a child\u2019, their response had not been hatred but to promote peace and dialogue between their two peoples. As for Archbishop Kamwenho, he symbolised the hope of the Angolan people for peace, justice and reconciliation. 189 The prizewinners took the floor to speak one after another 190 . Mrs Peled-Elhanan stressed that children, who were just figurines in political games, had to be saved as a matter of urgency. Mr Ghazzawi called for the healing that can come once we are \u2018able to understand each other\u2019s needs\u2019. \u2018Tolerance\u2019 was the key word in Archbishop Kamwenho\u2019s speech: national reconciliation, founded on dialogue, would be \u2018able to break the never-ending cycle of war\u2019.

        "The award ceremony was arranged for 17 December 2002. Despite the problems he faced in obtaining his first exit and re-entry visa, Mr Pay\u00e1 did manage in the end to come to Strasbourg. As the European Parliament\u2019s President Mr Cox stressed in his speech 194 , the European Parliament was awarding the Sakharov Prize to Mr Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as \u2018as a tribute to his commitment to freedom of thought, democracy and reconciliation of the Cuban people\u2019. Mr Cox referred to the \u2018Varela project\u2019 195 started by Mr Pay\u00e1, a petition calling for a referendum on open elections, freedom of speech and association, an amnesty for political prisoners and free entreprise. The petition had been signed by more than 11 000 Cuban citizens before being presented to the Cuban Parliament. Oswaldo Jos\u00e9 Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as said that in accepting the 2002 Sakharov Prize he was doing so on behalf of all Cubans, including those in prison simply because they had stood up for their rights. Through this Prize, Mr Pay\u00e1 added, the European Parliament recognised that they had \u2018the right to rights\u2019. \u2018This time we will carry out the changes by means of this civic movement which is already opening up a new stage in the history of Cuba, in which dialogue, democratic participation and solidarity will prevail. In that way we will build a true peace.\u2019 196 In spring 2003, a group of 11 MEPs launched the \u2018Sakharov Initiative\u2019 in response to dramatic events that had taken place in Cuba. Dozens of dissidents had been arrested and put in prison in Cuba shortly after Mr Pay\u00e1\u2019s return from Strasbourg, and the death penalty had been reintroduced. The goal of the \u2018Sakharov Initiative\u2019 was to invite Mr Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as officially to Europe so he could meet representatives of the EU institutions and Member States\u2019 authorities at the very highest level and provide them with information about events in Cuba 197 . On 29 November 2003, Mr Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as sent a message to the European Union: the Cuban Government refused to give him permission to travel. However, he and other human rights defenders continued their struggle for peaceful change and genuine dialogue in Cuba. 198 Mr Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as , winner of the 2002 Sakharov Prize, died in a car accident in Cuba in July 2012. 194 Speech by President Cox, European Parliament debates of 17 December 2002 (not published in the OJ). 195 Named after Father F\u00e9lix Varela, a Cuban independence hero. 196 Speech by Mr Oswaldo Jos\u00e9 Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as, European Parliament debates of 17 December 2002 (not published in the OJ). 197 Resolution of the European Parliament of 4 September 2003 on Cuba, OJ C76 E, 25 March 2004, p. 384, see paragraph 12 in particular. 198 Statement of 29 November 2003 from Oswaldo Jos\u00e9 Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as, coordinator of the Citizens\u2019 Committee for the promotion of the Varela Project in Havana, PE OD PV/CPRG CPRG-20040115 0120. 25 YEARS OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE: THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT UPHOLDING FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 118 ",

        "The Conference of Presidents decided to award the 2003 Sakharov Prize to Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, and to all United Nations staff, \u2018with a view to commemorating Sergio Vieira de Mello and the many other UN officials who had lost their lives in the service of world peace\u2019. The decision was made with the support of all the political groups except one: the Verts/ALE Group defended the nomination of Mr Ganji. It was decided that the prize would be presented to Mr Annan on 29 January 2004 in Brussels, on the occasion of his official visit to Parliament. 202 At the ceremony on 29 January, the President, Mr Cox, welcomed some survivors of the attack in Baghdad and the families of those who had died, extending a special welcome to Mr Vieira de Mello\u2019s widow and son 203 . Parliament had also invited six former winners of the Sakharov Prize: Wei Jingsheng (1996 winner), Salima Ghezali (1997 winner), Ibrahim Rugova, President of Kosovo (1998 winner), Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, President of East Timor (1999 winner), a representative of \u00a1Basta Ya! (2000 winner) and Dom Zacharias Kamwenho (2001 joint winner). Three former prizewinners were unable to attend: Aung San Suu Kyi and Ms Zana, both in confinement at the time, and Mr Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as, who had again been prohibited from attending by the Cuban authorities. Kofi Annan 204 said he was proud to receive the Sakharov Prize in memory of the United Nations officials who gave their lives to promote peace in the world. He congratulated Europe, which he said had learnt the lessons of its long history and was now \u2018a shining light of tolerance, human rights, and international cooperation\u2019. A few months later, the European Union would welcome ten new Member States. However, the message of Mr Annan\u2019s speech to Parliament was very clear: he encouraged Member States to become more open to immigration, because Europe needed migrants just as migrants needed Europe. Immigration had to be well managed, \u2018not just for the sake of those who move, but for the sake of the countries they leave behind and those they travel through and those they migrate to\u2019. Mr Annan emphasised the shared legal and moral responsibility that we have towards those who are forced to leave their country of origin. 205 Brian Cowen, President-in-Office of the Council, and Chris Patten, the Commissioner for External Relations, both spoke before handing over to the chairs of the political groups and of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. 202 Minutes of the Conference of Presidents of 23 October 2003, pp. 27-28, PE4 OD PV/CPRG CPRG-20031023 0010. 203 Speech by President Cox, European Parliament debates of 29 January 2004 (not published in the OJ). 204 Speech by Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, European Parliament debates of 29 January 2004 (not published in the OJ). 205 Ibid. 25 YEARS OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE: THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT UPHOLDING FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 122 ",

        "Following a discussion and a vote, the Conference of Presidents decided 208 to award the 2004 Sakharov Prize to the Belarusian Association of Journalists. The Belarusian Association of Journalists was represented by a delegation at the award ceremony, which took place on 14 December 2004 in Strasbourg. The Sakharov Prize was presented to Zhanna Litvina, the cofounder and president of the organisation. Addressing members of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, the President, Mr Borrell Fontelles, declared that the Sakharov Prize recognised \u2018a group of professionals who risk their lives on a daily basis to seek out the truth and communicate it to their citizens\u2019. Dozens of journalists had been killed and hundreds imprisoned throughout the world in 2004 alone. Despite the regular attacks from the authorities that independent media outlets faced in Belarus, the Association of Journalists continued their work to uphold freedom of expression. 209 During her speech, Zhanna Litvina remarked that the Sakharov Prize was a very important symbol for her organisation, but also \u2018a sign of solidarity and support for the entire Belarusian democratic movement \u2019. She added that, in a closed society in which the government wanted to control all information, it was extremely important to uphold the individual\u2019s right to objective information. The independent press was practically the only source of free information for people in Belarus. In order to survive, however, these media outlets relied on the support of international and European organisations. 210 208 Minutes of the Conference of Presidents of 28 October 2004, pp. 24-26. 209 Speech by Mr Borrell Fontelles, President of the European Parliament, European Parliament debates of 14 December 2004. 210 Speech by Zhanna Litvina, from the Belarusian Association of Journalists, European Parliament debates of 14 December 2004. 127 CHAPTER V A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE ",

At its meeting of 26 September 2005 212 , the Committee on Foreign Affairs drew up a shortlist of three candidates following two rounds of voting: the Ladies in White, Hauwa Ibrahim and Reporters Without Borders. One month later, the Conference of Presidents 213 decided to award the 2005 Sakharov Prize jointly to all three candidates following a single vote. It was the first time in the history of the Sakharov Prize that the three candidates nominated by the Committee on Political Affairs or its successor, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, won the prize. The award ceremony for the 2005 Sakharov Prize took place on 14 December 2005 in Strasbourg. Two of the winners were able to attend: Hauwa Ibrahim, a Nigerian lawyer, and Reporters Without Borders, represented by its Secretary General, Robert M\u00e9nard. The \u2018Ladies in White\u2019, who had not obtained authorisation to leave Cuba, were represented by Blanca Reyes, a former \u2018Lady in White\u2019. During his speech, the President, Mr Borrell Fontelles, affirmed that Parliament had long supported these nominees, who all shared the ambition to uphold human dignity and freedom. Parliament had followed their struggle: the peaceful demonstrations by the Ladies in White in Havana, the work of Ms Ibrahim to bring the rule of law to her country so that everyone could have the right to a fair trial and to education, and the fight for freedom of information by Reporters Without Borders. 214 All the prizewinners, or their representatives, gave a speech at the ceremony 215 . Ms Reyes made the following statement on behalf of the Ladies in White: the prize was \u2018an inspiration to carry on defending the innocence of our loved ones with greater courage and to demand their immediate and unconditional release\u2019. She then listed the names of those who had signed the statement: Laura Poy\u00e1n, wife of H\u00e9ctor Maceda; Miriam Leyva, wife of \u00d3scar Espinosa Chepe; Berta Soler, wife of \u00c1ngel Moya; Loida Vald\u00e9s, wife of Alfredo Felipe Fuentes; and Julia N\u00fa\u00f1ez, wife of Adolfo Fern\u00e1ndez Saiz. In 1999, twelve Nigerian states had introduced the Sharia legal system. Since then, Ms Ibrahim had helped defend 90 victims of that system, including women accused of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning, such as Safya Husseini and Amina Lawal. In her speech, she pointed out that these were victims with no power and no voice. Thanks to the Sakharov Prize, the attention of the world had turned towards them, and \u2018their cause is known and supported\u2019. 212 Minutes of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 26 September 2005, p. 5, PE6 AP PV/AFET.2004 AFET-20050926 0010. 213 Minutes of the Conference of Presidents of 26 October 2005, pp. 15-16. 214 Speech by President Borrell Fontelles, European Parliament debates of 14 December 2005. 215 Speeches by Blanca Reyes, Hauwa Ibrahim and Robert M\u00e9nard, European Parliament debates of 14 December 2005. 131 CHAPTER V A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE ",
        "Mr M\u00e9nard, the Secretary General of Reporters without Borders, spoke of journalists who had been killed and detained in Iraq: \u2018It is to them, through us, that you are paying tribute.\u2019 He congratulated Parliament for its having defended Florence Aubenas, the French journalist taken hostage in Iraq, but noted that there were \u2018others like Florence Aubenas, but they do not belong to great Western media organisations and they do not come from the West.\u2019 In those cases, politicians and journalists did not work nearly as hard, \u2018as though double standards were being applied, as though some lives were worth more than others and as though there were some freedoms that affect us and others that do not. It is imperative that we put a stop to this way of thinking.\u2019 On 23 April 2013, the Ladies in White were eventually allowed to travel to Parliament in Brussels to personally receive the Sakharov Prize that had been awarded to them almost eight years previously. The prize was presented at a special ceremony during a joint meeting of the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Development and the Subcommittee on Human Rights, with the President, Mr Schulz, also in attendance. 216 216 Minutes of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 23 April 2013. 25 YEARS OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE: THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT UPHOLDING FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 132 ",

        "In line with Article 7 of the Statute of the Sakharov Prize, as amended on 14 June 2006 219 , the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development jointly took a vote to select three \u2018finalists\u2019. For the first time, therefore, the shortlist of three candidates was drawn up at a joint meeting of the two committees, which chose the finalists on the basis of two rounds of voting. The nominees put forward to the Conference of Presidents were: all those fighting to free hostages in Colombia, Alexander Milinkevich and Ghassan Tueni. Mr Tueni received the most votes. 220 The Conference of Presidents held a meeting on 26 October 2006 221 . The chairs of the political groups discussed how to interpret the phrase \u2018shall select one winner\u2019 in Article 7 of the amended Statute 222 . All three nominees received votes but ultimately, following two rounds of voting, Mr Milinkevich was chosen, with a majority of the votes, to be the winner of the 2006 Sakharov Prize. The official award ceremony was organised for 12 December 2006, and Mr Milinkevich, the leader of the United Democratic Forces of the Belarusian opposition, was invited to attend. Addressing the 2006 winner, the President, Mr Borrell Fontelles, spoke about the Belarusian presidential elections in March which had been \u2018neither free nor fair\u2019, and during which Mr Milinkevich had had the \u2018courage to challenge the last dictatorship in Europe\u2019. In awarding the Sakharov Prize to this scientist and leader of the opposition, Parliament was awarding it \u2018to the hope of a democratic Belarus and to all the people fighting alongside you to make it a reality\u2019. 223 Mr Milinkevich dedicated the Sakharov Prize to all his compatriots, to \u2018all of those who were in the square in Minsk last March, who have been thrown into prison and expelled from universities and workplaces\u2019, to the political prisoners in his country, to all those who continued to defend the fundamental right to live in a free country. He urged Europe to continue its robust stance with regard to the difficult situation in his country: \u2018There is a lot you can do! You can help us to break down the barriers to information and the restricted view of the world imposed upon my fellow countrymen by government propaganda, to create a public space conducive to open debate amongst the citizens, bringing together independent authors, intellectuals and moral authorities.

In his speech, Mr P\u00f6ttering pointed out that the decision of the political group chairs as to the winner of the 2007 prize had been unanimous: \u2018The European Parliament has thereby reaffirmed its solidarity with the people in Darfur and its conviction that a sustainable solution for that region can only be achieved through justice, democracy and respect for human rights.\u2019 Salih Mahmoud Osman\u2019s work exemplified this in that it went beyond the provision of legal representation for victims. The President highlighted Mr Osman\u2019s commitment, as a member of the opposition in the Sudanese parliament since 2005, to promoting genuine reform of the country\u2019s judicial system. 230 In his speech, Salih Mahmoud Osman said he would be proud to accept the prize on behalf of all the other candidates that year. Regarding the situation in Darfur, he gave the following message to the European Union: the innocent civilians in the region, the thousands of torture victims and the four million people displaced, all needed the European Union to take a strong and united position, because \u2018so far we have not seen any concrete steps to address the situation in a strong and targeted manner.\u2019 Europe had to put greater pressure on the Sudanese Government and redouble its efforts to bring the government and the rebels to the table for peace negotiations. In addition, he requested that Europe encourage the establishment of the rule of law in his country, \u2018so that all citizens of Sudan can enjoy their individual and collective rights\u2019. 231 230 Speech by President P\u00f6ttering, European Parliament debates of 11 December 2007. 231 Speech by Salih Mahmoud Osman, European Parliament debates of 11 December 2007. 25 YEARS OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE: THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT UPHOLDING FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 142 ",

        "At its meeting of 23 October 2008 234 , the Conference of Presidents decided to award the 2008 Sakharov Prize to Hu Jia. It also used the meeting to criticise any attempt by some third-country governments to influence Parliament\u2019s decision by lobbying MEPs. The President, Mr P\u00f6ttering, announced the decision to Parliament that day in plenary 235 : \u2018By awarding the Sakharov Prize to Hu Jia, the European Parliament is demonstrating forcefully and with determination its recognition of the daily fight for freedom carried on by all defenders of human rights in China.\u2019 The award ceremony took place on 17 December 2008. It was a special event, as Parliament welcomed a large number of former Sakharov Prize winners to mark the 20th anniversary of the prize and the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The day before, Parliament had created a Sakharov network in an effort to promote the activities of past and present winners. Most of the winners attended in person: Adem Dema\u00e7i (1991 winner); Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo, represented by Hebe Pastor de Bonafini (1992 winner); Oslobo\u0111enje, represented by Lidija Kora\u0107 (1993 winner); Taslima Nasreen (1994 winner); Leyla Zana (1995 winner); Wei Jingsheng (1996 winner); \u00a1Basta Ya!, represented by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Alem\u00e1n Amundarain (2000 winner); Dom Zacarias Kamwenho (2001 joint winner); the Belarusian Association of Journalists, represented by Zhanna Litvina (2004 winner); Hauwa Ibrahim (2005 joint winner); Reporters Without Borders, represented by Jean- Fran\u00e7ois Julliard (2005 joint winner); Aleksander Milinkevich (2006 winner); and Salih Mahmoud Osman (2007 winner). Other recipients were, once again, unable to make it to Strasbourg. Under house arrest in her country, Aung San Suu Kyi (1990 winner) was represented by Zoya Phan. Forbidden from travelling by the Cuban authorities, Oswaldo Jos\u00e9 Pay\u00e1 Sardi\u00f1as (2002 winner) was represented by his nephew, Adam Mascar\u00f3 Pay\u00e1, and the Ladies in White (2005 joint winner) by Blanca Reyes. In prison since 2007, Hu Jia did not attend the ceremony to collect his Sakharov Prize. An empty chair was placed in the centre of the Chamber for him. Deprived of her passport, Zeng Jinyan, the winner\u2019s wife, was also unable to leave China. She did however send Parliament a video message on behalf of her husband, in which she announced that she intended to respect her husband\u2019s wishes and use the Sakharov Prize money to create a foundation dedicated to helping the families of human rights activists. To celebrate this historic moment, Elena Bonner was also invited to attend the ceremony with her daughter, Tatiana. In her speech 236 , Mr Sakharov\u2019s widow, an 85-year-old human rights activist, stressed that \u2018we should never make concessions 234 Minutes of the Conference of Presidents of 23 October 2008, pp. 16-17. 235 Speech by President P\u00f6ttering, European Parliament debates of 23 October 2008. 236 Speech by Elena Bonner, European Parliament debates of 17 December 2008. 25 YEARS OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE: THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT UPHOLDING FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 146 ",

        "6 October 2009 239 . The three nominees with the most votes were: Dr Izzeldin Abuelaish, Dawit Isaak and Memorial (Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva). At its meeting of 22 October 2009 240 , the Conference of Presidents unanimously decided to award the 2009 Sakharov Prize to Memorial, the organisation dedicated to promoting human rights in the post-Soviet states. When the President, Mr Buzek 241 , announced the name of the winner at the plenary session, he expressed Parliament\u2019s hope \u2018that by doing so, we will contribute to ending the circle of fear, uncertainty and violence surrounding human rights defenders in the Russian Federation\u2019. Twenty years after the death of Andrei Sakharov, the prize bearing his name was awarded to one of the associations that he himself had created. In its early years, Memorial, which was founded during the perestroika era, aimed to support the political prisoners who were victims of Stalinist repression. The formal Sakharov Prize award ceremony took place on 16 December 2009. In his speech, the President, Mr Buzek, asked how Mr Sakharov might have felt that day, if he could have attended the ceremony. \u2018Would he feel pride, or more a sense of sadness that today\u2019s Russia still needs such organisations?\u2019 242 At the ceremony, Memorial was represented by Lyudmila Alexeyeva, Oleg Orlov and Sergei Kovalev. Mr Kovalev gave an acceptance speech on behalf of the organisation 243 . He called for a minute\u2019s silence in memory of all the people who had been murdered 244 , in recent years, for campaigning for human rights in Russia. Mr Kovalev stressed that the Sakharov Prize had not been awarded exclusively to Memorial but to all those people who had disappeared and to the entire Russian community involved in the fight to defend human rights. Mr Kovalev concluded his speech with a few thoughts on the name of the \u2018Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought\u2019. \u2018How can thought not be free? Who can limit its freedom and how? There is a means \u2013 it is the fear that becomes part of a person\u2019s personality and makes that person think and even feel as required.\u2019 \u2018What can stand up to this fear? However paradoxical it may be, purely and solely freedom of thought.

At its meeting of 21 October 2010 248 , the Conference of Presidents decided to award the 2010 Sakharov Prize to Guillermo Fari\u00f1as. After the meeting, the President, Mr Buzek, announced the name of the winner in plenary 249 : \u2018Guillermo Fari\u00f1as [was] ready to sacrifice and risk his own health and life as a means of pressure to achieve change in Cuba. He used hunger strikes to protest and to challenge the lack of freedom of speech in Cuba, carrying the hopes of all those who care for freedom, human rights and democracy.\u2019 The 2010 award ceremony took place on 15 December 2010. However, Guillermo Fari\u00f1as\u2019 chair remained empty: the prize winner had not received authorisation to leave Cuba. In his absence, President Buzek laid his certificate on an empty chair with a Cuban flag draped over it, and a prerecorded speech by the winner was played. In his speech, Mr Buzek highlighted the strength of people like Guillermo Fari\u00f1as, of whom it could be said that, although they were persecuted and imprisoned, \u2018their voice cannot be silenced\u2019. He added that \u2018the role of the European Parliament and the role of every one of us is to strengthen that voice\u2019. 250 In his message, Guillermo Fari\u00f1as thanked the European Parliament for not abandoning the Cuban people and for not forgetting the sufferings endured in more than 50 years of struggle for democracy. He stressed that Cuba should fulfill five conditions before Europe changes its position on the country: 1) proceed with the release of all political prisoners and conscientious objectors; 2) immediately stop all violent repression of peaceful opposition; 3) announce the review and repeal of Cuban laws which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 4) authorise, in everyday practice, independent opposition parties, media and unions; 5) publicly accept that Cubans living in diaspora have the right to participate in the country\u2019s social, political, economic and cultural life. 251 On 3 July 2013, Guillermo Fari\u00f1as, accompanied by his mother, was finally welcomed at Parliament in Strasbourg and the 2010 Sakharov Prize was personally awarded to him at the plenary session. He thanked Parliament for the prize, declaring: \u2018We are the change.\u2019 He raised his fist at the end of his speech, signalling the strength of hope, the hope of one day living in a democratic Cuba. 252 247 Minutes of the Committee on Development of 18 October 2010, p. 1, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/home.html 248 Minutes of the Conference of Presidents of 21 October 2010, p. 13. 249 Speech by President Buzek, European Parliament debates of 21 October 2010. 250 Speech by President Buzek, European Parliament debates of 15 December 2010. 251 Recorded message by Guillermo Fari\u00f1as, European Parliament debates of 15 December 2010. 252 European Parliament debates of 3 July 2013. 157 CHAPTER V A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE ",

The official ceremony took place on 14 December 2011.

Ms Sotoudeh is an Iranian lawyer who had defended women\u2019s rights, human rights activists and prisoners of conscience. She was arrested in September 2010 and sentenced to 11 years in prison in addition to being barred from practising law for 20 years. Mr Panahi is an Iranian film director and screenwriter whose films, which were often banned in Iran, had won many international awards. In December 2010, Mr Panahi was arrested and sentenced to 6 years in prison and barred from directing any films for 20 years.

The Conference of Presidents 264 decided, unanimously, to award the 2012 Sakharov Prize to the Iranian nominees, Nasrin Sotoudeh and Jafar Panahi. That same day, the President, Mr Schulz, announced the names of the winners to the European Parliament 265 and said that awarding the prize to these joint winners was a sign of solidarity and recognition for a man and a woman who had not been bowed by fear and intimidation and who had chosen to put the fate of their country before their own. 262 Notice to the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Committee on Development of 18 September 2012, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/home.html 263 Minutes of the Committee on Development of 9 October 2012, p. 6, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/home. html 264 Minutes of the Conference of Presidents of 26 October 2012, p. 16. 265 Speech by President Schulz, European Parliament debates of 26 October 2012. 165 CHAPTER V A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF THE SAKHAROV PRIZE ",
        "The President added that the decision had been taken by the political group chairs unanimously and extremely quickly. The formal Sakharov Prize award ceremony took place on 12 December 2012. The winners, both imprisoned in Iran, were unable to receive their prize in person: two chairs were left empty for them in the middle of the Chamber. Ms Sotoudeh was represented by two of her compatriots: Shirin Ebadi (winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize) and Karim Lahidji. Before reading Ms Sotoudeh\u2019s message, Shirin Ebadi explained that the choice of representatives had been no accident. Two Iranian lawyers had been forced into exile for defending political prisoners and prisoners of conscience: Mr Lahidji 28 years ago and herself four years ago. The choice of representatives therefore showed that such practices had been ongoing in Iran for 30 years. In her message to Parliament, Ms Sotoudeh deplored the fact that, in spite of decades of fighting for human rights worldwide, these rights were still being violated in some countries where there were no effective mechanisms for safeguarding them. She stressed that it was up to governments to respect and uphold human rights, and that measures should be taken in order to ensure that those governments honoured the commitments they had given in international conventions 266 . Ms Sotoudeh thanked the European Parliament for the Sakharov Prize, which she dedicated to all Iranian political prisoners, to oppressed religious minorities, to those who had demonstrated during the elections and had been imprisoned and, above all, to her lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, who was imprisoned in 2012 for defending political prisoners. Mr Panahi asked two members of his \u2018cinema family\u2019 to receive the prize on his behalf: the director Constantin Costa-Gavras and Serge Toubiana, director of the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in Paris. Solmaz Panahi, Mr Panahi\u2019s daughter, was also present. In his speech, Mr Costa-Gavras recalled that a seat had been left empty in the Cannes Film Festival jury two and a half years earlier. \u2018The chair belonged to Jafar Panahi, who was banned from attending the film festival and celebration.\u2019 Concerned colleagues from the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise had started a petition, which was signed during the Festival by directors\u2019 and actors\u2019 guilds and by big names from around the world. Despite this international support, Mr Panahi was arrested a few months later. 267 In his message, read by Mr Costa-Gavras, Mr Panahi explained why he had chosen to stay in the country that had sentenced him and banned him from working as a filmmaker.

        "Dear Chair of the Sakharov Foundation, I won the Sakharov prize this year along with another Iranian dissident. I use the word \u201cdissident\u201d as your fame comes from this word. Being a dissident, especially in the Soviet regime was a terribly tough vocation! The times you lived in and your homeland presented their own difficulties but the struggles and efforts of people like you made things better. I understand the importance of this award, but more than anything I wished to learn more about your life. I had heard the name \u201cAndrei Sakharov\u201d since I was a University student in the 1980s, as a \u201cdissident scientist\u201d. I wished to know what he had done to have to been dubbed a \u201cdissident\u201d. And why does a person become a dissident in his country? With whom and with what is he discontented? Later I learnt that \u201cdissident\u201d is a soft term that critics of an autocratic and powerful government call themselves to try to safeguard their own selves from violence perpetrated against them and paying a higher price whilst guarding their honour and human dignity and not surrendering to the illogical demands of their government: an honourable and peaceful way for opponents to both keep their self-respect and make clear to the government that they will not surrender. But as the story of autocracy in all governments is alike, the stories of resistance based on human nature are similar too. So, many years after Sakharov was carrying out his dissident activities, \u201cdissidents\u201d in my country chose a similar word for themselves: \u201cnonconformist\u201d. In its broad meaning the term \u201cnon-conformist\u201d describes all people who think differently from the government, whose reflections, daily and civil lives, religion and beliefs and what they like and dislike are not liked by the government. Accordingly, Iranian nonconformists are not necessarily all opponents but simply people whose beliefs are different from those of the government, making them similar to the \u201cdissident\u201d in the Soviet Union. \u201cNonconformist\u201d is also a term applied to people who do not accept the government politically and wish to gain power. \u201cNonconformist\u201d is applied as well to people who do not politically accept the government and wish to gain power through reforms and not through a rapid shift in power through revolution. \u201cNonconformist\u201d is applied to people who struggle for women\u2019s right, rights that are not liked by the government. \u201cNonconformist\u201d refers to people who might have criticism of the government as well. \u201cNonconformist\u201d is applied to people who have converted from Islam, since, on the basis of the Constitution, the official religion of the country is Islam. This term includes people who are born to families following religions other than Islam. \u201cNonconformist\u201d is applied to secular people, liberals, leftists and people who follow many other schools of thought. And unfortunately, I should say that \u201cnonconformist\u201d is applied even to survivors of the incidents of the 80s in Iran since after those occurrences many of them took up new lifestyles and started viewing the government differently. The blot on their honour has never been erased. Nonconformist includes the protesters against the electoral fraud and the journalists who reported news concerning the nonconformists. And it also includes students who struggle for their union rights and it of course applies to lawyers who defend the students from all angles to prove their innocence and provide them with a legal defence. The political section of Evin and other prisons in Iran is accommodating all these nonconformists. ",

        "3rd March 2013 Evin Prison Dear Mr. Sakharov, Do you know how eager a political prisoner is to know about the experience of other political prisoners in other countries? She wants to know what kinds of pressures they suffered. How they demonstrated their discontent of their suffering, how the political power would react to them and how and to what extent would the prisoners resist the pressures piled on them. Through studying the memoirs of the freedom fighters in other countries, she learns that she is not the first person to protest and neither is her government the first one to use the intelligence and security services more than is necessary and uses the courts as a charade for justifying its unjust verdicts. She also compares the resistance methods of other fighters to those used in her own country as well as the existing potential for fighters in other countries and hers. As she compares and analyzes, she admires the efforts of these dissidents to defend, with honour, their honour and human dignity and learns that there are noble and pacific ways to safeguard her human dignity. And, in the end, she concludes with all her faith and hope that she will conquer all difficulties. Reading your memoirs was exciting for me in many ways. The similarities in our methods and the existence of lots of points in common, were all very encouraging to me and of course your reluctance to surrender to the authoritarian methods of the government in your country was admirable. Your daily renewal of life and resistance was amazing. You of course were reflecting the spirit of Goethe when he said \u201che alone deserves liberty and life who daily must win them anew\u201d. But I have to make a shameful confession to you: I learnt this method from my investigators. I learnt from them that I have to renew my struggle every day, as each day they pick their unfair fight with me. And I ask myself, if they are so persistent in their unfair goals, why should not I be as persistent in my fair aims? ",

        "Reading your memoirs, I kept comparing the situation of political prisoners in Iran and the Soviet Union. I know long and difficult years were imposed on your society during which many families felt the bitter taste of being imprisoned or having a relative in prison, but in time the dignity of the prisoners and their families was re-established. The society I live in has been through the horrible events of the 1980s. Despite the fact that three decades have passed, the dignity of the victims has yet to be re-established. This hurts me, but I do not lose hope as I wish to live in a society that respects civil standards as we know them today. You embarked on a hunger strike to protest the punishment imposed on your family that denied them the right to leave the country. You did so because it is evident that no family member of a prisoner should be prosecuted and punished due to the conviction of another family member, an axiom that was repeatedly ignored by dictatorships that turned punishment of political prisoners into family punishments. I also went on a hunger strike to protest the travel bans on my daughter and my husband, so I could easily empathise with that part of your memoirs. I hope the state in which I am a political prisoner stops prosecuting my husband, although I am prepared to face that as well. You got your professional qualifications for your activity through the same government that you unavoidably and quickly came to oppose. I also received the permission to study in state universities despite hard filtering, and through them I gained the bachelor and master degrees in law. Of course I faced a lot of difficulties to become a member of the Iranian Bar Association. This took 8 years and might have postponed my imprisonment for 8 years. Constantly being investigated was a part of the life full of worries that you lived in exile in Gorky, and sometimes hundreds of pages of your memoirs got confiscated. I was also subjected to searches, and once even my defence statements got confiscated! In addition to all similarities between my life and yours, or the ones that I wish to find, there is the companionship of an attendant spouse who is a prudent advisor and a powerful manager, a gift that I enjoy as you did.

        "9th March 2013 Evin Prison Dear Mr Sakharov, In addition to investigating your past in your book, you showed how you came to take the positions you took in your life. How did you turn into a dissident? How did you turn into a protestor? And how did you detach step by step from a government that had provided you with everything? Did a kind of moral responsibility for nuclear war that was threatening the earth and could destroy humanity lead to your position? Did you feel responsible for the disaster that could ruin the earth? And did you see the power in yourself to stop this disaster, huge as it seemed? I imagine you did see this potential in yourself, because you correctly believed that: \u00abWe must make good the demands of reason and create a life worthy of ourselves and of the goals we only dimly perceive\u00bb. While reading your memoirs, I kept asking myself whether it was really your spontaneous efforts and those of Robert Oppenheimer in America that stopped the nuclear war and resulted in the agreement between the United States and the USSR. As the probability of a nuclear war has decreased, has its terrifying shadow on the population of the world been forgotten? I, personally, have not forgotten that this shadow was looming over the heads of billions of people and disaster could have happened. I believe that the endeavours of people and scientists like you shifted that dreadful shadow away from us. But the world of politics is still overwhelmed with threats of ruinous wars which are about to wipe out the lives of billions of people. But civilians today hope that in time, as time goes by, humans gain more rationality and wisdom and achieve more rational ways. I would like to go back to your first question, as it is a question I have asked myself many times: how did I come to take the positions I have taken in my life? How did the fear of prison subside in me? Do you remember how you used to attend the trials of your friends to show your support for them? Was it a feeling of responsibility to oppose the injustice done to \u00abdissidents\u00bb in the Soviet Union that made you declare your support for them? But I was just defending \u00abnonconformists\u00bb in fulfillment of my professional lawyers\u2019 oath. Witnessing the verdicts given to them, I was sure that they would come for me soon. This is how the fear of prison collapsed in me as the suffering I was enduring by witnessing those unjust verdicts was stronger than the suffering of being imprisoned. 19/12/1391 ",

        "29 March 2013 Evin Prison This is the last letter I am writing to you. However, the similarities between your life and what I see in Iran are so many that describing them will take much more time. Yet I want to say I admire your persevering and continuous attempts to attend the trials of dissidents in the Soviet Union, and I want to believe that the suffering you and other dissidents bore led to changes in the Soviet Union. Reading descriptions of the trials of dissidents in your book reminded me of the trials of Iranian dissidents and free thinkers and their families and friends waiting behind the court walls, prohibited from entering the court rooms. They also faced threats of arrest and were actually arrested many times, too. Your efforts to get political prisoners given an unconditional amnesty paved the way for their release with their pride intact. Your resistance prevented the general amnesty from being used to force the prisoners to abandon their so called anti-social behaviours (!) or to clean the image of the oppressors. You prevented such misuse and paved the way for their unconditional release. I know that all your dreams have not come true. The shadow of nuclear war still shows its ugly face due to violence-spreading politicians. I know that not all your dreams have come true even in your homeland. Pussy Riot still get arrested in the Russia after the reform for their peaceful protest as does Ales Bialiatski in the Belarus after the reform for a crime he did not commit. \u2018What you managed to achieve was a great victory for all freedom fighters all over the world. May those who come in future realise your unrealised dreams. They will definitely struggle to realise their dreams and will guard them\u2019. Good bye! Nasrin Sotoudeh Evin ",

        "CONCLUSIONS The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought is testimony to the importance that the European Parliament attaches to the fight against violations of democracy and freedom of thought, opinion and expression. In creating the Sakharov Prize, Parliament wanted to pay homage to those people involved in promoting human rights throughout the world, sometimes in extremely difficult circumstances. Each year, when selecting a winner, or sometimes two or three, the European Parliament is faced with a very difficult task, as all the nominees deserve the prize. In the 25-year history of the prize, Parliament has awarded it to some 30 people and seven organisations for their outstanding contributions in protecting human rights and promoting democracy. Many of these winners have spent years in prison and some have even given their lives to protect these values. The men and women who have been awarded this prize come from different continents and countries 269 and represent different professions: i.a. lawyers, journalists, writers, politicians, religious men and women, teachers and artists. The common thread between the people and organisations that have received the Sakharov Prize is that they have seen the urgent need \u2018to promote basic human rights, especially freedom of discussion and inquiry, respect for the law, and for international law and conventions and mutual commitments as the foundation of peace among nations\u2019 270 and that they have all been willing to devote their lives to this difficult struggle. 269 South Africa, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Bangladesh, Belarus, Myanmar/Burma, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, Cuba, Egypt, Spain, Ghana, Iran, Israel, Kosovo, Libya, Nigeria, Palestine, Russia, Sudan, Syria, Czechoslovakia, East Timor, Tunisia and Turkey. 270 Resolution of the European Parliament of 13 December 1985 on the creation of a Sakharov Prize, OJ C 352, 31.12.1985, p. 304. 183 CONCLUSION ",
