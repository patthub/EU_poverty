The following shall be disregarded in calculating the automatic decommitment: (a) that part of the budget commitments for which a declaration of expenditure has been made but for which reimbursement has been reduced or suspended by the Commission at 31 December of year N + 3; (b) that part of the budget commitments which a paying agency has been unable to disburse for reasons of force majeure seriously affecting the implementation of the rural development programme. National authorities claiming force majeure shall demonstrate the direct consequences on the implementation of all or part of the programme. By 31 January, the Member State shall send to the Commission information on the exceptions referred to in the first subparagraph concerning the amounts declared by the end of the preceding year. 5. The Commission shall inform Member States in good time if there is a risk of automatic decommitment. It shall inform them of the amount involved as indicated by the information in its possession. The Member States shall have two months from receiving this information to agree to the amount in question or present observations.

The Commission may adopt implementing acts, reducing or suspending the monthly or interim payments to a Member State if one or more of the key components of the national control system in question do not exist or are not effective due to the gravity or persistence of the deficiencies found, or if there are similar serious deficiencies in the system for the recovery of irregular payments and if one of the following conditions is met: (a) the deficiencies referred to in the first subparagraph are of a continuous nature and have been the reason for at least two imple \u00ad menting acts pursuant to Article 52, excluding from Union financing expenditure from the Member State concerned; or (b) the Commission concludes that the Member State concerned is not in a position to implement in the immediate future the necessary remedial measures in accordance with an action plan with clear progress indicators, to be established in consultation with the Commission. The reduction or suspension shall be applied to the relevant expenditure effected by the paying agency where the deficiencies exist for a period to be determined in the implementing acts referred to in this paragraph, which shall not exceed twelve months. If the conditions for the reduction or suspension continue to be met, the Commission may adopt implementing acts prolonging that period for further periods not exceeding twelve months in total.

Article 42 Suspension of payments in the case of late submission Where sectoral agricultural legislation requires Member States to submit, within a specific period of time, information on the number of checks carried out under Article 59 and their outcomes and where the Member States overrun that period, the Commission may suspend the monthly payments referred to in Article 18 or the interim payments referred to in Article 36 provided that the Commission has made available to the Member States in good time prior to the start of the reference period all the information, forms and explanations they need to compile the relevant statistics. The amount to be suspended shall not exceed 1,5 % of the expenditure for which the relevant statistical information has not been sent in time. In applying the suspension, the Commission shall act in accordance with the principle of propor \u00ad tionality, taking account of the extent of the delay.

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 116(2). 2. The Commission shall assess the amounts to be excluded on the basis of the gravity of the non-conformity recorded. It shall take due account of the nature of the infringement and of the financial damage caused to the Union. It shall base the exclusion on the identification of amounts unduly spent and, where these cannot be identified with proportionate effort, may apply extrapolated or flat-rate corrections. Flat-rate corrections shall only be applied where, due to the nature of the case or because the Member State has not provided the Commission with the necessary information, it is not possible with proportionate effort to identify more precisely the financial damage caused to the Union. 3. Before the adoption of any decision to refuse financing, the findings from the Commission's inspection and the Member State's replies shall be notified in writing, following which the two parties shall attempt to reach agreement on the action to be taken. At that point in the procedure the Member States shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate that the actual extent of the non-compliance is less than in the Commission's assessment. If agreement is not reached, the Member State may request the opening of a procedure aimed at reconciling, within a period of four months, each party's position. A report of the outcome of the procedure shall be submitted to the Commission. The Commission shall take into account the recommendations in the report before deciding on any refusal of financing and shall give reasons if it decides not to follow those recom \u00ad mendations. 4.

For any undue payment following the occurrence of irregularity or negligence, Member States shall request recovery from the beneficiary within 18 months after the approval and, where applicable, reception, by the paying agency or body responsible for the recovery, of a control report or similar document, stating that an irregularity has taken place. The corresponding amounts shall be recorded at the time of the recovery request in the debtors' ledger of the paying agency. 2. If recovery has not taken place within four years from the date of the recovery request, or within eight years where recovery is taken in the national courts, 50 % of the financial consequences of the non- recovery shall be borne by the Member State concerned and 50 % by the Union's budget, without prejudice to the requirement that the Member State concerned must pursue recovery procedures in compliance with Article 58. Where, in the context of the recovery procedure, the absence of any irregularity is recorded by an administrative or legal instrument of a final nature, the Member State concerned shall declare as expenditure to the Funds the financial burden borne by it under the first subparagraph. However, if for reasons not attributable to the Member State concerned, it is not possible for recovery to take place within the time limit specified in the first subparagraph, and the amount to be recovered exceeds EUR 1 million, the Commission may, at the request of the Member State, extend the time-limit by a period of up to half of the original period. 3. On duly justified grounds, Member States may decide not to pursue recovery. A decision to this effect may be taken only in the following cases: (a) where the costs already and likely to be effected total more than the amount to be recovered, which condition shall be considered to have been met if: (i) the amount to be recovered from the beneficiary in the context of an individual payment for an aid scheme or support measure, not including interest, does not exceed EUR 100; or (ii) the amount to be recovered from the beneficiary in the context of an individual payment for an aid scheme or support measure, not including interest, falls between EUR 100 and EUR 150 and the Member State concerned applies a threshold equal to or higher than the amount to be recovered under its national law for not pursuing national debts. \u25bc B ",

Where the decision referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is taken before the outstanding amount has been subject to the rules referred to in paragraph 2, the financial consequence of non- recovery shall be borne by the Union's budget. 4. Member States shall enter in the annual accounts to be sent to the Commission under point (c)(iv) of Article 102(1) the amounts to be borne by them under paragraph 2 of this Article. The Commission shall check that this has been done and make any adjustments needed in the implementing act referred to in Article 51. 5. The Commission may, provided that the procedure laid down in Article 52(3) has been followed, adopt, implementing acts, excluding from Union financing sums charged to the Union's budget in the following cases: (a) if the Member State has not respected the time limits referred to in paragraph 1; (b) if it considers that the decision not to pursue recovery taken by a Member State pursuant to paragraph 3 is not justified; (c) if it considers that an irregularity or lack of recovery is the outcome of irregularity or negligence attributable to the administrative auth \u00ad orities or another official body of the Member State. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 116(2). Article 55 Provisions specific to the EAGF Sums recovered following the occurrence of irregularity or negligence and the interest thereon shall be made over to the paying agency and booked by it as revenue assigned to the EAGF in the month in which the money is actually received.

Amounts of the Union financing under the EAFRD which are cancelled and amounts recovered, as well as the interest thereon, shall be real \u00ad located to the programme concerned.

Member States may set up decentralised databases on condition that these, and the administrative procedures for recording and accessing data, are designed to be homogeneous throughout the territory of the Member State and are compatible with one another in order to allow for cross-checks. Article 70 Identification system for agricultural parcels 1. The identification system for agricultural parcels shall be estab \u00ad lished on the basis of maps, land registry documents or other carto \u00ad graphic references. Use shall be made of computerised geographical information system techniques, including aerial or spatial orthoimagery, with a homogenous standard that guarantees a level of accuracy that is at least equivalent to that of cartography at a scale of 1:10 000 and, as from 2016, at a scale of 1:5 000, while taking into account the outline and condition of the parcel. This shall be fixed in accordance with existing Union standards. Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, Member States may continue to make use of such techniques including aerial or spatial orthoimagery, with a homogenous standard that guarantees a level of accuracy that is at least equivalent to that of cartography at a scale of 1:10 000 where they were acquired on the basis of long-term contracts that were agreed before November 2012. 2. Member States shall ensure that the identification system for agri \u00ad cultural parcels contains a reference layer to accommodate ecological focus areas. That reference layer shall, in particular, cover the relevant specific commitments and/or environmental certification schemes referred to in Article 43(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 that are equivalent to the practices in Article 46 of that Regulation before the application forms referred to in Article 72 of this Regulation for payments for agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment referred to in Articles 43 to 46 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 are provided in respect of claim year 2018 at the latest. Article 71 System for the identification and registration of payment entitlements 1. The system for the identification and registration of payment entitlements shall allow for verification of the entitlements and for cross-checks with the aid applications and the identification system for agricultural parcels. 2. The system referred to in paragraph 1 shall allow direct and immediate consultation, through the competent authority of the Member State, of the data relating to at least the previous four consecutive calendar years. Article 72 Aid applications and payment claims 1. Each year, a beneficiary of the support referred to in Article 67(2) shall submit an application for direct payments or a payment claim for the relevant area and animal-related rural development measures respect \u00ad ively indicating, where applicable: \u25bc B ",

As regards the area-related direct payment, each Member State shall determine the minimum size of agricultural parcels in respect of which an application may be made. However, the minimum size shall not exceed 0,3 ha. 2. By way of derogation from point (a) of paragraph 1, Member States may decide that agricultural parcels of an area of up to 0,1 ha on which an application for payment is not made, do not need to be declared, provided that the sum of such parcels does not exceed 1 ha, and/or may decide that a farmer who does not apply for any area-based direct payment does not have to declare his agricultural parcels in the case where the total area does not exceed 1 ha. In all cases, the farmer shall, indicate in his application that he has agricultural parcels at his disposal and at the request of the competent authorities, shall indicate their location. 3. Member States shall provide, inter alia through electronic means, pre-established forms based on the areas determined in the previous year as well as graphic material indicating the location of those areas. A Member State may decide that the aid application and the payment claim: (a) are valid if the beneficiary confirms the absence of changes with respect to the aid application and the payment claim submitted the previous year, (b) need to contain only changes with respect to the aid application and the payment claim submitted for the previous year. However, with regard to the small farmers scheme provided for in Title V of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, that possibility shall be given to all farmers concerned. 4. A Member State may decide that a single application shall cover a number of or all support schemes and measures referred to in Article 67 or other support schemes and measures. 5. By way of derogation from Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 ( 1 ), the calculation of the date for the submission or the amendment of an aid application, of a payment claim or of any supporting documents, contracts or declarations under this Chapter shall be adapted to the specific requirements of the integrated system.

Article 74 Verification of eligibility conditions and reductions 1. In accordance with Article 59, Member States, through the paying agencies or the bodies delegated by them, shall carry out administrative checks on the aid application to verify the eligibility conditions for the aid. Those checks shall be supplemented by on-the-spot checks. 2. For the purpose of on-the-spot checks Member States shall draw up a sampling plan of agricultural holdings and/or beneficiaries. 3. Member States may use remote sensing and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) techniques as a means of carrying out on- the-spot checks on agricultural parcels. 4. In the case of non -compliance with the eligibility conditions Article 63 shall apply. Article 75 Payment to beneficiaries 1. The payments under the support schemes and the measures referred to in Article 67(2) shall be made within the period from 1 December to 30 June of the following calendar year. Payments shall be made in a maximum of two instalments within that period. Notwithstanding the first and second subparagraphs, Member States may, prior to 1 December but not before 16 October, pay advances of up to 50 % for direct payments and of up to 75 % for the support granted under rural development as referred to in Article 67(2).

In order to respond to changes in sectoral agricultural legislation and to ensure the efficiency of the system of ex-post controls established by this Chapter, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115 establishing a list of measures which, due to their design and control requirements, are unsuited for additional ex-post controls by way of scrutiny of commercial documents and, therefore, are not to be subject to such scrutiny under this Chapter. 3. For the purposes of this Chapter the following definitions shall apply: (a) \"commercial document\" means all books, registers, vouchers and supporting documents, accounts, production and quality records, and correspondence relating to the undertaking's business activity, as well as commercial data, in whatever form they may take, including electronically stored data, in so far as these documents or data relate directly or indirectly to the transactions referred to in paragraph 1; (b) \"third party\" means any natural or legal person directly or indirectly connected with transactions carried out within the financing system by the EAGF. Article 80 Scrutiny by Member States 1. Member States shall carry out systematic scrutiny of the commercial documents of undertakings taking account of the nature of the transactions to be scrutinised. Member States shall ensure that the selection of undertakings for scrutiny gives the best possible assurance of the effectiveness of the measures for preventing and detecting irregularities. The selection shall take account, inter alia, of the financial importance of the undertakings in that system and of other risk factors. 2. In appropriate cases, the scrutiny provided for in paragraph 1 shall be extended to natural and legal persons with whom undertakings are associated and to such other natural or legal persons as may be relevant for the pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 81. 3. The scrutiny carried out pursuant to this Chapter shall not prejudice the checks undertaken pursuant to Articles 47 and 48. Article 81 Objectives of the scrutiny 1. The accuracy of primary data under scrutiny shall be verified by a number of cross-checks, including, where necessary, the commercial documents of third parties, appropriate to the degree of risk presented, including: (a) comparisons with the commercial documents of suppliers, customers, carriers and other third parties; \u25bc B ",

In particular, where undertakings are required to keep particular book records of stock in accordance with Union or national provisions, scrutiny of those records shall, in appropriate cases, include a comparison with the commercial documents and, where appropriate, with the actual quantities in stock. 3. In the selection of transactions to be checked, full account shall be taken of the degree of risk presented. Article 82 Access to commercial documents 1. The persons responsible for the undertaking, or a third party, shall ensure that all commercial documents and additional information are supplied to the officials responsible for the scrutiny or to the persons authorised to carry it out on their behalf. Electronically stored data shall be provided on an appropriate data support medium. 2. The officials responsible for the scrutiny or the persons authorised to carry it out on their behalf may require that extracts or copies of the documents referred to in paragraph 1 be supplied to them. 3. Where, during scrutiny carried out pursuant to this Chapter, the commercial documents maintained by the undertaking are considered inadequate for scrutiny purposes, the undertaking shall be directed to maintain in future such records as are required by the Member State responsible for the scrutiny, without prejudice to obligations laid down in other Regulations relating to the sector concerned. Member States shall determine the date from which such records are to be established. Where some or all of the commercial documents required to be scrutinised pursuant to this Chapter are located with an undertaking in the same commercial group, partnership or association of undertakings managed on a unified basis as the undertaking scrutinised, whether located inside or outside the territory of the Union, the undertaking shall make those commercial documents available to officials responsible for the scrutiny, at a place and time to be determined by the Member States responsible for carrying out the scrutiny. \u25bc B ",

Member States shall ensure that officials responsible for scrutiny are entitled to seize commercial documents, or have them seized. This right shall be exercised with due regard to the relevant national provisions and shall be without prejudice to the application of rules governing proceedings in criminal matters concerning the seizure of documents. Article 83 Mutual assistance 1. Member States shall assist each other for the purposes of carrying out the scrutiny provided for in this Chapter in the following cases: (a) where an undertaking or third party is established in a Member State other than that in which payment of the amount in question has or should have been made or received; (b) where an undertaking or third party is established in a Member State other than that in which the documents and information required for scrutiny are to be found. The Commission may coordinate joint actions involving mutual assistance between two or more Member States. 2. During the first three months following the EAGF financial year of payment, Member States shall send the Commission a list of under \u00ad takings established in a third country for which payment of the amount in question has or should have been made or received in that Member State. 3. If additional information is required in another Member State as part of the scrutiny of an undertaking in accordance with Article 80, and in particular cross-checks in accordance with Article 81, specific scrutiny requests may be made indicating the reasons for the request. An overview of such specific requests shall be sent to the Commission on a quarterly basis within one month after the end of each quarter. The Commission may require that a copy of individual requests be provided. The scrutiny request shall be fulfilled not later than six months after its receipt; the results of the scrutiny shall be communicated without delay to the requesting Member State and to the Commission.

The Member States which were Members of the Union on 1 January 2004 shall ensure that land which was under permanent pasture on the date provided for in the area aid applications for 2003 is maintained under permanent pasture within defined limits. The Member States which became Member of the Union in 2004 shall ensure that land which was under permanent pasture on 1 May 2004 is maintained under permanent pasture within defined limits. Bulgaria and Romania shall ensure that land which was under permanent pasture on 1 January 2007 is maintained under permanent pasture within defined limits.

The first subparagraph shall not apply to land under permanent pasture to be afforested if such afforestation is compatible with the environment and with the exclusion of plantations of Christmas trees and fast growing species cultivated in the short term. 4. In order to take account of paragraph 3, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115 laying down the rules on maintenance of permanent pasture, in particular in order to ensure that measures are taken to maintain the land under permanent pasture at the level of farmers, including indi \u00ad vidual obligations to be respected such as obligation to reconvert areas into permanent pasture where it is established that the ratio of land under permanent pasture is decreasing. In order to ensure a correct application of the obligations of the Member States on the one hand and individual farmers on the other hand, as regards the maintenance of permanent pasture, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115 to establish the conditions and methods for the determination of the ratio of permanent pasture and agricultural land that has to be maintained. 5. For the purpose of paragraphs 3 and 4, \"permanent pasture\" means permanent pasture as defined in point (c) of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1120/2009 in its original version.

CHAPTER II Control system and administrative penalties in relation to cross- compliance Article 96 Checks of cross-compliance 1. Member States shall make use, where appropriate, of the inte \u00ad grated system laid down in Chapter II of Title V and in particular of points (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) of Article 68(1). Member States may make use of their existing administration and control systems to ensure compliance with the rules on cross- compliance. Those systems, and notably the system for the identification and regis \u00ad tration of animals set up in accordance with Council Directive 2008/71/EC ( 1 ) and Regulations (EC) No 1760/2000 and (EC) No 21/2004, shall be compatible with the integrated system referred to in Chapter II of Title V of this Regulation. 2. Depending on the requirements, standards, acts or areas of cross- compliance in question, Member States may decide to carry out admin \u00ad istrative checks, in particular those already provided for under the control systems applicable to the respective requirement, standard, act or area of cross-compliance. 3. Member States shall carry out on-the-spot checks to verify whether a beneficiary complies with the obligations laid down in this Title. 4. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts, laying down rules on the carrying out of checks in order to verify compliance with the obligations referred to under this Title, including rules allowing that risk analysis takes account of the following factors: \u25bc B ( 1 ) Council Directive 2008/71/EC of 15 July 2008 on the identification and registration of pigs (OJ L 213, 8.8.2008, p. 31).

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the exa \u00ad mination procedure referred to in Article 116(3). Article 97 Application of the administrative penalty 1. The administrative penalty provided for in Article 91 shall be imposed where the rules on cross-compliance are not complied with at any time in a given calendar year ('the calendar year concerned'), and where the non-compliance in question is directly attributable to the beneficiary who submitted the aid application or the payment claim in the calendar year concerned. The first subparagraph shall apply mutatis mutandis to beneficiaries who are found not to have complied with the rules on cross-compliance, at any time during three years from 1 January of the year following the calendar year in which the first payment was granted under the support programmes for restructuring and conversion or at any time during one year from 1 January of the year following the calendar year in which the payment was granted under the support programmes for green harvesting referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013('the years concerned'). 2. In cases in which the land is transferred during the calendar year concerned or the years concerned, paragraph 1 shall also apply where the non-compliance in question is the result of an act or omission directly attributable to the person to whom or from whom the agri \u00ad cultural land was transferred. By way of derogation from the first sentence, where the person to whom the act or omission is directly attributable has submitted an aid application or a payment claim in the calendar year concerned or the years concerned, the administrative penalty shall be imposed on the basis of the total amounts of the payments referred to in Article 92 granted or to be granted to that person. For the purpose of this paragraph, 'transfer' means any type of trans \u00ad action whereby the agricultural land ceases to be at the disposal of the transferor. 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, and subject to the rules to be adopted pursuant to Article 101, Member States may decide not to apply an administrative penalty per beneficiary and per calendar year when the amount of the penalty is EUR 100 or less. \u25bc B ",

The finding and the obligation to take remedial action shall be notified to the beneficiary. 4. The imposition of an administrative penalty shall not affect the legality and regularity of the payments to which it applies. Article 98 Application of the administrative penalty in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania For Bulgaria and Romania, the administrative penalties referred to in Article 91 shall be applied at the latest from 1 January 2016 as regards the statutory management requirements in the area of animal welfare referred to in Annex II. For Croatia, the penalties referred to in Article 91 shall be applied in accordance with the following time schedule as regards the statutory management requirements (SMR) referred to in Annex II: (a) from 1 January 2014 for SMR 1 to SMR 3 and SMR 6 to SMR 8; (b) from 1 January 2016 for SMR 4, SMR 5, SMR 9 and SMR 10; (c) from 1 January 2018 for SMR 11 to SMR 13. Article 99 Calculation of the administrative penalty 1. The administrative penalty provided for in Article 91 shall be applied by means of reduction or exclusion of the total amount of the payments listed in Article 92 granted or to be granted to the beneficiary concerned in respect of aid applications he has submitted or will submit in the course of the calendar year of the finding. For the calculation of those reductions and exclusions, account shall be taken of the severity, extent, permanence and reoccurrence of the non- compliance found as well as of the criteria set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. 2. In the case of non compliance due to negligence, the percentage of reduction shall not exceed 5 % and, in the case of reoccurrence, shall not exceed 15 %. Member States may set up an early warning system that applies to cases of non-compliance which, given their minor severity, extent and duration, shall not, in duly justified cases, lead to a reduction or exclusion. Where a Member State decides to make use of this option, the competent authority shall send an early warning to the beneficiary, notifying the beneficiary of the finding and the obligation to take remedial action. In case a subsequent check establishes that the non- compliance has not been remedied, the reduction pursuant to the first subparagraph shall be applied retroactively. \u25bc B ",

Member States may give priority access to the farm advisory system to the beneficiaries who have received for the first time an early warning. 3. In the case of intentional non-compliance, the percentage reduction shall in principle not be less than 20 % and may go as far as total exclusion from one or several aid schemes and may apply for one or more calendar years. 4. In any event, the total amount of reductions and exclusions for one calendar year shall not be more than the total amount referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1. Article 100 Amounts resulting from cross-compliance Member States may retain 25 % of the amounts resulting from the application of the reductions and exclusions referred to in Article 99. Article 101 Commission powers in relation to the application and calculation of administrative penalties 1. In order to ensure a correct distribution of the funds to the entitled beneficiaries and that cross-compliance is carried out in an efficient, coherent and non-discriminatory way, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115: (a) establishing a harmonised basis for calculation of administrative penalties due to cross-compliance referred to in Article 99, taking into account reductions due to financial discipline; (b) laying down the conditions for the application and calculation of the administrative penalties due to cross-compliance, including in the case of non-compliance directly attributable to the beneficiary concerned. 2. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down detailed procedural and technical rules concerning the calculation and application of administrative penalties referred to in Articles 97 to 99, including as regards beneficiaries consisting of a group of persons under Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.

Article 108 Use of the euro by non-euro Member States 1. If a Member State which has not adopted the euro decides to pay the expenditure resulting from sectoral agricultural legislation in euro rather than in its national currency, the Member State shall take measures to ensure that the use of the euro does not provide a systematic advantage compared with the use of national currency. 2. The Member State shall notify the Commission of the measures planned before they come into effect. The measures may not take effect until the Commission has notified its agreement thereto.
