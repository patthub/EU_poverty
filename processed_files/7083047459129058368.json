        "it was such a revelation,\u201d Trollb\u00e4ck says. \u201cYou know everybody is so involved and tangled up in all the complexities of the whole thing, that it all seems insurmountable sometimes, and suddenly there was just this moment where everybody seemed to realise: yes, we can actually do this.

It\u2019s not a simple challenge, when the goals are laid out in long, wordy, and some- what impenetrable docu- ments. And yet, that was exactly what designer Jakob Trollb\u00e4ck was asked to do: make the Global Goals a brand that is relatable to ordinary people. \u201cThe world isn\u2019t going to solve these challenges if no one understands what they\u2019re about,\u201d says Trollb\u00e4ck. Short and simple The first step was giving each goal a short, simple and positive name. For instance the mouthful \u201cCon- serve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development\u201d became Life Below Water. Then each goal got a bold, colourful icon, arranged in an easy-to-read grid. \u201cIt is like a periodic table for change.

All the countries of the world agreed on a huge plan to solve many of mankind\u2019s worst problems. The plan is called the \u2018Global Goals\u2019: 17 ambitions for what we, the people of the world, want to achieve before 2030. The goals include ending poverty and hunger, providing quality education for all, and much more. In short, it\u2019s about making it possible for everyone to live a good life now, while making sure our children will be able to do the same. One of the world\u2019s leading experts on global development, senior fellow Homi Kharas of the Brookings Institution, be- lieves these Global Goals could indeed change the world: \u201cThere is now a common framework linking various pieces of development cooperation \u2013 security, environment, human rights, humanitarian aid \u2013 all of these are currently operating separately. Through the Global Goals they are being brought together. This can be truly trans- formative,\u201d says Mr. Kharas. Total change Making life better for people should not make us forget the natural world that is the reason we are able to be alive at all. For this reason, many of the goals are about protecting life on land and in the oceans, making our production sus- tainable, and stopping global warming. But one thing is agreeing on such goals, another is to achieve them. \u201cThe scale and ambition of the Global Goals calls for solutions that are more radical than business as usual,\u201d says Kharas. Poverty already halved The success of the previous Millennium Development Goals (2000\u20132015) give some reason for optimism. Extreme poverty has already been halved since 1990, partly thanks to those goals, accord- ing to Homi Kharas. \u201cLeaders are more ambitious when they know others are also acting, and when they are being compared to their peers\u2026 no one wants to be last!\u201d Editorial What kind of world do we want our children to inherit? That is basically the question answered by world leaders from all UN member states exactly one year ago, when they committed to the biggest plan ever to save our planet\u2019s future: The Global Goals. Affecting billions of people, the goals were agreed after years of open discussions between governments, organisations, and private sector companies, while taking in feedback from millions of involved citizens all over the world.

Today, the fertility rate has dropped to 2.5 children per woman.

        "The world has a huge plan. It is so huge that one can be forgiven for wondering if we stand a chance of ever making it. But if we take a look at recent history, there is indeed reason for optimism. Remarkable results The predecessor to the Global Goals \u2013 the so-called Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \u2013 were a set of time-bound targets agreed on by heads of state in 2000 \u2013 through 2015 they managed to unify, fuel, and expand efforts to meet some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges. Although some of the MDGs were not fully achieved, they produced remarkable results. The global child mortality rate has declined by more than half since 1990. The same almost goes for mater- nal mortality. In sub-Saharan Africa, pri- mary school enrolment went up to 80 per cent in 2015 from 60 per cent in 2000, and glob- ally the number of children out of school almost halved since 2000 \u2013 to mention just a WORLD\u2019S BEST NEWS Education will be a key to ending world poverty. few examples of the progress made. A joint effort Many might think of the MDGs as the UN\u2019s goals, but the real- ity is that no single individual or organisation was responsi- ble for achieving the MDGs. Instead, countless public, private, and nonprofit actors working together and indepen- dently, in developed and devel- oping countries all around the world, have furthered them. \u201cThe world is moving towards a wider and more concerted approach reflect- ing a will to cooperate, share responsibilities and look at the worlds problems \u2013 and their solutions \u2013 in a more com- prehensive manner, where all issues are linked and all of society must get engaged,\u201d says Erik Lundsgaarde, Senior Researcher at the Danish Insti- tute for International Studies. The new journey The MDGs heralded a compre- hensive approach to meeting global challenges by bringing together the development and environment agendas. They came a long way in moving the world ahead in the space of fifteen years \u2013 and brought the international community and societies closer together in the process. That should bode well for the new Global Goals and their journey towards 2030. The Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative is an African-led project with an epic ambition: to grow an 8,000 km line of plants and trees across the entire African continent. Its goal is to pro- vide food, jobs, and a future for the millions of people who live in a region on the front line of climate change. Desertification and land degradation threatens the food security and livelihoods of millions of people across Africa\u2019s drylands \u2013 in 2015, more than 20 million people in the Sahel were food insecure. Since 2000, the EU has de- ployed more than 120 election observation missions. Electoral assistance and elec- tion observation missions are key in strengthening democracy and helping to deter fraud, intimidation, and violence during elections. \u201cThey have become widely accepted as an instrument to build public confidence and increase the integrity of electoral processes,\u201d says Dr Annette Fath-Lihic, Senior Programme Manager at the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Most recently the EU has deployed election observation missions to Myanmar, Haiti, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Uganda, and Peru. / hz \u201cIn light of these urgent challenges, the Great Green Wall promises to be a compel- ling part of the solution by pro- viding people with improved economic prospects, a cushion against climate change, a reason to stay for unemployed youth set to migrate from the region, whilst helping to restore political stability,\u201d says Alexander Asen, Communica- tions Officer at the Global Mechanism of the UN Conven- tion to Combat Desertification \u2013 one of the main partners in the initiative, together with the EU and the African Union. The African Union estimates that the wall is 10\u201315 % com- plete already.

Where to start? According to professor Jeffrey D. Sachs, a renowned expert on sustainable development, there\u2019s one of the goals that could be the key to unlocking the rest: \u201cOf all of the investments needed to achieve sustainable development, none is more important than Goal 4: Quality Education,\u201d says Mr Sachs. \u201cIf we can guarantee that every child in the world will be able to start in kindergarten and then go at least all the way through a quality secondary education, that would mean a breakthrough for the world in well-being, and in the ability to meet all of the other 16 SDGs [Global Goals]. It would enable the end of poverty and em- power people to achieve good health and decent work, and to be good active participants in democracy\u201d. All in all, the world has made big progress towards educa- tion for everyone. Today, more than nine out of every 10 chil- dren are in school, and there are now just as many girls as boys in the classrooms. However, as many of the last children out of school live in conflict areas, more efforts to create peace and stability will also be needed to reach the goal of educating all children before 2030.
