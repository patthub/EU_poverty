        "New attitudes towards consumption: best practices in the domain of built-in obsolescence and collaborative consumption The study analyses the collaborative consumption and planned obsolescence in the context of circular economy, shared and the common good. The analysis is done from a holistic view of the interactions and interdependencies in the various economic, environmental and social spheres. From the values of responsibility, efficiency and sustainability, it is proposed a new model that considers the emergence of issues such as the economy of the functionality and the servicizing, the durability and the lifecycle extension of the products, the eco-design and the supra-recycling, the co- creation of value or disruptive technological innovation. The framework of the study is developed in connection with the European policies, and more specifically with the Europe 2020 Strategy, and its operational programs, as well as in relation to the opinions of the Economic and Social Committee: \"Collaborative or participatory consumption: a model of sustainability for the XXI century\u201d, and \"For a sustainable consumption: the life span of industrial products and consumer information to restore confidence\". _____________ Reference number: CES/DAG/Relations with Organised Civil Society and Forward Studies/2/2014 Catalogue number: QE-01-15-445-ES-N ISBN: 978-92-830-2795-9 Language: ES Pages: 145 Author: Alejandro Salcedo Aznal (Spain) Availability: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.publications.36482 Requesting service: Consultative Commission on Industrial Change (CCMI) Contact person : Adam.Plezer@eesc.europa.eu ",
        "Key factors affecting the future growth of Europe Achieving sustainable growth in a competitive world is challenging. The challenge is even greater for the European Union, as the Old Continent faces a severe competitiveness deficit. Without entering into a health review, that could be delivered at a further stage, of each of the 28 Member States, the ambition of this study is to draw-up a comprehensive picture of EU economic growth. This will lead to specific recommendations on the conditions to restore EU competitiveness and a scoreboard of the current state of reforms among Member States. The reader will have a clearer appreciation of the tools that could be usefully mobilised on both economic and political levels to tackle the growth issue and seize the most realistic opportunities to restore growth within the EU. We analyse step by step the main reasons for the EU\u2019s lack of competitiveness paving the way for a comprehensive analysis of the conditions necessary to stimulate EU competitiveness. There follows a review of the current state of reforms. The conclusions are summarized in a SWOT analysis chart for the EU. _____________ Reference number: CES/DAG/ Relations with Organised Civil Society and Forward Studies/04/2014 Catalogue number: QE-04-15-393-EN-N ISBN: 978-92-830-2781-2 Language: EN Pages: 52 Author: Lighthouse Europe (Belgium) Availability: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.publications.36598 Requesting service: Group I : \"Employers\" Contact person : marco.thyssen@eesc.europa.eu ",
        "From the Outer Banks to the Food Banks Feasibility study for the organisation of value chains for unsold seafood products intended for European food aid The study was conducted with the aim of analysing feasibility of a supply chain, to capitalise on unsold seafood products for distribution to deprived people. The study was based on the new regulation regarding landing obligations, and was carried out in three phases. The first part is dedicated to examining the conditions for access to seafood products within distribution networks. The second part of the study focuses on detailing the legal, technical and economic constraints involved in the recovery and exploitation of landed catches that are below the minimum conservation reference sizes, or which exceed individual quotas. The study highlights the obstacles at various levels, from on-board processing to existing processing units, that make it difficult to process raw materials at a cost that is acceptable to stakeholders; it draws attention to the experience of the non-market-oriented structures of the Social and Solidarity Economy in France. On the basis of a comparative analysis of the traceability guarantees and costs related to the various possible technical solutions for a collection and processing system that is appropriate to the volume of supply arising from the landing obligation and to the needs of distribution operators, the study presents a proposal for action, based on the mobilisation of fishery producer organisations and of public financial aid. _____________ Reference number: CES/DAG/CSS/06/2014 Catalogue number: QE-01-15-775-FR-N ISBN: 978-92-830-2848-2 Language: FR Pages: 80 Author: F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des Paniers de la Mer (France) Availability: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.publications-studies Requesting service: Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment Section Contact person : Arturo.Iniguez@eesc.europa.eu ",
        "The economic and social situation in Bulgaria The social dialogue and industrial relations in Bulgaria are developing in an unfavorable environment. A trend towards decentralisation of collective bargaining and abandoning the practice of extending the branch collective agreements is observed. All these developments are gradually diminishing the collective bargaining coverage. New income policy with catching effect can be achieved not just on the base of economic growth but also through increasing role of the state in the distribution and redistribution of the product created. The fight against poverty and social exclusion goes both through a higher quantity and quality employment and also through more equitable taxation and improved social and solidarity systems. Social effects of the new economic governance and the European semester are apparent. The restrictive policies adversely affect the ability to exit the economic crisis and employment recovery. Stimulating consumption and investment activity are the main prerequisites for ensuring a new type of growth. \"The economy of supply\" imposed in Bulgaria through historically low tax rates, a flat tax and consistent reduction of social security contributions, exhausted its possibilities without ensuring economic prosperity, adequate employment and better living standards. Instead, the processes of social stratification and income inequalities deepened. _____________ Reference number: CES/DAG/CSS/07/2014 Catalogue number: QE-01-15-436-EN-N ISBN: 978-92-830-2790-4 Language: BG, EN, FR Pages: 17 Author: Institute for Social and Trade Union Research (Bulgaria) Availability: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.publications.36497 Requesting service: Group II: \"Employees\" Contact person : Francisco.Soriano@eesc.europa.eu ",
        "The economic and social situation in Romania In 2009, Romania ignored the signs of the financial crisis which manifested visibly in EU and North America, and entered into this crisis unprepared and later than other countries. Therefore, the effects of the crisis were not mitigated by preventive measures, and nor after entering the crisis, were real corrective measures taken, except measures to reduce public spending. But these measures were not homogeneous in all public spending areas. A lack of balance and pro-cyclical fiscal and budgetary policies were aggravating factors, but the economic crisis in Romania started from the overconsumption behaviour of the private sector and the current account deficit. Romania's economy remains anchored in low and medium skilled labour, relatively low use of technologies and based on low value added industries. Productivity is affected and business models used allow productivity gains based only on wage cuts, which basically is a powerful additional stress factor. The structure of employment in Romania shows a serious lagging behind compared to the other European countries economies structures, being one of the causes of low productivity in general. Although there has been some recovery, Romania continues to be the EU country with the most inadequate distribution of employment in economic sectors. This structure affects the ability of real convergence in order to join the euro zone. _____________ Reference number: CES/DAG/CSS/08/2014 Catalogue number: QE-01-15-435-EN-N ISBN: 978-92-830-2787-4 Language: RO, EN, FR Pages: 27 Author: Steluta Enache (Romania) Availability: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.publications&itemCode=36489 Requesting service: Group II: \"Employees\" Contact person: Francisco.Soriano@eesc.europa.eu ",
        "Draft guidelines for citizens and civil society participation in EU transport policies and projects The study proposes draft guidelines to serve as a framework for participatory dialogues to facilitate planned Commission initiatives to implement the 2011 transport policy White Paper or infrastructure projects on the TEN-T Core Network Corridors. Participants will vary depending on the context. Dialogues should be early, transparent, open and managed in a neutral fashion. Interventions shall receive a rapid reaction and follow-up shall include information about the final outcome of the initiative. The limits of what a dialogue can achieve must be clear. Neutral management by the EESC is vital for inspiring confidence that will attract participants. Dialogues can take place through events, over the internet or a combination of both. For efficiency, flexibility and financial reasons the study prefers internet dialogues. Most costs should be borne by the party initiating the dialogue; the European Commission for policy and legislative proposals and Member States concerned or project promoters for TEN-T projects. The study also outlines a project for finalising the guidelines through a cooperative process, including one or more test dialogues. _____________ Reference number: CES/DAG/CSS/09/2014 Catalogue number: QE-01-15-437-EN-N ISBN: 978-92-830-2791-1 Language: EN Pages: 41 Author: Par Boqvist (Norway) Availability: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.publications&itemCode=36491 Requesting service: Transport, Energy, Infrastructure and Information Society Section Contact person : Andrei.Popescu@eesc.europa.eu ; Nuno.Quental@eesc.europa.eu ",
        "Civil dialogue and participatory democracy in the practice of the European Union institutions The European Union is at its core a model of transnational governance based, inter alia, on democracy and the rule of law. There are two key findings from our survey: On the one hand, that civil dialogue is based on the primary or constitutional law of this Union and addresses the specific challenges of transnational democracy. On the other, that implementation remains a challenge. Our survey and mapping of its results, legal basis and other relevant data clearly show that the status quo can still stand considerable improvement, as was stated repeatedly by the EESC. Nonetheless, in the area of \"vertical dialogue\" we were able to ascertain significant silver linings: most notably the openness of DG Agri (ahead of other DGs) and its approach of carefully setting legal rules for the dialogue's framework. Nonetheless, we find ourselves in agreement with the Ombudsman's call for a rigid conflict of interest policy, reviewing and monitoring scheme. Based on our findings, we present a roadmap towards a single open online tool in order to save money, gain broad compliance and ultimately address the ongoing challenge of implementing the requirements of Art 11 paragraph 1 and 2 TEU. _____________ Reference number: CES/DAG/CSS/10/2014 Catalogue number: QE-02-15-397-EN-N ISBN: 978-92-830-2767-6 Language: EN Pages: 108 Author: Professor Johannes W.
