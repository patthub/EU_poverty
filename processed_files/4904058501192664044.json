        "2 Sustainability Report 2014 W e are proud that in 2014 the EIB Group once again delivered on its commit- ments made to the EU Member States. We signed EUR 77bn of EIB loans and an addition- al EUR 3.3bn of investments by the EIF resulting in a total of EUR 80.3bn of Group financing. Beyond figures, by backing viable and sustainable projects, we are investing in the future for the benefit of to- day\u2019s citizens and the generations to come. Sus- tainability is a major pillar of our mission: our activ- ity is governed by the need to improve social and environmental impacts. 2014 provided a wealth of achievements which illustrate this ambition. We at the EU bank recognise that employment op- portunities are at the heart of economic revival and individual prosperity. The funding we provid- ed to 290 000 micro, small and medium-sized en- terprises will sustain some 3.9 million jobs world- wide. Our focus in the past years has been on maximising employment opportunities for Eu- rope\u2019s youth \u2013 the drivers of our sustainable future. Around 500 000 young people were employed or trained by the SMEs we supported between July 2013 and the end of 2014. As a Group we aim to ensure that we innovate con- stantly to renew our commitment to global sus- tainability. The EIF\u2019s Social Impact Accelerator itself gained speed in 2014. Launched in 2013, the first pan-European public-private partnership for social impact investing has been successfully addressing the growing need for equity finance to underpin social enterprises. The gauge of our projects is in the impact they have on lives. For us, infrastructure projects are not sim- ply bridges, wind farms or urban redevelopment schemes. In 2014 alone our support for transport infrastructure projects will result in 545 million ad- ditional passengers, enabling people to move more freely, and reaping time savings of over 100 mil- lion hours \u2013 that\u2019s more time to spend with friends and family. 80% of the energy capacity we funded was renewable, powering over one million homes. And the healthcare projects we funded will impact positively on 10 million citizens, bringing health and wealth to Europe. In emerging and developing economies, the projects we financed in 2014 will benefit some 4 million people, providing access to safe drinking water or improved water sanitation.

        "3 2014 Sustainability Report The EIB has been a pioneering force in the field of climate action for some time. Since 2009, we have invested over EUR 90bn in this area. In 2014, we once again met our target of dedicating 25% of our total lending activity to climate action. Overall, our projects resulted in annual emissions savings equivalent to taking 1.5 million cars off the roads. And our approach to climate is a holistic one. Take our borrowing activities: we roughly tripled our is- suance of Climate Awareness Bonds, compared to the previous year, to EUR 4.3bn, and confirmed our position as the largest issuer in this new and important market segment. We also established a new reporting system on our Climate Awareness Bonds which looks at the impact of those projects which receive financial allocations, providing data on important indicators such as Greenhouse Gas emission avoidance and absolute emission levels. At the EU bank, responsibility and sustainability also mean accountability, transparency and strong governance, for us and our counterparts. Last year we consulted stakeholders with the aim of improv- ing our Transparency Policy: we want to be as open as possible about our decision-making process and operational activities. We also launched a Pub- lic Register which contains environmental and so- cial data on relevant projects we finance. And, of course, we continued our community engagement through the actions of the EIB Institute. Finally, our commitment to sustainability in 2014 was set in stone with the creation of a new Cor- porate Responsibility Department to promote sustainability standards and best practices across all EIB activities. The team is growing and embed- ding sustainability at the heart of the work of the EU bank. Our approach to sustainability is shaped by our specific skills and expertise as a financial EU institution, and reviews of our performance by sus- tainability research and rating agencies help us to improve our strategy and policies. Looking forward, as a Group we are mobilising our efforts to implement the ambitious Investment Plan for Europe presented together with the Pres- ident of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, in November 2014. We will apply the same environmental and social standards as in our current projects, ensuring sustainability remains at the core of our activities. This sustainability report is witness to the efforts made in 2014 by the EIB Group to comply with the best corporate social responsibility standards. Our efforts will continue and develop: climate action, gender equality, conflict sensitivity, to name but a few topics, are high on our agenda in 2015. This re- port is also an invitation to stakeholders to deepen their dialogue with the EU bank. Werner Hoyer G4-1 G4-3 ",

        "6 Sustainability Report 2014 Sustainability at the EIB Group The EIB Group continues to be instrumental in helping Europe to recover from the worst global financial crisis in a generation. Our loans to over 500 projects in 2014 have helped to mobilise in- vestment in support of innovation, small business growth, infrastructure, climate action and the en- vironment. Through our diverse range of activities, we aim to make a long-term, fundamental differ- ence to Europe\u2019s economic, social and environmen- tal prospects. For us the concept of \u201csustainability\u201d centres on the opportunities and responsibilities we have to support a growing, inclusive and environmentally sound economy. Sustainable growth must deliver shared prosperity for today\u2019s citizens, without com- promising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The EIB Group has shown improvement in its sus- tainability reporting year on year, and since 2011 has reported at GRI 3.1 (Global Reporting Initiative) application level A+. To demonstrate our commit- ment to best practice and continual improvement in our reporting, in 2014 we applied the GRI G4 guidelines for the first time as early adopters. We support a range of sustainable investments Within Europe, the EIB Group works to foster sustain- able growth and employment. We represent the inter- ests of the European Union Member States, providing finance and expertise for a broad range of economi- cally, technically and environmentally sound projects. Our work also extends outside the EU where our financing complements the EU\u2019s development aid and cooperation policies, which aim to reduce poverty, ensure sustainable development and pro- mote democracy, peace and security. Sustainability is at the very heart of the EIB Group; it is embedded in our mission and guides our investment choices. As the EU bank, we pride ourselves on transparency and accountability and have been reporting on our corporate responsibility and sustainability annually since 2005. Introduction ",
        "7 2014 Sustainability Report Sustainability is embedded in the heart of what we do In accordance with our statutory framework (EIB/ EIF), our core purpose is designed to directly align with the principles of sustainability. Our strategic objectives, which are articulated in our Corporate Operational Plan (EIF Corporate Operational Plan), embed the principles of sustainability into our method of working. We provide a unique contribution to the EU As the world\u2019s largest multilateral borrower and lender, the EIB Group is in a unique position to support European and global sustainable develop- ment. With more than 50 years of experience, we ensure that all of the projects we finance are not only bankable but also comply with strict econom- ic, technical, environmental and social standards. This puts us in a privileged position to deliver real impact and remain accountable to all EU citizens. The EIB Group (EIB) The EIB Group is made up of two entities, each of which contributes to sustainability in the organisation: The European Investment Bank (EIB) The EIB is the long-term lending institution of the European Union owned by its Member States. The Bank makes long-term finance avail- able for sound investment in order to contribute towards EU policy goals. The EIB is the largest multilateral lender and borrower in the world. The EIB Institute was founded within the EIB in 2012 and is dedicated to promoting \u201cEuropean initiatives for the common good\u201d. This includes reducing inequalities, enhancing knowledge and innovation and ensuring cohesion across Europe. With the support of its network of partners, the In- stitute is a catalyst for social, cultural, educational and research activities directed towards econom- ic and social development in EU Member States, Candidate and Potential Candidate Countries, and countries of the European Economic Area. The European Investment Fund (EIF) The EIF is the arm of the EIB Group specialised in providing SME risk finance. The Fund supports Europe\u2019s micro, small and medium-sized busi- nesses (MSMEs) by improving access to finance through a wide range of selected financial inter- mediaries across Europe. To this end, the EIF pri- marily designs, promotes and implements equity and debt financial instruments which specifically target SMEs. In this role, it fosters EU objectives in support of entrepreneurship, growth, innovation, research and development, and employment. ",
        "8 Sustainability Report 2014 About this Report I n our continuous pursuit of excellence and to ensure that we remain at the forefront of sustainability reporting, we are a member of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Organisational Stakeholders programme, which connects more than 600 organisations from over 60 countries, com- mitted to advancing sustainability reporting. This year we have followed the GRI G4 pioneer programme to embrace the changes in the GRI reporting framework whilst maintain- ing the level of reporting from previous years. The content of this report is based on the results of a materiality analysis, which identified all of the EIB Group\u2019s material aspects, i.e. aspects of high priority to internal and external stakeholders. We report on the key aspects identified and the appropriate GRI G4 indicators in line with the GRI G4 'in accordance' com- prehensive option. This report provides insights into the material environmen- tal, social and governance aspects and performance of the EIB Group. It covers both the material direct and indirect impacts and data, unless otherwise mentioned, allowing a full picture of sustainability in the EIB Group. The full GRI content index can be found on our website and includes explanations of why we have not reported on indi- cators that were omitted. Where appropriate, the index re- fers to relevant sources of the required information, includ- ing our 2014 Financial, Activity and Sustainability Reports. Furthermore, GRI disclosure labels (e.g. G4-32) are included in the appropriate places throughout the report for ease of reference in respect of the GRI content index. In line with our ambition to continually improve our sustainability cre- dentials we actively review the GRI content index to identi- fy indicators that we could report upon in the future where appropriate. The EIB Group commissioned its external auditors, KPMG, to provide a limited assurance report on the statements and indicators in the Sustainability Report marked with \uf052 and in italic text prepared in accordance with the GRI G4 Guidelines 'in accordance' comprehensive option, support- ed by internally developed guidelines together referred to as the internal reporting criteria applicable at the EIB Group in 2014.

        "10 Sustainability Report 2014 Defining the Aspects that Matter T he EIB Group always seeks to understand and respond to our most material aspects \u2013 those aspects that are of greatest concern to our stakeholders and which have the most sig- nificant impact on the operational success of the institution. The materiality assessment identified ten material aspects, shown in the matrix. Of these, we further identified the top three most important material aspects (in dark blue) that were a high priority for both internal and external stakeholders, which are addressed in this report. Materiality assessment The EIB Group continues to display a commitment to inviting and listening to the views of its stake- holders. In addition to holding a number of stake- holder events, we undertook a materiality survey in 2013/14. In this assessment, we considered both internal and external perspectives through the en- gagement of: employees, civil society, project pro- moters/borrowers and dealers. This engagement process was undertaken specifi- cally as part of the report preparation process in To better define, understand and respond to the aspects that matter most to us and our key stakeholders, we conducted a materiality assessment in 2013/14. From this, we identified three key aspects that are a high priority for both internal and external stakeholders. These will be the aspects that we report on for 2014.

        "11 Activities in 2014 2014 Sustainability Report line with the requirements of the GRI G4 Reporting Guidelines. To determine if a Global Reporting Initi- ative aspect is material for the EIB Group, an assess- ment was carried out based on the importance of the impacts of EIB Group activities and the impor- tance to external stakeholders. Assessment process The purpose of the assessment was to ensure that the correct aspects are being given due promi- nence in the strategy as well as in our public re- porting. Materiality is a principle that has become essential to helping companies focus their sustain- ability strategy, define performance indicators and determine what they manage and report. A materiality assessment begins with the definition of a strong purpose which helps frame the internal and external perspectives within a structured pro- cess. We defined the purpose, perspective and pro- cess for our materiality assessment as follows: By \u201ccivil society\u201d, we mean representatives of non-gov- ernmental organisations, business associations and/or think-tanks. By \u201cproject promoters\u201d, we mean the bodies responsible for identifying and developing projects. Promoters may also be responsible for operating and/or implementing projects. By \u201cdealers\u201d, we mean investment banks underwriting secu- rities, i.e. purchasing securities from the EIB (bond issues) and distributing them to end investors. Reinforce our corporate responsibility and sustainability strategy and ensure that the correct aspects are being given due prominence in the strategy as well as in our public reporting. Purpose Conduct research to identify the aspects that are of high importance to our stakeholders and which have a high impact on the short and long term success of the Bank . Perspective The materiality assessment draws on existing resources and includes primary research to incorporate both internal and external views. Process Methodology \u2013 Desk research and aspect categorisation We reviewed internal and external documentation to identify 54 key aspects in five categories: \u2022 governance; \u2022 economic; \u2022 employment; \u2022 society; and \u2022 environment. These 54 aspects were then consolidated into a \u201cmaterial aspects table\u201d that included the above five key categories in five columns. Aspects were further categorised in terms of how much influence the EIB Group has over the man- agement of each of them. The three spheres of in- fluence were identified as: \u2022 aspects related to the EIB Group\u2019s direct or inter- nal environmental footprint through its build- ings and equipment as well as social impacts related to its staff and procurement on its own account; \u2022 aspects related to the EIB Group\u2019s lending priori- ties or mandate, borrowing activities and priori- ties supporting EU policies; \u2022 aspects related to the EIB Group\u2019s indirect im- pacts, which include the social, environmental, economic and governance impacts that arise from the projects that the EIB Group finances.

        "12 Sustainability Report 2014 Methodology \u2013 Internal stakeholder interviews The second stage of the process tested the aspects identified during the desk research with senior man- agers and subject matter experts within the EIB Group. We consulted employees from a selection of repre- sentatives from all relevant EIB Group operational en- tities, including the EIF and the EIB Institute, which interact with stakeholders directly or indirectly. The systematic selection aimed to achieve a balance of views by inviting EIB staff that represented a cross section of hierarchy, geography and operations with- in the EIB Group. Interviews were conducted to gain an understanding of the relative importance of aspects identified dur- ing the desk research. The interviews elicited both un- prompted and prompted views from EIB staff mem- bers on what they considered to be the most material and relevant environmental, social and governance aspects for the EIB Group. Subsequently these aspects were mapped on the \u201cx\u201d axis of the materiality matrix. Methodology \u2013 External stakeholder survey In addition to the desk research and the insights gained through the internal interviews, it was essen- tial to incorporate external perspectives to inform our materiality assessment process. For this reason an online survey was developed for civil society or- ganisations, project promoters/borrowers and deal- ers. Responses to the survey were received from 119 external stakeholders from a cross section of the 28 EU Member States. The purpose of the online survey was to determine the relative importance of specific environmental, social and governance aspects to external stake- holders. To ensure parity and comparability, the sur- vey questions were designed to mimic the questions asked during the internal materiality interviews. The surveys included four questions that covered as- pects related to the EIB Group: 1) Financing priorities; 2) Projects financed; 3) Internal, i.e. direct environmental and social, impacts; and 4) Governance and management processes. Stakeholders were invited to comment on whether they care a lot, a little or not at all about each indi- vidual aspect under the four headings above. We then analysed and consolidated these perspec- tives to create a materiality matrix. In the matrix, the \u201cx\u201d axis represents the relative importance of the aspects to the EIB Group. The \u201cy\u201d axis represents the relative importance of the aspects to external stakeholders. Outcome of materiality assessment The top three material aspects were deemed to be: \u2022 achieving our priority objectives; \u2022 managing the EIB Group\u2019s indirect impacts; \u2022 transparency and accountability of the EIB Group. Due to the breadth of aspects, some were grouped together in the matrix. The intention for these broad- er categories was to be holistic enough to capture most of the aspects that surfaced during the assess- ment and, at the same time, succinct enough to be meaningful for both internal and external audiences. Material aspects and boundaries Achieving our priority objectives Boundaries: the impacts of achieving our objec- tives occur primarily outside the EIB Group\u2019s own organisational boundaries. The EIB provides tech- nical assistance and advisory services to better pre- pare and implement projects, to enhance the ef- fective use and potential leverage of EU funds and to improve access to public and private finance.

        "13 2014 Sustainability Report Defining the Aspects that Matter institutions therefore fall within the boundaries of this material aspect. Alongside the EIB Group, other external stakeholders that may have a direct impact on achieving our core objectives are the fi- nancial intermediaries and those ultimately bene- fiting from our funding. This material aspect is explored further in the sec- tion \u201cSupporting Sustainable Growth\u201d Managing the EIB Group\u2019s indirect impacts Boundaries: the impacts of managing the EIB Group\u2019s indirect impacts occur both within the in- stitution, through the governance of our invest- ments, and externally through the financial inter- mediaries that distribute our loans and the public and private sector entities which benefit from our financing. Indirect impacts cover the entire project cycle of the EIB Group and so the boundaries in- clude all impacts from the social and environmen- tal due diligence process during the pre-appraisal or appraisal stages, monitoring during disburse- ment through to implementation of projects and ex post evaluation of results. Indirect impacts beyond those covered in our own appraisal systems are not within the scope of this report. This material aspect is explored further in the sec- tion \u201cOur Wider Impact.\u201d Transparency and accountability of the EIB Group Boundaries: the primary impacts of transparency and accountability occur within the EIB Group as we strive towards constant improvement of all aspects of our performance. Transparency and accountabil- ity is, of course, subject to external influence but it is down to the EIB Group to report on, suitably govern and evaluate the projects we support. This material aspect is explored further in the sec- tion \u201cOpen and Accountable.\u201d Mapping our GRI aspects and indicators For the specific standard disclosures, we chose to construct our index starting with our three most important material aspects identified during the materiality exercise. We then mapped the relevant GRI G4 aspects as closely as possible to these ma- terial aspects, and for each GRI G4 aspect we report on all relevant indicators in line with the require- ments of the GRI G4 'in accordance' comprehensive option.

        "14 Sustainability Report 2014 Supporting Sustainable Growth In 2014, the European Investment Bank lent EUR 77bn in support of the objectives of the European Union: EUR 69bn in the Member States of the Union and EUR 8bn in the partner countries. The EIB Group acts as the backbone of investment in sustainable growth and development in the EU. We rec- ognise the importance of our position as the bank of the European Union and continue to step up our response to the changing economic conditions that are occurring as a result of the global financial crisis through the pro- vision of targeted and appropriate funding. In 2014, the EIB Group helped make a real difference to people\u2019s lives in Europe and beyond by supporting over 500 projects, including many that may have been delayed or never got off the ground without our intervention. Our investment is directly in line with EU policy objectives and supports projects with a focus on innovation and skills, access to finance for smaller businesses, climate action, the environment and strategic infrastructure.

Additional targeted support for projects, with a particularly strong impact on growth and employ- ment, is pursued through a number of special ini- tiatives, including \u201cJobs and Skills \u2013 Investing for Youth\u201d, and the roll-out of trade finance facilities and programmes for midcaps (companies with up to 3 000 employees). The European Commission- EIB SME Initiative is yet another important new instrument which aims to overcome persistent fi- nancing bottlenecks for SMEs. On 26 November, the EIB Group and European Commission announced the Investment Plan for Europe to boost jobs and growth in the face of an investment crisis. The financing arm of the plan in- volves the creation of a new European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) , managed by the EIB Group. EFSI will mobilise at least EUR 315bn of ad- ditional investment in strategic projects for Europe over the next three years. In April 2015, the EIB an- nounced the first projects earmarked for support under the EFSI guarantee. For the latest developments on the EIB Group\u2019s involvement in the Investment Plan for Europe, please visit our website. As such, 2015 will be a year of transition for the EIB Group. While continuing to deliver on our core business, we will focus on financing new pro- jects under the new Investment Plan. Investing in Europe means so much more than just figures and projects. The new initiative is about mobilising in- vestment, to ensure that projects which are stra- tegic for the prosperous future of Europe have the much needed support to become a reality. Technical assistance and advisory services The EIB Group makes available its financial and technical expertise to project promoters and local authorities to enhance their institutional capacity, strengthen project preparation and implementa- tion and improve the efficient use of EU and other funds. Technical assistance and advisory services often have a positive bearing on the aspects iden- tified through the materiality assessment such as the achievement of EIB Group objectives, manag- ing the indirect and direct impacts, lending priori- ties outside the EU and stakeholder engagement. The Bank\u2019s portfolio of advisory programmes is aligned with EU and Corporate Operational Plan (COP) objectives. In 2014, the EIB Group incurred around EUR 120m for technical assistance and advi- sory services, with approximately 630 ongoing advi- sory operations/assignments under more than 40 ad- visory programmes/facilities. 2014\u2019s advisory activity remained for the most part project-focused and con- cerned to a lesser extent institutional support/capac- ity-building and upstream support/market studies. Support for strategic infrastructure represented the biggest share of advisory activity, but the EIB\u2019s ob- jective is to progressively increase its support for in- novation, access to finance and resource efficiency activities. \uf052 EIB advisory services are at the heart of another el- ement of the Investment Plan. The European Com- mission and the Bank have agreed to provide an integrated advisory offer to the public and private sectors via a European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH) with the objective of strengthening and ac- celerating investment. EIAH will aim at (i) provid- ing a single point of entry for project preparation and implementation, use of financial instruments as well as capacity-building, (ii) bringing together existing advisory programmes and activities and developing new or extended services to cover un- addressed or increased needs; (iii) establishing a unique cooperation platform to make available and share the existing expertise within the EC, the EIB, National Promotional Institutions (NPIs) and Managing Authorities. The Advisory Hub will be set up in the second half of 2015. Innovation and skills The EIB Group is a major partner in supporting pro- jects to develop innovation and skills for a growing economy in Europe. Our projects include every- thing from financing ambitious large-scale research ",
        "16 Sustainability Report 2014 to backing small, specialised spin-outs or fund- ing digital networks. In 2014, the EIB Group provid- ed EUR 14.7bn in finance for this area in the form of loans, equity and guarantees. \uf052 Projects that support our drive to develop innova- tion and skills in the EU focus on promoting edu- cation and skills, accelerating innovation and sup- porting the digital economy. Examples include: \u2022 backing vocational and other training schemes; \u2022 financing investments in research, technology development and innovation across the board; \u2022 investing in telecoms infrastructure throughout Europe. Our financing products in this area include tradi- tional medium and long-term loans as well as indi- rect support through credit lines to local banks or other intermediaries.

The loans allow already estab- lished firms to break through to the next stages of progression and growth and enable increased private investment. Between 2014 and 2020, it is expected that the InnovFin products will make available more than EUR 24bn of financing for re- search and innovation by small, medium-sized and large companies and the promoters of research infrastructure. As innovation is a key ingredient for driving sus- tainable growth, the EU and EIB Group have made it a top priority to provide access to finance for in- novation and R&D projects. InnovFin financing so- lutions and advisory services provide a foundation from which to mobilise investment from other par- ties \u2013 in keeping with the EIB\u2019s core mission of us- ing public money to leverage private investment. From June to the end of December 2014 the EIB Group: \u2022 signed 28 individual operations with companies and other innovative entities; \u2022 partnered with five banks and financial intermedi- aries; and \u2022 provided EUR 2.7bn in loans and guarantees. \uf052 Supporting innovation through teamwork The InnovFin SME Guarantee, managed by the EIF, aims to address identified market gaps in invest- ment and builds on the success of its predecessor, the Risk-Sharing Instrument.

Acting for both the EIF and the EU as the implementing body, it covers a portion of the losses incurred by the finan- cial intermediaries on loans, leases and guarantees of between EUR 25 000 and EUR 7.5m, which they provide under the InnovFin SME Guarantee Facility. In this way, the EU and the EIF allow the provision of more debt financing to innovative SMEs and small midcaps (up to 499 employees). A sister product managed by the EIB, the InnovFin Midcap Guarantee, provides guarantees and coun- ter-guarantees on debt financing of up to EUR 50m to innovative midcaps (up to 3 000 employees). Like the SME Guarantee, financial intermediaries are guaranteed against a portion of their potential losses. Commerzbank in Germany as well as KBC Belgium signed up to the pilot scheme. Direct financial support The EIB Group also offers loans to innovative mid- sized and large companies as well as promoters of research infrastructure. One of the first loans to be signed under InnovFin Large Projects was with UCB, in what was also a first-of-its-kind transaction with its innovative \u201cat risk co-development funding\u201d approach to sup- porting the company\u2019s biopharmaceutical R&D. The Bank is providing up to EUR 75m in a programme designed to share risks and returns, with payments being contingent on milestones being reached. This will see the Bank investing directly in certain selected R&D programmes in UCB\u2019s significant port- folio of potential breakthrough medicines. These are at various stages of development but could help millions of patients. Innovative projects supported in 2014 also include large-scale research infrastructure, such as the ELI Network, an open-access, laser-based research fa- cility located in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania. The InnovFin financing is helping to bring forward new laser-based research opportu- nities and make them available to an international scientific user community. A dedicated EIB team is also working to improve access to growth finance for mid-sized companies via the InnovFin Midcap Growth Finance product and has so far signed transactions with 12 compa- nies such as Novabase in Portugal, Pharmathen in Greece and Finnish Rovio, creator of the popular Angry Birds game. A combination of financial and advisory support Further to the financing that is on offer, InnovFin products include advisory support. InnovFin Advi- sory takes two forms: \u2022 guiding clients on how to structure their re- search and innovation projects in order to im- prove their access to finance. We advise clients on how to capitalise on their strong points and adjust elements such as their business model, governance and funding sources; Development of new financing mechanisms - A blueprint for an Infectious Diseases Finance Facility Following discussions with the European Com- mission, pharmaceutical companies and in- dustry players, InnovFin Advisory prepared a concept paper covering the latest trends in in- novative financing instruments for infectious diseases R&D. The paper outlines the need for a new, higher risk-taking Infectious Diseases Finance Facility (IDFF). This is expected to be funded by EU budgetary resources and, poten- tially, to be a catalyst for attracting additional resources from other funders. InnovFin Adviso- ry has met with various pharmaceutical compa- nies and stakeholders to check the IDFF concept and to contribute to the development of a po- tential investment pipeline. Going forward, In- novFin Advisory will work to attract additional resources from other entities/donors to invest in IDFF to enhance the impact of the facility. ",

        "24 Sustainability Report 2014 Infrastructure Under the EIB priority goal of infrastructure, we support transport, energy and urban projects which assist growth and development. Cities are the drivers of the modern economy and are national hubs for growth and employment op- portunities, so fostering good quality urban devel- opments to renew our cities is vital for sustainable growth. In addition, linking Europe\u2019s urban centres with an efficient and effective network of transport and energy connections, together with smart grids and smart cities, enables the creation of coherent European systems that are ready for the future. Support for these projects is born from the need to secure freedom of movement for people, energy and goods, all of which underpin the fundamental devel- opmental and integration aims of the European Union. Our lending in this area generally amounts to less than our upper limit of 50% of the project cost; however this can rise to 75% in exceptional circumstances. The EIB\u2019s Trans-European Network (TEN) contribution adds real value by mobilising the large amounts necessary with maturities tailored to the long construction and operating periods of the schemes.

        "25 2014 Sustainability Report Warmer homes, lower costs The inhabitants of Bucharest suffer from an ageing and inefficient housing stock. Emissions are high and energy bills are costly for the city\u2019s two million inhabitants, with residential buildings accounting for more than one third of total energy consump- tion. The EIB loans were put to work financing a comprehensive energy efficiency programme for the city\u2019s residential buildings. The programme has the added advantage of job creation through the implementation of these measures. The project will provide the co-benefits of a reduced subsidies bill for the authorities and a reduced heating bill for residents. Giving inefficient housing the cold shoulder Over 80% of Bucharest\u2019s dwellings are situated in blocks of flats within estates which were built as early as the 1960s. The first phase started in 2010-2011 when the Bank worked with various Districts of Bucharest (1, 2, 4 and 6) and provided loans amounting to EUR 282m out of a total project cost of EUR 423m. In 2014, the EIB developed the second phase of the energy efficiency refurbishment of multi- apartment buildings and provided financing to Districts 1 and 4. Supporting the retrofit of an existing inefficient housing stock in Romania\u2019s urban hub Co-benefits and continuous investment programme As an energy efficiency project, this represents an example of a dedicated climate change mitiga- tion and adaptation initiative. The investment pro- gramme will provide the co-benefits of a reduced subsidies bill for the authorities and a reduced heating bill for residents, with positive implications for living standards in Bucharest. At present, apart- ment residents are eligible for heavily subsidised heating tariffs. However, the authorities are plan- ning to phase out these subsidies over the next couple of years, when heating costs in refurbished buildings are expected to fall by up to 50%. The first tranche of investment began in 2014 and has since been followed by a series of loans, the lat- est signed in the first half of 2015. The EIB\u2019s close follow-up of implementation and investments has resulted in the continual expansion of the pro- gramme, increasing its coverage across neighbour- hoods in Bucharest. The estimated project cost for the second phase is EUR 238m (District 1 and 4).

The municipality\u2019s own resources are expected to cover the remain- ing 25% of the cost. Demonstrable efficiency gains Before works started, most buildings in the neigh- bourhoods of Bucharest were classified with a D energy performance rating within the city. Today, their performance has significantly improved as most have passed from D to B and are below the energy consumption threshold of 100 kWh/m 2 per year, set by the programme requirements. This rep- resents energy savings of up to 50%. The EIB has identified energy efficiency as the most cost-effective way of reducing emissions and ener- gy demand and has made this investment in Bucha- rest\u2019s existing housing stock in accordance with the EIB Energy Lending Criteria adopted in July 2013. Climate action and the environment Sustainable growth and caring for the climate and our environment go hand in hand. It is of ma- jor importance to the EIB Group to both main- tain our environmental, social and climate stand- ards and also to support environmental projects that include sustainability aspects, such as those targeting air quality improvements, depollution, safety or ecosystem restoration. The natural envi- ronment is a major source of employment around the world, so supporting its wellbeing bears fruit for economic growth. Key areas for environmental lending include the upgrading of Europe\u2019s industrial sites. Projects such as Poland\u2019s KGHM copper smelter rehabilitation protect and create jobs, whilst significantly improv- ing air quality. Another key area of environmental lending is provision of water services: in such pro- jects, which often involve the depollution of a ma- jor water resource, biodiversity is also a priority. The importance we place on the natural environ- ment is underscored by the launch of the new Nat- ural Capital Financing Facility (NCFF), in conjunc- tion with the European Commission in 2014. Many environmental impacts will be exacerbated in the future by climate change, which is one of the most urgent challenges of this century. Worsening droughts, flooding and extreme weather events are already affecting us, threatening growth and devel- opment. In Europe and in developing economies, there are many opportunities to promote energy ef- ficiency, more climate-friendly transport modes, re- newable energy generation and forestry, land use and natural capital investments which will support climate mitigation by avoiding or reducing GHG emissions. As our world becomes more heavily af- fected by climate change impacts, support for ad- aptation processes and investment are also vital. All these areas of mitigation and adaptation are includ- ed in the EIB\u2019s wide-ranging climate action finance. Climate action at the EIB takes a dual approach: as well as prioritising climate action lending, as high- lighted above, the EIB integrates climate action con- cerns into the methods and processes used to assess and monitor all of its investment projects. These in- clude using an economic price of carbon in the eco- nomic analysis of projects, providing technical as- sistance to promote energy efficiency in projects, assessing climate impacts on projects, and estimat- ing and reporting the greenhouse gas (GHG) emis- sions from all sectors of investment projects that it finances. The carbon footprint methodologies (Meth- odologies for the Assessment of Project GHG Emis- sions and Emission Variations) that the EIB has de- veloped to assess and report the GHG emissions generated and saved/avoided by EIB projects are publicly available on the Bank\u2019s website, and more information on the carbon footprint data for 2014 projects in the EU is given below.

        "27 2014 Sustainability Report Climate finance The EIB commitment to support a shift to a more re- source efficient, climate resilient and low-carbon economy is shown through the EUR 19.1bn invest- ment in climate action projects in 2014. \uf052 To fully support not only European climate policy goals but also international goals, the EIB has committed to in- vesting at least 25% of its lending signed each year in climate action, and this target was achieved again in 2014. \uf052 We finance whole projects and smaller component investments dedicated to climate change mitiga- tion and adaptation across a variety of sectors. All these parts contribute to our overall climate action figures, and this granular approach is harmonised with other Multilateral Development Banks, with which we have been working for five years on a co- herent and rigorous approach to climate finance tracking. A shift to a more resource efficient, climate resilient and low-carbon economy is needed globally, and the Bank has adopted climate standards and pro- vides innovative climate financing, as well as tech- nical assistance for its projects and promoters, to deal with climate risks and support climate action opportunities. There are many synergies between our support for climate action and other areas \u2013 we also seek benefits beyond CO 2 emissions reduction and adaptation to climate change such as resource efficiency, sustainable transport and access to wa- ter and clean air.

        "28 Sustainability Report 2014 Greater energy independence, lower emissions In direct support for the renewable energy directive the EIB provided financing of EUR 587m for one of the world\u2019s largest wind farms, to be constructed 85 km north of the Netherlands. Once operational the Gemini offshore wind farm will supply renewa- ble electricity for more than 1.5 million people and mitigate 1.25 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions per year. The project is a significant feat of engineer- ing as, from tip to toe, the turbines stand more than two-thirds of the height of the Eiffel Tower. The EU Renewable Energy Directive has set the goal of sourcing 20% of all energy from renewables by 2020. In order to meet this target, the EU requires significant investment in renewables infrastructure. The EIB has a primordial role to play in the financ- ing of positive climate action, encouraging low- carbon and climate resilient growth by supporting projects such as Gemini. Dutch renewable energy boosted by EUR 587m of EIB backing for one of the world\u2019s largest wind farms EIB at the forefront of renewable investment From 2017, the Gemini offshore wind farm will make a significant contribution to the national en- ergy independence of the Netherlands as well as to the sustainability goals of Europe. The EIB is confident with lending at scale The 150 turbines in the Gemini wind farm will pro- duce the largest amount of renewable energy from any offshore wind farm due to the constant high wind speeds, averaging wind force 5, in the 68 square kilometre construction area. The project\u2019s innovative turbines with rotors that reach 150 m above sea level can operate up to gale force 11. The wind farm\u2019s distance from the shore has been overcome with the longest power export cables ever to be employed for an offshore wind farm \u2013 two cables of 100 km each. ",

The largest renewable project to be developed using project finance The new Dutch project is also the largest renew able energy project in the world to be developed using project finance. The only security provided to the banks and organisations providing loans consists of the project itself and its expected revenues. 85% of the electricity generated by the Gemini wind farm will be marketed by the Dutch energy company Delta. The overall building costs of the Gemini wind farm are expected to be EUR 2.8bn. The EIB is financing the project together with Northland Power, the Danish pension fund PKA and a consortium of in- ternational commercial banks. The Bank is one of the world\u2019s largest lenders to re- newable energy projects. Recent support has in- cluded backing for the Noordoostpolder onshore wind farm and investment by TenneT to improve high-voltage connections between wind farms and consumers in the Netherlands and Germany. Climate mainstreaming: the carbon footprint of EIB projects Project carbon footprinting at the appraisal stage was started at the EIB in 2009 and is now mainstreamed into the Bank\u2019s operations. We apply our carbon foot- printing methodology to all sectors, not only climate mitigation projects. While an external review of our methodologies in 2013 confirmed our Carbon Foot- print Exercise (CFE) approach, we continue to up- date our methodologies and to improve the clarity and transparency of our reporting. We aim to contin- ually improve our carbon footprinting work, learning from our peers and partners, and take an active role in the IFI working group on greenhouse gas (GHG) assessments. Our approach to footprinting For our CFE, we estimate and report the GHG emis- sions from projects where emissions are expected to be significant, i.e. emissions above one or both of the following two thresholds: \u2022 absolute emissions (actual emissions from the project) > 100 000 t CO 2 eq/year for a standard year of the project\u2019s operation \u2022 relative emissions (estimated emissions increas- es or reductions compared to the expected al- ternative) > 20 000 t CO 2 eq/year Analysis of our CFE suggests that these two thresh- olds capture approximately 95% of emissions from the EIB\u2019s investment projects. We strictly apply the Bank\u2019s thresholds for inclusion in the CFE to avoid possible distortion of results, despite acknowledg- ing that other EIB projects which fall below the thresholds also target emissions savings. At the heart of our footprinting approach are the absolute emissions from each project. Whilst as- sessing and reporting emissions reductions and in- creases, which give an important indication of the emissions in comparison with other technologies or projects, we consider a project\u2019s absolute emis- sions to be a fundamental element, as these are what will ultimately affect our climate. When estimating savings or increases in emissions, we consider it is important to compare emissions from projects as equally as possible \u2013 particularly in the power generation sector. Thus, to estimate savings or increases in emissions, the Bank uses the same approach for the baselines of all new power generation projects, whether renewable or not. To review the total impact of our lending, we be- lieve it is important to assess significant emissions from all sectors we fund, not only from green sec- tors. We include projects in our annual CFE from the areas of conventional and renewable energy generation and networks, energy efficiency, trans- port, industry, water and solid waste and, this year for the first time, forestry. This allows us to assess the contribution from each type of lending. Supporting Sustainable Growth ",
        "30 Sustainability Report 2014 2014 project footprinting In 2014, 70 of the projects in the EIB portfolio 2 had es- timated emissions above the absolute or relative emis- sions thresholds and were included in the 2014 CFE. They represent total EIB signatures or allocation ap- provals of EUR 15.1bn. The related total absolute GHG emissions are estimated at 4.7 Mt CO 2 eq/year, with overall reduced or avoided emissions from the same fi- nancing estimated at 3.0 Mt CO 2 eq/year in accordance with the CFE methodology. \uf052 Project level data for projects included in the CFE are reported at appraisal stage in our Environmen- tal and Social Data Sheets (ESDSs) and published in our public register of environmental informa- tion. For the annual figures, these are aggregated over all the included projects, with emissions first prorated to EIB financing in the corresponding year. If total project emissions were aggregated the figures would be significantly larger, but there would be a risk of double-counting these emis- sions and the savings claimed with other finan- ciers who are also reporting. For this reason, the Bank believes that, for the annual aggregated data shown here, it is important to report only the emis- sions linked to its own lending. The table below shows the results of these aggregate figures for the last three years of EIB project CFE. These totals vary significantly from year to year, and are closely linked to the numbers of large power or indus- trial projects for which financing is signed in the year. Despite our conservative CFE approach, every year the Our carbon footprint exercise: 70 projects 15 .1 bn E U R signed or allocated GHG emissions 4 .7 Mt CO 2 eq/year 3 .0 Mt CO 2 eq/year Relating to projects included in the CFE 2012 2013 2014 Number of projects 61 67 70 Total EIB amount signed 3 - EUR bn 11.2 13.8 15.1 Total project cost - EUR bn 45.7 79.6 63.0 Average % EIB financed 25% 17% 24% Absolute emissions - Mt CO 2 eq/year 4 5.7 3.2 4.7 Relative emissions - Mt CO 2 eq/year 5 -3.0 -2.4 -3.0 overall emissions figures show a large saving \u2013 the ag- gregate savings have been estimated at 2 to 3 Mt CO 2 eq for the last two years, \uf052 confirming that, overall, the EIB\u2019s investment projects are supporting a path of re- duced emissions. 2 Projects with finance contract signed or large allocations approved in the year. Large allocations under already signed framework loans are those where the individual investment projects have undergone a full individual project appraisal. 3 Individual project GHG data is assessed at appraisal, but for the purposes of annual reporting, the project figures are aggregated on the basis of prorated figures in proportion to the volume of EIB funding of each project. Thus if the EIB funds 50% of a project in a particular year, 50% of the project emissions will be reported in that year. 4, 5 Emissions are prorated to the EIB lending volume prior to aggregating.

At the same time, we have responded to demand for Green Bonds in other currencies: CHF, JPY, SEK and ZAR. The Bank has also played an active role in the de- velopment of the Green Bond Principles, voluntary process guidelines that recommend transparency and disclosure and promote integrity in the devel- opment of the Green Bond market. The new, second edition of the Green Bond Principles, reflects a broad consensus reached among Green Bond market par- ticipants \u2013 investors, issuers and intermediaries. The alignment of EIB practices with the recommenda- tions of the Green Bond Principles has been outlined in our latest CAB Newsletter, published concurrently with the announcement of the second edition of the Green Bond Principles in March 2015. Ahead of the UN Climate Summit in September 2014, in a Joint Statement by Multilateral Develop- ment Banks (MDBs) on climate finance, the EIB un- dertook to \u201cmaintain its developmental role, in order to spur further sustainable growth of the green bond market 7 \u201d. Issuers such as the EIB are also collectively working towards a common framework for reporting on the impact of projects associated with Green Bonds. In early 2015, the EIB launched its new impact report- ing framework, putting the Bank in the vanguard of accountability on environmental impact, and re- sponding to the investor demand for the inclusion of quantitative metrics. This reporting conformed to an approach agreed among several MDBs and pub- lished in a joint paper. Both the EIB\u2019s impact report- ing and the joint approach were given a high profile at the Annual General Meeting of the Green Bond Principles in March 2015. EIB commitment leads to clear outcomes In 2014, based on a documented internal tracking and allocation method, EUR 3.3bn of proceeds from CAB is- suance were allocated to 56 projects, within and outside the EU. The unallocated proceeds at the end of 2014 stood at EUR 1.1bn. \uf052 To increase transparency and accountability, rather than report by aggregated sectors, the EIB reports the complete list of projects to which CAB proceeds have been allocated, as well as publishing the EUR amounts allocated in this report and a dedicated CAB Newsletter. The 2014 CAB Newsletter is the first Green Bond report to encompass such detailed information on climate impacts, including absolute and relative GHG emissions estimates, at the aggregate and indi- vidual project levels. 7 http://www.eib.org/infocentre/press/releases/all/2014/2014- 189-multilateral-development-banks-agree-to-reinforce-cli- mate-financing-in-advance-of-un-summit.htm 3 . 3 bn E U R of proceeds from CAB issuance 56 projects G4-DMA (audit) ",

        "34 Sustainability Report 2014 Our Wider Impact The sustainability outcomes of the EIB Group extend beyond the direct impacts of the projects we support with our finance or advisory services. That is because we promote high standards on aspects such as pollu- tion prevention, labour and human rights, and health and safety. Our everyday impact evaluation systems include the social and environmental due diligence process during the pre-appraisal or appraisal stages as well as the ex post evaluation of results. Combating fraud and corruption and fostering re- sponsible procurement are all fundamental to the promotion of sustainable development. We have stringent policies in place to ensure commitment to both of these principles. The EIB aligns its social standards and corresponding due diligence with the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2012), the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), the EU Strategy 2011-2014 for Cor- porate Social Responsibility (under review \u2013 EU CSR strategy 2015-2020 to be launched in 2015) and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (2011). How does the EIB Group\u2019s influence extend beyond its direct investments? To ensure that the sustainability outcomes of our projects are carefully controlled we promote high standards across the project lifecycle. This includes stringent due diligence processes and the evaluation of performance against a number of standards.

        "35 Activities in 2014 2014 Sustainability Report Social and environmental due diligence The preservation of environmental and social capital underpins the EIB Group\u2019s lending strate- gy and objectives; however, to achieve these, the Group relies to a large extent on activities under- taken by our clients, the borrowers and project promoters. We set high expectations for social and environ- mental due diligence, covering aspects such as pollution prevention, climate impacts, rights of vul- nerable people and labour rights, which have been embodied in a set of ten standards. The ten envi- ronmental and social standards outline the pro- moters\u2019 responsibilities regarding EIB-supported projects. The EIB\u2019s approach to integrating sustain- able development into our operations is fully de- scribed in the Environmental and Social Handbook. Since the creation of the EIB\u2019s Public Register in Janu- ary 2014, the Bank has made publically available the Environmental and Social Data Sheets (ESDSs) for those projects approved since 2013, for which a due diligence was required and carried out by the Projects Directorate. These data sheets are publically available and outline any significant environmental and social aspects, from the list above, which the promoter fac- es, how they will manage the impacts, including the policies, frameworks and legislation they will follow, and the requirements of the EIB before financing the project. \uf052 10 EIB financing environmental and social standards S1 Assessment and management of E&S impacts and risks S2 Pollution prevention and abatement S5 Cultural heritage S3 Biodiversity and ecosystems S6 Involuntary resettlement S4 Climate-related standards S7 Rights and interests of vulnerable population groups S8 Labour standards S9 Occupational and public health, safety and security S10 Stakeholders engagement G4-EC7 ",
        "36 Sustainability Report 2014 Building the first eco-city in Morocco The EIB has provided a EUR 150m loan to help tack- le Morocco\u2019s urban development challenges face-on. This project hopes to relieve pressure on existing ur- ban areas through the establishment of a new con- urbation \u2013 the Zenata eco-city. The aim is to house 300 000 residents and create 100 000 jobs by 2030. The project\u2019s scale and ambition means there are im- portant environmental and social impacts that need to be considered. Consequently, the EIB has ensured that an extensive environmental and social impact assessment has been carried out by the promoter in accordance with EIB requirements in preparation for the development of Morocco\u2019s first eco-city. Building a map of impacts \u2013 the eco-city urban development project, Zenata Morocco, impact review Morocco faces evolving urban development chal- lenges as its economy continues to grow. The ob- jective of the Zenata eco-city project is to provide a Housing people and creating jobs, whilst carefully considering environmental and social aspects response to the urban population pressure in Mo- rocco. The EIB\u2019s EUR 150m loan to the project con- tributes to EU priorities by supporting sustainable communities in one of the key Mediterranean part- ner countries. Zenata has been presented as the first eco-city in Africa and employs the core principles of sustain- able development: public modes of transport, op- timisation of water management, green corridors, high density, and social and functional diversity. Due consideration of project impacts The project aims to reconcile urban develop- ment with sustainable goals, but a number of environmental and social impacts have to be considered first. The EIB\u2019s rigorous due diligence process was employed to ensure these impacts are minimised. G4-EC7 ",
        "37 2014 Sustainability Report Our Wider Impact Ambitious in its scale, the Zenata city project has been designed to house 300 000 residents and cre- ate 100 000 jobs in many high value added activi- ties (in the commercial centre, exhibition centre, education and health centres, logistics centre, tour- ism, light industry, municipal services, etc.) by 2030. Zenata will also have an impact on the construction industry, which accounts for almost a million direct and indirect jobs in Morocco. Beyond these economic achievements, the Zena- ta project also seeks to reach new realms in urban planning in terms of its environmental impacts. It will do this through the incorporation of positive environmental features such as extensive green zones, water retention basins for water manage- ment, dedicated rights of way for public transport, cycle lanes, energy-efficient lighting and planning- led mixed-use development. Within the EU, projects such as this typically re- quire a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). There are no such requirements in Morocco, so an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been carried out incorporating elements required by the EIB and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) to align it with the typical requirements of an SEA. The EIA indicates that negative environmental im- pacts on air quality, soils, groundwater, etc. will be modest or negligible, and primarily concentrated during the construction phase. Environmental im- pacts will be mitigated through measures incor- porated into an Environmental and Social Man- agement Plan (ESMP). The project is expected to generate significant positive environmental bene- fits, for example through the provision of sewerage infrastructure and the elimination of wastewater discharges from informal settlements. Social impact challenges of the project In the short and long terms, the project will gen- erate vast benefits for the local area, but it also has the potential to create adverse social impacts, which need to be carefully monitored. Due to its scale and complexity, the resettlement component carries the most significant social risk: as a result of the acquisition of 1 600 ha of land, the project will require the resettlement of over 10 000 house- holds, 238 registered businesses, other informal economic activities, livelihood strategies (includ- ing subsistence) and community infrastructure. Over 8 000 of the affected households are locat- ed in 17 informal settlements and are low-income slum-dweller households lacking land titles. In ad- dition, some of the affected households (i.e. own- ers of sheds along the coastline) have launched le- gal proceedings against the expropriation process delaying the completion of the land acquisition process. Concrete solutions and successful outcomes In line with EIB environmental and social standards, the project owner will seek to mitigate the risk as- sociated with involuntary resettlement by draw- ing up a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). At the same time, meaningful consultations will be held with the people affected by the project. These measures are expected to result in improved living conditions, particularly for slum dwellers, who constitute the vast majority of the individuals affected. This group will also benefit as a result of gaining more secure land tenure rights, whilst remaining in the vicinity of their current homes and communities. Based on the findings of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, in May 2014 the EIB re- quested that an open doors event be held to firm up elements of the resettlement option, with both the Governor of Mohammadia Province and the project promoter in attendance. The above-men- tioned land tenure rights were confirmed as a re- settlement option during the event. This was the first affirmative step by the promoter in building ownership of the mitigation measures and facilitat- ing the resettlement process through consultation. The Bank has also made requests to the promoter to enhance long-term in-house capacity related to social impacts. In addition, the EIB will contrib- ute to the creation of an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) to guide the imple- mentation of the project. We are committed to the close and sustained monitoring of these aspects to ensure that environmental and social risks and im- pacts are adequately mitigated. G4-EC7 ",
        "38 Sustainability Report 2014 Meeting the energy needs of over 150 000 Jordanians The EIB has invested in a 117 MW wind farm in Jordan. The project has the potential to meet the energy needs of over 150 000 people and to be a major contributor to employment and skills in the region. However, the site is located within the Rift Valley flyway and near an important bird area and as a result the EIB required that comprehensive and seasonal bird surveys be carried out including the development of a biodiversity management plan. This resulted in a change in the layout of the turbines and the establishment of a post-construc- tion monitoring programme in order to protect mi- gratory bird species. The EIB supporting first-time projects The EIB\u2019s environmental standards require that the mitigation hierarchy be applied, in particular avoidance and minimisation of negative impacts on the natural environment. Furthermore, the EIB actively invests in projects that contribute to re- ducing climate change impacts and protecting our environment. In 2013, the EIB signed a EUR 53m loan agreement for Jordan\u2019s first large-scale inde- pendent renewables project, Tafila wind farm. When fully operational in August 2015, the Ta- fila wind farm will produce 354 GWh/y of renew- able energy, meeting the energy needs of over 150 000 Jordanians. Construction began in April 2014, following four years of development by Jor- danian and international experts. The EIB financed around 25% of the project cost, with other lending partners, including the International Finance Co- operation, Europe Arab Bank and OPEC Fund for International Development and Netherlands De- velopment Finance Company, providing a further 52%. A milestone in Jordan\u2019s renewable energy strategy The project represents a significant milestone in Jordan\u2019s renewable energy strategy, delivering a reliable source of clean energy. In line with the Mediterranean Solar Plan\u2019s goals and the coun- try\u2019s objectives, Jordan aims to reduce its heavy dependency on fossil-fuel energy imports, while developing renewable capacity and increasing the participation of the private sector in energy generation. Reducing reliance on fossil-fuel imports whilst protecting local biodiversity G4-EC7 ",
        "39 2014 Sustainability Report For the EIB, as one of the global leaders in climate finance, the Tafila wind farm represents a signifi- cant investment in climate change mitigation. With the announcement of the loan, the EIB\u2019s then Vice- President Philippe de Fontaine Vive commented, \u201cThe EIB is proud to contribute both its financ- ing and its technical expertise acquired across the European Union for all sources of renewable ener- gy... [The project] provides a strong and green sig- nal for the future in terms of technology, economic and energy development, and job opportunities.\u201d Monitoring environmental and social impacts Environmental and social impacts were a key con- sideration throughout the development process. Prior to investment, the project underwent a com- prehensive Environmental and Social Impact As- sessment (ESIA), in accordance with applicable EIB Environmental and Social Standards and inter- national best practice. The assessment, mitigation and management framework developed for the project has now been adopted as a model for simi- lar projects in Jordan and elsewhere. The project will be a major contributor to employ- ment and skills in the region, creating around 150 jobs during its construction and around 30 jobs during operation. Further indirect impacts will be felt by local businesses who meet the needs of the workforce, while no resettlement of the local popu- lation is expected. The project site is located less than 5 km away from the Dana Biosphere Reserve\u2019s eastern border, an important bird area, and within the Rift Valley flyway. Detailed field monitoring and biodiversity surveys were undertaken by multiple internation- al experts between 2011 and 2014, with an em- phasis on migration periods. The surveys deter- mined a potential heightened risk of collision with the moving rotors for soaring migrating birds. A comprehensive post-construction monitoring programme will be developed and implemented, also allowing for adaptive management meas- ures which may include shut down on demand based on the monitoring results. The Tafila wind farm will have wide-ranging positive social im- pacts through the provision of electricity to over 150 000 people. Our Wider Impact G4-EC7 ",
        "40 Sustainability Report 2014 Ex post evaluations In our endeavour to see continuous improvement in the management of the EIB Group\u2019s indirect im- pacts, Operations Evaluation (EV) carries out inde- pendent ex post evaluations of EIB and EIF activi- ties with two aims: \u2022 accountability: to assess whether our activities have been in line with our policy mandates and the strategies derived from them, and if these activities have delivered as expected; \u2022 lessons learned: to identify possible areas for improvement that can be applied to Group ac- tivities to increase performance in the future. Whilst this evaluation goes beyond the indirect im- pacts, it provides us with a valuable review tool to understand the impacts of our projects, how those impacts have been controlled and what we can do to improve our performance going forward. Combating fraud and corruption The EIB Group has a zero-tolerance policy on fraud or corruption whether occurring in connection with projects, loans or equity financed by the EIB Group or perpetrated by its own staff. The EIB Group has an Anti-Fraud Policy that is regularly updated (last revision in 2013) and is supported by a number of other anti-fraud instruments such as the Whistle- blowing Policy, the EIB's Guide to Procurement, pro- active integrity reviews and exclusion procedures. Ensuring sound procurement practices As part of our commitment to managing our indi- rect impacts, the EIB has produced a Guide to Pro- curement which includes the requirement for the EIB\u2019s project promoters to comply with the EIB\u2019s en- vironmental and social requirements when imple- menting EIB-financed projects, and for tenderers to comply with applicable national and internation- al standards in that regard. More specifically, the Guide to Procurement provides promoters with the possibility to include environmental character- istics in tender evaluation criteria. The EIB strives to continually review and improve its practices, for example by providing practical guidance to its staff to ensure that environmental and social measures required for projects are consistently reflected in procurement documents and taken into account in procurement decisions. The main elements of the Bank\u2019s policy on procurement are: \u2022 the work, goods and services procured under the EIB\u2019s financing should be of appropriate quality and acquired at economic prices and in a timely manner; \u2022 in projects located within the EU and in those candidate and potential candidate countries that have already incorporated the relevant EU legislation, the applicable EU laws on public procure- ment should be adhered to, particularly as regards tendering on the basis of fair and non-discrimi- natory terms; \u2022 in all other countries outside the European Union, the Bank requires that the main mechanisms of the EU Directives on procurement be followed, with the necessary procedural adaptations.

        "41 2014 Sustainability Report Growing forest sustainability in Slovakia Forests play an important role in Slovakia, providing employment and maintaining a delicate environ- mental balance. In 2014, the EIB financed a EUR 210m loan to support an afforestation project by the Slovak Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The project will improve the environmental performance of farms, with 2 000 farmers\u2019 land benefiting from the modernisation of on-farm facilities. Supporting the entire forest value chain In March 2014, the EIB signed a EUR 120m loan agreement in support of the Slovak Ministry of Ag- riculture and Rural Development. The EIB finance will contribute to afforestation projects, improved forest protection and management and the up- grading of agricultural infrastructure in Slovakia. Forests and other wooded land account for over 40% of the EU\u2019s land area. In recent decades, af- forestation and natural succession have increased this area by approximately 0.4% annually while the global demand for forest products continues to grow steadily at an annual rate of 3%. Woodland areas are an important source of em- ployment for three million people living in Europe\u2019s rural areas. The EIB has been active in the forestry sector for some 35 years, promoting its wide range of economic, environmental and social benefits by investing in the entire forest value chain, from planting, management and fire protection, to pro- cessing and timberland funds. Importance of forest cover in Slovakia In Slovakia, forests play a particularly important role in maintaining the delicate environmental bal- ance; they make up 69% of the country\u2019s Natura 2000 network of protected areas, compared to an EU average of 51%. This afforestation project will have considerable environmental benefits in terms of improved forest ecosystem health and increased greenhouse gas sequestration and renewable en- ergy production. It will also generate new employ- ment throughout the country. Improving the environmental performance of farms The investment will improve the environmental performance of farms, with 2 000 farmers\u2019 land ben- efiting from the modernisation of on-farm facilities, including the use of renewable energy and energy- efficient technologies. Improved nutrient manage- ment will reduce surface and groundwater pollu- tion from livestock farming activities to improve the management of all-important water resources. The on-farm nutrient management will reduce ni- trate and phosphate pollution arising from agricul- tural activities, directly contributing to Slovakia\u2019s compliance with the EU Nitrates Directive and the country\u2019s progress towards meeting the require- ments of the Water Framework Directive. As this project was particularly environmentally sensitive a Strategic Impact Assessment was car- ried out, which resulted in the Ministry of Environ- ment giving its approval to the programme.

        "42 Sustainability Report 2014 Open and Accountable T ransparency is at the core of how the EIB Group operates. We consider that as a bank and a pub- lic institution, openness on how we make our decisions and implement EU policies strengthens our credibility and accountability to citizens. We strive to put processes and instruments in place to make it easier for external stakeholders to request informa- tion. We want to be transparent about our decision- making processes and our governance, about the re- sults and impacts that our projects have and about how we prevent maladministration in the Bank. Engaging with stakeholders As a public institution and the only bank owned by all EU Member States, we are committed to en- gaging with a wide range of stakeholders The underlying objective of stakeholder engage- ment at the EIB Group is to ensure that our many and diverse stakeholders have a channel to be heard and that their concerns are adequately ad- dressed. The EIB\u2019s stakeholder engagement fol- lows best practice, with the aim of increasing mutual understanding, addressing stakeholder concerns by adjusting our activities accordingly, and decreasing potential gaps between expec- tations, policy and practice. In addition, by en- gaging with stakeholders we are able to achieve greater coherence and accountability in our poli- cies and practices. In terms of engagement with EU institutions, the EIB Group not only holds discussions with the Euro pean Commission and the European Parlia- ment, but also with smaller institutions, such as the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. The EIB contributes to How the EIB Group aspires to meet the highest standards of transparency. We pride ourselves on constantly reviewing and improving how and what information we share. One of our biggest achievements in 2014 was to launch our public register, which allows public access to the environmental information received or produced by the EIB Group. The stakeholders with which the EIB engages range from other EU institutions to individual EU Member States, from companies in the financial and business sectors to many organisations in civil society, including various interest groups from universities and research centres to social entrepreneurs.

        "43 Activities in 2014 2014 Sustainability Report Civil society organisations are invited to participate in the EIB Group annual Board seminar events of other institutions, such as the Open Day of all EU institutions on Europe Day on 9 May, as well as the Open Day events of the Committee of the Regions. Also, when the EIB runs a public con- sultation on a topic such as our transparency or climate action policy, we actively seek the partici- pation of other institutions. Equally, the Bank con- tributes to similar initiatives of the other institu- tions and we regularly participate in their public events. Examples of our stakeholder engagement in 2014 include our materiality assessment for sustainabil- ity reporting and the annual EIB Board Seminar with Civil Society Organisations. Furthermore, the EIB also engages with the stakeholders of individu- al projects we support. Engagement through our materiality assessment As part of our process to understand and respond to our most material aspects \u2013 those aspects that are of greatest concern to our stakeholders and which have the most significant impact on the op- erational success of the institution \u2013 we consulted with a wide range of stakeholders at the end of 2013 and throughout 2014. In line with our strong ethos of transparency, we used a third party to conduct the materiality sur- vey. Using a third party ensured impartiality when speaking with all stakeholders and gave us a clear and balanced picture of what the material aspects are for the EIB Group. At the end of 2013, we distributed an online sur- vey to civil society organisations. Responses were received from a wide range of stakeholders includ- ing, non-governmental organisations, business as- sociations and federations and think-tanks. After analysis of the data and further consultation we extended our materiality survey to include pro- ject promoters and dealers to provide a broader stakeholder opinion base. The survey was adapt- ed for project promoters and dealers and sent to every one on the EIB\u2019s Project Promoters and Deal- ers contact list in October 2014. We also conducted an internal consultation which included face-to-face and telephone interviews with EIB Group employees. From the comprehensive stakeholder engage- ment, we were able to produce a materiality matrix and determine that the three aspects that are most important to both internal and external stakehold- ers are: achieving our priority objectives; managing the EIB Group\u2019s indirect impacts; and transparency and accountability of the EIB Group. More on the materiality process can be found in the materiality assessment section of this report. G4-37 ",
        "44 Sustainability Report 2014 Transparency policy and public register Transparency is a core value of the EIB Group. The EIB Group\u2019s Transparency Policy governs our ap- proach to transparency, access to information and stakeholder engagement. We apply the principle of \u201cpresumption of disclosure\u201d to all information held by the Bank with well-defined exceptions based on applicable EU legislation and case law. Every year on our website, we publish a detailed report on the number of information requests, the topics con- cerned and the origin of the requests, click here for the latest report. In 2014 we conducted a review of our Transparency Policy through a \u201cbest in class\u201d public consultation. Full details of the consultation can be found here. A public register of environmental documents was es- tablished in early 2014 as a result of the application of the Aarhus Regulation to the EIB. The register allows public access to the environmental information re- ceived or produced by the EIB. It is constantly evolving and information will be progressively made available. Further information concerning the public register can be found here. \uf052 Compliance and ethics Recent developments in the banking industry have placed an increased focus on compliance and ethics. As the EU bank and the financing institution of the European Union, the EIB Group and its staff have a duty to adhere to the highest integrity, ethical and professional standards. This is a primary feature of appropriate business conduct, which we apply to our relationships with colleagues and project coun- terparts, as well as to the full range of our activities. The Office of the Chief Compliance Officer is the key control function for ensuring the integrity of EIB staff, management and activities. The main as- pects covered by the EIB compliance function in- clude ethics, anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (\u201cAML-CFT\u201d), integrity due diligence of EIB counterparties and operations, regulatory compliance, training, and clearance of procurement processes for the Bank\u2019s own account. In September 2014, the EIB compliance function hosted the first Compliance Summit. The audi- ence comprised leading experts in their fields and drew from an international community includ- ing International Financial Institutions (IFIs) such as the World Bank, IADB, EBRD, ADB and AfDB, as well as representatives from European bilateral financial institutions, from regulators and stand- ard-setting organisations (EBA, BIS, EUROPOL, FATF and OECD Global Forum) and from Transpar- ency International. The summit emphasised the high and ever-rising importance of compliance and highlighted recent trends in the fight against money laundering, terrorism financing, tax eva- sion and harmful tax practices and their link to the reputation of IFIs. External review of performance We firmly believe that understanding external per- ceptions of our sustainability efforts is of the ut- most importance. To do this we engage with a number of external non-financial rating agencies. The feedback from these agencies allows us to fine-tune our communication or adjust our policies and practices in the most effective way. In 2014, we were rated as \u201cOutperforming\u201d by Sus- tainalytics, as \u201cPositive\u201d by IMUG, as \u201cPrime\u201d by Oe- kom Research and as \u201cAdvanced\u201d by VIGEO, main- taining the same levels of performance as in previous years.

        "45 2014 Sustainability Report Open and Accountable Complaints Mechanism The EIB Complaints Mechanism Division (EIB-CM) looks into cases of alleged maladministration sub- mitted by members of the public who have been directly or indirectly affected by the EIB Group\u2019s activities. Complaints give us the opportunity to improve how we operate. A two-tier complaints procedure is available to the public which in- volves first the EIB-CM and, second, the European Ombudsman. In 2014, the Complaints Mechanism Division re- ceived 60 new cases (63 in 2013). Of these, 48 were declared admissible in accordance with the EIB Complaints Mechanism Principles, Terms of Refer- ence and Rules of Procedures (57 in 2012). The European Ombudsman (EO) received five new cases (two in 2013) against the EIB Group and closed six (six in 2013). Of these, one was closed with a critical remark and a conclusion of malad- ministration, and in another, the EO issued a draft recommendation. In September 2014, the EIB Compliance function hosted its first Compliance Summit G4-37 G4-EN34 ",
        "46 Sustainability Report 2014 A public consultation on the review of the EIB Group\u2019s Transparency Policy Bringing the outside in Consulting our external stakeholders The EIB Group is committed to actively encouraging stakeholder input in its policies and practices. Through our commitment to open communication, as a Group we demonstrate our willingness to listen to third parties so as to benefit from their contribu- tions and better fulfil our mission. In 2014, we held a public consultation as part of the review of our Transparency Policy, which sets out the EIB Group\u2019s approach to transparency and stakehold- er engagement and defines the Bank\u2019s procedures concerning information requests from the public, as well as the information that we routinely make avail- able to the public. The previous Transparency Policy had been adopted in 2010, following an in-depth two-round public con- sultation procedure that took place in 2009. The consultation process was launched in July, with an announcement on the EIB website. Concurrently, a draft revised Transparency Policy was published so- liciting opinions. The consultation process was a standard, one-round process, which had proven successful during the re- cent reviews of the transport and energy lending policies and criteria. Stakeholders were invited to submit written contributions. In addition, two con- sultation meetings were organised in order to dis- cuss the review with interested stakeholders. In order to inform a broad range of stakeholders about the review, and in addition to the regular public announcements on the Bank\u2019s website, in- formation about the consultation and its steps were sent directly to interested organisations and individ- uals who had shown or were likely to show a partic- ular interest in the EIB Group\u2019s Transparency Policy. We also held bilateral meetings with EU institutional stakeholders such as the European Ombudsman. The stakeholders\u2019 written contributions were con- solidated in an aspects matrix that outlined sug- G4-37 ",
        "47 2014 Sustainability Report gestions and comments according to articles of the Transparency Policy. An inter-directorate re- view panel was set up within the Bank to consid- er all stakeholders\u2019 contributions and to examine the extent to which suggestions could be taken into account in the review process. The consolidat- ed matrix with the aspects raised by stakeholders\u2019 suggestions and the Bank\u2019s reasoned opinion was published on our website, together with the draft revised policy, the stakeholders\u2019 contributions and a consultation report, more than 15 working days before the new policy was submitted to the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors. The process to review the policy through public con- sultation and meetings with stakeholders has been brought by the European Ombudsman to the atten- tion of relevant EU agencies as a model when they consider developing their own policies in the area of transparency. \uf052 Improving our transparency The revised EIB Group Transparency Policy main- tains the high level of transparency provided for in the previous version and its guiding principles will apply to the whole EIB Group. The new poli- cy continues to compare favourably with interna- tional best practice, while safeguarding legitimate requirements for confidentiality on the part of the Bank\u2019s commercial counterparts. It also recognises the particular character and the specificities of the EIB as enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The policy is more user-friendly than the previous one, with significant improvements to its structure and clarity. It has been further aligned with appli- cable EU legislation, as interpreted by the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union re- garding transparency and access to information. The new policy commits the EIB to a high level of proactive dissemination of information via tools such as a public register of documents and the publication of project data via the International Aid Transparency Initiative. It also continues to apply the principle of \u201cpre- sumption of disclosure\u201d to all information held by the Bank with well-defined exceptions based on applicable EU legislation and case law. By implementing this revised Transparency Policy, the EIB Group remains committed to achieving the highest possible level of transparency regarding its activities. Open and Accountable G4-37 ",
        "48 Sustainability Report 2014 Proactive disclosure The right of access In order to support and promote the principle of transparency, the EIB is fully committed to regu- larly publishing accurate information regarding our role, policies and operations in a timely fash- ion, and we routinely publish a broad set of docu- ments, notably through our website. In compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1367/2006 (the Aarhus Regulation), environmental and social information held by the Bank and related to projects is also made available through the EIB's public regis- ter of documents, which we set up on our website in 2014. \uf052 In accordance with the Aarhus Regulation, EU institutions and bodies must organise the en- vironmental information which is relevant to their function and which is held by them, with a view to its active and systematic dissemination to the public. The register is progressively evolving and we aim to publish more information in the future. It cur- rently includes the key project-related environ- mental and social information/documents held by the Bank, namely: \u2022 EIB Environmental and Social Data Sheets (ESDSs), which summarise the EIB\u2019s environmental and social appraisal of individual projects.

Group Management\u2019s responsibility for the Report Group\u2019s Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Report, and the informa- tion and assertions contained within it, in accordance with the internal reporting criteria applicable in 2014 at the Group as detailed on page 8 of the Report; for determining the EIB Group\u2019s objectives in respect of sustainable development performance and reporting, including the identification of stakehold- ers and material issues; and for establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control systems from which the reported performance information is derived. Responsibility of the R\u00e9viseur d\u2019Entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9 Our responsibility is to perform a limited assurance engagement and to express a conclusion based on the work performed. We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, as adopted for Luxembourg by the Institut des R\u00e9viseurs d\u2019Entreprises. That Standard requires that we comply with applicable ethical requirements, including independence requirements, and that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the indicators and statements in the Report marked in italics and with a tick \uf052 are free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement on a sustainability report consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the sustainability report, and apply- ing analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate. These procedures included, to the extent that they apply to the indicators and statements in the Report marked in italics and with a tick \uf052 : \u2022 Inquiries of management to gain an understanding of the Group\u2019s processes for determining the material issues for the Group\u2019s stakeholder groups; \u2022 Interviews with relevant staff at corporate and business unit level responsible for providing the informa- tion in the Report; KPMG Luxembourg, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 coop\u00e9rative, a Luxembourg entity and a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (\u201cKPMG International\u201d), a Swiss entity.

A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement or an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and Assurance Engagements, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit or a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express an audit or a reasonable assurance conclusion on the Report as a whole or on the indicators and statements in the Report marked in italics and with a tick \uf052 . We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. Conclusion Based on the limited assurance procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the indicators and statements in the Report marked in italics and with a tick \uf052 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the internal reporting criteria applicable in 2014 at the Group, as detailed on page 8 of the Report.
