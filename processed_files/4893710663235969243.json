The IF has now reached its cruising speed and has developed a balanced portfolio of investments both in terms of sectoral and geo- graphicaldiversification,withanumberofoperationsbeingcharacterisedbyinnovativefeaturescomparedtotraditional lending activities. \u00b8 Both infrastructure, which is widely recognised as a prerequisite for economic development, and the financial sector, involving both enhancement of the sector and the funding of small projects, SMEs and micro-enterprises, now appear pr ominen tly in the por tf olio . \u00b8 By the end of 2005, after just over two and a half years of operations, the IF had committed EUR 829m or \u00181% of its EUR 2 0\u00187m initial capital endowment, corresponding to \u00188 projects financed in 2\u0018 different countries spread across the ACP region. Of these \u00188 projects, 1\u0018 had a regional scope: \u0018 covered the whole of the ACPs, 7 focused on Africa and 2 targeted investments in the Pacific and Caribbean respectively. In addition a total of EUR \u001801m of financings had been approved but not yet signed. \u00b8 Commitments signed during 2005 totalled EUR \u001851m for the financing of 25 projects located in 15 different countries, of which 5 projects had a regional scope. \u00b8 Disbursements equivalent to EUR 211m on a cumulative basis were made, representing 25% of contracts signed to date and corresponding to 2\u0018 projects, of which 7 have now been fully disbursed. \u00b8 TheBankalsocommittedownresourcesofEUR219mfor9differentprojects,withdisbursementssofartotallingjustover EUR 20m. This brings the Bank\u2019s total commitments and disbursements under the Cotonou Agreement to EUR 1 0\u00188m and EUR 2\u00182m respectively. \u00b8 The June 2005 signature of the revised Cotonou Agreement introduced greater flexibility in the financing of public sec- tor (mainly infrastructure) projects in HIPC or other countries pursuing economic adjustment. This allowed the Bank to commit EUR \u00188m of the EUR 187m interest subsidies appropriation under Cotonou, for 6 projects requiring sufficiently concessional resources in countries facing debt sustainability constraints. \u00b8 TheBankofficiallyopeneditsfirstthreeregionalofficesintheACPsinNairobi(CentralandEastAfrica),Dakar(WestAfrica) andTshwane (Pretoria) (Southern Africa and Indian Ocean).The official ceremonies took place in the presence of Kenya\u2019s Minister for Finance, the Hon.

Although the level of activity in developing and emerging markets was robust, a significant number of countries in the ACPs remain dependent on the support and commitment of the international community to make decisive strides towards poverty eradication. Sub-Saharan Africa continued to enjoy sustained growth, with an average of nearly 5 percent in 2005. Even though it did not compare to the rapid pace of growth in other developing countries, notably that of some developing Asian economies, a similar performance had not been witnessed for a very long time. Apart from broadly supportive global economic conditions, growth in the re- gion was driven by a number of factors stemming from purely internal circum- stances: \u2022 the easing of conflicts in a number of countries\u2013suchasBurundiandtheCen- tralAfricanRepublic\u2013eventhoughthe Darfur region of Sudan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Zimbabwe,partsoftheDemocraticRe- public of Congo and Uganda were still affected by continued turmoil; \u2022 the successful implementation by a number of countries of the necessary reforms to reach their HIPC comple- tion point, with debt relief supporting macroeconomic stability; \u2022 the coming on-stream of new oil fields inSouthernandCentralAfricatogether with a recovery in agricultural produc- tion in East and Central Africa. Almostallcountriesintheregion(except forC\u00f4ted\u2019Ivoire,ZimbabweandtheSey- chelles) are currently enjoying positive growth, although cross-country distri- bution was uneven \u2013 with oil produc- ers, where output growth reached 6.8 percent, showing the largest increases.

Also, the members of the CFA franc zone have lost consider- able competitiveness with the deprecia- tion of the US dollar against the euro, to which their currency is pegged. In fact, the CFA zone economies are increas- ingly dependent on dollar-zone mar- kets, the United States and Asia.

Given the overall difficult environment in which the IF operates, the results achieved so far, especially during 2005, are encouraging both in terms of lending volume and in terms of geographical and sectoral diversification of the portfolio, whilst certain operations finalised during the year were characterised by a number of innovative features compared to the Bank\u2019s traditional lending activities. The Bank also made good progress in implementing its new Development Impact Assessment Framework, the first results of which are expected to be available during the course of 2006. This represents a further step in ensuring that the IF projects do contribute to sustainable development. Under the Albion Resort Mauritius project, the IF is offering a financial package comprising a senior loan and equity for the financing of a new high-end266-roomClubM\u00e9diterran\u00e9e beach resort hotel located on Mau- ritius\u2019s west coast, alongside equity from Proparco and senior debt from the Mauritius Commercial Bank. This operation clearly illustrates how the IF can fulfil its task of promoting private sector activities that add value to local resources.The tourism industry is a driv- ing force in Mauritius\u2019s economy and is a major provider of employment in the country. Both the IF and Proparco\u2019s long-term funding usefully complement local funding, which remains constrained by limited long-term resources. Signatures for the year totalled just over EUR \u001851m for the financing of 25 projects located in 15 different coun- tries, of which five projects equivalent to EUR \u0018\u0018m had a regional scope. Nearly \u00180% of these commitments went to projects located in the Central and East African regions, notably for energy in Ethiopia and Kenya, and for an indus- trial project in Chad. West Africa was fairly active with total commitments of EUR 97m, corresponding to 10 projects in the financial, industrial and mining and energy sectors. Commitments for the Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region totalled EUR 68m and targeted investments in the services (tourism), in- dustrial and mining and energy sectors. Financings for the Caribbean and Pacific regions amounted to EUR \u00185m for lines of credit to the financial sector.

A key source of the value-added of the IF stems from its nature as a risk-sharing facility, i.e. its ability to offer an extended range of flexible financial instru- ments \u2013 denominated in EUR, other widely traded currencies or even local currencies \u2013 that can be used in supporting the financing of development projects. These are: \u00b8 ordinary or senior loans \u00b8 junior or subordinated loans \u00b8 quasi-equity through participating, conditional or convertible loans \u00b8 equity (direct and indirect) \u00b8 guarantees. In order to preserve its overall financial viability, the IF operates according to specific credit risk policies which, while reflecting best banking practice, take into consideration the IF\u2019s development objectives as well as its remit to operate in all ACP countries and OCTs and the re- sulting need to apply those policies with sufficient flexibility. This, in turn, requires proactive monitoring of the IF exposure, in particular \u2013 but not exclusively \u2013 of the various risk-bearing instruments that the IF uses in the course of its operations.

Whilst adopting a more proactive approach aimed at promoting new financial instruments often better suited to local needs, such as equity funds or guarantees, the IF is continuing to offer global loans in a number of countries. By the end of 2005, sig ned global loans under the IF to talled EUR 186m, i.e . some 22% of the IF por tf olio , and near ly EUR \u00180m had alr eady been allocated to over 80 different sub-projects. The ventures financed through these global loans cover a wide range of sectors, rangingfromservices(transportation,telecoms,security,tourism)tohealthandeducation,agro-industry,urbaninfrastructure and manufacturing industry. In Uganda, the DFCU Leasing Global Loan was fully allocated and disbursed within just over a year of signature. This EUR 5m local currency loan was used to finance eight Ugandan ventures operating in the telecommunications, transport services, health and education and industrial sectors. Following the success of this operation, a second global loan has been put in place and will be signed shortly. Niger\u2019s financial sector remains one of the least developed in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). Apart from a generally unfavourable investment climate and a certain aversion by banks to the perceived degree of risk, the poor capacity of the financial sector to support investments with ap- propriate long and medium-term financing is one of the obstacles holding back private sector development in the country.

This operation represented a quantum increase in the total supply of medium and long-term credit in Niger, a development much welcomed by the Central Bank.The Finan- cial Sector Global Loan II operation intends to provide further impetus to this trend. A key element behind the successful implementation of this operation lies with the role played by an EU-sponsored financing support scheme \u2013TANYO \u2013 which operates at three levels: (i) selecting and preparing promoters\u2019projects forsubmissiontotheintermediarybanks,(ii)providingassistanceandguidancetotheenterpriseanditspromoterthroughout the life of the loan and (iii) guaranteeing half the maximum amount of loans advanced by the intermediary banks.

These concerned mainly countries in either the CEMAC or WAEMU areas \u2013 where local banks appear to have excess liquidity, notably through the availability of domesticsavings,whichisgreatlyreducingtheirinterestin\u2013andneedfor\u2013additionalfundingsources.Furthermore,appropri- ate benchmarking for pricing such loans is proving to be a key issue to ensuring the successful utilisation of global loans. The BOAD guarantee facility is expected to be \u2013 at least partially \u2013 issued during the course of 2006, once the Bank is satisfied that BOAD has fulfilled the requisite contractual conditions. As indicated above, guarantees are an obvious alternative to global loans in countries with surplus liquidity and the Bank will continue to promote this instrument in order to avoid committing resources which remain unutilised.

Both infrastructure, which is widely recognised as a prerequisite for economic development, and the financial sector, involving both enhancement and the funding of smaller projects, SMEs and micro-enterprises, now appear prominently in the portfolio.

This has directly translated into a significant increase in the relative share of infrastructure invest- ments, which accounted for 26% of the portfolio at the end of 2005, compared to some 10% in 200\u0018. IF financing of infra- structure projects has so far focused on energy projects \u2013 nine projects located in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Gre- nada, Kenya, Mauritania, Mozambique and Zambia \u2013 and, to a limited extent, on transport(LiaisonMaritimeDakar-Ziguin- chor in Senegal). Although its relative share in the IF port- folio decreased from close to 60% to just under \u00185% at the end of 2005, financial services continue to be a focus sector in line with the provisions of the Cotonou supportthedevelopmentofSMEs,suchas guarantees or equity, which, with a total of 16 operations equivalent to nearly EUR150mofcommitments,accountedfor 18% of the portfolio at the end of 2005. Regional cooperation and integration are high on the agenda for accomplish- ing some of the core Millennium Devel- opment Goals and the IF recognises the need to support regional projects, whilst acknowledging the difficulties involved in developing regional initiatives. Re- gional operations covering the whole of the ACPs accounted for 16% of the IF portfolioattheendof2005,comparedto 27%in200\u0018.TheseincludetheEuropean Financing Partnership Agency Agree- ment signed in 200\u0018, the implementa- tion of which is progressing satisfactorily (see below).The portfolio also comprises a number of operations that target indi- vidualsub-regions,especiallyWestAfrica, where 2\u0018% of the sub-region\u2019s lending is made up of regional operations.

This policy is reflected in the regular consultation at both senior management and sta ff lev els , pr oj ec t co financing and joint participation in working groups. During the year, the Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Commission and the African Development Bank, the intention being to provide a framework for future coop- erationbetweenthethreeinstitutionsin identifying more joint financing oppor- tunities, with particular focus on private sector and regional integration project initiatives, in line with the objectives of the Investment Facility. The MoU also addresses areas of cooperation in the field of development policy issues, not only in the ACPs but also in the Mediter- ranean region. At policy level, the possible pooling of the Bank\u2019s and the Commission\u2019s ex- pertise as well as the identification of financing opportunities where Com- mission grant resources could be used alongside IF funds or the Bank\u2019s own resources is a major area of concerted action. In this respect, a key feature of the year was the definition of a new\u201cEU- AfricaPartnershipforInfrastructure\u201d,the establishment of which was initiated at the instigation of Commissioner Michel. A blend of Commission grants and EIB loans was identified as the most ap- propriate mechanism to increase EU financial assistance for African infra- structure projects. A Memorandum of Understanding between the Bank and the Commission was signed in early 2006, marking the official launch of this EU financing initiative for infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, in which other bi- lateral financial institutions will be able to participate at a later stage. Institutional cooperation was also very active in other areas, including the sec- February2006:EIBPresidentP.MaystadtandCommissionerL.MichelsigntheEUAfrica PartnershipforInfrastructureMemorandumofUnderstanding ",

The first concrete results are already visible with the launching of the EU Water Facility, with which the Bank is closely associated. Following a first call for proposals launched in November 200\u0018, five proposals involving the EIB were accepted, for a total grant contri- bution of nearly EUR 70m, representing about \u00180% of the funds available. These include four projects in Ethiopia, Mada- gascar, Mozambique and Tanzania (the last of these for the preparatory phase) as well as a EUR \u0018m project preparation facility. Synergies are also expected in the energy sector, once the EU Energy Facility is further developed. With regard to other European devel- opment institutions and agencies, in December 2005 the Bank concluded an agreement with AFD and KfW with a view to strengthening cooperation in theACPsandintheMediterraneancoun- tries. The agreement builds on lengthy experience of working together and is based on shared objectives. It is open to all specialised European institutions wishing to participate in this effort to creategreatersynergiesbetweenofficial development assistance agencies. Practical implementation of the Frame- work Agreement on Financial Coopera- tion between the Bank and the Euro- pean Development Finance Institutions (EDFIs) through the European Financing Partners(EFPs),aSpecialPurposeVehicle (SPV) set up in 200\u0018 and jointly owned by the EDFIs and the EIB (on behalf of the IF) made significant progress during 2005.

This positive evaluation led to the decision to proceed with the replenishmentoftheEFPsandattheend of2005theBankapprovedanadditional EUR 100m to be made available from IF resources, in parallel with an additional EUR 50m from the EDFIs. Another example of the Bank\u2019s efforts to boost cooperation with other donors was the two-day workshop on Develop- ment Impact Indicators for IFI Private Equity Funds, which the Bank hosted in early November 2005. This workshop was organised in the framework of an IFC initiative launched in 2001, with a twice-yearly series of meetings being held as a forum to discuss issues of com- mon interest to various IFIs. The topic of this workshop reflected the Bank\u2019s will- ingness to contribute to the definition of common key or core indicators in order to achieve a minimum degree of harmonisation in the assessment of the development impact of private invest- ment funds. This workshop, which was co-chaired with the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation and attend- ed by a wide number of IFIs and EDFIs, achieved an initial breakthrough which will hopefully lead to the endorsement oftheindicatorsbyallparticipantsatthe next meeting to be held in Washington DC in the spring of 2006.

General information The Investment Facility (the \u201cFacility\u201d) has been established within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) on co-operation and development assistance negotiated between the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (\u201cthe ACP States\u201d) and the European Union and its Member States on 2\u0018 June 2000 and revised on 25 June 2005. The Facility is managed by the European Investment Bank (the \u201cEIB\u201d or the \u201cBank\u201d). Under the terms of the Agreement up to EUR 2,200 million for ACP and EUR 20 million for OCT (as agreed by the Council Decision of 27 November 2001 on the association of the Overseas Countries and Territories with the European Community) may be allocated to finance the Facility. Within the framework of the Agreement, the EIB also manages loans granted from its own resources. All other financial resources and instruments under the Agreement are administered by the European Commission. 2. Significant accounting policies In 2005, the Facility adopted the International Financial Reporting Standards for the preparation of its financial statements and this adoption was done according to IFRS 1 \u2013 First Time Adoption of IFRS \u2013 using January 1, 200\u0018 as the transition date. The accounting policies applied are in conformity with the IFRS and with the overall principles of the Directives 86/6\u00185/EEC of the Council of the European Communities of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions, as amended by Directive 2001/65/EC of 27 September 2001 and by Directive 200\u0018/51/EC of 18 June 200\u0018 on the annual and consolidated accounts of certain types of companies, banks and other financial institutions and insurance undertakings (the\u201cDirectives\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requirestheuseofcertaincriticalaccountingestimates.Italsorequires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Facility\u2019s accounting policies. The area involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed. The Balance Sheet represents assets and liabilities in decreasing order of liquidity and does not distinguish between current and non-current items. 2.1 Foreign currency translation The Facility uses the Euro (EUR) for presenting its financial state- ments, which is also the functional currency. For the presentation of the financial statements, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Euro are translated into Euro at the spot rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date. The profit and loss accounts are translated monthly into Euro based on the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each month. Exchange differences arising on translation are recorded as a cur- rency gain or loss in the income statement. 2.2 Cash and cash equivalents Th e Fa cilit y defines cash equiv alen ts as cur re nt ac co un ts or shor t- term deposits with original maturities of three months or less. 2.3 Financial assets other than derivatives Financial assets are accounted for using the settlement date basis. \u2022 Loans Loans originated by the Facility are recorded at cost (net disbursed amounts), which is the fair value of the cash given to originate the loan, including any transaction costs, and are subsequently meas- ured at amortised cost, using the effective yield method, less any provision for impairment or uncollectability. \u2022 Equity investments This consists of the Facility direct or indirect equity investments. Such assets are carried at fair value and classified as available for sale. a. Venture capital funds The fair value of each venture capital fund will be based on the Net AssetValue (NAV), reported by the fund, if calculated based on international valuation standard recognized to be compliant with IFRS. The Facility may however decide to adjust the NAV reported by the fund if there are issues that may affect the valuation. If no internationally recognized fair valuation standard is applied, the valuation will be conducted on the basis of the underlying portfolio. b. Direct equity investments The fair value of the investment will be based on the latest set of financial statements available, re-using, if applicable, the same model as the one used at the acquisition of the participation. For non quoted investments, the fair value is determined by applying recognized valuation techniques. Unrealised gains or losses are reported in equity until such investment is sold, col- lected or disposed of, or until such investment is determined to be impaired. At this time the cumulative profit or loss previously recognised in reserves is included in the income statement. These investments are accounted for at cost when the fair value cannot be reliably measured. \u2022 Guarantees Guarantees issued by the Facility are categorized as financial guar- antees and are recorded off-balance sheet, with the exception of related premiums, unless a provision is needed to cover probable losses, determined in accordance with IAS \u00187. 2.4 Impairment of financial assets Impairments are made for loans outstanding at the end of the financial year, when presenting objective evidence of risks of non recovery of all or part of their amounts according to the original con- tractual terms or the equivalent value. Specific provisions for impair- ment are then recognized in the income statement. Impairment is then defined as the difference between the carrying value of the loans and the net present value of expected future cash flows, determined using the instrument\u2019s original effective interest rate where applicable. On the basis that the Bank conducts credit risk assessment on a loan by loan basis, there is no need for collective impairment provision. The Facility determines that available-for-sale equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below cost. This determination of whether a decline is significant or prolonged is based on a judgmental appreciation. If a specific provision for impairment is made for an equity investment, any change in fair value that had previously been recognized in reserves is taken to the income statement. ",
        "Annual Report 2005 \u2013 Investment Facility \u00189 A f r i c a \u2022 C a r i b b e an \u2022 P a c i f i c \u2022 A f r i c a \u2022 C a r i b b e a n \u2022 P a c i f i c \u2022 A f r i c a \u2022 C a r i b b e a n \u2022 P a ci f i c The European Investment Bank\u2019s Risk Management reviews financial assets for impairment at least once a year. Resulting adjustments include the unwinding of the discount in the income statement over the life of the asset, and any adjustments required in respect of a reassessment of the initial impairment. 2.5 Derivative financial instruments In the normal course of its activity, the Facility may enter into swap contracts with a view to hedge specific lending operations, denomi- nated in actively traded currencies other than the Euro, in order to offset any gain or loss caused by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. However, the Facility has not entered into any hedge accounting transactions under IFRS rules as at December \u00181, 2005 and 200\u0018. Therefore, all derivatives are measured at fair value through the income statement. Fair values are derived primarily from discounted cash-flow models, option-pricing models and from third party quotes. Derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is posi- tive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. 2.6 Contributions Contributions from Member States are recognized as receivable in the balance sheet on the date of the Council Decision fixing the financial contribution to be paid by the Member States to the Facility. 2.7 Interest subsidies As part of its activity, the Facility manages interest subsidies on behalf of the Member States. The part of the Member States contributions allocated to the pay- ment of interest subsidies is not accounted for in the Facility\u2019s equity but is classified as an amount owed to third parties. 2.8 Interest income on treasury Under the terms of the Facility and according to the Financial Regulation applicable to the 9th European Development Fund, the funds received by the EIB on behalf of the Facility are recorded in an account in the Commission\u2019s name. Interest on these deposits, placed by the Facility with the EIB, is not accounted for by the Facility as it is payable directly to the European Commission. Reflows, being repayment of principal, interest or commissions stemming from financial operations, and interest calculated on these reflows are accounted for within the Facility. 2.9 Interest, fees, commissions and dividends Interest is recorded on an accruals basis using the effective yield method. Fees received in respect of services provided over a period of time are recognized as income as the services are provided. Commitment fees are deferred and recognized in income using the effective inter- est method over the period from disbursement to repayment of the related loan. Dividends relating to equity investments are recognised when received. 2.10 Taxation The Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union, appendedtotheTreatyof29October200\u0018establishingaConstitution for Europe, stipulates that the assets, revenues and other property of the Institutions of the Union are exempt from all direct taxes. 2.11 Effect of changes in accounting policies Previous financial statements were produced in accordance with the general principles of the Directive 86/6\u00185/EEC of the Council of the European Communities of 8 December 1986 (as amended by Directive 2001/65/EC of 27 September 2001) on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions (the\u201cDirective\u201d). Where necessary, certain prior-year figures have been reclassified to conform with changes to the current year\u2019s presentation for com- parative purposes. The transition to IFRS has not affected the net income and equity for the year 200\u0018. 3.
