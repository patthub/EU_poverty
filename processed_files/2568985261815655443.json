An issue of growing concern, Member States can see its implications for economic growth, productivity, flexibility and skills - unless action is taken now. The working-age population (15-64) in the EC increased by around 17%* during the past twenty years, as the workforce welcomed the generation of post-war 'baby boomers'. However, Only Euro Time will Show A fascinating gamut of facts and figures have emerged from Euro Time, a survey undertaken by the IP Group International Marketing Committee in October 1991 on how Europeans divide their time. Sweeping across 20 European countries, the survey questioned almost 10,000 people on how they arrange their day. Focusing on a range of forty activities, such as sleeping, work, child care and leisure, the survey found that three of these activities take up more than 60% of the average day - sleeping, working and watching television. (Continued on page 8) with the decline in the birth rate during the late 70s and '80s, it was projected that over the next ten years this population would increase by only 3% to 5%; remaining \u00a7EP\u00bfS constant or showing a slight decline in the subsequent decade. Gradually the face of the European workforce was changing, and it was by no means a temporan' phenomenon: there are less young people to renew the workforce as the years pass. By the year 2010 some 14% of the working-age population will be under 25, as compared to 18% in 1990. It is estimated that the proportion of the working-age population of 50 or over within the EC will rise from 39% in 1990 to 43% in 2010. while 28% will be over 60 years of age in 2010 \u2022 Continued on page 2 An Open Forum 1993 has already proved a busy year for the Foundation with 55 visits recorded in the first six months. All the groups hosted at Loughlinstown House came seeking further information on the work of the Foundation, interested both in understanding the projects in development but also in using the results in a constructive way to mould better working and living conditions in Europe. \u2022 Continued on page 5 Dr. Clive Purkiss, Director and Mr. Uric Verborgh, Deputy Director with members of the Democratic Alliance (RDE) of the European Parliament who visited the Foundation recently.

Participants at conference \"Training to support families who care for older relatives\" held in Porto, March I 7-19. 1993 in comparison to 25% in 1990. Yet one of the features of the economic recession and subsequent adjustments within the labour market has been the adoption of measures to bring forward the effective age of retirement, in some cases by up to ten years, by many enterprises. In so doing, they have reduced the activity rate of the over-60s since 1980, in particular in northern Member States. Beyond the labour market, repercussions include the necessity to commit national resources to Adapting to age In Aerospatiale, the Ergonomics Department discovered that the design of work was based on the concept of unchanging human abilities. On this basis, ergonomie questions were integrated into planning and design from an earl/ stage and training programmes were designed for engineers and designers to develop their understanding of how workers function. These programmes aimed at assisting participants to understand the effects of ageing on the functioning capacity, the cognitive activities and certain types of behaviour of workers in the work situation and to use this knowledge in designing new work situations, especially in the area of work organisation. They also aimed at making that knowledge work in a practical sense by incorporating it into project design in such areas as work space, industrial equipment, work organisation and operator training. meet the costs of social and community services for the elderly, possibly diverting monies from investment in education and necessary skills training for young people. Many Member States have, in recent years, had difficulties providing work for young people entering the labour market - the subsequent rise in unemployment, now affecting older workers in greater numbers in the past decade, has added to the already serious dependency ratio in the Member States (taking the dependency ratio to be those not in paid work, and either too young or too old to work, as a proportion of those in paid employment). Already, in 1990 for every 10 people in paid employment within the EC, there were another 15 people not working. Any short-fall in the supply of labour should, however, result in the greater participation of women, a reduction in unemployment and further migration from the neighbouring regions of Central and Eastern Europe and North Africa. The growth in these labour forces is predicted to be greater than the growth in employment in the foreseeable future. Against this backdrop, the Foundation, in conjunction with ANACT, held a European Colloquium, in Paris (June, 1991)**. It examined changes in the age structure of employees in a number of sectors and enterprises, the responses of management through human resource policies and the impact these changes Age no hindrance Bayer, the German chemical company, has initiated training programmes to update the skills and qualifications of employees, whatever their age. This company found that older workers can perform as well or even better than younger workers and that they tend to be more stable in their behaviour because of their experience. While it was found that older workers took longer to adapt to the introduction of new technologies, once they did so their performance was not significantly different. Indeed, they were found to be best suited to some tasks requiring experience and a degree of specialisation. Paris Proposals: A number of proposals emerged at the Paris Colloquium in June 1991. Firstly, that more information is needed for firms on the advantages of continuing to employ older employees, on the physical and psychological process of ageing and the way working conditions may interact with this process. Secondly, that there is a growing mismatch between the characteristics of workers and their jobs with implications not only for their health and safety but also for the economic efficiency of the firm. Thus, there is a need to adapt jobs to suit the characteristics of ageing workers and to carry out preventive actions on working conditions so as to avoid a deterioration in workers' health. In certain situations where work constraints are strict, when high speeds are expected, painful postures are part of the work routine or where work is undertaken in extreme temperatures, employees may find work under such conditions difficult from the age of thirty onwards. Thirdly, there is a need to adopt training policies which are appropriate to the older worker, while there is also a need for greater flexibility at work, making it possible to develop the abilities of ageing workers and increase their mobility.

        "Delegates (above and below) at Conference 'Public policies to support family care for dependent older people\" held in Copenhagen, fune 3/4, 1993- might have on the organisation of work. It was found that workplace policies tended towards the exclusion of older workers rather than the adjustment of work organisation to suit their changing circumstances. One consequence being not only the loss of competence and a reservoir of \"experience-based knowledge'', but also demotivating those remaining at work in the enterprise. Several case studies were outlined at the Paris gathering of innovative enterprises which are already taking action to adjust to the changing demography of the workforce. (Seepanels) It was agreed that a consensus is emerging on the importance of setting up an in-company system of information which would make it possible to anticipate future problems linked to the ageing of the workforce. Clearly, the stage is prepared for change in our approach to older people within lhe workforce.

Nine-month Visit One of the Foundation's Research Managers, Robert Anderson, has spent much of the period from October 1992 to June 1993 as visiting Research Professor at the University of Maryland, Centre on Ageing, designated National Eldercare Institute on Employment and Voluntarism by the United States Administration on Ageing. He has been working closely with Institute staff and in collaboration with officials and organisations in Washington DC to document US company and public sector initiatives for older workers. Heis preparing a number of papers on age discrimination legislation, elder care and employment, and training initiatives for older workers. On his return, he will contribute both to the planning of a European Conference on Older Workers to be organised by the Foundation in November 1993 and to further work by the Foundation on older workers and the ageing workforce.

        "The broad objectives of the Year are to: help to implement the social dimension of the internal market; increase public awareness of the challenges resulting from the ageing of the population; promote reflection and discussion on the types of change required in order to deal with current demographic developments; prepare the general public for the implementation of these changes. A Note from the Director S teadily working as a catalyst for change, the knowledge gathered by the Foundation's research is designed to be brought together in different ways to help practitioners and policy makers work intelligently towards the improvement of living and working conditions. Thus the Foundation has already predicted the shifting of the European spotlight from the European Year for Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work to the European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations by featuring both themes strongly in its work programme. For the current European Year we will look to disseminating widely the results of our research into different aspects of the situation of the elderly. In this Newsletter we outline some of the Foundation's studies on this topic. Special attention has been given to problems which can arise, for enterprise and individual, as firms adopt policies to reduce their labour forces and introduce early retirement schemes. However, our studies have identified a number of new approaches to the employment of older workers, and ways by which firms have adapted working methods and training to suit their skills and experiences. Other work has investigated the experiences of family carers of the more dependent older population. The Foundation has sought to identify how different public policies and services are helping such carers in their task. It has also begun to look at initiatives in the workplace to support workers who also provide care for older family members. There is still much to be learnt if we are to understand the wide implications of our ageing population for all aspects _ c \"} of Community life. \u00bf _ _ Lu ^f^\\ ; A year to learn... European Year of Older People and Solidarity Between Generations EUROPEAN YEAR OF OLDER PEOPLE ANO SOLIDARITY BETWEEN GENERATIONS 1993 T he designation by the Council of Ministers of 1993 as \"European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations\" marks the conclusion of the Community's three year programme of action in favour of older people. The year is intended to make all citizens aware of developments taking place as a result of the ageing population, and the European Commission plans to set up a network of pilot projects, initiate information activities and competitions, and to have information campaigns and publications focusing on the concerns and hopes of the elderly. Certain issues have been set aside for attention which, when resolved, should ensure that older people's expectations are not dashed: making it easier for older people to live independent lives, coping with health problems in old age, appreciating the positive contributions of older people to society, promoting active participation by older people in society and solidarity between generations, and, finally, improving dialogue and understanding in the Community in order to cope better with the challenges of ageing. HASTE Grows Rapidly HASTE, the Foundation's new electronic European database on health and safety, is attracting considerable attention beyond the Community. Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Norway and Sweden have all recently expressed a strong interest in being included in the database. FIASTE ('Health and Safety in Europe') already includes information on 110 health and safety monitoring systems within the EC. With the inclusion of the further five participants, this number of systems will be almost doubled. The data gathering in the various countries is already well underway, running concurrently with the updating of the information already in the existing prototype of the database (the 12 EC countries). A summary of this information was published by the Foundation in 1992 under the title, 'Catalogue of Systems for the Monitoring of Working Conditions Relating to Health and Safety'. (ISBN 92-826-4312-3) With the completion of the updating task and the inclusion of Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Norway and Sweden, a series of new publications is planned on the subject. Although HASTE is currently only available for internal use, it is expected to be on line by mid-1994. Research Managers responsible for the project are Henrik Litske, Pascal Paoli and Barbara Schmidt. ",
        "An Open Forum \u2022 Continued from page 1 Among recent groups to visit the Foundation were Irish members of the European Parliament's group of the European Democratic Alliance and a team of senior officials from a variety of Directorate- Generals of the Commission. Discussions ranged over the content of the Foundation's programme and initiatives which might be taken to extend liaison and communication between the Foundation and other Community institutions. One such visitor was Mrs Schridar, Administrative Head of the All Bengal Women's Union, who visited Ireland as part of a study tour funded by COMMACT/ Commonwealth Relations Trust Travelling Bursary. The Union is a voluntary sector organisation which assists over 500 disadvantaged women and children in Calcutta with shelter, education, training and employment. The aim of her tour was to study women's development programmes and project management methods in order to be able to 1993 has already proved a busy year for the Foundation with 55 visits recorded in the first six months improve the administration and development of her own organisation. The Foundation helped to arrange visits to agencies working with women and young people in Dublin, such as the Combat Poverty Agency, Focus Point, Aontas and Parent Alone Resource Centre. On 18 April, Mrs Schridar met for discussion with Wendy O'Conghaile, the Foundation's Research Manager responsible for programmes on social cohesion and equal opportunities. She was especially interested in the results of the Foundation's work on the role of local community groups in disadvantaged urban areas, which highlighted the important role of women in the creation and development of local citizen action. (See Neivsletter 35). A more recent guest, in July, was Mr Sven- Runo Bergqvist, Managing Director of the prestigious Swedish Foundation of Occupational Health and Safety ('Previa'). He met Henrik Litske, one of the Foundation's Research Managers, responsible for the promotion of safety and health. The focus of their discussion included further co-operation in the future. L T he closer the Community moves to social and economic unity, the more important becomes the task of ensuring that vulnerable groups within society do not get excluded or disadvantaged. Since 1985, the Foundation has placed increasing emphasis on the needs of vulnerable groups, while a series of projects have dealt specifically with ageing and older people. For example, in 1985 a study was published which assessed the impact of occupation, income, health, mobility, housing and family circumstances on individuals' experiences of retirement. Just two years on, the Foundation published 'Meeting the Needs of the Elderly', a more extensive analysis of the situation of older people in the Community. Although the proportion of those aged 80 and over is rising in all European countries, as shown in this survey (carried out in 10 Member States), the elderly are not an homogeneous group of people, the report stressed. While some need daily care and support, others need more opportunities to live active lives. Whichever end of the scale our older citizens lie, it is clear that the \"graying\" of Europe and the projected needs of older people will put increasing pressure on a wide range of services and resources. Specific attention has been paid in broader research projects on living conditions in urban areas, on the provision of information about urban services, and to trends and initiatives affecting older people. More recently, within an on-going research programme into consumer-oriented action in the Community's public services, Fighting for the vulnerable the Foundation has examined new developments, which can often be particularly significant for the elderly. The importance of ageing in the population, both in the workplace and the broader community, is underlined in the Foundation's new Four-Year Programme for 1993-1996. To date, it is participating in a network of research organisations which is examining age discrimination in the labour market, further company initiatives to support workers who are carers of older relatives and, at enterprise level, employment strategies for older workers. During the European Year of Older People and Solidarity Between Generations (1993), the Foundation will focus on the results of its recent research into care and support of older people and, in particular, on the problems of those who provide this support - the families, including the difficulties facing employed workers who have care responsibilities for older relatives. It commissioned a review of initiatives taken by enterprises to support workers who are also family carers. Employers and unions in the Member States were interviewed and a number of case studies carried out as part of this review. A report based on the results, \"Eldercare and Employment\" is due out this year, as is a casebook analysing initiatives to support family carers and a volume dedicated to recording the experiences of carers in their own words, based upon inteiviews from the studies in the Member States. ",
        "Supporting t he Carers S ome of the Foundation's most recent research into the situation of older people in the European Community has focussed on the plight of those who provide most of the care to dependent older people - their families, especially spouses and daughters. Such work has built steadily on the extensive research project which culminated in the publication, 'Meeting the Needs of the Elderly' in 1987*. The Foundation's studies have sought to systematically document the needs and experiences of family carers, and to assess the impact of caring on daily life in all Member States except Luxembourg. In particular, these national studies examine policy developments and initiatives to assist family carers, Attention Social Partners: The Foundation's studies of family care have many important implications for social partners. These are most pronounced in relation to the employment consequences of being a carer. It is estimated that among employed women in Ireland, for example, 10-15% give up work to become a main carer. Many others need to restructure their patterns of work, while those remaining in work may suffer stress-related problems, impossible time pressures, absenteeism and decreased performance. For other carers, their work may offer an anchor in the stormy, often distressing life of a carer. A first review of this issue was undertaken as an additional part of the Foundation's work and is being published 'Eldercare and Employment: Workplace Policies and Initiatives to Support Workers who are Cares'. The needs of carers: Studies point to a clear set of carers' needs, similar despite the range of different circumstances. \u2022 Recognition and acknowledgement that they are doing a difficult job, to be asked how they feel, what their needs and preferences are, on an on going basis. \u2022 A genuine break from the tasks and responsibilities of caring. \u2022 Information: the majority of carers appear ill-informed about available services. Firstly, a need for recognition by carers. with a view to identifying what can be done to inprove the quality of life for the carers, as well as the cared-for. While all Member States emphasise the maintenance of older people at home and in the community for as long as possible, the nature and extent of supportive services offered vary significantly. How big an issue is this? Some facts and figures speak eloquently: In Germany, 80% of older people needing care at home are looked after by family members; one third of these carers also of pensionable age. In Spain, the figure is higher still with relatives providing most of the care in 90% of cases when the older person is ill; even among older people living alone, 60% are supported by relatives. And in the United Kingdom (UK), the number of severely disabled people aged 80-years and over living in private households, mainly with family, is two- thirds higher than the number living in hospitals, residential or nursing homes. The majority of family carers are women, many themselves elderly. The proportion varies from state to state but, in general, two-thirds to three- ^ ",
        "quarters are wives, daughters or daughters-in-law. Where men are the main carers, they are usually husbands. A general picture of the situation is provided in the main multi-national report on the Foundation's work: 'Family Care of Dependent Older People in the European Community'. As well as statistical data and existing studies, the report draw on material from interviews with carers. These illustrate some of the physical, emotional, social and financial costs to carers. The former is often well managed, but the emotional distress caused by changes in relationships, social isolation and the limitations caused by the older relative's dependency, is often hard to bear - despite the fact that it is in fact borne over many years. Most carers manage with little support from formal services, with the exception of Denmark. The experience of caring, its satisfactions and distress, is vividly described in 'Carers Talking: Interviews with Family Carers of Older Dependent People in the European Community'. BREAKING NEW GROUND As the needs of carers appear on the policy agendas of several countries, including Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and France, so a range of initiatives have emerged explicitly for the support of family carers. They take the form of respite breaks, the development of advocacy organisations (Belgium, Ireland and the UK), training for informal carers (the Netherlands and Germany), development of support groups and improved social security and financial support. Within and beyond the EC, greater interest is being taken in stich initiatives, despite the survival of the traditional, collectivist family in southern Europe, with almost no programmes or polices to support family carers. Recognising the need for It's Happening Now! Recent initiatives to support carers include: Belgium: A social security cash benefit can now be paid under certain conditions to people receiving care at home. Germany: The pension insurance reform law gives credit under specific conditions for pension insurance contributions during the period of care. This measure is designed to provide an incentive for voluntary care and to safeguard, in particular, the position of women in the pension system. UK & Ireland: Income support is paid to carers providing care above a certain level. examples of initiatives benefiting carers, the Foundation is bringing out 'Family Care of the Elderly: Casebook of Initiatives'. It will cover various developments in respite care, home services, day centres, income support, training and support groups, with attention to their effectiveness. Such initiatives are largely driven by the wish to contain costs and to maintain levels of family support, against other pulls in the labour market, changing family size and relationships. So too, the issues of employment and social protection for family carers have begun to raise their heads in international bodies such as the International Labour Office and the Council of Europe. As well as the potential contribution of European-wide efforts to strengthen research, training and exchange of information, these issues too are demanding and worthy of attention at EC level. * Meeting the needs of the elderly (ISBN 92-825-7819-4) also available in DE, FR, IT) > > >EURO-BRIEF> > > LEGISLATION \u25a1 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2952/92, of 30 December 1992, amending Regulation (EEC) No 594/91 in order to speed up the phasing out of substances that deplete the ozone layer.

For example, 48% of Europeans spend an average of seven hours and 20 minutes at work each weekday - yet at the time of the survey, in Central European countries 57% of the population was working compared with Greece (36%), Spain (38%) and Ireland (39%). What constitutes a working day differs quite significantly. The British claim to work six hours 25 minutes daily on average, while the Portuguese work nearly two hours longer. The British show the greatest interest in television, with 91% watching, on average, more than four hours daily. Alternatively, the Swiss watch just two and a half hours. Radio has the most loyal listenership in Sweden, with Swedes tuning in for five and a half hours per clay, compared with only 35% of Italians listening for two hours daily. As for the printed media, only 15% of the Portuguese and Greeks retici a newspaper every day in stark contrast with 85% of the Finns. Possibly the most revealing statistics are those concerning life satisfaction \u2014 measured by consideration of all the responses. 95% of the Danes, Dutch and Finns are satisfied, while Central European countries reside at the bottom of this scale \u2014 only 72% of Czechs, 65% of Polish and 58% of Hungarians say they are satisfied with their lives. In conjunction with the Foundation's 'Time Budget' studies, the Euro Time survey allows for an interesting historical examination of trends in time use for certain activities. It complements efforts at European Community level, where the Statistical Office (EUROSTAT) is moving towards an EC-wide time- budget survey in conjunction with the statistical offices of the Member States and with methodological advice from the Foundation. It is proposed that this survey will be carried out in the second half of the 1990s. Further reading: The Furo Time Survey, available from IP Groupe. 31. rue de Colisee, 75008 Paris, France.
