        "C hildren are always the first and most vulnerable victims of any conflict. The use of child soldiers is one of the most horrific trends in war. Today an estimated 300,000 children are fighting in more than 30 countries. Their plight is quickly rising to the top of the international political agenda, but we still face a cruel paradox. The adverse effects of conflicts on children and the serious consequences of their active involvement in wars are well documented. Indeed, there is a broad international consensus that the rights of the child must be respected. Despite this, the unacceptable reality is that children are increasingly targets of and participants in armed conflict. We do not need more analyses and academic exercises. What the world needs today are hard facts and practical solutions - backed by genuine political will and the required international financial and moral support. We need strengthened enforcement mechanisms and concrete programmes to prevent the occurrence of conditions that are conducive to the abuse of children. Making children a priority in humanitarian assistance is obviously important but we have to recognise that we are still only treating the symptoms when we do this. Finding a cure is more complex. We need, above all, to develop effective ways of reducing the potential for armed conflict. This is an international responsibility that involves poverty alleviation, promoting sustainable development and reducing disparities within and among communities. To this end, the EU is committed to a balanced, poverty-oriented development policy and a stronger focus on the transition from crisis situations to development. Ours is an urgent task. For each day that passes without a commitment to finding new solutions, children continue to have their rights violated and their futures destroyed.

ECHO funds relief to victims of both natural disasters and man \u2013 made crises outside the EU. Aid is channelled impartially, straight to victims, regardless of race, religion and polit- ical beliefs. ECHO has more than 170 partners \u2013 organisations which have signed a Framework Partnership Contract with the Commission. Its partners are the specialist agencies of the United Nations, the Red Cross family, other international organisations and non-governmental organisations. ECHO is one of the biggest sources of humanitarian aid in the world. In 2000 it provided \u20ac 492 million in funding (not including aid that the EU\u2019s 15 Member States gave separate- ly). ECHO support went to projects in more than 60 countries. The funds are spent on goods and services such as food, clothing, shelter, medical provisions, water supplies, sanitation, emergency repairs and mine-clearing. ECHO also funds disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation projects in regions prone to natural catastrophes. EU Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) 200 rue de la Loi, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium. Tel.

Examples of ECHO-funded operations include: \u2022 A project by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) providing psychosocial support to war-affected children in Sierra Leone. \u2022 A project by Enfants du Monde providing emergency psychological assistance to traumatised Palestinian children living in the West Bank and Gaza. At a policy level, ECHO has been active in the conceptual development of tools for assisting and protecting children in conflict. In the area of child soldiers, it is currently funding two research activities: \u2022 The Save the Children (UK) project on \u201cChild Soldiers and Children Associated with the Fighting Forces: Guidelines for Best Practice\u201d, which aims at producing a manual for people working with child soldiers, drawing on the wider experience of the aid community. \u2022 The \"Multidisciplinary study on the problem of child soldiers in Africa\" by the Belgian Red Cross, which seeks to elaborate durable, stable, institutional and operational intervention strategies for the Red Cross Movement. ECHO is also involved in a new policy initiative, in cooperation with UNICEF, to improve the availability of data on children affected by armed conflict. The aim is to establish the kind of data that needs to be collected, as well as an adequate methodology and format for collecting the data, thereby allowing systematisation and tracking of information. Finally, ECHO has stepped up its efforts in the field of advocacy for children affected by armed conflict. This is reflected in a range of actions including the production of brochures, the treatment of the issue in regular ECHO publications and the funding of photographic exhibitions.

        "THE COMMITMENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION Support for the most vulnerable C hildren as young as seven or eight \u2013 girls as well as boys \u2013 are tak- ing part in hostilities around the world. They are often abducted from schools, refugee camps or their homes. The world\u2019s most vul- nerable are killed, maimed, sexually abused, recruited into armed forces and denied life-saving humanitarian assistance. The widespread use of child soldiers is a tragedy, and the European Commission is strongly committed to relieving the plight of these children. Assistance and protection of children in the midst of armed conflict is chan- nelled through a number of Commission programmes including the European Initiative for Human Rights and Democracy. The promotion of children\u2019s rights is one of the priorities for funding in 2001. Moreover, the Commission considers that assistance and protection of vulnerable children should be seen in the wider context of poverty eradica- tion, which is at the heart of EC development cooperation. Children are, therefore, an important focal group of the Community\u2019s external aid activi- ties, in particular in sectoral social policies such as education and health. In addition to its efforts in the fields of human rights and development cooperation, the Commission has also made children a cross-cutting priori- ty for humanitarian assistance. This commitment is reflected in concrete projects, in advocacy work inside the EU, and in research aimed at improv- ing the international humanitarian response. A recent study commissioned by the Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) and carried out by Save the Children UK, confirms that poverty drives children into armed groups. According to the study, \"The Democratic Republic of Congo and Colombia provide examples of the social and economic 'push factors' that fuse with the 'pull' of recruitment by armed groups. Hunger, domestic violence, lack of access to education and no prospects for the future combine for many boys and girls to make joining fighting forces a simple matter of survival.\" Curbing child soldiering is an urgent priority. Children are impressionable and easily manipulated into becoming unquestioning, ruthless fighting machines. Child soldiers committed some of the worst atrocities in Sierra Leone. Demilitarisation, demobilisation and reintegration programmes are desperately needed. The Commission strongly supports an action-oriented agenda, and in the field, ECHO pays special attention to protecting and assisting children. Building on standards, obligations and principles spelled out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, specific projects on humanitarian assistance for conflict-affected children are being supported.This is demon- strated by the funding of psychosocial treatment of child soldiers (Sierra Leone, Sudan, Kosovo and Macedonia ) , of schools in emergency camps for displaced persons (in West Timor, DRC, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro) and of health care programmes for war-affected children (Sudan). Since the beginning of 2000, ECHO has spent more than \u20ac 40 million on projects to protect and assist children worldwide.These efforts form an integral Turning their backs on war? Sudan, March 2001 AT A GLANCE Reliable data on children affected by armed conflict is hard to obtain. However, the following estimates, published in recent years, give some indication of the scale of the problem: \u2022 there are 300,000 combatants in 40 countries under the age of 18 \u2022 2 million children were killed in conflicts during the 1990s \u2022 1 million were orphaned during the same period \u2022 more than 6 million were seriously injured or permanently disabled \u2022 10 million suffered serious psychological trauma \u2022 more than 20 million were displaced by war within and outside their countries \u2022 approximately 800 children are killed or maimed by landmines every month (Sources: Global Report on Child Soldiers 2001, by the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, The Machel Review 1996-2000) A study commissioned by ECHO and coordinated by Save the Children UK shows \u201ca gap between international law and reality on the ground\u201d and notes that law is powerless against other factors that lead to recruitment. Information was collected in Colombia, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Mozambique. Consultation with specialists revealed a very limited understanding of the impact of assistance and approaches to work with child soldiers. The transition from army to community is critical \u2013 families and commu- nities must be fully prepared or reintegration will fail. Long-term strategies are needed including safe refuge, medical care, schooling, vocational skills and intensive psychosocial counselling. Increased understanding, knowledge and improvement in our capacity to respond to the needs of these most abused and brutalised children are urgent priorities, the study reports. More understanding is also needed about how knowledge of their rights helps strengthen children and local communities and what factors determine vulnerability to recruitment. The July 2000 study concludes with a two-day conference during the Belgian Presidency, to be held following the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children in New York in the autumn of 2001. Participants will address raising awareness among NGOs and the media as well as promot- ing support for work with child soldiers.The remaining knowledge gaps will be debated: \u2022 Making contact with armed groups and getting children released. \u2022 How to make the demobilisation process more inclusive. \u2022 How better to support integration into the community. \u2022 How better to address the needs of girls, and of children with a disability. SAVE THE CHILDREN Study reveals need for long-term strategy in rehabilitating former child soldiers \u00a9 : U N I C E F / S U D A N / S t e v i e M a n part of the promotion and protection of human rights within humanitarian operations as well as in linking relief, rehabilitation and development. \u201cIt is time to focus on solutions, not on the problems we may encounter\u201d, says Commissioner Poul Nielson. \u201cThe Commission is committed to work- ing with the international community to improve the long-term protection of war-affected children, particularly child soldiers. A serious development pol- icy must take into account the children caught up in today\u2019s conflicts... they are the foundation upon which the future of their countries will be built.\u201d ASSISTANCE TO CHILD SOLDIERS European support for the Optional Protocol T he European institutions share a commitment to combat the wide- spread use of child soldiers, which is considered an unacceptable scourge. Strong support has been given to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, which was formally adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 May 2000. The Optional Protocol includes provisions requiring states to raise the minimum age for conscription to 18 and to \u201ctake all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities\u201d. It also sets out conditions on vol- untary recruitment. The European Parliament has taken several initiatives in support of children\u2019s rights, both through resolutions and with budget commit- ments. For example, it adopted a resolution on child soldiers in 1998, expressing its support for the Optional Protocol which was being nego- tiated at the time in the UN. At the 57 th session of the UN Commission of Human Rights this year, EU Member States reiterated their support for the Optional Protocol. During the last year, 80 countries have signed the protocol, which is expected to come into force by the end of 2001. In addition, ongoing EU dialogue with third coun- tries offers a mechanism for emphasising the importance of support for the Optional Protocol \u2013 and indeed for children\u2019s rights in general.
