        "7 PREFACE The main objective of this report is providing the results that have been obtained in the course of this project. This report contains the results from the activities under Pillar 1: a review of mechanisms for the transfer of eco-innovation and knowledge to developing countries, from Pillar 2: the case studies on selected environmental technologies in developing countries, and from Pillar 3: the international workshop. The report starts with indicating the policy context, and the objectives of this project. In comparison with the Request for Services, the Commission asked to focus more specific on developing countries and to non-energy and non-climate environmental technologies. However, insofar as relevant, lessons, examples, and literature from energy and climate technologies have been included. Section two provides a literature review focussing on various environmental technology transfer aspects. Section three provides a conceptual framework for analysis and describes our vision on environmental technology transition with particular emphasis on transition towards sustainability and implications for the case study work. Section four contains the results from the assessment of the design and effectiveness of existing environmental technology transfer instruments that have been identified. Section five contains the reporting of ten selected case studies on environmental technology transfer in developing countries. The case studies are instrumental in providing in-depth insight in the real life process of environmental technology transfer to developing countries, and particularly in the so-called soft regime and niche conditions that are crucial for a successful outcome. Section six provides an overview of the main lessons learned and suggestions for policy making. The valuable results of this study were not possible without the voluntary participation of many interviewees and workshop attendants.

        "18 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Policy context 1.1.1 EU policy and practice The EU has been on the forefront for environment and climate protection, both in terms of policy and practice. The EU2020 growth strategy, which aims at a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, has formulated five ambitious objectives to be reached by 2020 in the area of employment, innovation, education, social inclusion and climate/energy. The EU2020 growth strategy is underpinned by seven flagship initiatives, two of which focus on sustainable growth: the flagship initiatives of a resource efficient Europe and an industrial policy for the globalisation era. Another important flagship initiative is the Innovation Union which aims at improving Europe\u2019s R&D conditions and improving the translation from research into innovation and further into job and growth creation. Additionally other important policy initiatives have also been taken, such as the EU Action against climate change and the sustainable industrial production and consumption policy. The EU companies that provide environmental goods and services are often leaders, both in terms of providing high value added environmental technology solutions and in terms of market. For some segments, such as water supply, renewable energy and recycling service the coverage on the global market ranges from 30% to 50% 1 . One of the important events was the Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development in June 2012, 20 years after the first \u2018Earth Summit\u2019, in Rio de Janeiro. It is hoped that the Rio+20 Conference would mark the start of a profound world-wide transition towards a green economy and the launch of international sustainable development governance. The European Commission is determined to make the Rio+20 a success and took various initiatives for an adequate preparation 2 . One of the proposed action lines is the development of a set of specific actions at international, national and regional level, called the \u201cGreen Economy Roadmap\u201d. A toolbox of policy approaches and best practice examples is also envisaged. After the Conference, Commissioner Janez Potocnik indicated that although the European Union and its Member States had hoped for a more ambitious outcome, such as the definition of concrete time lines, they remained fully engaged in further work on defining and operationalizing the Sustainable Development Goals 3 . The Commissioner also stressed that the fact that the outcome document of the Conference acknowledged the important role of the green economy for achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication was an important step in the right direction. However the EU does not operate in isolation. The effectiveness of the EU environmental and climate policies is co-determined by the actions in other parts of the world. And also EU policy actions and the behaviour of consumers and producers affect the rest of the world as well, e.g. in terms of climate and resource use. Of particular importance are the fast growing economies, i.e. the BRIICS and the developing countries. The first group is important because of the large 1 Bilsen, V. et al.

        "19 potential in terms of decoupling economic growth and environmental/climate pressure and consequently the global environmental impact. The second group is important because environmental technologies help improve living conditions and help these countries move towards a sustainable growth path. Furthermore, severely impacted areas in terms of e.g. environmental pollution, bio-diversity loss, and deforestation are situated in developing countries, often as a consequence of catching up in wealth creation, but in a non-sustainable manner. Therefore the implementation and transfer of environmental technologies in these countries is expected to have an important impact both locally and globally. The EU has been a world leader in the support of eco-innovations. Its Energy-Climate package sets the target of reducing GHG emissions by at least 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. Furthermore, to achieve this target, it is believed that the EU will need to support mitigation outside its own frontiers in addition to domestic action to reduce its own emissions. To this end, the EU has notably developed the largest company-level scheme for trading in carbon dioxide emissions. The growing price of carbon on EU carbon market has encouraged businesses to consider new opportunities, driving Europe towards technological leadership. A key aspect of the EU scheme is that it allows companies to use credits from Kyoto\u2019s project-based mechanisms, joint implementation (JI) and the clean development mechanism (CDM), to help them comply with their obligations under the scheme. Some of the EU\u2019s sectoral programmes place emphasis on cooperation as a way to resolve environmental issues and develop clean technology worldwide. The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) (2007-2013) of the European Union places emphasis on international research cooperation which is increasingly seen as being at the centre of community policies. The EU approach to international cooperation addresses the entire spectrum of FP7 activities and includes strategic activities underpinning the building of a European Research Area open to the world that will require a policy dialogue with major regions of the world and true partnership with those countries with which the Commission on behalf of the Community has signed an S&T Cooperation agreement. 1.1.2 The global dimension The EU has been recognized as a leading promoter of international action in environment and climate. It is an active participant in the development and implementation of multilateral environmental agreements, negotiations and processes, especially within the UN framework. For instance, the agreements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including the Bali Action Plan emphasize the use of finance, technology, and capacity building as tools to address climate change. Enabling the transfer and spread of technology is, therefore, central to the global effort to combat climate change and a means to help developing countries address both climate change and energy security. The 16th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Cancun, Mexico in December 2010 reached an agreement to establish a global Technology Mechanism to facilitate the implementation of actions to achieve technology development and transfer based on national circumstances and priorities. The Parties agreed to create a Technology Executive Committee and a Climate Technology Centre and Network under this mechanism 4 . Article 4.5 of the UNFCCC states that developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II \u201cshall take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention.\u201d 5 The UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol include provisions for establishing and funding project activities that are expected to allow technology transfer, although participation in these are 4 See Asian Development Bank document on Climate technology Centres 5 UNFCCC, 1992 - http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1349.php ",
        "20 mostly voluntary. Governments, multilateral organizations and private firms have established nearly 6 billion US$ in carbon funds for carbon-reduction projects, mainly through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). In rapidly developing countries, the CDM is currently the principal economic incentive to de-carbonize new investments. In 2009 the Major Economies Forum (MEF) Leaders announced a Global Partnership to spur development and deployment of low-carbon and climate-friendly technologies and asked their respective ministers to develop an initial set of deliverables prior to the Copenhagen climate negotiations in December 2009. These included an analysis entitled Global Gaps in Clean Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration (GCERD), prepared by the International Energy Agency (IEA) for the MEF Global Partnership, and a suite of ten Technology Action Plans (TAPs), prepared by MEF countries, focused on advanced vehicles; bio-energy; carbon capture, use, and storage; buildings sector energy efficiency, industrial sector energy efficiency; high-efficiency, low emissions coal; marine energy; smart grids; solar energy; and wind energy. The GCERD establishes a new global baseline for current funding for research, development and demonstration (RD&D) for each of the technology categories covered by the TAPs. It also specifies research priorities and assesses gaps in funding between today's level of support and the substantially higher levels of sustained support that will be needed to achieve shared climate goals to 2050. This information will inform MEF countries as they scale up clean energy innovation investment consistent with their stated intention to at least double clean energy innovation funding by 2015 6 . 1.1.3 The Rio 20 + Conference outcome The final outcome document 7 of the Rio+20 Conference \u201cThe Future We Want\u201d contains several indications on technology transfer as one of the means for reaching sustainable development and eradicating poverty 8 . Paragraph 78 of section III \u201cGreen economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication\u201c indicates that \u201c We emphasize the importance of technology transfer to developing countries and recall the provisions on technology transfer, finance, access to information, and intellectual property rights as agreed in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, in particular its call to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, access to and the development, transfer and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies and corresponding know-how, in particular to developing countries, on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed. \u201d In section V \u201cFramework for action and follow-up\u201d, technology transfer is explicitly mentioned as a means in the areas of water and sanitation, oceans and seas, disaster risk reduction and climate change. In other areas the transfer is not particularly mentioned, yet access to technology, R&D and technology development are earmarked as important means, i.e. food security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture, sustainable energy, chemicals and waste, gender equality and empowerment of women. The importance of technology is also highlighted in section VI on \u201cMeans of implementation\u201d. After mentioning finance (section A), section B explicitly focusses on technology. Paragraph 269 states that \u201c We emphasize the importance of technology transfer to developing countries and recall the provisions on technology transfer, finance, access to information and intellectual property rights as agreed in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, in particular its call to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, access to and the development, transfer and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies and corresponding know-how, in particular to 6 See Major Economies Forum, 2009.

We also take note of the further evolution of discussions and agreements on these issues since the adoption of the Plan of Implementation \u201d 1.1.4 Where the current project fits in The current project builds on the co-operation between the European Commission and the OECD. In the context of the Environmental Technology Action Plan (ETAP), the European Commission supported the Global Forum on Environment, which was organised by the OECD the 4 th and 5 th of November 2009. Among others, the Forum concluded that \u201cthe technology transfer to the developing countries is key but could be substantially improved 9 \u201d. The challenge here seems to lie on the ability of the (eco-)industries and research labs in the developed countries to develop products, processes and technologies that can be adapted to the needs and circumstances of the developing countries. However additional challenges exist. According to Ockwell, D. et al. (2010), some key barriers of developing countries with respect to access to eco-innovations include: \uf0b7 Lack of international policy focus on indigenous eco-innovation capabilities: policies have often focused on the need for developing countries to only \u2018consume\u2019 eco-innovations by providing access to these countries to the use of eco-innovation. However, the development of knowledge-absorbing capabilities in developing countries is more important. It is only through these \u2018absorptive\u2019 capabilities that countries can benefit most from the use of eco-innovations both for the diffusion of eco-innovations in their markets and through adapting them to the needs of their markets and thus contributing to the development/adaptation of eco-innovations locally. \uf0b7 Characteristics of eco-innovation: eco-innovations are often not ready-to-market and therefore need the take-up of risk on the side of the investor. In developing countries this may give raise to difficulties due to lack of available venture capital, lack of knowledge of operation (particularly in new geographical and cultural contexts) and higher incremental costs. \uf0b7 Incremental costs and market failures: apart from the higher costs related to the higher risks, incremental costs of eco-innovations are also higher as markets do not necessarily capture the full benefits from environmental innovations. \uf0b7 Intellectual property: although intellectual property protection is needed in order to allow investment in eco-innovations, it is however not sufficient to lead to the investment in eco-innovations in developing countries. For such innovations, tacit knowledge which is often not patented is needed as well. Therefore, policy actions that take into account the specific needs of developing countries and that facilitate the diffusion of environmental technologies in the economies of these countries need to be taken. The following subsection provides more details on the specific objectives on this study. 1.2 Objectives of the study Given the policy background briefly sketched in the previous paragraphs, the current project aims to study the \u201cincentives for the development and diffusion of environmental technologies\u201d , (see RfS) with special emphasis put on the needs of developing countries. More specifically, the study intends to focus on the transfer of environmental technologies from developed to developing countries and the role that the governments of developed countries and the private sector play in this transfer. 9 OECD, 2009, \u201cSome of the things that have been heard at the OECD Global Forum on Environment on eco-innovation held on 4-5 November 2009 at the OECD Headquarters in Paris, France\u201d ",
        "22 Given this context, the objective of the project is to \u201c examine how national and international policy measures can be designed such as to accelerate the widespread adoption of appropriate environmental technologies in developing countries \u201d, (see RfS). In serving this main objective the following types of initiatives will be analysed: \uf0b7 initiatives in developing countries to help the uptake of environmental technologies, and how they can be scaled up; \uf0b7 initiatives of developed country governments to support the development and diffusion of environmental technologies that fit the needs of developing countries; and, \uf0b7 initiatives from the private sector, and how they can be stimulated and supported by governments, on both developed and developing economies. At the start of the project, it was decided to focus the project on non-energy related technologies such as resource efficiency, water and wastewater services. In terms of innovations the focus should be on those innovations that are of particular interest for developing countries and innovations that can be identified in existing data sets e.g. the CDM database. As far as country coverage is concerned, the focus should be on developing countries, where BRIICS can be included to the degree that they still can be considered as a developing country, e.g. rural India and rural China.

        "23 2 BACKGROUND & SCOPING: FINDINGS FROM THE LITERATURE 2.1 Introduction This section presents a number of important issues which were found in the literature dealing with environmental technology transfer to developing countries. A first and logic question one may ask is what can we learn from the eco-technology transfer within the EU and in particular to the New Member States. Evidently these are not developing countries, but given the more developed economic and institutional environment it is worth looking at what works. Evidence will be presented from a recent study for DG RTD on \u2018the role of science and technology for Catching-Up Economies\u2019. Subsequently the focus is on developing countries. The move from greentech to cleantech is an important aspect for environmental technology transfer to developing countries, as documented in section three. It is increasingly perceived that optimization within existing systems and production manners will not provide the results hoped for and that genuine/radical innovation will be needed. Given their relatively less advanced economies, developing countries have the possibility of developing their economy with new and radical environmental technologies at earlier stages of economic growth. This leads to the concept of leapfrogging in economic development with a huge potential for decoupling growth and environmental impact, as documented in section four. Section five presents an overview of the main barriers and success factors for environmental technology transfer to the developing countries. These range from technology specific aspects, such as the maturity of the technology, to institutional factors, such as technology promoting offices and platforms, to market conditions and the local industry\u2019s absorption capacity. Indeed, the framework conditions for environmental technology transfer clearly matter, as shown in Figure 1 in terms of type of technology and Figure 2 in terms of geography. Section six focuses on the very nature of particular environmental technologies such as solar PV, CSS, and water treatment services, and on their readiness for transferring to developing countries. The last section ends this scoping chapter with evidence based on field experience and literature on which environmental technologies do developing countries demand. ",

        "25 2.2 What can we learn from tech transfer to the New Member states \u2013 catching-up economies in the EU? 2.2.1 Role of STI for economic growth development Technology development is essential for economic growth and development not only for EU \u2018catching-up\u2019 economies, but also for developing countries that are striving to close the technology gap for example in the area of environmental technologies. The work carried out for the Rindicate (2008) study 10 , clearly illustrated that understanding science, technology and innovation for \u2018catching-up\u2019, requires that social and technological capabilities need to be taken into account when considering the potential of a particular country or region to develop. Secondly, catching-up is also an issue of how developing countries interaction with the frontier economies, hence the importance of networking and collaboration. The Rindicate study derived valuable conclusions on the role of STI for catching-up economies which can be transposed to a developing country setting: \uf0b7 Science and technology provides an important way to learn how to use existing knowledge as well as to develop new knowledge . This implies that in the underlying study on the success of technology transfer and knowledge diffusion, it will thus be important to pay attention to the STI capabilities of knowledge \u2018receiving\u2019 countries as they are a precondition for successful take-up. \uf0b7 Institutional diversity across the catching-up economies is vast . The analysis showed that Europe is not \u2018one economy\u2019. The same applies to developing countries, where institutional diversity (i.e. science and technology governance) is an important factor. The presence of institutional diversity also makes the use of \u2018best practice\u2019 norms unconvincing. \uf0b7 Catching-up economies should develop a strategic, horizontal approach to innovation policy . Since innovation does not rely only science and technology, countries should develop an innovation policy that includes vertical, horizontal and temporal coherence. Policy instruments should be aligned and mutually supportive of each other 11 . This is also a factor that needs to be taken into account when judging/explaining success of technology transfer. \uf0b7 Building an effective innovation policy is path-dependent. A common problem among all of the catching-up economies is that institutions generate routines, habits and customs. The design of ministries, agencies and policy mechanisms is one example of path dependency that makes it difficult to create an effective innovation policy. This also applies to many developing countries where indeed \u2018routine \u2018thinking often stands in the way of innovation. 2.2.2 International Technology Transfer (ITT) Technological development (also for developing countries with respect to environmental concerns and problems) involves not only internal R&D activity, including reverse engineering and copying, but also accessing existing knowledge through a variety different means. There are different channels of ITT, as presented in the overview below. 10 RINDICATE (2008), \u201cThe role of science and technology for Catching-Up Economies\u201d, study commissioned by the European Commission DG RTD in the context of the Rindicate framework contract, Brussels, DG-RTD-2005-M-02-01 11 OECD (2005).

        "26 Figure 3: Channels of international technology transfer Source: IDEA Consult (based on UNCTAD, 2004 12 ) Each mode of technology transfer is not exclusive; the process of taking advantage of a technological opportunity may involve several of these methods, and the sources need not be foreign. The relative importance of each method of technology transfer will depend on the foreign direct investment regulations and attitudes toward foreign ownership, the intellectual property regime, on the availability of technology in the mode, and how well firms in the economy make use of the modes 13 . Box 1: The role of absorptive capacity A minimum level of R&D is important for a firm\u2019s ability \u2018to identify, assimilate and exploit knowledge from the environment\u2019. This innovative capability has been coined as the firm\u2019s learning or \u2018absorptive capacity\u2019 14 , which is based on the level of prior. Absorptive capacity can also be seen as a set of organizational routines and strategic processes, by which firms acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge for the purposes of value creation 15 . Since most product and process innovations in developing countries require the ability to imitate existing technology, it is most important to recognize, assimilate and apply new knowledge external to the firm to attain commercial ends. Building an absorptive capacity requires a time-consuming and costly process of investing in R&D and education. 12 UNCTAD (2004), \u201cEncouraging International Technology Transfer\u201d, UNCTAD-ICTSD project on IPRs and Sustainable Development 13 Dahlman, C. and R.

        "27 Considerable controversy surrounds the effectiveness of each mode of technology transfer in closing the technology gap. Reddy and Zhao 16 emphasize that the opportunity to gain access to technology is context specific and depends on several factors including competition among supplier firms, its importance to the firm supplying the technology, the age of the transferred technology, and the nature of the transferred technology. There three principal channels of international R&D spill-overs and technology transfer are: \uf0b7 The first is a direct transfer of technology via international licensing agreements 17 though recently these provide a less important source, as the latest and most valuable technologies are not available on license. Intellectual property rights assigned to new knowledge and the absorptive capacity of firms in the host economy may influence whether technology transfer comes through licensing. While licensing has become an increasingly common way to access technology, the newest technology often requires non-exclusivity and carries certain restrictions on its use or inclusion in products. Nevertheless, even when there are no restrictions, local firms must also have the absorptive capacity to take advantage of the license. \uf0b7 The second source of technology transfer is foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI provides potentially one of the most important and the cheapest channel of direct technology transfer as well as of indirect knowledge spill-overs to host countries. FDI has a positive impact on economic growth and is dependent on the level of human capital in the host country 18 . \uf0b7 The third channel of technology transfer is through international trade . Trade flows can facilitate the transfer of technology through R&D spill-overs 19 . Teece (1977) gives an overview of difficulties of technology transfer projects, from the perspective of transmitting firms (that are located in developed economies). If a firm wants to transmit technological knowledge, the main issues are: distance and communication difficulties, language issues, difference in units of measurement, cultural and attitudinal differences and socio-economic differences. The cost of technology transfer further strongly depends on the type of technology that is being transferred. If it is possible to embody sophisticated technology in capital equipment that needs relatively little knowledge to run, then the transfer is cheap. However, most technology transfer requires some type of accumulation of skills besides the pure transfer of equipment (or capital) and this is often more difficult to obtain (Teece, 1977). 2.3 Environmental technologies: evolution from \u201cend of pipe\u201d solutions to \u201cCleantech\u201d solutions Sustainable development is defined by the Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development adopted in 1987 as \u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d. In spite of the ever growing interest in the concept of sustainable development since then, the radical changes in contemporary world societies that should result from that concept still fail to occur. This may be due to the inherent inertia of the systems concerned, or to the comforting idea that problems can be solved through superficial optimisation of products and processes rather than genuine change. 16 Reddy, M. and L.

        "28 2.3.1 Major drivers\u2026 In the 1980s there were about 4.5 billion people on planet Earth; in 2010 there are 7 billion (a 55 % increase in a one-generation time span); projections from the UN for 2050 range from 8 to 10.5 billion. At the same time, resource-intensive consumption patterns have emerged in developed countries, and now increasingly in developing countries. These evolutions significantly enhance the world\u2019s average consumption per capita, which can be expressed in GDP per capita: the 3 decades spanning from 1980 to 2010 showed a world average increase in GDP per capita of about 174%. 2.3.2 \u2026induce major pressures\u2026 More and more people aspiring more and more consumerism, have resulted in increasing and mutually reinforcing pressures on our finite planet: scarce resources are getting depleted, polluting emissions are changing our climate and basic environmental health conditions, biodiversity is declining. By a combination of ever increasing consumption levels in developed countries the human ecological footprint is exceeding the world\u2019s carrying capacity since the 1980s. In other words, the planet\u2019s resources are insufficient to produce what humanity consumes, to absorb its wastes, and to provide space for its infrastructure. Humanity\u2019s ecological footprint now exceeds the planet\u2019s regenerative capacity by about 30 percent. Continued growth in consumption in developed countries as well as resource-intensive development in the rest of the world would only exacerbate pressures on the planet\u2019s resources. 2.3.3 ...and destabilize key societal systems Energy production and distribution, transport and mobility, industrial activities, urban and rural planning are a number of societal spheres, or systems, in which the pressures clearly translate in observable and tangible impacts : high and instable fuel prices, growing traffic jams and congestion, increasing waste generation and disposal, extending deforestation, perceptible climate change effects, overcrowded cities,\u2026 And in spite of continuing optimism for \u2018growth\u2019 (increasing GDP and GDP per capita), a more or less standstill of people\u2019s general well-being is observed since the 1980s in developed countries, while most developing countries are still struggling to satisfy their peoples\u2019 basic needs, as expressed for instance in our inability to reach the Millennium Development Goals.

In response to this, the sense of urgency to abandon traditional approaches of production and consumption should no longer be questioned. Even engaging to address and solve a number of the occurring problems through end-of-pipe solutions is only dealing with the symptoms of a failing system. And although these efforts appear to be reassuringly effective in the short run, such remedial optimizations could be considered as \u2018solutions as usual\u2019, which only post-pone the advent of impacts and create an artificial optimism, but do not tackle the roots of the issues. In many cases, the negative effects of the considered activities/systems are slowed down but not stopped or reversed; the eventual system remains unsustainable in the long run. Such an optimization approach and hence the failure to significantly turn tides is rooted in the often partial, purely technology-oriented (\u2018technological fix\u2019) approach, based on a problem point of view. While \u2018greentech\u2019 or cleaning/remedial technologies represents end-of-pipe technologies, cleantech addresses the roots of ecological problems. Cleantech has a very wide scope. Genuinely clean technologies encompass not only renewable energy, and the \u2018classic\u2019 technologies of water- and soil sanitation, but also sustainable chemistry, renewable materials and products, integrated production processes, smart grids, electric vehicles, etc. In light of the preceding, genuine cleantech should be more than \u2018greentech\u2019. 2.4 Eco-innovations and the advantage of leapfrogging in developing countries The need to deploy environmental technologies could represent an opportunity for developing countries. Since many are in the early stages of development, they will need to construct a huge amount of infrastructure in the coming decades in any case. ",
        "30 In principle it should be possible to craft an approach that could at once supply local people with basic energy and other services, achieve development, climate and environmental goals, and perhaps even allow developing countries to leapfrog the fossil-based economies of the developed world to achieve a genuinely sustainable (economic) system. Eco-technologies can involve the highest and most complex technology, such as nano- structured photovoltaic cells to harness sunlight more efficiently, or the application of biotechnology to develop drought-resistant crops. Even seemingly simple technologies such as wind turbines may be based on cutting-edge materials and engineering. Similarly some planning and management processes can require significant technological backup as in the case of transport management systems. It is not only in the development of these technologies and products but also their manufacture that requires deep technical expertise. This is true for advanced batteries, for example, where the production of the storage material may require exacting procedures, or wind turbines, where blades may be made of advanced composite materials. But not all environmental technologies need to be high-tech or complex: drip irrigation systems that can greatly help in increasing the efficiency of water use in agriculture are relatively simple 20 . The active pursuit of eco-innovations is especially relevant for developing countries in the face of pressing concerns relating to poverty and economic development (Ockwell, 2010). Firstly, developing countries are often most vulnerable to the impacts of environmental problems (e.g. climate change impacts, such as drought and flooding). It is therefore in their interest both to access eco-innovations relevant to both adapting to the impacts of climate change and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to mitigate against future climate change. Secondly, access to technology is a key determinant of levels of economic development. Bridging the historical north-south gap by increased access to technology improves the developing countries\u2019 competitive advantage. Moreover, the successful diffusion of environmental technologies into developing countries will give them the advantage of leapfrogging: adopting cleaner technology without having to go through the technological learning curve which caused so much environmental damage in the developed countries. The key element of leapfrogging is the skipping of unsustainable stages (mimic-like) of development pathways (Sauter and Watson, 2008). 20 Source: InfoDev, 2010. Climate Innovation Centres.

We expect that consequences of such a path in developing countries will be more severe and occur faster than in developing countries. \uf0b7 Optimizing: This scenario includes additional effort to address sustainability issues by further optimizing current technologies (e.g. efficiency increases). Even through such an approach is necessary on the short term to lower environmental impacts, it will in the end only buy us time, as no fundamental changes to our unsustainable practices are done. \uf0b7 Radical change: This scenario assumes that radical changes in technology, way of living, producing and consuming will be adopted, based on true eco-innovations that provide us with a long-term sustainability. Only in this scenario we will be able to sustain a world with a growing population and an increasing well-being for all people. This approach would mean a true transition to a sustainable world. The key question is: can a transition(-like) approach of radical changes be an opportunity for developing countries to skip a major part of the \u2018optimization path solutions\u2019 that developed countries apply/applied by directly from the start applying \u2018radical\u2019 sustainable technologies and hence have a quicker acceleration/switch towards the transition to a sustainable system? And can we support that process by successfully transferring knowledge and capacities on cutting edge cleantech- as supporting tools? ",
        "32 Successful wide-scale deployment of environmental technologies will require two approaches: \uf0b7 Limited public sector funds should be spent in a way that is likely to have maximum impact in terms of attracting and sustaining private investment in relevant technologies. This will demand the development of financial mechanisms that can overcome the risks associated with the new technologies and broader policy frameworks that can support technology transfer and diffusion. \uf0b7 Indigenous eco-innovation capabilities should be strengthened, both on the institutional and human level. This will encourage the uptake and rapid diffusion of existing eco- innovations, as well as the development of new eco-innovations relevant to specific developing country contexts. These approaches may allow attracting sufficient finance to deliver widespread adoption of environmental technologies and eco-innovations, and to do so in a way that ensures developing countries develop indigenous innovation capabilities. 2.5 What are specific issues for implementation and success of eco- technologies in developing countries? Policy-makers have to deal with two types of market failure: the first one is environmental pollution. The second is the lack of innovation. Addressing those two externalities through technology transfers implies a number of choices related to policy instruments and framework conditions. These choices are conditioned by internal and external factors having an influence on environmental innovation. It is possible to distinguish both negative and positive issues to be taken into consideration. Eco-technologies are mainly developed in high-income countries 21 . General market conditions and policy frameworks are of main importance for eco-technologies development 22 and a number of studies raised certain issues to be faced by developing countries 23 . Several barriers and challenges were identified by a number of studies in this regard: Intellectual property is an important theme: access to intellectual property is not sufficient for many developing countries, and internationally accepted standards will have to be built. This challenge is related to the current lack of international policy framework 24 , which can be considered as one of the first barriers. The generation and transfer of innovations related to real needs is another issue, as it is important to keep a focus on indigenous eco-innovation capabilities . This relates to the fact that cooperation must be bilateral (and not unilateral), in order to benefit to local populations. Building and absorbing environmental technology 25 has indeed to be done with 21 Popp, D.

        "33 regards to the real need of the local population and the specific issues that each country is facing (at both national and sub-national levels). The characteristics of eco-innovations are rarely at a commercial stage; this raises some market issues to be addressed by developing countries. It is indeed to be noted that some increase in the costs can be expected from the various market failures and incremental costs implied by eco-innovation processes. Uncertainty has also been pointed as a brake for investors: how to make the state predictable to promote eco-technology transfers by reducing the risk for investing 26 is an issue to be considered. There is an obvious need for leveraging the private finance and optimizing public funding; in that field, it has been showed that stringency 27 is a good basis for fostering innovation 28 ; the issue which then arises is \u201chow\u201d to promote environmental products innovation while staying attractive for investors. This requires coherence 29 , flexibility 30 and responsiveness from targeted countries. The implementation of structures and institutions for optimizing the impacts of public investments are also to be included in such government strategy. As it is specified in the \u201cEnhancing Developing Country Access to Eco-Innovation: The Case of Technology Transfer and Climate Change in a Post-2012 Policy Framework\u201d OECD report (2010), countries have to \u201d recognise the critical importance of developing indigenous eco- innovation capabilities \u201d among firms. They also need to adopt new approaches, moving from approaches focusing on large scale projects towards what the OECD points as \u201c flows of codified knowledge 31 . It is to be kept in mind that fostered innovation would enhance the competitive position of local firms in their own domestic markets 32 . But barriers are not without opportunity windows, and can also been considered as possibilities to overcome the challenges they can represent. To go beyond these existing issues, several positive dimensions are also pointed out by the OECD, related institutions and experts dealing with eco-innovation transfers: \uf0b7 Generation and transfers of eco-technologies will help reducing carbon dioxide emissions and will be useful for developing low carbon technologies 33 . \uf0b7 Developing countries face a number of issues in the implementation of eco-technologies, but can target the right technologies and instruments to address the real needs of local populations, dealing with local issues and addressing local challenges 34 . 26 Nick Johnstone, Ivan Ha\u0161\u010di\u010d and Margarita Kalamova, Environment Directorate, OECD (2010), \u201cENVIRONMENTAL POLICY DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: EVIDENCE FROM PATENT DATA\u201d, ENVIRONMENT WORKING PAPER No. 16, ENV/WKP(2010)2 27 OECD (2011), Invention and Transfer of Environmental Technologies, OECD Studies on Environmental Innovation, OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264115620-en 28 Nick Johnstone, Ivan Ha\u0161\u010di\u010d and Margarita Kalamova, Environment Directorate, OECD (2010), \u201cENVIRONMENTAL POLICY DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: EVIDENCE FROM PATENT DATA\u201d, ENVIRONMENT WORKING PAPER No. 16, ENV/WKP(2010)2 29 David Bennett, UNIDO (2002), \u201cUNIDO and the World Summit on Sustainable Development Innovative Technology Transfer Framework Linked to Trade for UNIDO Action\u201d, UNITED NATIONS INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION Vienna 30 OECD (2011), Invention and Transfer of Environmental Technologies, OECD Studies on Environmental Innovation, OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264115620-en 31 Ockwell, D. et al.

        "34 \uf0b7 Developing access to technologies is a way to ensure economic development: transfers can lead to lower production costs in the industry under the condition of pubic incentive 35 , and a potential increase in foreign direct investments can be expected, as the creation of new market opportunities. The idea is also that such transfers would lead to lowering the cost of achieving environmental objectives 36 . Transfers for capabilities development but also know-how are important in this regard: beyond access to IPRs, other knowledge and especially tacit knowledge can be of benefit to developing countries. \uf0b7 Developing countries now have the possibility of tailoring the innovations they want to promote according to their interests, and they can upscale their policy focus to an international scale to benefit from collaborative R&D opportunities. This is related to the fact that developing countries can engage in closer collaboration with developed countries. Coordination over the time has been identified as a key factor in fostering eco- technology innovations, between governments at all levels but also between the public and private spheres 37 . The World Bank (2008) report on Accelerating Clean Energy Technology Research,Development, and Deployment. Lessons from Non-energy Sectors. Working Paper no. 138) found that the following factors discourage investment in clean energy RD&D and reduce its effectiveness: \uf0b7 Uncertain future value of CO2 emissions abatement. Frameworks for CO2 valuation continue to evolve but political and market risks, as well as post-2012 concerns, undermine the long-term planning needed to justify expensive RD&D. \uf0b7 Mitigation of climate change is a global public good. Provision of a public good is hampered by free-riding across space\u2014countries that free-ride on the mitigation efforts of others\u2014and across time\u2014actors that avoid the costs of mitigation now because the benefits of timely mitigation will be reaped by future generations. \uf0b7 The \u201cValley of Death,\u201d which occurs when promising technologies languish between public and private sector R&D efforts. \uf0b7 Intellectual property rights (IPRs). The large RD&D investments needed for technical advances in clean energy will be undermined by uncertain global IPR protection. At the same time, IPRs also hamper the deployment of technologies once commercialized. \uf0b7 Challenges developing and transferring technology to developing countries. Developing countries\u2014a substantial source of incremental emission growth\u2014will need OECD resources and expertise to deploy the needed clean energy technologies. \uf0b7 Subsidies for conventional energy products. Subsidies at both the retail and production levels reduce to below-cost the price with which new energy technologies must compete. Moreover, deployment of clean energy technologies is often hampered by trade barriers. Cleff et al. (2008) examine five factors that can potentially act as driving forces stimulating innovation, or as barriers hampering innovation activities: 1) Financing of innovation, 2) Taxation, 3) Competition in product markets, 4) Demand, 5) Regulation. Horbach (2005, 2008) suggests determinants of eco-innovation should be grouped in three distinct fields: supply side, demand side, institutional and political influences. Technopolis (2008) lists the following 34 Ockwell, D. et al.

        "35 elements: 1) Cost and demand, 2) Regulation and standards, 3) Taxation, 4) Competition, 5) Socio-cultural factors. There are large differences among the countries where these technologies will be deployed. This is particularly important for developing countries, where technological capabilities are often limited; where financial, institutional, and other constraints make the innovation challenge starker; and where other energy challenges \u2013 such as enhancing energy access and security \u2013 are equally pressing. Developing countries are too often the passive recipients of technologies developed elsewhere. This can lead to the deployment of technologies unsuited to local conditions, and also prevent developing countries from exploiting the economic potential of one of the most promising sectors of the 21st century. One particular problem is that developing countries require products that have very different specifications from their equivalents in the industrialised world. There is a need to adapt products invented in developed countries to make them suitable for developing ones, even though the core technology may remain the same. Successful innovation involves not just the development of new and improved technologies or adaptation of existing ones, but also their introduction into the marketplace through specific products . So we have to ensure not only that products are available (\u2018supply push\u2019), but also that a market exists to absorb them (\u2018demand pull\u2019). A technology that exists elsewhere, but is introduced into a new country through \u2018technology. transfer\u2019, can also contribute to \u2018 innovation\u2019 in the receiving country . Technology transfer may occur at any pre-market stage in the value chain. Another problem is that international technology markets often ignore products that meet the specific needs of developing countries such as cleaner cooking stoves. So there is a need not only to adapt existing products from the developed world, but also to come up with altogether new ones 38 . 2.6 Eco-technologies, technological readiness and transferability Eco-innovations are a key area where developing countries might access new technologies with the support of international policy incentives. Experience to date with knowledge transfer and capacity building projects has been mixed. Some proved to be very successful, while others were unable to make any progress due to a variety of reasons. In some cases (e.g. technologies that enhance energy efficiency and savings) these technologies might diffuse into developing countries without help from policy. In other cases, the adoption of environmental regulations in developing countries may be required to stimulate clean technologies (Popp, 2009). 2.6.1 Solar PV Experiences from PVMTI (Photovoltaic Market Transformation Program) highlighted that solar PV projects are most challenging to implement, precisely in those countries where demand for the technology is high 39 . Often, poor and isolated rural communities, who do not have access to the electricity grid and thus would benefit highly from solar PV, are unable to generate the resources necessary for purchasing or maintaining the PV units without subsidies. Projects should direct their efforts at raising public awareness of the merits of solar PV, upgrade the skills of local technicians, provide technical assistance and capacity building, including tacit knowledge. This need for capacity building and technical assistance may be even more important than business finance. Business models, investment terms and management of solar 38 Source: InfoDev, 2010.

        "36 PV focused projects should be tailored to the specific needs of the technology and the communities. Administration requirements, contracts and business plans should be understandable and manageable for small businesses, SMEs and entrepreneurs. Often, minimum deal sizes are too large for existing solar PV firms, and larger companies are often not interested in servicing the rural markets. The quality of the solar PV products (e.g. faulty batteries) and the availability of a reliable solar PV service network is a serious issue. Projects should focus on the establishment of a favourable environment for high-quality products, product-innovation, effective quality-control mechanisms and qualified service providers. Furthermore, favourable tax, regulatory, and grid-extension policies may help the development of the solar PV market in a given country. 2.6.2 Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are regarded by many scientists as potentially capable of making a significant contribution to meeting global greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation objectives. However, before the technology can be deployed in industries in developing countries and countries in transition, substantial efforts should be carried out to exchange knowledge to understand all aspects of CCS to reduce investor risk, and help design policies to mitigate economic impacts, including increases in electricity prices and financing mechanisms to facilitate investment in the technology use 40 . 2.6.3 Water supply and treatment services Provision of adequate water supply, sanitation, and hygiene promotion is vital for the prevention of infectious diseases. Many advances in science have been made. However, the reality is that many \u201cnovelties\u201d of decades ago still haven\u2019t been effectively absorbed in water and sanitation practice in developing countries. Many barriers to better water management in the developing countries are rooted in economic problems (poverty, overpriced or underpriced drinking water), poor education and awareness, rapid population growth, and ineffective institutions and policies for developing, distributing, pricing, and conserving water resources. Some of the common shortcomings of \u2018advanced\u2019 technologies are their inability to cope with resource-limited contexts. Also, often effective review systems are lacking to enable fair comparison of currently available and emerging technologies, while a lack of effective forums for new innovations hinders successful technologies to diffuse to end users 41 . An important barrier to improving water services in developing countries is the high cost of upgrading and constructing additional water treatment infrastructure to meet the increased demand of water caused by population increases; while original supplies have often diminished or their quality has been degraded. 2.7 Which technologies are developing countries asking for? Figure 6 shows that low income economies predominantly need technologies that have little or no market potential in upper middle income countries. These technologies are usually small scale applications, require relatively little amount of capital and are more focussed on households. Yet if applied in large numbers, the effects on climate and environment are expected to be substantial. 40 Kulichenko N., Ereira E. (2011), Energy and Mining Sector Board Discussions Paper no. 25.

It has to be noted that these technology needs are not the same for all developing countries, especially since the state of economic development may differ substantially, even within a country. For instance at the 11 th EU \u2013 India Business Summit, December 2010, sustainable construction and smart grids were identified by the delegation of India as needed technologies 42 . Evidently, this would support India\u2019s economic profile as a fast growing economy. Sustainable building and construction It is important to recognize that urban areas are particularly vulnerable due to their high level of dependency on distant bio-capacities and ecosystems that sustain them by providing food and resources and absorbing their waste. This vulnerability is particularly the case for the informal settlements forming 30-70% of urban housing stock in low and low-middle income countries, often sprung up in hazardous locations and subject to poor quality housing, water supply, sanitation and access to social services. Resilience advocates, inspired by the C.S. Holling\u2019s resilience theory, therefore plead to increase the capacity of urban systems to undergo 42 These needs were identified during the 11th EU-India Business Summit that was organised by VITO, the Belgian Industry Chamber (VBO) and Indian Industries Association, see http://euindia.summitsfeb.be/about- euindia/presentation/ ",
        "38 significant changes or distress without collapsing, by strengthening the ability of cities to withstand shocks and rebuild themselves by reorganization and adaption. Compared with other industrial products, buildings and infrastructure present an unusual case in that they are relatively long-lasting. Structures built in developed countries have an average lifetime of 80 years (UNEP, 2003). These structures are often particularly rigid and unable to deal with ever changing realities and needs. This implies an exceptional challenge lying ahead in terms of transitory measures for adapting our existing built infrastructure. Sustainable building and construction represents an enormous challenge and clearly calls for a holistic, integrated and multidisciplinary approach. Sustainable building and construction cannot be seen separate from global trends in population growth and rapid spread of urbanization, production and consumption patterns, spatial organization and land use, energy systems, transport and mobility. Sustainability aspects are of importance on all levels and at all stages of the building and construction process: from site selection and location, building concept, choice of materials, technical installations, building operational phases, building upgrading and adaptation and end of service life waste treatment. Clean tech solutions for sustainable building and construction will only achieve if they go parallel with a holistic approach towards a sustainable economy and society, successful in decoupling human development and economic growth from environmental impact. It is clear that clean tech solutions are destined to pay a major contribution towards sustainable building and construction, not in the least in coping with challenges of rapid urban growth in developing countries. Clean energy and smart grids Reliable, affordable energy is essential in ensuring human well-being and socio-economic development. Insufficient energy access continues to hinder human development in many developing countries, particularly in India, where over 85% of rural households continue to use firewood, chips, and cow dung as the primary source of energy for cooking. In such a constrained context, renewable energy technologies, in particular solar energy, hold tremendous potential to usher in a sustainable energy option 43 . To achieve more sober, efficient and clean energy production and distribution patterns, a major cleantech challenge is the electricity grid to become more intelligent; since it has to deal with a different mix of both centralized and distributed, non-variable and variable generation combined with new demand profiles, and this utilizing both existing and new assets. Currently the power flows basically from the high through medium to the low voltage grid. Because of the increased amount of distributed electricity sources the grid becomes more and more a path for bidirectional power flow in which both production and demand can be managed to guarantee security of supply at all times. The European Technology Platform Smart Grids defines smart grids as electricity networks that can intelligently integrate the behaviour and actions of all users connected to it - generators, consumers and those that do both \u2013 in order to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies. A smart grid employs innovative products and services together with intelligent monitoring, control, communication, and self-healing technologies in order to: - better facilitate the connection and operation of generators of all sizes and technologies; - optimise grid operation and usage (e.g. reducing losses) and grid infrastructure; - allow consumers to play a part in optimising the operation of the system; - provide consumers with greater information and options for choice of supply; 43 source: ETP 2010, IEA ",

        "40 3 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK \u2013 A VISION ON ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND TRANSITION 3.1 Technology transfer and diffusion The move towards sustainable development constitutes an important economic and social transition for developed as well as developing countries. As innovative and clean technologies play an important role in the evolution to a more sustainable society, technology transfer and capacity building for innovation are very important. The active pursuit of eco-innovations is especially relevant for developing countries in the face of pressing concerns relating to poverty and economic development (Ockwell, 2010). Moreover, the successful adoption of environmental technologies in developing countries will give them the advantage of leapfrogging: adopting cleaner technology without having to go through the technological learning curve which caused so much environmental damage in the developed countries. Successful transfer and diffusion of innovative technologies are key determinants for the development, implementation and wide adoption of technology in developing countries. Many definitions of technology transfer and technology diffusion exist and are used interchangeably, causing a lot of confusion (Ramanathan, no date). Nevertheless, for policies to be effective, a clear distinction between the different concepts behind the definition is necessary. In order to understand the process of transfer and adoption of innovations, we propose to use the technological innovation system (TIS) framework as developed by Carlsson and Stankiewicz (1991) and applied to study of technological changes by Hekkert and Negro (2009). In this approach a TIS is defined as \u201ca network or networks of agents interacting in a specific technology area under a particular institutional infrastructure to generate, diffuse and utilise technology\u201d. Based on the concept of a TIS, the use of the following definition of technology transfer is proposed: Technology transfer aims at making scientific and technological developments accessible to a wider range of users. It consists of 3 phases: \uf0b7 Technology development: basic or advanced research and development in order to develop a new technology or apply an existing technology in a new context (e.g. sector or country context), involving experiments, technology adaptation, imitation and pilot implementation. \uf0b7 Technology diffusion: the further development and exploitation of the technology into new products, processes, applications, materials or services, leading to broadening, up- scaling and spreading of the technology. This process requires the building, exchange and spreading of knowledge, but also the creation of favourable conditions, such as the adaptation of legislation, the provision of resources and supporting infrastructure, building of legitimacy, market creation etc. Diffusion of technology relies on the willingness and ability of users to adopt it. \uf0b7 Technology use: widespread adoption and use of the new technology in the newly created context. 3.2 Transitions: a multi-level perspective In their bare essence, transitions are defined as processes of radical, structural change of society or its different socio-technical systems (Rotmans, 2003; Loorbach, 2007). Such processes encompass fundamental turns in the established socio-economic structures, cultures and modes of thought. As a logical consequence, we are talking about long-term strategies (25 \u2013 50 years). ",
        "41 Transitions play simultaneously at different levels of structure, scale, organisation and (possibilities) for influence. This is expressed in the \u2018multi-level perspective\u2019 that distinguishes landscapes, regimes and niches, as shown in Figure 7 : \uf0b7 Landscape: At the \u2018landscape\u2019 level \u2018gradients of force\u2019 are in play: dominant trends and evolutions from which it is difficult to deviate and which are rigid in the sense that it is difficult to change them on an individual base (e.g. globalisation, climate change, ageing populations\u2026). Nevertheless, these prevailing evolutions and trends exert external pressure on the systems in place. \uf0b7 Regime: A \u2018regime\u2019 refers to the dominant culture, structure and practice embodied in physical and immaterial infrastructures (e.g. roads, power grids, routines, actor- networks, regulations, government and policy \u2026). Regimes are the backbone of the stability of societal systems and have a characteristic rigidity that very often prevents innovations from altering the standing structures fundamentally. \uf0b7 Niche: \u2018Niches\u2019 are protected, and often little visible small scale segments in society where novelties are created and tested. These novelties can be (combinations of) new technologies, new rules and legislation, new concepts, new organizations\u2026 Niches contain incubators for transition experiments and proofs of concept of radical innovations. Thereby, the landscape exerts pressure on the ruling regimes: problems that arise from business-as-usual (e.g. climate change, overpopulation,\u2026) urge the ruling regimes to address these problems by significant changes. At the same time, the niches look for \u2018windows of opportunity\u2019 in the ruling regime in order to find pathways to scale up and become part of the new mainstream. When eventually the regime(s) change, they can become strong enough to influence the landscape or at least cope with the pressure it exerts. Promising eco-innovations (e.g. solar boiler) emerge and develop in \u2019niches\u2019\u2019\u2014partially protected spaces where people experiment and incubate promising concepts or prototypes through trialling. If such experiments go well, are sustained over time and are disseminated successfully among society, they pave the way for the creation of a viable market and broader adoption (e.g. solar boilers on private houses). Eventually, successful eco-technologies are regarded as \u2018proven technology\u2019 and become the mainstream themselves. At this point, they become part of the ruling regime, which becomes more environmentally-friendly and sustainable (e.g. less burning of fossil fuels for household water-heating). This in turn, gives an answer to the pressures of the landscape (e.g. climate change). Figure 7 : The multi-level perspective: a nested hierarchy of niches, regimes and landscapes Source: Geels F.W.

        "42 3.3 Technology transfer as a driver for transition The way that transitions work is often visualized as an \u201cS-curve\u201d. It explains a transition as a sequence of four subsequent phases (: 1. Pre-development , during which the system status quo remains, but small-scale initiatives arise in which completely new working and thinking paradigms are employed. Early experiments fitting in innovative system structures are established. There is a kind of \u2018nervousness\u2019 within the system caused by external (landscape) pressure or tangible consequences of unsustainable practices (\u2018symptoms\u2019). The appropriate way for finding solutions for the complex problem settings is being explored. 2. Take-off , during which the system in place starts to absorb the transition impulses and shows a visible \u2013 be it cautious - start of a change process. It is the phase during which a number of reactions to the unsustainable situation get higher visibility, are mutually connected and reinforce each other. 3. Acceleration , during which the system in place starts to absorb the transition impulses and shows a visible \u2013 be it cautious - start of a change process. It is the phase during which a number of reactions to the unsustainable situation get higher visibility, are mutually connected and reinforce each other. 4. Stabilisation , during which the speed of change decreases, a new system in a dynamic equilibrium is established (in which new niches develop, marking a new cycle\u2026). In the case of transfer of eco-technologies one can combine this S-curve transition framework to explain the sequenced way that technology transfer takes place, see Figure 8. a) technology development: The transfer of an eco-innovation towards or within a developing country starts with the set-up of a transition experiment in a niche . The technology is adapted to the local context, tested, adjusted, fine-tuned and tested again. Frontrunners and \u201cearly adopters\u201d (innovation-minded firms or individuals) start to use the technology. The technology becomes successful in its technological niche. b) technology diffusion: When conditions are favourable, broadening and up-scaling can occur. The niche grows into an empowered niche , and the technology is successfully distributed to a broader public, a wider range of applications or a more extended region. Additional adjustments and developments along the way can be necessary. Successful technology diffusion allows the innovative technology to mature. c) technology use: when the technology in the empowered niche is mature enough, it can seize a \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 and establish itself as a part of the prevalent regime or even overthrow it completely. A new regime equilibrium is established in which the innovative, emerging technology has become a mainstream technology. ",
        "43 Figure 8: Technology transfer and diffusion in transition processes, S-curve Source: VITO 3.4 Technology diffusion: a critical phase towards success Transition experiments that are aimed at learning, searching and technology development are of major importance to enable take-off and acceleration of a technology transfer. Failure of experiments is part of the game, and is no impediment, as long as learning experiences and the related knowledge are captured. The key phase in technology transfer that \u201cmakes or breaks\u201d the breakthrough of a new innovative technology is the diffusion phase. Literature on technology diffusion often suggests that successful technologies diffuse automatically in a passive way. However, this is only the case when the context in which the technology is evolving (the regime conditions) has a positive attitude towards the technology and supports this process. This is not always the case, or only to a limited extent. Therefore, to allow a successful up-scaling of innovative technology, the diffusion process should be strategically managed by exploring possible opportunities and barriers in an early stage (van den Bosch, 2010). Hekkert and Negro (2009) use the innovation system approach in order to understand how the innovation system around a new technology is built up to allow for successful diffusion and sustainable technological changes. A \u2018technology innovation system\u2019 (TIS) is defined as: \u201ca network or networks of agents interacting in a specific technology area under particular institutional infrastructure to generate, diffuse and utilise technology.\u201d A well-functioning TIS is a requirement for a successful development and diffusion of the technology. Hekkert proposed a set of 7 \u2018system functions\u2019 or \u2018key activities\u2019 which have to be fulfilled in order to result in a successful innovation system (Hekkert et al. , 2007): ",
        "44 Entrepreneurial activities: Entrepreneurs are an essential player to turn the potential of new technologies and markets into concrete actions to generate new business opportunities. They are willing to take the risks and uncertainties that come with emerging innovations, but only if a reasonable chance for success exists. The development of a positive climate for the private sector will depend on how well the 6 other functions are developed. Typical indicators for this function are the number of new companies set up around the new technology and the number existing companies embracing the new technology. Knowledge development (learning): R&D and knowledge development are at the heart of an innovation process. Typical indicators for this function are the number of R&D projects, investments and patents. Knowledge diffusion through networks: Information exchange and network interaction is very important, especially when different stakeholders are involved. An indicator for this function can be the number of workshops and conferences organised around the new technology. Guidance of the search: This function refers to all kinds of activities done by industry, government or markets to increase visibility of a new technology, create positive expectations and boost ambitions by setting targets and goals (both by governments and industries). This positive vibe stimulates the allocation of resources to further development and adoption of the technology. Market formation: As new technologies often have difficulties to compete with existing technologies, it is important that protected spaces are provided that allow for a temporary niche market, supported by e.g. favourable tax regimes, quota or subsidies. Markets can also emerge when new environmental standards are adopted that impose the use of eco-technologies. Resource mobilisation: Both financial and human resources are necessary resources to generate knowledge. Creation of legitimacy/counteract resistance to change: New technology has to become part of the incumbent regime, it has to overcome resistance and pre-assumptions, it has to fight old habits. A successful diffusion of a new technology depends highly on public acceptance and the willingness of people to adopt it. These seven functions do not exist separately from each other, but influence and support each other, setting off a positive drive (\u2018virtuous cycle\u2019) which reinforces itself leading to successful diffusion of the technology. In the same way, lack of certain key functions can cause a negative spiral, causing the diffusion process to fail, even for technologies with a high potential (Figure 9). ",
        "45 Figure 9: Seven key functions for a successful innovation systems Source: Hekkert and Negro, 2009 3.5 Towards an analytical framework Integrating various aspects into a consistent analytical framework a scheme was developed to guide as a common framework for linking environmental technology transfer, diffusion, the stakeholders and the conditions that codetermine the outcome. This is presented in Figure 10. The niche corresponds to the project level or the level of initiatives. Existing environmental technology is brought in or is being developed and subsequently transferred to a particular application. This may require adaptation to local circumstances and needs and as such involves innovation. Within the project or niche the initiative has a result in terms of environmental performance, economic and social as well as resource use. If successful at the niche level, up- scaling may take place by transferring the niche technology and know-how to other initiatives and projects. At this stage one may perceive that the environmental and other impacts spread beyond the borders of what one individual initiative might have ever reached. The technology (or variations thereof) is now applied over a wider scale affecting a wider area, which is called the regime. Evidently, part of the dissemination or up-scaling may require adaptation and innovation that is necessary to increase the technology\u2019s application. Also at the level of the regime environmental and other impacts will occur. At a certain point in time, the scale of these regime impacts may be big enough to affect the landscape, which initially determined the conditions for both the regimes and niches, such as pollution, draught, but which through environmental technology actions at the niche level which subsequently proliferated, were ultimately changed. Both the regimes and the niches have their own conditions. The niche conditions are co- determined by the regime and its conditions, but through dissemination of successful initiatives, the niche may alter the state of the regime. Stakeholders are present at both levels. Some are more relevant at the niche level, while others at regime level. For instance, policy makers at the national level co-determine primarily the regime conditions, while local policy makers focus on the niche level, although both policies need to be compatible. ",

        "47 3.6 This project\u2019s approach In order to answer the main questions of this study (see 1.2 Objectives of the study) a threefold approach has been followed, each of which is indicated as a pillar. The first pillar provides a review of mechanisms for the transfer of environmental technologies and knowledge to developing countries. The aim is to assess the effectiveness of existing mechanisms and to discuss how the design of existing mechanisms takes account of the need to strengthen the absorptive capacities of developing countries. The analysis is based on publicly available information and a set of existing initiatives that could be identified. The second pillar comprises ten case studies on selected environmental technologies in developing countries. Compared to the first pillar, the analysis goes more in-depth and focusses on identifying the so-called soft conditions and drivers that are not observable from a macro view, as applied in pillar 1. The results of these two pillars will be presented in the next part of the report. The third pillar is geared towards discussing the main results at an international workshop which was held October 11 th 2012, and deriving policy recommendations.

        "48 4 RESULTS OF PILLAR 1: A REVIEW OF MECHANISMS FOR THE TRANSFER OF ECO-INNOVATION AND KNOWLEDGE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES What can we learn with regard to design and effectiveness for environmental technology transfer to developing countries from existing literature and initiatives? This is the main question that we endeavour to answer in this section. In the background and scoping section of this report, Part 1.2, a number of important factors were identified that influence the successful outcome of environmental technology transfers, such as absorptive capacity in the developing countries, indigenous eco-innovation capabilities, and science and technology policies, financial leverage. Some of these elements can be part of an initiative\u2019s design, while others are to be considered as landscape, regime or niche conditions. The following section analyse in more depth how existing technology transfer instruments are designed and what is their effectiveness. We start with insights from a literature review focussing on two important non-energy environmental technologies: waste management and water management. Subsequently the results of a qualitative analysis are presented using a set of environmental technology transfer initiatives that the project team could identify. A distinction is made between individual projects and larger programmes. Section 4.3 presents the results of a quantitative network analysis of more than 4000 climate change initiatives in the context of the Clean Development Mechanism. 4.1 Design and effectiveness of existing technology transfer instruments in the fields of waste and water management Among the environmental technologies other than climate and energy ones, water and waste management are two technologies that are of particular importance for developing countries. Furthermore they are closely interrelated with material management and the sustainable use of the land. For each of these technologies, the subsequent sections first present a review of the literature and then show by the main insights and potential policy lessons. 4.1.1 Technology transfer for efficient waste treatment 4.1.1.1 Literature review For the area of solid waste management, it seems that this problem is relatively well understood in the developed world. Therefore, the issue is mainly which technologies should be transferred to developing countries and how this can best be done. Bezama et al. (2007) describe the development, performance and conclusions derived from three know-how and technology transfer projects to South American countries. All three projects are related to waste management: the first was dealing with the issue of industrial waste, the second with municipal solid waste and the third with contaminated sites management. The general conclusions that the authors derive from this set of projects are the following: Firstly, when a certain need is identified in a certain region that can be resolved by a technological innovation it is very important to figure out how to adapt this innovation to local circumstances. It is important to look at the legal context, local knowledge and technological development, as well as the availability of maintenance resources. Secondly, partial changes or enhancement of currently available technologies must be considered, rather than introducing completely new technologies. Even though radical changes seem technically possible, economic reasons may make their introduction not feasible or not desirable. Thirdly, for successful implementation of technology transfer, partnerships with local stakeholders such as universities, sectorial bodies and/or public private authorities must be established. Local companies can often be motivated to participate through these local stakeholders. Also, longer term gains can be tapped by maintaining the knowledge sharing network that has been established. ",
        "49 Medina (1999) also argues convincingly that profound differences exist between first world and third world countries, and that this distinction is particularly relevant in the context of municipal waste collection. Therefore, \u2018conventional approaches\u2019 towards technology transfer in this area, as they are often advocated by development agencies & organizations and which put a high emphasis on centralized capital-intensive solutions, often fail. He cites the examples of compactor trucks that break down due to lack of road infrastructure, waste incinerators that do not function as planned due to climatic conditions and high humidity of waste or in-vessel composting facilities that closed because the equipment and electrical power requirements were too high. Medina (1999) argues that socio-economic conditions are so different in the developing world that a new much more decentralized approach should be conceived. In particular, the potential contribution of the informal sector should not be ignored, as currently extensive scavenging operations exist and these activities represent a significant source of income for the least well-off in the society. After all, the context in developed economies is one of relatively high labour costs and relatively low capital costs. In this context, it makes sense to make municipal solid waste management a capital-intensive industry. In the developing world it is quite the opposite: labour costs are much lower, while capital costs are high. Thus, opting for a labour-intensive waste management industry is probably the best available option. Finally, the author is also in favour of public-private partnerships between existing waste collection micro- enterprises and public agencies. He also proposes to analyse best practices in the area of solid waste management in the developing world and enable complementary technology transfer at south-south level, between developing countries. Given that characteristics of developing regions/areas are often similar and very different from those in developed world; this would be a more promising approach rather than trying to copy to approaches towards waste management of developed countries. Shafiul et al. (2004) also analyse expansion of public-private partnerships as a possible way to improve solid waste management in developing countries and argue that there is indeed quite some potential on the condition that the \u2018conventional\u2019 first world approach is adapted. The aim is to free up financial means of local municipalities, who are often in lack of financial resources and limits their abilities to invest in essential services such as public education and health care services. These municipalities often spend well over 50% of their budget on collecting & processing municipal waste. By contracting a more efficient private firm, they can direct a higher share of resources towards these other activities. What is really needed, according to Shafiul et al. (2004), are \u2018facilitators\u2019 for a.o. the following issues: shifting the government role from being a service provider to a regulator, eliminate corruption, eliminate inefficiencies and take the interests into account of people who are currently active in waste collection (and who are often very poor). 4.1.1.2 Most important policy implications for the design of waste management technology transfer A number of observations arise from the papers considered and seem to be key recommendations for successful technology transfer in the area of solid waste management: \uf0b7 Adapt technological innovations to local circumstances o Partial changes should be considered, rather than going for radical shifts or advanced technologies \uf0b7 Investing in capacity building/facilitating good practices may be as important as introducing advanced technological innovations o Public private partnerships are promising approach, but should be adapted to developing country circumstances \uf0b7 Include local institutions in your project/build local networks o Let local institutions contribute to project design o Use established relationships for continued knowledge transfer and LT learning ",
        "50 \uf0b7 Take the potential of the informal sector into account, consider decentralized options for waste collection and processing o While labour costs in developed economies are high relative to capital costs, the opposite is true for developing economies 4.1.2 Technology transfer for efficient water management practices 4.1.2.1 Literature review Water scarcity is a very serious issue in the developing world. It may even become a serious constraint in developed countries during the coming decades, if insufficient action is taken to address these problems now (Shannon et al. 2008). Therefore, a lot of research is needed in this area and this knowledge needs to be transferred and put in practice. Shannon et al. (2008) discuss how water scarcity may become a serious issue in developing as well as in the developed world if no serious action is undertaken to improve our scientific knowledge of this issue. Water scarcity and human use of contaminated water is already a serious issue and the cause of many diseases in the developing world nowadays. On top of this, most proposed technologies are capital-, energy- and operationally-intensive which makes them less appropriate for transfer and application in the developing world. They propose a three-tier approach towards moderating the water challenging in the coming decades. Firstly, a lot of research is needed to develop new technologies. Secondly, consortia should be built at all levels to translate scientific knowledge to practical applications as soon as possible. Thirdly, educational and capacity-building strategies should be implemented to enhance public understanding of the issues and change human behaviour such that water efficiency is improved. With respect to the development of new technologies, the authors state that special attention should be given to relatively low-tech water options for application in the developing world. These options should preferably incorporate sustainable energy resources to reduce the accompanying energy demands. From a technology readiness perspective, water reuse seems to be the most promising option for the developing world. A couple of suggestions made by the author are the following: To recover water close to the point of use, because then there is less need of pumping, transporting and storing the water which is a large share of its cost (in particular in the developing world). To use membrane bio-reactor technology in decentralized sewage treatment, particularly in fast-growing mega-cities. To use solar thermal distillation or humid air desalination of water where electrical use can be supplied by solar power or complemented by heat. With respect to the building of consortia, Roux et al. (2006) argue that co-production of knowledge involving collaborative learning between \u2018experts\u2019 and \u2018users\u2019 of knowledge is likely to be most productive. They emphasize the importance of tacit knowledge as the main reason to increase the use of collaborative approaches. With respect to the educational and capacity-building issues, Elton & Wolfe (2012) provide a case study of capacity building for water efficiency using the USA plumbing industry. They explain how professional plumbers play an essential role in implementing water efficiency measures. However, repositioning the industry requires substantial rethinking and retraining. The authors analyse how one retraining program, the Green Plumbers Program (that is developed and runs in developed countries), contributes to the transfer of water efficiency knowledge. They stress the importance of tacit knowledge for effective technology transfer. They also emphasize how (local) social networks can be used to disseminate information among its members and also to its clients (in case of a professional association). The authors propose to use a \u2018local champion\u2019 to promote the diffusion of an innovation in a certain area. Finally, they also stress the importance of tailoring the program to local needs. This case study may seem, at first sight, a little remote from the case of explicit technology transfer towards third world countries. However, the importance of capacity-building and educational approaches is ",
        "51 equally present in the developing world and this paper highlights the way through which social networks can be an effective tool for achieving behavioural change. Another issue is how to make people motivated to participate in educational and capacity- building programs and how to make them effectively apply what they have learned. Thompson & Stoutemyer (1991) have conducted an experiment that sheds light on how to motivate people to change behaviour towards more efficient water management practices. They contrast egoistic motivations with non-egoistic motivations by emphasizing different messages in two experimental groups of people. They show that people who were exposed to messages that elicit non-egoistic motivations (such as a focus on long-term consequences of water use) were not less likely to adapt their behaviour than people who were exposed to messages that elicit egoistic motivations (such as a focus on economic advantages of conservation). However, they conducted their analysis in a developed country context and it is not clear whether their results could be transferred to a developing country environment. Carter (1998) focuses on how behavioural change concerning water use can be brought about in function of socio-economic circumstances. She finds that potential for behavioural change responds positively to content knowledge, to confidence, to developing of a national network and to satisfaction with the program. This result suggests that knowledge is a key driver of human behaviour with respect to water efficiency and similar approaches may be used to motivate people to change behaviour in the developed and developing world. 4.1.2.2 Most important implications for design of water management technology transfer We now summarize a couple of key recommendations from the academic literature for achieving better water management in developing world: \uf0b7 Technological innovations that are transferred to developing countries to improve water management should focus (as much as possible) on small-scale, low-tech water options o If possible they should include sustainable energy resource use to cover additional energy demands that water technologies often entail \uf0b7 Tacit knowledge may not be immediately as visible as explicit knowledge, but is key in capacity-building and achieving behavioural change through education o Local (social) networks can be used to disseminate information effectively o A local champion can be a good starting point for diffusing new knowledge/a new innovation \uf0b7 People can be motivated to change behaviour not only by appealing to their own economic benefit, but also by informing them about long-term consequences of water use and how they can contribute to this problem ",
        "52 4.2 A qualitative analysis of a sample of environmental technology transfer programmes and projects In this second section, our aim is to investigate the extent to which the success factors identified above are incorporated in currently existing technology transfer programmes and projects. We start by discussing technology transfer programmes and put particular emphasis on the international architecture of climate funds. The main goal of these funds is to provide funding for a selection of technology transfer projects. These projects may be fully funded, but more often the funding is partial. The expertise that these technology transfer programmes provide, concerns, most often, knowledge of finance or (government) policy areas, rather than thorough technical knowledge. After discussing the programs, we go to a more specific level by discussing a sample of environmental technology transfer projects. 4.2.1 Technology transfer programmes We give an overview of the existing structure of international climate change initiatives, with a special focus on climate funds that help to enable technology transfer. A graphical overview of the international inter-governmental institutional framework is given in Figure 12 to Figure 15. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) entered into force in 1994 and provides an overall framework for intergovernmental efforts to tackle the challenges posed by climate change. In Figure 12, we give an overview of institutions/bodies that are established in connection with the UNFCCC, but that are not directly involved in funding of climate change projects. The negotiations among national delegations are conducted in the COP-meeting (Conference of the Parties), such as Kyoto 1997 or Durban 2011 for example. It is at these meetings that new initiatives are being taken or that legally binding targets are agreed upon. The UNFCCC further consists of two subsidiary bodies: one in charge of implementation and the other in charge of scientific and technological advice. In the context of implementation, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the Joint Implementation program (JI) are relatively well-known flexibility mechanisms for countries to comply with their Kyoto GHG-emission reduction pledges. The CDM allows countries to collect credits by investing in GHG- abatement projects in developing countries, whereas the JI program allows developed countries (so-called annex1 countries) flexibility in jointly achieving their emission reduction targets. In the area of technology advice, CC:iNet and TT:Clear are meant to be platforms for effective knowledge exchange and dissemination of information. While CC:iNet focuses on information related to climate change in general, the emphasis of TT:Clear is specifically towards technology transfer that can contribute to dealing with climate change. Finally, there are also efforts to co-ordinate and improve scientific knowledge that should enable better technology transfer. Under the UNFCCC, these are referred to as the technology transfer framework and the technology mechanism. ",

        "54 Let us now devote more attention to the climate funding organizations. The goal of these organizations is, in general, to provide (partial) funding to selected projects through which dissemination of so-called \u2018environmentally sound technologies\u2019 (ESTs) can take place. Figure 13 gives a general overview of the international climate finance architecture. At the last COP meeting in Durban (December 2011), an agreement was reached to establish a Green Climate Fund. This would become a mechanism to transfer money from developed to developing world in order to assist them in adaptation and mitigation against climate change. The Green Climate Fund administration is currently assigned to an interim trustee, the World Bank. This fund should be raising $100 billion a year by 2020, which would make it far more influential and powerful than any of the other, currently operational climate fund (the GEF, for example, operates an annual budget of a couple of 100million euros). For the period 2010-2012, it was agreed to have a Fast Start Funding of the GCF with a budget of $30 billion for these three years. Even though the pledges for this amount of money have been made, up to now only a share of the sum has been delivered. Some controversy exists about how the GCF should optimally be conceived, but we will address this issue at a later stage. The main inter-governmental institution that currently provides funds for environmental technology transfer is the Global Environmental Facility. This body was established in 1991 and is active not only in financing projects in the area of climate change, but also in other environmental areas such as combatting desertification or protecting biological diversity. It is managed separately from the UNFCCC, but its policies in the areas of climate change are in accordance to the general policies and priorities adopted by the COP. The institution targets mainly the financing of the incremental costs of measures to achieve global environmental benefits, for projects that are endorsed by the national governments of the countries where they will be implemented. The emphasis on global environmental benefits entails that this fund is active in adaptation only to a limited extent. However, there is also a sub-branch of GEF called the \u2018Least Developed Country Fund\u2019 which puts much more emphasis on the implementation of National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). Also the Special Climate Change Fund, another sub- branch of GEF focuses more on investing in adaptation measures. Another climate fund is the Adaptation Fund. This body is managed separately from GEF and is directly funded by a small percentage (2%) of CDM proceeds. Another major initiative is UN-REDD which emphasizes on reducing GHG-emissions by preventing deforestation. This initiative is managed by three separate United Nations programs: UNDP, UNEP and FAO and is complemented by a host of other initiatives that address prevention of deforestation (and which are shown in Figure 16). Another major player in financing environmental technology transfer projects is the World Bank. Its\u2019 structure is shown in Figure 15. The World Bank is a major player in providing development finance. It has recently also developed a special \u2018environmental arm\u2019 by starting the World Bank Climate Investment Funds in 2008. Under this arm it developed two programmes: the Clean Technology Fund which provides finance to encourage environmental technology transfer, and the Strategic Climate Fund. This last funding program again exists of three sub-initiatives: one that targets deforestation prevention, one that helps developing countries with implementation of their adaptation plans and one that aims to accelerate renewable energy investments. Besides this, a multitude of other programs and funds exist. In the group of multilateral development banks, the European Investment Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank and others all invest in environmental technology transfer. The EU also has a Climate Change Alliance program, which it operates through its classic development aid channels. Besides this, other programs exist at national level; as well as bilateral agreements between nations. ",

        "59 What can we now say about the design of these programmes and how does this affect their effectiveness? In the context of designing the Green Climate Fund in an effective way for it to spend its allocated funds efficiently, some authors have analysed the design of other international aid funds and derive a number of recommendations from this exercise. Abbott & Gartner (2011) criticize the conception of the GCF as being too state-centred. They argue that the 20 th century \u2018monopoly of the states\u2019 approach imperils GCF\u2019s effectiveness, as it fails to engage the resources and energies of non-state actors. The authors claim that a climate fund that is explicitly designed to involve civil society (such as NGO representatives) and other stakeholders (such as private firms) would be much more effective at reaching its goals, than a state-centred, strictly inter-governmental climate fund. The authors further argue that while international environmental governance was initially ahead of the curve in involving relevant stakeholders, progress in this area seems to have stalled. The authors mention the GEF as a relatively good example of outsider stakeholder involvement, as provisions are there to include the views of civil society representatives when decisions need to be made. Then, they contend that the subsequent CIF and the Adaption Fund programmes are actually significant retreats in the area of participatory innovation. This is strange given that adaptation to climate change is a clear example of an area where advantages from (local) civil society input and buy-in should be very clear. The authors cite global health governance as an example that environmental governance should try to follow. They embrace a multi- stakeholder model in which civil society, the private sector, foundations and other constituencies participate directly in governing bodies and decision-making. This is preferable over simple consultative procedures and has enabled these funds to realize significant successes in important areas. The channels through which this works are more effective resource mobilization, contribution of information and expertise, introduction of subjective understanding of situation and issues, etc. This also creates a stronger sense of civil society ownership, which is known to be one of the key dimensions for any successful development aid program. Representatives of civil society should therefore be present within inter- governmental environmental (technology transfer) institutions. This is also preferable over simple consultative approaches. Ideally, civil society representatives should also be elected or their participation should be integrated in some type of constituency model. This would significantly improve accountability and strengthen the legitimacy and representativeness of international environmental (technology transfer) institutions. Van Kerkhoff et al. (2011) also address the question of how the GCF should be conceived for it to spend its anticipated annual allocation of $100 billion efficiently. They argue that it is a more difficult task to design institutions that enable spending such a huge amount of funds in an efficient way, than it is to find these funds. They argue that even though the approach should be global, the implementation of measures should be locally embedded and adapted to local circumstances. For achieving this, it is most often not appropriate to implement a hierarchical arrangement in which national government ministries act as \u2018gatekeepers\u2019. On the other hand, direct engagement with small-scale local agencies may create significant transaction costs for large global-scale environmental funds, which makes this approach also infeasible. Evidence suggests that international and national institutions best facilitate technology transfer and subnational adaptation activities when they provide knowledge, establish legal mandates and create sustainable financing mechanisms to support adaptation done by local institutions. Global financing that is restricted to national government bodies may fail to engage the energy, skills and operational effectiveness of non-government and subnational actors. The authors start their plea by reiterating the five overarching principles of effective development finance: 1. Ownership by partner countries and local institutions 2. Alignment of overall support with national development strategies 3. Harmonization of donors\u2019 actions as well as transparency and effectiveness ",
        "60 4. Managing for results 5. Mutual accountability They further argue that despite the developing countries\u2019 opposition to viewing climate finance as aid, it is very likely that an institution like the Green Climate fund will follow the same kind of project/programme model as in other aid financing structures. For effective technology transfer and effective adaptation it is therefore imperative that managerial and financial capacities are provided by the international institutions as these are often not locally available. Also transparency and accountability towards all project partners are key, as well as a strong national involvement of the receiving nation. Finally, it is important that projects are implemented at sufficiently local scale and that these local stakeholders are also involved in the entire procedure. After reiterating the basics of effective development finance, the authors turn towards issues which are specific for the environmental technology transfer funds. One issue is additionality as the resources that are going into this new fund should be \u2018new and additional\u2019 with respect to existing development finance. The associated recommendation that the authors give is to source funds from somewhere else than the typical government budgets that are going into development aid. One possibility would be to use funds that arise from climate change flexibility mechanisms, such as CDM. Another issue is embeddedness. Flows of funds into climate change adaptation measures may be highly important from a developed country perspective. However, if they do not provide any other specific benefits in developing areas (such as improved education, better farming practices, etc.) then their acceptability in developing nations may be low. The authors propose to look for co-benefits and to clearly decouple the additionality of funds (which should be as clear as possible), from the additionality of the activities that are funded (which should not be clearly decoupled). Another issue is the uncertainty that is inherent to climate change science and its potential impact. Therefore, it makes more sense to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience against climate change through a bottom-up approach of capacity building, rather than a top- down approach that is based on implementation of specific measures that should reduce the projected climate change impacts. Another issue is the avoidance of maladaptation in the sense that actions taken to reduce vulnerability to climate change may also have adverse effects on other systems or sector or social groups. The authors propose to have thorough environmental impact assessment requirements in place, with periodic reviews to correct potential mistakes timely. If possible, they are also in favour of incremental deployment to learn from initial mistakes. As a final important issue they argue for the creation of an authorative body that should be in responsible for collecting, analysing and sharing knowledge and lessons learned from implementation of previous projects. The same authors (Van Kerkhoff et al., 2011) also conduct a short review of the effectiveness of other climate funds. They take the example of GEF as a typical government-led fund and analyse the CDM to learn about market-based financing. They assess the GEF as being perceived as a \u2018typical aid\u2019 programme with little or no additionality, despite its focus on funding additional costs for projects that arise due to measures which provide clear environmental benefits. Another problem with GEF, at least in the perception of developing countries and thus in terms of acceptability of this programme, is its focus on global benefits. Therefore, little investments are done in adaptation measures, which is what developing countries are mainly looking for. Other problems evaluated with respect to GEF are the slow administrative processes and the low involvement of businesses and civil society. The CDM is a very different story from GEF, because it relies much more on private investments and market-based incentives. The authors evaluate the CDM projects at generally effective. However, most projects are done in emerging economies (China 55%, India 15%) and concern large-scale projects because these are the most profitable carbon reduction projects for private firms. Also, the focus is very much on CO2 reduction and the potential that these projects can cause certain negative externalities in other areas or regions does not get enough attention. As a result, these projects tend to involve very less co- benefits from the broad economic and social perspective. In sum, CDM works effectively as a mitigation device, but performs relatively less as a general development aid or a social ",
        "61 adaptation device. We are going to consider the environmental technology transfer aspects of the CDM programme in more detail in the next section. Project Catalyst (2010) puts forward the following design criteria for a global climate finance system: \uf0b7 Mobilise a predictable, sufficient supply of climate finance \uf0b7 Generate demand for that finance by building a pipeline of large-scale abatement and adaptation programs \uf0b7 Deploy climate financing resources to take advantage of the most cost-effective abatement and adaptation opportunities \uf0b7 Provide a range of financial instruments to match diverse funding requirements across sectors and around the globe \uf0b7 Free up an increasing share of public financing over time to tackle a likely increase in demand for adaptation investments \uf0b7 Attract and mobilise complementary private sector capital investment at scale \uf0b7 Generate synergies with existing systems of development finance \uf0b7 Operate transparently: to make clear the sources and uses of climate funds Van Aalst (2004) proposes four tools to improve access to climate change related technology transfer: \uf0b7 Look for added value for all stakeholders (policy makers, financiers and developers of projects and technologies) \uf0b7 Specify and quantify benefits as much as possible \uf0b7 Link climate change theme to other themes to improve economic and financial sustainability of a project \uf0b7 Effective policy frameworks should be in place for good communication; stable and sustainable reflecting long financing horizons and meeting legally binding targets 4.2.2 Technology transfer projects We constructed a sample of environmental technology transfer projects, by drawing on the knowledge of the consortium partners that were involved in the project (VITO, DTI, REC & IDEA Consult). With the exception of the CDM initiative, no systematic and public accessible repository of environmental technology transfer projects exists. In Table 1, we show the number of cases included in our sample and the nature of their funding (public or private). We also give an idea about geographical scope by showing the region of the technology transfer target countries. The projects that we included in our sample mostly involved \u2018classical\u2019 transfer of technologies from Western developed countries towards developing areas.

        "62 The underrepresentation of private technology transfer projects in our sample probably originates from the way that the sample was constructed. This sample cannot be treated as a random, unbiased sample because the technology transfer programmes and projects identified were the ones within the knowledge range and network of the project team. However, we do believe that this sample gives an idea of technology transfer practice and can allow a number of lessons to be drawn. We collected information on the following programme or project characteristics: their (annual) budgets, which specific technologies they target & the expertise that they invoke. In addition, we also collected some additional specificity on whether the projects have specific components targeting training and whether the technology transfer concerns products, services or technologies. We also discuss the financing of the projects in more detail. We start by analysing project duration. Figure 17: Duration of technology transfer projects that we identified The average length of the projects in our sample is almost 3 years. We see that the distribution is skewed to the right, with a small number of projects that have a relatively long duration. This implies that a relatively high number of projects only take 1 year. At first sight, this seems rather short to have a long-term impact, yet we do not have information on potential up-scaling activities or follow-up initiatives which might have been done. Ideally this should be assessed for each project specifically. When we look at the distribution of project budgets (represented in Figure 18), we find that most projects in the sample work with a budget below 3 million \u20ac. 02468 10 12 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 More F r e q u e n c y Years ",
        "63 Figure 18: Technology transfer project budgets On the subject of the specific technologies that are being transferred, Table 2 shows that many projects deal with the topic of efficient energy use or with the issue of more efficient waste treatment/materials handling. Other projects are related to efficient use of water resources, measures to help climate change adaptation or mitigation, improving food quality or productivity of food sector, environmental pollution abatement, developing business opportunities or helping to deal with technical regulations/requirements. Notice that adding up these numbers gives a sum which is higher than 44, but this is due to the fact that one project can involve different types of technology transfer. Table 2: Overview of technologies that are being transferred Energy use 13 Waste management/materials treatment/recycling 12 Climate change adaptation & mitigation 6 Efficient use of water resources 5 Environmental pollution/air quality 5 Business capabilities/SME/IP 5 Technical regulations 5 Food production & food quality 4 With respect to the expertise involved in these projects, we find that there is often a combination of technical knowledge together with management skills on (government) policy and finance. This seems to be a good combination for obtaining effective technology transfer. In Table 3, we give an overview of other characteristics on environmental technology transfer projects. We find that the majority of projects have a clear and targeted training component. With respect to transfer of products and services, our sample shows that transfer of services is included more often than transfer of products, but that investment and training are needed to establish effective transfer of services. When transfer of technologies is involved, it is most often the case that existing technologies need to be adapted to local circumstances, or 02468 10 12 14 1.000.000 2.000.000 3.000.000 4.000.000 More F r e q u e n c y Budget (in \u20ac ) ",
        "64 sometimes new technologies even need to be invented. Finally, even though budgets are often co-financed, in our sample financial means often come for the highest share from the developed country and/or from an international organization. This last result holds for the projects where we could obtain information about project financing.

The UNFCCC provides an overall framework to co-ordinate and channel the inter-governmental efforts that deal with climate challenges. In terms of implementation the CDM and JI are relatively well known mechanisms. In the area of technology advice CC:iNet and TT:Clear are valuable platforms for knowledge exchange on environmental technologies. Also in terms of providing funding the institutional framework is well established with e.g. the Global Environmental Facility with the Least Developed Country Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund, the World Bank\u2019s Climate Investment Fund and Clean Technology Fund. Also the European Investment Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank invest in environmental technology transfer. Specifically relevant for financing the adaptation to climate change of developing countries, the December 2011 COP meeting at Durban agreed to establish a Green Climate Fund. However, various authors analysing the design and effectiveness of various programmes indicate that e.g. the Green Climate Fund is too state-centred. A multi-stakeholder model is favoured in which civil society, the private sector and NGOs participate directly in governing bodies and decision-making. Another challenge is bridging the global scale collection of funds with the need to implement measures in a locally embedded manner and that are adapted to local circumstances. ",
        "65 Looking at the sample of 44 environmental technology transfer projects we found indeed international funds did play an important role and that the majority of the projects were funded by public funds only. The projects were mainly short-term (1-3 years) and with budgets in the range from 1 to 3 million \u20ac. Energy use and waste materials recycling were among the most popular environmental technologies transferred. And in the majority of the projects the technology was adapted to local conditions or involved local inventions. In more than half of the projects training was an explicit objective especially in relation to the transfer of services. 4.3 Network analysis of project interactions in the framework of the CDM initiative 4.3.1 Introduction The purpose of this section is to identify the general patterns in geographic distribution of the cooperative projects being (having been) implemented in the framework of the CDM initiative, which we have chosen as one of the indicative policy initiatives which involves transfer of environmental technologies to developing countries. The CDM programme allows emission-reduction projects in developing countries to earn certified emission reduction credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2. These credits can be traded and sold, and used by industrialized countries to meet a part of their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Among the declared priorities of the CDM programme the priorities of technology development and transfer are clearly stated in both the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol 45 . Article 4.1 of the Convention requires that all parties promote and collaborate in the development, application and diffusion of the GHG (Green House Gases) mitigation technologies and of environmentally of other relevant technologies that are in the public domain 46 . The mechanism stimulates sustainable development and emission reductions, while giving industrialized countries some flexibility in how they meet their emission reduction limitation targets. Furthermore, there are additional co-benefits of the investment in climate change mitigation CDM-projects such as the transfer of technology and know-how which are not available in the host countries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines technology transfer \u201cas a broad set of processes covering the flows of know-how, experience and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change amongst different stakeholders such as governments, private sector entities, financial institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and research/education institutions.\u201d The contribution that the CDM makes to technology transfer \u2013 by financing emission reduction projects that use technologies currently not available in the host countries - may be seen in this light. CDM project participants are not specifically required to report technology transfer but are required to provide details in PDDs on the technology used for their projects in the PDDs and, from these, information on technology transfer can be derived. 45 UNFCCC, 1992, Article 4.1. 46 UNFCCC, 1997, Article 10(c).

The available data do not allow us to judge about the extent of the actual realized technology transfer, because the project information contains only the projected characteristics of the CO2 reduction as the main project outcome. It is not possible without going into the individual project details to mke deductions about the actual technology transfer performance. As it was mentioned in the previous section the CDM initiative is not focused on environmental technology transfer as its main goal. These technology transfer aspects are ",
        "67 considered as secondary benefits from implementation of the programme\u2019s projects, as well as other broader social and development benefits. Nonetheless, the technology transfer component is inherently present in a large number of the CMD\u2019s eligible technologies. According to the recent UNFCCC study 47 , about 30% of all projects in the CDM pipeline as of 2010 involved technology transfer. These projects accounted for approximately 48% of the estimated emission reductions. According to the UNFCCC (2011) report, CDM technology domains such as Energy Efficiency (Industry), HFCs, N2O, Transportation and Wind projects are more likely than average to involve technology transfer. While other technologies, such as Afforestation, Biomass Energy, Cement, Fugitive Gas, Hydro, PFCs and SF6, and Reforestation are less likely to involve a clear technology transfer. In the list of the most frequently used technologies in Table 4 the projects from the first group of technologies are well represented pointing out that de facto the environmental technology transfer benefits are quite noticeable. Therefore we can expect interesting and important insights into the patterns of environmental technologies transfer facilitated by the CDM programme. 4.3.2 The data In Table 5 we can see that it is a small number of countries, which attract the largest individual projects proposed in the framework of the CDM programme. The top 20 projects are located in just four countries with 14 being located in China, four in India, one in Brazil and one in Republic of Korea. 47 UNFCCC (2011), \u201cThe Contribution of the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol To Technology Transfer\u201d ",

The concepts and methods of network analysis are grounded in a formal description of networks as graphs. Methods of analysis primarily originate from graph theory as these are applied to the graph representation of social network data. Network analysis also applies statistical and probabilistic methods and to a lesser extent algebraic techniques. The methods of data collection in network analysis are aimed at collecting relational data in a reliable manner. As a whole, these specific data describe the interactions between the partner countries in the framework of individual joint CDM projects as reported in the databases. In their vast majority these project represent the environmental technology transfer initiatives. 4.3.3.1 Analysis Tool For each of the cooperative interaction we have acquired the following data: Table 6: Source data structure for the network analysis software | Host Partner| Other Partner | Project Title/Code | CO2 Reduction | Comments | The network analysis of these data is implemented with the use of the Cytoscape software package which is a recognized tool for network analysis in natural and social sciences (see Box below). 2230 738 164 89 63 35 30 12 21 12 13 3 7 2 7 3 3 3 1 0 5 0 0 1 0 0 01 5 0 02 0 0 02 5 0 0 F r e q u e n c y 0 500000 1000000 1500000 2000000 Reductions ",
        "70 Box 2: The Cytoscape software platform for network analysis After the data are imported into the analysis software package, we use the internal network data processing tools to eliminate the \u201cSelf-Loops\u201d and the duplicated links corresponding to the same project (if such are detected). In the analysis stage we created the general visualisations of the networks and eventually calculate the relevant quantitative network parameters. 4.3.3.2 Visualisation technique The main type of the diagrams we intend to use is so called spring embedded visualisation of a network. The spring-embedded layout is based on an idea of a \u201cforce-directed\u201d network as implemented in Kamada and Kawai (1988). The network nodes are treated like physical objects that repel each other, such as electrons. The linkages between nodes are treated like metal springs attached to the pair of nodes. These springs repel or attract their end points according to a force function. The layout algorithm sets the positions of the nodes in a way that minimizes the sum of forces in the network. This algorithm can be applied to the entire network or a portion of it. The final graph is laid out by repeated iterations of a procedure that calculates the repulsive and attractive forces acting on all nodes. In the course of iterative process the nodes in the network are moved according to the resulting forces applied to them. Cytoscape is an open source bioinformatics software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks and biological pathways and integrating these networks with annotations, gene expression profiles and other state data. Although Cytoscape was originally designed for biological research, now it is a general platform for complex network analysis and visualization. Cytoscape is used by social scientists to: \uf0b7 Visualize and analyse large social networks of interpersonal relationships; \uf0b7 Assemble social networks from tables and forms; \uf0b7 Gather social interactions from the web by variety of web service API and scripted web crawlers within Cytoscape; \uf0b7 Calculate network statistics using plugins. Note: Cytoscape is a collaborative project between the Institute for Systems Biology (Leroy Hood lab), the University of California San Diego (Trey Ideker lab), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (Chris Sander lab), the Institut Pasteur (Benno Schwikowski lab), Agilent Technologies (Annette Adler lab) and the University of California, San Francisco (Bruce Conklin lab).

In Figure 20 we present an overall overview on the collaborative project interactions created in the framework of the CMD programme between different countries. As we can see the network of the joint efforts exhibits a high degree of interconnection with the vast majority of countries been involved in projects with more than one partner. There is, nonetheless, a small set of countries whose involvement in the CMD programme is realized via partnership with only one donor countries, which in this way serves as kind of guide to the CMD programme. The countries with the most prominent guiding role are Japan, Great Britain and to a lesser degree Spain (see also Figure 21 for two examples of such collaboration patterns). For the rest of the countries we observe a relatively good degree of interconnection. ",

From the two figures above we obtain the first indication of the large intensity and variety of collaborative efforts implemented in the framework of the CMD projects. Thus, the degree of technology transfer and the possible intensity of diffusion (via multiple interconnections) in this programme is quite high. We also see that there is a large variance in the intensities of collaboration if measured by the volumes of declared CO2 reductions. ",

In Figure 22 we present a circular diagram of the CMD project interactions grouped by the World Bank income classification of countries. As can be expected the donor countries all belong to the group of High Income countries (either OECD or non-OECD members). The recipient countries in their vast majority belong to the group of countries with middle or low income. There are, though, several countries with high income, which also enjoy the benefits of the CO2 reducing technology transfer projects. These countries are: Republic of Korea, Cyprus, Israel and Singapore. There are three countries in our dataset which have a double role in the CMD project network of both donor and recipient country: Philippines, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates. There is (a small) number of projects where these countries serve as the donors in the technology transfer channels. ",
        "74 The case of Republic of Korea especially stands out by the high volume of CO2 reductions realized. These come mostly from project in NO 2 emissions reductions realized in the petrochemical industry. An objective observer in this case can argue that the development assistance element of the projects in this case is not strong and the main impact is realized in the form of substantial equivalent decrease of emissions.

It is also clearly visible that the vast majority of developing countries in the lower income groups (low and lower middle income) are much less actively involved in the CDM programme than their counterparts that are economically better-off.

Other European countries are more \u2018evenly\u2019 involved in the technology transfer project with different foreign participants. It can be expected that the greater involvement of the host countries with partners from more donor countries can have a stronger potential effect on the success of technology transfer initiatives as it allows the hosts to diversify their cooperation and have a larger number of different simultaneously running initiatives.

The most active and the most \u2018networked\u2019 participants will tend to gravitate towards the centre of the diagram and form a core of the network. The less active participants will drift more towards the periphery of the diagram. As we can see in Figure 26, the core of the network is primarily comprised of the donor countries, which are the most active participant. Then we also see a pattern of two distinctive layers around the core consisting of the semi-peripheral and the peripheral participants. ",
        "78 In the semi-periphery we find mostly the countries from Central and Latin America, which appear to be more actively involved in the CMD network than the countries from other regions. Most of the countries from Middle East, Northern and Sub-Saharan Africa are located at the periphery of the diagram, which also can be seen in Figure 23. The Asian countries are present in both the peripheries and close to the core of the network. Looking at the same spring embedded diagram in terms of the income classification of countries in Figure 27 we can observe that the core of the network is comprised of the high income core countries. In the periphery and semi-periphery of the network find countries from different income groups, although the low income countries tend to be located farther away from the core, supporting our earlier findings.

Rectangle: donor country. Diamond: host/recipient. Circle: double role. ",
        "79 4.3.5 Conclusion The main conclusions from the qualitative results of the network analysis we can present as follows: - The network comprised of project interactions in the framework of the CDM programme is quite well interconnected with the most of participants being involved with multiple partners in multiple projects. Therefore, at this stage the degree of potential proliferation of environmental technology transfer activity is high, which asks for a good geographic distribution of the case studies. - The largest projects in terms of the equivalent CO2 reduction are concentrated in a limited number of host countries, which also tend to be relatively more economically developed. There is nonetheless, a substantial number of smaller initiatives which are more distributed geographically. This suggests putting more attention towards the countries, which are less embedded into the analysed technology transfer initiatives, such as countries in Africa and the Middle East. - Measured by the declared volume of CO2 reduction, the degree of participation among individual countries varies substantially. There are a number of recipient countries that are much more actively involved in the CDM projects, than their peers, e.g. China, Brazil, and South Korea. As the CDM programme is determined on a primarily bottom- up principle driven by the commercial interests, the CDM projects corresponding to the large and the most active participants are quite likely to be the ones with the least need for public intervention. - We detect a limited number of strongly expressed bilateral collaboration links between certain donor and recipient countries, e.g. the pairs UK-Equatorial Guinea and Norway-Nigeria. These links do not appear to be the indications of \u2018exclusive\u2019 relationships, because they take place together with a number of other co-operations with different partners. This holds for both donor and recipient types of countries. Therefore in further analyses when conducting a broader overview of the policy initiatives toward environmental technology special attention should be paid to identifying the underlying factors, which lead to the more exclusive technology transfer relationships in particular cases. It is possible that these factors would also strongly influence the success and the up-scaling potential of the individual initiatives as well. - There are noticeable geographic patterns in the intensity and the degree of involvement of individual countries in the CMD programme. The donor countries are the ones mostly involved and forming a core of the network. The countries from Africa and Middle East are considerable less involved in the CDM projects compared to their counterparts from Asia and Central and Latin America. Therefore, the special attention should be paid to the technology transfer projects located in Africa, the Middle East and eventually South Asia. - Given the relatively strong country concentration of CDM initiatives in terms of CO2 reductions, another conclusion that arises from these data is that (technological) absorption capacity indeed seems to matter, but that there is more to it. Also the economic deployment possibilities matter. Local skills, infrastructure, financial capacity, industrial readiness, entrepreneurship and (commercial and research) links with the donor countries give certain economies a predominant position among the environmental technology receivers. The above findings provide us with the first look into the patterns of environmental technology transfer in the context of CO2 reduction objectives. These patterns provide us with directions and indication regarding the choices and the special points of attention when conducting the case studies. ",
        "80 5 RESULTS OF PILLAR 2: CASE STUDIES ON SELECTED ECO- INNOVATIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 5.1 Introduction The analysis in section 4 of this report approached the research topic of this study from a macro point of view. Although this certainly provided valuable insights on overall patterns, certain aspects might still escape attention, particularly when it comes to the question what are the soft, often intangible, conditions that make technology transfer work. For that reason ten cases of non-energy environmental technology transfers to developing countries were selected. Table 7 provides an overview of the ten cases and their properties in terms of environmental technology, the technology development stage and a number of design properties such as type of partnership and transfer elements. In terms of geographical distribution, the cases focus on countries that do not show a predominant activity in the CDM. The cases cover three Asian countries: rural India, Nepal and Vietnam, two countries from the Middle East: Egypt and Jordan, four African countries: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Uganda, and one South American country: Chile. Half of the cases are particularly relevant because of their up-scaling activities. Others, such as the cases of Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo are relevant because of the particular landscape, regime and niche conditions that these countries face. The prevailing environmental technology is clean and efficient production, with three cases (Egypt fish food, Egypt cement course, Vietnam aquaculture). Two cases deal with biogas (Nepal biogas support programme and two-phase gasifier for rural India ). Two cases focus on recycling (plastic waste in DR Congo and WEEE in South Africa). Two cases deal with wood, agriculture and resource use (Lorena stoves in Uganda and environmentally sound practices in Burundi). One case covers water management (the introduction of a new membrane technology for desalination/purification of irrigation water in Chile and Jordan). The ten cases are developed in a comparable outline: after providing the relevant context information indicating why this case was selected, the design is presented in detail. Subsequently the results are analysed focussing on drivers, but also barriers. The cases conclude with lessons learned and policy recommendations. ",

        "83 5.2 Biogas support programme in Nepal 5.2.1 Summary The Biogas Support Programme (BSP) in Nepal managed to install over 250.000 domestic biogas plants in rural households between 1992 and 2011. The plants use cattle manure to provide biogas for cooking and lighting, replacing traditional energy sources such as fuel wood, agricultural residue and dung. Benefits of the technology include improved sanitation and health, workload reduction, energy savings, improved agricultural production, employment, soil quality conservation and reduced deforestation. The programme focuses on the development of a commercially viable and market-driven sector in which private construction companies play a major role. The combination of a well-adapted design, investment subsidies for farmers and strict quality requirements and control made the programme very successful. It was extended several times and continues up to the present date (2012), reaching a relatively wide diffusion throughout rural Nepal. 5.2.2 Context, selection, goals and ambitions 5.2.2.1 Country context Nepal is the poorest country of South Asia, where 76.6% of the population is living with less than US$2 a day. Depleting forest resources coupled with increasing population present important challenges with regard to energy supply, especially in rural areas. 85% of the population is engaged in the agricultural sector and in most rural areas over 95% are dependent on fuel wood and biomass for cooking. This heavy dependence on fuel- wood has caused a prevailing deforestation around villages and associated negative impact on the local and global environment. Overexploitation of forest resources has increased wood collection time and cost, loss of habitat, forest degradation, soil erosion and damage to the watershed. Apart from domestic fuel use, forests are also under pressure from agricultural land expansion, resettlements, fodder collection, timber harvesting, industrial fuel-wood use and road construction. As a result of the declining availability of fuel wood, households have been turning to the use of agricultural residues and animal dung as a fuel source. Depriving the soil of these traditional organic fertilizers has resulted in declining soil fertility and reduced crop yields. Women and children are typically in charge of collecting fuel wood and dung. They are also most affected by the adverse health impacts of the smoke emitted from wood and biomass combustion. Because many small-scale farmers in Nepal possess a few cows, biogas has a huge potential to improve the life of the people living in rural Nepal, while at the same time protecting the environment. 5.2.2.2 History of biogas technology in Nepal and the Biogas Support Programme (BSP) Biogas was first introduced to Nepal on an experimental basis in 1955, when Reverend Father Saubolle installed a demonstration biogas system in a school. After this pioneering installation, it took almost 20 years before the technology gained attention. The first official biogas program was launched in 1974 by the government of Nepal, including interest-free loans for potential customers, financed by the Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADB/N). In 1977 the state owned Gobar Gas Company (GGC) was established, which meant a breakthrough for biogas technology. Prior to 1985, the installation rate of biogas systems ranged between 100 and 300 units per year. In the Seventh Five Year Plan (1985-1989) the Government set the target to the construction of 800 units per year. To meet this target, subsidy funds were provided to support the ",
        "84 installations (25% for capital cost and 50% for interest costs on loans). The initial experiments showed that the biogas technology was suitable for meeting a significant portion of rural household energy needs, primarily cooking and lighting. Additionally it had the potential to reduce deforestation and its associated social, environmental and economic pressures. The Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) got involved in the program in 1989 to provide the GGC with technical assistance to help improve their product and to reduce costs in order to increase the affordability for a wider range of farmers. Figure 28: Project history and main figures In spite of the benefits, the biogas systems did not break through on a large scale as rural farmers were not motivated to adopt the technology for their energy and fertiliser supply. As a result, the Biogas Support Program was started in 1992, in a joint effort between the Nepalese Government, ADB/N and the SNV, with funding from the Directorate General for International Cooperation (DGIS) of the Netherlands. As the project was very successful, it was prolonged several times. BSP phase I had the objective of the installation of 7,000 biogas plants by the state-company GGC by 1994, which was increased with an additional 13.200 units by 1997 in BSP phase II. Phase II also involved private companies in the program, which stimulated the development of a market for biogas technology. Since 1997 (BSP III) the German Development Bank (KfW) has also been a co-funding organisation. The fourth phase of the BSP (since 2003) was aimed at further development, dissemination and commercialisation of biogas as a mainstream renewable energy solution. In 2011 about 80 private companies (with about 200 local offices) were active in the domestic biogas sector in Nepal 48 . The technical potential of domestic biogas in Nepal is estimated to be about 1 million households (Van Nes, 2012). To be a potential biogas user, a household needs to own at least a few cattle capable of producing about 20 kg manure a day to feed the system. The poorest farmers that do not own any livestock are not targeted by the programme. This implies that with the installation of 250,000 plants up to 2011 about 25% of the potential users in Nepal have been reached (SNV, 2012). It is still a challenge of the coming years to further scale-up the biogas program while maintaining a viable market- led biogas sector (see further sections). Recently even smaller scale biogas plants have been developed that can cope with smaller amounts of manure (12-13 kg) in order to reach an even poorer segment of rural society (Van Nes, 2012). BSP phase V is under design at the moment in the framework of the wider Rural and Renewable Energy Programme (RREP). This Programme will be funded by the Nepal, Norwegian and Danish 48 List of recognized companies (15/02/2011) available from: http://www.bspnepal.org.np/images/pdfs/company-list%2067-68.pdf 1955 1975 1992 1994 1997 2003 2012 Pre-BSP stage BSP I and II BSP III BSP IV Technology developmentand introduction Market development and regulation Market expansion Consolidation and commercialisation Budget (US$): 9,5 mio 21,8 mio 8,7 mio + 5 mio 171 mio Target (n\u00b0 of plants) 13.200 + 100.000 + 200.000 RREP 2017 ",
        "85 Government, the KfW, CDM revenues and GPOBA with technical support of SNV and GIZ. The programme aims at delivering rural access to renewable energy with different technologies (e.g. solar systems, micro-hydropower, biogas, improved cook stoves,...). The RREP will provide financial (subsidies and credits) and technical support. The RREP will be executed by the Alternative Energy promotion Centre (AECP), implementation will be in partnership with the Government of Nepal (GoN), NGOs and the private sector, while the financial support will be managed by the Central Renewable Energy Fund (CREF). (these institutions are described further in the following chapters) More than 1.4 households can be reached by RREP, especially aiming at remote areas and disadvantaged groups. The expected budget will be 171 million US$ for five years (2012- 2017), of which the Government of Nepal will provide 40%. The RREF is planned to go into action in July 2012 (DANIDA, 2012). 5.2.2.3 Domestic biogas technology The Biogas Support Programme (BSP) aims to implement domestic biogas plants for cooking, basic lighting and organic fertiliser of households in rural Nepal. Since its start in 1992, the strategy of the programme has been to develop a commercially viable biogas sector in which local companies market, install and service the biogas plants. The principal objective is to promote the wide-scale use of biogas as a substitute for wood, agricultural residues, animal dung and kerosene that are used currently. The BSP managed the installation of over 250,000 domestic biogas plants in rural Nepal between 1992 and 2011 (SNV, 2012). Domestic biogas plants convert cattle manure and human excrement at household level into combustible gas (60-70% methane, 30-40% carbon dioxide) by anaerobic fermentation. This biogas is odourless and burns without smoke production, making it suitable for use in simple gas stoves for cooking and in lamps for lighting. The residue of the process, bio-slurry, can be used as an organic fertiliser to enhance agricultural productivity. To function properly, a minimum of 20 kg of manure is required on a daily basis to generate enough biogas for basic cooking and lighting needs (standard system size is 4m\u00b3). This means that the technology is suitable for farmers keeping a minimum of two cattle or six adult pigs. The digester can also be connected to the toilet, improving sanitation. Investment costs for a plant vary between \u20ac 300 and \u20ac 600, depending on size, location of construction and geographical region. For schools and hospitals, larger biogas plants can be constructed. Recently, a smaller plant of 2 m\u00b3 has been developed to accommodate a poorer segment of farmers with fewer cattle (12-13 kg of manure a day) (Van Nes, 2012). ",
        "86 Figure 29: Schematic presentation of a \u2018fixed dome\u2019 domestic biogas system in Nepal Source: Van Nes (2012) The biogas system provides multiple benefits at different levels, which can be classified according to their impact on gender, sanitation and health, energy savings, agricultural production, employment and environment (for details see section 5.2.4.1). The use of biogas especially improves the life of women, who get more free time and a healthier home environment. The main benefits perceived by the beneficiaries are the savings of time and money (for fuel collection or purchase) as well as the improvement of indoor air quality. As not all farmers use the bio-slurry, this is only an important element for some of the beneficiaries. Only a minority reported the environmental aspects (deforestation, climate change) as important incentives to purchasing a biogas installation. 5.2.2.4 Relevance of this case study for the project The Biogas Support Programme (BSP) is a very valuable case study in terms of transfer of eco-technologies to a developing country. Both the biogas technology itself and the BSP have a long history in Nepal. Due to this long history, the technology has already reached a fairly wide-spread diffusion. Additionally, SNV has a good tradition in documenting and assessing its projects in great detail, which provided us with a vast amount of information on the development and scaling-up of the program. This elaborate field experience allows us to learn many valuable lessons on technology introduction, development and diffusion. In Figure 30 the case study has been located on the technology transfer and transition curve. Given the wide-spread dissemination of the technology throughout Nepal, the technology has left its niche status and has grown into a mature technology that is making its way into the regime. By 2011, only about 25% of its total technical potential has been reached. Thus, there is still room for further diffusion. A major concern is the fact that the biogas market for the moment still relies heavily on external funding (by KfW, GPOBA and Nepalese government) for its viability and that especially the poorer farmers rely on investment subsidies for purchase of a system. In 2011 the BSP succeeded in obtaining carbon credits from the UNFCCC for a few bundles of biogas plants, and this strategy is now included in the further elaboration of the program, in order to assure a sustainable funding in the future (SNV, 2012). ",
        "87 Figure 30: Position of the case study on the technology transfer and transition curve 5.2.3 Design The BSP represents a partnership between the Government of Nepal, the Directorate General for International Cooperation of the Netherlands (DGIS) (until 2010), the German Financial Cooperation through the German Development bank (KfW) (since 1997), SNV and a large number and variety of international, national and local stakeholders including WWF, GIZ, the private sector and the rural farmers of Nepal. 5.2.3.1 Main stakeholders The Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) launched the BSP in 1992 and was the implementing organisation until 2003. Currently, SNV has reduced its technical assistance to the programme and has terminated the channelling of DGIS funds. Biogas Sector Partnership Nepal (BSP/N) was established as an NGO in 2003 to take over the implementation management of BSP Phase-IV from SNV, as a first step towards an independent biogas sector in Nepal. Its primary roles are to provide training to users and companies, ensure quality and long-term reliability of plants and manage the subsidy programme. BSP-Nepal does not itself install biogas plants, but works as an operational apex body. International Cooperation of the Netherlands (DGIS) is the historical donor of BSP, from its beginning in 1992 until 2010. Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau of Germany (KfW) started funding the BSP at the start of Phase-lll (1997). KfW\u2019s financial support, which mainly backs the subsidies for the biogas plants as well as the credit provision to end-users, will probably continue into phase V.

        "88 Government of Nepal (GoN) has been supporting the development of biogas since 1975, when it introduced biogas in the development plan and by the disbursement of interest-free-loans. Now the GoN bears an increased share of the financial participation in the project. Since 2007 GoN is receiving subsidy funding from the World Bank (through GPOBA). Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC) was established in 1996 to promote alternative energies with a focus on the rural sector. This is the executive \u201carm\u201d of the GoN for all programs related to alternative and decentralized energies. AEPC\u2019s main roles are the formulation of policies, promotion of appropriate rural energy technologies, set up of strong partnerships, establishment of a test station and information centre and R&D on renewable energy technology. In the framework of BSP, AEPC supervises the BSP programme, recommends biogas policies to the GoN and is in charge of the control of the subsidy distribution and biogas credits for farmers through MFIs. Nepal Biogas Promotion Association (NBPA) was established in 1994 in association with the biogas construction companies to organise the private sector. They support the private sector by providing business management and marketing training. Biogas Construction Companies (BCC) are the \u201cexecutive arm\u201d of the programme, marketing, installing and maintaining the biogas plants all over the country. About 80 companies are recognised by the programme, entailing over 200 local offices. 49 The BCCs vary from small to medium and big local enterprises, employing mostly masons for the construction. Banks and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) provide loans and other financial products to households and biogas companies. National Cooperative Federation of Nepal (NCF/N) works together with AEPC to promote biogas through its members and to maximize the micro-credit flow through cooperatives. On a local level, additional actors are coming into play: District Development Committees (DDC) and village development committees (VDC) used to be little involved in the biogas sector, but are starting to take action by providing additional subsidies or technical support for biogas. With the support of the AEPC each DDC has established a District Environment and Energy Unit (DEEU) that coordinates, promotes and monitors renewable energy programmes at the local level. 49 List of recognized companies (15/02/2011) available from: http://www.bspnepal.org.np/images/pdfs/company-list%2067-68.pdf ",
        "89 Figure 31: Overview of stakeholders and partnerships within the biogas programme Source SNV (2009). 5.2.3.2 Targeted beneficiaries Households : By the end of 2011, over 250,000 rural households in the 75 districts of Nepal received technical and financial support for the construction of their own biogas plants. Biogas Construction Companies (BCC) and workshops . About 80 BCCs and 16 appliance workshops received technical support, training and qualification from the project, creating more than 11,000 direct and indirect jobs (SAESUp, 2010). The Government of Nepal (GoN) has been receiving technical support to develop adequate national policies and regulations regarding domestic biogas. Additionally, the BSP contributes to poverty alleviation and economic development efforts carried out by the GoN. A larger group of local organisations was provided with financial and technical support including NBPA , AEPC , BSP-N , training institutes , NGOs promoting biogas in their areas, universities , etc. This all contributed to the building of the biogas sector in Nepal. 5.2.3.3 Financial resources Project financing An important factor in the success of the BSP has been the dedicated vision and sustained support of its principal donors (total budget per phase see Figure 28). DGIS ",
        "90 has been continuously supporting the programme through SNV since 1992. The financing of BSP I and II was divided as follows: \uf0b7 43% by Nepalese banks (mainly ADB/N) through investment loans to farmers \uf0b7 44% by DGIS (through SNV) for project management, subsidy funding and technical assistance \uf0b7 12% cash payments by farmers buying a biogas plant \uf0b7 1% by participation fees of companies Since BSP phase III (1997), the support of DGIS has been complemented by co-funding of the German Development Bank KfW (aimed at subsidy funding). Additionally, the support of the Nepalese Government has been increasing by 1% per year since 2003, resulting in 28% of the total subsidy contribution of the program by July 2010. This continuous support has been one of the main factors for a smooth and steady development of the biogas sector in Nepal, avoiding \u2018stop and go\u2019 effects that are often responsible for the failure of projects all over the world. The contribution of DGIS ended in 2010. However, recently, with assistance of SNV, KfW and the World Bank, BSP-Nepal succeeded in registering some biogas projects as CDM projects. With the issue of the first carbon credits by UNFCCC in 2011, the financial future of the programme looks bright. Securing a steady flow of carbon revenue is crucial for its financial sustainability and decreases the dependence on external funding. Already 92,278 carbon credits were issued in the 2 nd half of 2011, and more are expected for 2013. It is estimated that the carbon financing could provide an annual revenue of up to 5 million US$ by the year 2014/15. This amount meets the current annual expenditure level of the programme, including the subsidies for the farmers. Carbon credits would make the programme self- financing, ensuring a successful continuation even without donor and government funding (SNV, 2012). The new Rural and Renewable Energy Programme (RREP) which allows a continuation of the BSP, will be funded by the Nepal, Norwegian and Danish Government, the KfW, CDM revenues and GPOBA with technical support of SNV and GIZ. The expected budget will be 171 million US$ for five years (2012-2017), of which the Government of Nepal will provide 40%. (DANIDA, 2012). Financing instruments within the project The programme was designed in such a way that project funds are directed maximally towards the target group (farmers) directly, avoiding that financial resources are pruned away by sellers or manufacturers. The investment cost for a domestic biogas plant ranges between 300 and 600 euros, which is very high in a country where 76.6% of the population lives with less than US$ 2 a day. To reach poor farmers, financial investment support is necessary. Therefore, financing of the domestic biogas plants in Nepal is supported by investments subsidies, credit facilities and favourable taxation systems. Investment subsidies are provided by a fund sustained by the Nepalese government, KfW and DGIS. On average, the subsidy rate is 25-35% of the total investment costs and the scheme is adjusted to the poverty and vulnerability of the applicants and remoteness of the area, in order to reach a poorer and larger segment of the rural population. The subsidy scheme is also used to impose quality requirements on the biogas construction companies in order to guarantee quality and reliability of the appliances delivered to farmers. Even though the original purpose of SNV was to reduce and possibly eliminate the subsidies, the Nepalese government has chosen to keep the subsidy system, in order to support potential customers with lower incomes. Also an ethical issue plays a role: as ",
        "91 recently carbon credits were issued to the programme, it seems only \u2018fair\u2019 to redistribute these incomes for the benefit of the population (Van Nes, 2012) Apart from the subsidy, the required investments are made possible through suitable credit facilities . In order to promote the development of micro-credit for biogas plants, a Biogas Credit Fund (BCF) has been set up, which is managed by AEPC. The fund provides loans to cooperatives and MFIs to enable them to provide medium-term loans to farmers. Apart from funding, they also receive training on credit management, risks associated with loans, cost benefits of biogas, recovery rates, etc.). About 31% of all installed biogas plants are credit financed through one of the 238 MFIs or Nepalese banks. This rate decreased a bit last year to 20% due to various reasons, but will get increased attention under RREP (Marree, 2012). Apart from subsidies and credits, biogas systems are also favoured by tax exemptions (VAT), starting from 1999. 5.2.3.4 Training and capacity building The BSP has conducted a variety of training programs in order to strengthen the capacities of all key stakeholders involved in the programme, such as BCCs, lending banks, biogas inspectors, officials, extension staff and end-users. By 2003, more than 126.000 persons had been trained in various aspects of biogas technology. Refresher training is also available as part of the training component. Training to Users is provided both by the BCCs as part of the installation process as well as by the BSP itself to promote specific practices to increase production. Technical constraints (e.g. maintaining minimum digester temperatures, availability of manure and water,\u2026) and guidelines on operation and minor repairs are provided in illustrative manuals and user trainings, funded by the project. The elaborate training programs have contributed to the fact that more than 90% of the plants constructed under BSP are in operation. Training to BCCs is conducted through several different regional training centres. BSP provides training to the instructors of these centres (\u2018train the trainers\u2019), who in turn provide training to the individual participants. Since the project started, over 6,000 people have been trained in plant construction and masonry. Trainings (theoretical and practical by internship) are organised within the staff working for or recommended by a BCC. This has several advantages: (i) the trainee selection lies with the BCC, (ii) in most cases a trainee has a guarantee of employment by the BCC and (iii) as the trainee is already involved in the biogas sector, probability increases that he will stay working within the sector and not change to another job afterwards. These factors add significantly to the effectiveness of the training efforts. Each trained mason receives a registration number and accreditation card. In addition to the technical trainings for masons, BSP organises trainings for BCCs to improve their skills in business management, financial management and marketing. Institutional capacity building is also an impact aspect in the training activities of BSP. The Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC) has been established to support and organise all renewable energy programmes. Moreover, the private sector has been organised in an association which prevents bad practices and strengthens the capacities of the member companies. The BSP was organised in such a way that a maximum of the existing organisational and institutional capacities already available in the country were involved and strengthened through local capacity building organisations. As an outsider, and back-up by its recognised capability in the field of domestic biogas, SNV played an important role in bringing stakeholders together and reaching consensus on the way forward (SNV, 2009).

        "92 Training to financial agencies is managed by AEPC. Cooperatives and MFIs that provide investment loans to farmers receive training on credit management, risks associated with loans, cost benefits of biogas, recovery rates, etc. 5.2.4 Analysis: results, drivers and obstacles 5.2.4.1 Results The Biogas Support Programme installed 111,395 domestic biogas systems throughout rural Nepal in the period 1992-2003, increasing to over 250,000 units in 2011 (SNV, 2012). The BSP has helped to open the market for the production of biogas plants in Nepal. As a result, in 2011 about 80 companies and 16 appliance workshops had entered into the programme (200 offices throughout Nepal). In order to keep high technology standards, all companies need to comply with strict quality and service standards in order to be eligible to the subsidy scheme that is provided to the farmers. As a result of the growing competition, sustained R&D efforts have continuously optimised the technical design, initiated quality control measures and reduced the net cost of biogas plants, while some modifications were made to increase the quality and lifetime of the biogas plants also increasing the capital cost (Van Nes, 2012a). Adequate training and quality control has made a significant contribution to the fact that over 90% of all installed biogas plants are operational and 91% of clients are satisfied (Manandhar (2011)). The biogas system provides multiple social, economic and environmental benefits, which are listed and quantified for an average domestic biogas plant in Table 8. Total benefits can be calculated by multiplying by the total number of installations (250,000 in 2011, SNV(2012)). The benefits can vary importantly between individual biogas plants as over time, with smaller biogas plants installed by smaller farmers generating fewer benefits compared to the bigger plants installed in the early days of BSP (Van Nes, 2012a). Table 8: Overview of the main benefits of biogas plants realised through the BSP in Nepal Type of benefit Description of benefit B e n e f i t s f o r t h e U S E R Gender: Reduction of work load for collecting fire wood, cooking and cleaning by women and children saving of 1 to 3 hours per day, that can be used for education, leisure or income-generating activities Sanitation and health: Better hygienic conditions and decrease of eye and lung problems * no indoor smoke pollution * about 60% of all biogas plants have toilets attached * improved dung management Energy saving (cost saving) * saving of 1,000-3,000 kg of fire-wood per year Increase of agricultural production * saving of max. 1000 kg of agricultural residue and max. 500 kg of dried manure per year (originally used for cooking) * saving of chemical fertiliser (max. 39 kg N, 19 kg P and 39 kg K per year) by using the bio-slurry residue (10 m\u00b3 per year of organic compost) * preserving soil quality (nutriments and organic matter), leading to less need for land expansion and deforestation.

Reduction of deforestation not quantified, linked with fire wood reduction. This also reduces soil erosion and improves watershed management Source: (SAESUp, 2010, completed based on several references (see list)) The Ashden International award 2005 has been given to BSP-N for raising the living standards of the people living in the rural areas of Nepal with clean and reliable energy through the promotion and successful use of biogas. 50 Despite all the positive developments, BSP has only reached about 25% of the 1 million potential households that are technically capable of using biogas (Van Nes, 2012, Manandhar, 2011). It is a challenge for the coming years to further scale-up the program while maintaining a viable market-led biogas sector. The project strategy is to focus first on the medium or well-of families that have enough investment capacity. When the technology is already established and demonstrated in an area, a second step is to reach poorer families and more remote areas by providing additional subsidies, adapting design or material use and selling smaller size plants (Van Nes, 2012). However, as investment costs are relatively high and at least some livestock is necessary, the programme does not reach the poorest segment of the population. 50 http://www.bspnepal.org.np/ ",
        "94 Figure 32: Spatial distribution of biogas plants in Nepal Source: Manandhar (2011) At the end of BSP phase II the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated at 11% including only the benefits of fuel savings. When the benefits of saved labour, improved health and saved soil nutrients were added, this increased to 36%. Finally, by adding the value of the reduced carbon emissions, the EIRR increased to 50% (Mendis, 2005). In spite of the successes of BSP, the question remains if a sustainable viable biogas market is possible without subsidies. Because most farmers cannot afford a plant without subsidy, demand would drop drastically if subsidy would stop, leading to the end of most private biogas companies. A few promising routes for self-financing are: \uf0b7 Bio-slurry trading: an estimated 2 million tonnes of bio-slurry fertilizer are produced annually by biogas plants in Nepal. Biogas farmers use this slurry for composting, but it can also be used for fish-food. At the moment there are no data available on the trading of this slurry at local markets, although this is clearly a business opportunity. Nevertheless, use of bio-slurry at the agricultural land of the farmers should be the first priority. If not, the soil fertility of this land will reduce over time (Van Nes, 2012a). \uf0b7 Local manufacturers and trade networks for biogas plant parts and appliances are well established in Nepal in order to provide after-sales services. Thus far, biogas plants are mainly made and used locally. When pre-manufactured biogas plants become competitive, trade with neighbouring China could be an opportunity. The main barrier to be overcome here, is government tax reduction in order to stimulate trade in biogas plant parts. ",
        "95 \uf0b7 Transferring incomes from carbon-financing towards biogas farmers (Van Nes, 2012). 5.2.4.2 Drivers for success The success of the Biogas Support Programme can be mainly attributed to the holistic approach of demand side, supply side and enabling environment. This has not only provided access to biogas plants for livestock farmers but also build the capacities of a wide variety of local organisations in the sector (Van Nes, 2012a). The following factors were identified as crucial to the success of the diffusion of the BSP throughout its different phases: Cultural drivers and meeting a need: \uf0b7 Appropriate technology : biogas plants fit very well into the Nepalese integrated farming system of crop production and animal husbandry. Most rural families own a few cattle and handling cattle dung is not a taboo in Hindu culture. \uf0b7 Meeting an actual need : the increasing difficulty of obtaining fuel wood is a strong incentive to look for alternative energy sources. Financial and economic drivers: \uf0b7 Reliable financial resources : the sustained, long-term vision and commitment of principal donors allowed for a smooth management of the programme, avoiding \u201cstop and go\u201d effects. \uf0b7 Demand generation : subsidies and credit supports were provided in order to make biogas systems affordable by the farmers to boost technology diffusion. However, in order to prevent distortions and to maintain a healthy market, all subsidies and support mechanisms should be streamlined and transparent. \uf0b7 An efficient-public-private partnership : the public sector facilitates and coordinates the sector, while the private sector is responsible for biogas installation and after-sales service. \uf0b7 Development of the private sector : a commercially viable, market-oriented and competitive private biogas sector was developed (even though it still heavily relies on subsidy), resulting in high quality and reduced costs. \uf0b7 Effective use of funding : the programme was designed in such a way that financial resources have reached the target group directly through subsidy funding, credit facilitation and tax exemptions. \uf0b7 Inclusion of CDM in the programme: in 2011 carbon funding was obtained for some groups of biogas plants. This provides a hopeful source of self-financing for the programme in the future. Technical drivers: \uf0b7 Continuous knowledge development and R&D : technical assistance of SNV in R&D in order to design a more appropriate, cost-effective and reliable biogas system for the Nepalese context fuelled the successful start of the program in the nineties. Costs, construction materials, design, available labour and skills were all taken into account and discussed with local stakeholders before the final design was decided on and standards were set (Van Nes, 2012). Continuous efforts are made to improve the design, use new materials, better meet the needs and improve client satisfaction, e.g. by the use of client satisfaction surveys. R&D efforts in the BSP are coordinated by the AEPC, as private companies do not have the capacity or means to perform their ",
        "96 own R&D. However, they do identify the needs for new developments (Van Nes, 2012). \uf0b7 Standardisation : standard design of the biogas plants makes it easier to train BCCs and users, make promotion, perform quality control and organise subsidies. \uf0b7 Quality control : good quality control mechanisms (matching ISO 9001), including certification and grading (AAA to E) of BCCs, and the obligation for every BCC to provide a 3-year guarantee period, guarantee reliability of the systems and consumer satisfaction Policy and institutional drivers: \uf0b7 A supportive government policy : the Government of Nepal has played a crucial role in the success of the BSP, mainly due to the financing of the subsidy for biogas plants, low interest rates and favourable fiscal policies. \uf0b7 Setting of objectives: quantitative objectives for biogas technology were included in several Five-Year Plans. Most recently, a target of 90,000 household size plants was included in the three Year Plan (2010/11 \u2013 2012/13), extended with the construction target of 50 community and 75 institutional biogas plants during the same period (Manandhar (2011)). \uf0b7 Institutional support : the government supports the development and promotion of biogas technology through the Ministry of Environment and the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC). The support of SNV has strengthened institutions. \uf0b7 Close partnerships : the BSP has worked in close partnership with the key institutional players, including the financial, technical and private sector and government and non-government institutions. \uf0b7 Sector organisation : the organisation of the biogas companies in an association regulates the sector, discourages bad practices and strengthens the technical, management and marketing capacities of the companies. Promotion and awareness building: \uf0b7 Dedicated promotion campaigns : biogas promotion and information campaigns are organised by BSP and adapted to the target groups: o National level: general awareness has been built through various publications (pamphlets, posters, bulletins,\u2026) and through radio and TV programmes. o District level: Radio programmes are adapted to local context and in local language. Exhibitions, trade fairs and other local events are organised including BSP stakeholders. o Village level: the principal actors for the promotion of biogas at the local level are the private Biogas Construction Companies (BCCs). They have to \u2018generate their own market\u201d, but receive a management and promotion training from NBPA to enhance their marketing skills. They also receive promotion materials about biogas benefits etc. On the other hand, in areas where biogas technology is not yet established, BSP organises village information meetings to present the benefits of biogas and existing support mechanisms. ",
        "97 \uf0b7 Self-promotion by word of mouth : by closely monitoring the quality of the plants, owners are kept satisfied and will serve as the best advocates for the promotion of the technology. 5.2.4.3 Barriers The following barriers for a successful environmental technology transfer and application, as well as the ones for the support for further scaling-up were identified (Mendis (1999), Bajgain (2005); Lam (2005); SAESUp (2010), SNV (2010); Manandhar (2011)): Cultural barriers: \uf0b7 Existing taboos : Biogas as such or the use of animal manure did not form an obstacle for the introduction of biogas technology. However, the use of human excrements to increase biogas production was a challenging objective, as it required overcoming long-standing cultural and social taboos associated with human excrements (Van Nes, 2012). In Nepalese culture, the kitchen is a sanctified place as prepared meals are offered to religious deities. Unclean fuels such as biogas derived from human excrements are in conflict with this practice. In response to this barrier, the design of the toilet system attached to the biogas plant was adjusted to eliminate the need for any handling or contact. In addition, an information programme was launched to convince people of the cleanliness of the resulting biogas. Financial and economic barriers: \uf0b7 High investment costs : Required investment costs are too high for small farmers if not supported by subsidy and credit. It is important to reduce costs without compromising quality and reliability. \uf0b7 High dependency on subsidy : The loan and subsidy programme that was put in place to support small and medium scale farmers has been a critical element in the commercial market creation for biogas in Nepal. When in 1990 the subsidies were briefly suspended, this resulted in a virtual standstill of the program, as most farmers cannot afford the investment without subsidy. \uf0b7 Farmer\u2019s affordability : due to inflation and negative growth in the agricultural sector the farmer\u2019s ability to afford the technology has decreased recently. The lack of adequate income-generating activities is an important barrier for biogas diffusion. \uf0b7 Access to credit is difficult for farmers as often a mortgage is required to advance the loan and the farmer does not own sufficient property. \uf0b7 Lack of long term thinking : to attain short-term profits companies conduct unhealthy competition and save on services that optimise biogas use. This barrier was addressed by implementing a code of conduct among companies. Technical barriers: \uf0b7 Standardisation : The standard design of the plants within the BSP, despite its advantages, is also a hindrance for the innovation efforts of private companies. However, new designs and product differentiation are needed to reach a broader number of beneficiaries (e.g. for remote areas designs based on easily transportable ",
        "98 materials such as plastic bags would be necessary, while prefabricated plastic parts could be an alternative for concrete in regions where cement is expensive). \uf0b7 Lack of R&D : the technology has to be improved continuously to increase efficiency and develop additional income-generating activities that generate auto-financing. \uf0b7 Insufficient quality control and after-sales-service : In areas with a limited market still problems with quality and after-service remain, causing bad word-of- mouth. To overcome this barrier SNV has developed several systems on quality management and enforcement. Well-performing companies receive a quality grade (AAA) that they can use in their marketing, while non-performing companies are penalised and, if performance doesn\u2019t improve after additional training, expelled from the subsidy program. Institutional barriers: \uf0b7 Lack of integrated approach : in order to develop further the biogas sector in Nepal, most stakeholders agree that strategic partnerships have to be developed with other sectors, such as health and sanitation (toilet connection to the plant), agriculture (bio-slurry fertilizer), poverty alleviation (support for poorest farmers to buy cattle and eventually a biogas plant). However, at the moment it is very difficult to reach a good collaboration between ministries and related organisations in order to share objectives and budgets. Social barriers: \uf0b7 Illiteracy is a very important barrier in information transfer-related activities: 25% of farmers are uneducated and very difficult to convince of the benefits of biogas. Promotion campaigns have been done through radio and TV and by using illustrative training manuals with very little text. \uf0b7 Poverty : as a biogas system requires a big investment and the possession of some livestock, the very poorest segment of the rural population is not reached by the BSP. External barriers: \uf0b7 Insecurity : the Maoist (CPN) rebellion that started in 1996 brought a period of insecurity throughout Nepal. Government forces have lost control of the majority of the countryside. As the biogas programme was perceived as politically neutral, its continuation was possible. However, the conflict has created a great number of problems at both demand and supply side, causing the number of new installations to fall drastically. Farmers migrated to safer areas or were reluctant to invest. Biogas companies faced a lack of working capital and encountered many difficulties due to material bans, travelling restrictions, strikes and \u2018donations\u2019 enforced by the Maoists. Quality control visits could not be made in certain unsafe districts. Additionally, banks (ADB/N) and credit facilities closed their offices in rural areas, causing the credit system to collapse. These events proved to be the major barrier of BSP phase IV (Van Nes, 2012). In response, the initial installation targets of BSP phase IV were lowered and program adjustments were made to address some of the issues (Mendis, 2005). ",
        "99 5.2.5 Lessons learned In conclusion, the Biogas Support Programme has been very successful in Nepal, despite some of its shortcomings. Social, economic and environmental impacts have positively affected the lives of thousands of rural poor families and brought benefits especially to women and children. Some important lessons can be learnt regarding development and diffusion of technologies in developing countries. The discussion is based on the 7 functions of innovation systems by Hekkert, 2009. In addition, the aspect of capacity building is treated separately. 1. Development of the private sector: \uf0b7 Capacity building and training of the private sector are crucial to improve the technical, management, financial and marketing skills of entrepreneurs and companies, as impacts (such as the number of households with a biogas plant or the environmental benefits) are directly linked to the capacity of the suppliers (qualitative construction and after-sales service). \uf0b7 Program functions (such as promotion, training, R&D, quality control, construction, maintenance, credit supply) should be undertaken by multiple rather than single stakeholders as much as possible, to avoid monopolies, dependencies and conflicts of interest. This allows competition on the supply side from which the users will benefit. Additionally, when a programme is successful, it would quickly grow too large and complex to be run efficiently by a single actor (SNV, 2009). Figure 33: Functions to be executed in a comprehensive and coordinated manner Source: SNV (2009) \uf0b7 The organisation of private companies in an association regulates the sector, prevents bad practices and strengthens the capacities of the companies. 2. Technology and knowledge development: \uf0b7 Standardisation of product design makes it easier to train manufacturers and users, make promotion, perform quality control and organise subsidies. It has proven to be a good strategy to start a project and introduce a new technology. \uf0b7 Before launching a wide-scale diffusion programme, the most appropriate and cost-effective design for the product needs to be identified, maintaining proper quality and product lifetime. Cheap, low-quality and short-live products disturb ",
        "100 the market and give the technology a bad name, hindering a sustainable diffusion and market development (van Nes, 2012). Hence, a strict enforcement of carefully designed quality standards is crucial in the promotion of biogas technology (SNV, 2009). \uf0b7 Continuous R&D efforts are necessary to improve design and to better meet the needs of the customers in order to improve client satisfaction. \uf0b7 Ensure quality and reliability by developing an effective quality control mechanism. \uf0b7 Strengthen the capacities of all key stakeholders \uf0b7 Illiteracy is a very important barrier in information transfer-related activities. Promotion campaigns therefore should be adapted to the local context, in local language and highly illustrative. 3. Network development: \uf0b7 The set-up of coordinating institutions and strengthening of their capacity to carry out their respective roles ensures collaboration and close partnership of all key stakeholders, including the financial, technical and private sector, and government and non-government institutions. \uf0b7 Develop strategic partnerships between different sectors (health, agriculture, poverty alleviation, education, etc.) in order to share objectives and budgets and develop an holistic approach. 4. Long-term guidance: \uf0b7 The support and setting of goals by the government has been a crucial factor in attaining the programme objectives. 5. Market formation: \uf0b7 Preparatory studies are required to determine the market potential of biogas technology, the proper technical design, the most appropriate institutional set-up and the required implementation modalities. These studies need to take place in a participatory manner, consulting relevant stakeholders from the government, civil society and private sector (SNV, 2009). \uf0b7 Identify the financial incentives needed to stimulate the market and to make the technology affordable by the targeted end-users to create demand. \uf0b7 Avoid unhealthy competition and short-term thinking in order to create a sustainable market and maintain service quality (e.g. by implementing a code of conduct). 6. Resource mobilisation: \uf0b7 Avoid \u2018stop-and-go\u2019-effects by securing the sustained and long-term commitment and support of governments, (international) donors and financing institutions \uf0b7 Design financial incentives (subsidy, low interest rates and favourable fiscal policies) in a uniform and transparent way, while ensuring that they reach the target groups and are not diverted towards manufacturers or sellers. \uf0b7 Develop mechanisms for self-financing, such as tradable side-products or services in order to reduce dependency on external funding. ",
        "101 7. Creation of legitimacy: \uf0b7 It is crucial to understand the targeted end-user, context and market and to design and promote a product accordingly, in a fashion that meets the needs and addresses the concerns. The potential of biogas technology depends on technical (availability of manure), financial (fuel wood costs, biogas investment costs) and cultural (way of cooking, taboos) aspects (Van Nes, 2012). \uf0b7 Establish a sense of ownership among the stakeholders. By making the technology affordable, but not for free, users tend to appreciate their plant more and make better use of it. When appliances are distributed without a personal contribution of the beneficiary, ownership is not guaranteed (Van Nes, 2012). \uf0b7 Promotion campaigns should be adapted to the local context. Satisfied clients are the best promoters of a new technology within their community. Quality and reliability of the systems therefore is crucial for self-promotion. Additionally, the quality of information provided to the end-users is very important to assure realistic expectations of the end-users. If expectations are erroneously high, they will never be met, leading to user dissatisfaction (SNV, 2009). \uf0b7 Be aware of existing taboos and cultural barriers. If possible, adapt the technology or product design accordingly as it will be far more difficult to overcome taboos with information campaigns. An additional observation from the BSP, which probably can be extrapolated to the transfer of environmental technologies all over the world, is the fact that the environmental benefits of biogas technology are seldom a decisive element for consumers to buy the technology. Personal benefits, such as cost and time savings or income-generating co-products or services are the main drivers. 5.2.6 Implications for future policy making As the Biogas Support Programme did not receive any funding from the EU, success factors or barriers were not directly linked to EU policy on eco-innovation, technology transfer or development cooperation. However, it is possible to derive some useful policy guidelines from the lessons learnt from the BSP in Nepal, and broader, similar biogas programmes implemented by SNV in Asia and Africa (Van Nes, 2012). 1. Use local products and local craftsmen to create high quality and durable products. 2. Avoid charity : The give-away culture in development aid makes that countries and communities get stuck in the \u201cAid Trap\u201d (Hubbard, 2009). Moreover, ownership of a technology is higher when a substantial contribution is asked of the beneficiaries (Van Nes, 2012). 3. Support the development of a private sector . A viable market, supported by quality design, loan schemes and capacity building can make external funding superfluous on the longer term. 4. Increase capacities of governments and institutions: the commitment of the government towards an eco-technology is crucial for its success. Good and transparent regulations, support through subsidy/tax/loan schemes and favourable conditions for private companies to enter the market are of prime importance for the setup of a viable private sector and raising awareness with the population.

        "103 5.3 Two stage biomass gasifier for rural India 5.3.1 Summary Biomass is an important energy source, contributing to 40% of primary energy requirement of India. In a gasifier, solid biomass fuels are converted into gaseous fuel which can be used in IC engines for producing mechanical power and electricity. TERI, in collaboration with DTU (Technical University of Denmark) and Sorena Sa, has developed a resource and energy efficient biomass gasifier system, with a long-term financial support from SDC (Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation) and the Government of India (subsidy scheme). During the technology transfer process, the design of the technology had to be adapted to meet the local context and targeted end-users, using local infrastructure, materials, available skills. A first prototype has been made, which is still under further improvement and development and a first step towards diffusion is being planned in 2014-2015 with the building of gasifiers in 4 villages. Drawbacks of the technology are the high initial investment costs, the low income level of the targeted users and thus the high dependency on subsidy. More R&D is necessary to continuously improve the design and support up-scaling activities. Local service support and after-sales service also has to be developed to promote sustainable use of the technology. The lack of institutional capacity at the village level limits the operation of the village gasifier plants. The second phase of the project aims to build village based management models to build the capacity of village committees to manage the gasifier system in pilot projects. 5.3.2 Context, selection, goals and ambitions 5.3.2.1 Country context Lack of access to modern energy among the poor is a major constraint to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and one of the most important development challenges that India faces. More than 400 million Indians have no electricity, limiting their access to education, income generation and information. For lighting one-third of households rely on kerosene, which provides poor quality light and is damaging to health. The Indian economy has grown rapidly over the past decade. Provision of modern energy, especially electricity is seen as part of the essential infrastructure in modern development processes. Box 3: Biomass gasification In a gasifier, solid biomass fuels (wood, agricultural residues, briquettes, etc.) are converted into gaseous fuel (producer gas) by a series of thermo-chemical processes. The producer gas has a calorific value of about 1,000 \u2013 1200 kcal/ Nm3 and consists mainly of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen. One kilogram of biomass produces about 2.5 Nm3 of producer gas. The producer gas can be used as a fuel in IC engines for producing mechanical power and electricity. About 1.2 to 1.5 kg of biomass is required for producing 1 kWh of electricity (using a 100% producer gas engine). The GDP of India has registered a growth of around 6-7 per cent per annum during the past few years and growth at an even higher rate is expected in the near future. This rate of growth will need contributions from all sectors, especially the rural sector which includes 80% of the population. Doubts are being raised whether this growth trend can be sustained considering the widening energy demand-supply gap. However, in the context of electricity supply; on one hand, India is facing a deficit of about 8% on average and 12% on peak demand; on the other hand a large number of villages do not have access to a reliable supply of electricity. As agriculture, post-harvesting ",
        "104 technologies, rural industry, rural commercial establishments and rural households are expected to rely even more on electricity, the demand will increase considerably. Even the electrified villages have to face the ordeal of erratic electricity supply. This is considered to be the biggest impediment to the socio-economic development of the rural population. In this context, the Government of India started the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojna program (RGGVY) with the goal of electrifying all villages by 2012. While grid extension is an important part of this scheme, it has been recognized that grid supply may not be feasible or cost effective for every village, and hence due attention has been given to renewable based Decentralized Distributed Generation (DDG) systems too. Even after the eventual arrival of the grid, these systems have the potential to complement the grid supply and become an additional source of energy. During the past two decades and more, the Government of India has given a significant amount of funding to the development, demonstration and field application of a variety of renewable energy technologies, including biomass gasification for decentralized energy generation in rural areas. A biomass gasifier system with 100% gas engines has recently been developed and demonstrated. Biomass is an important energy source, contributing to 14% of the world\u2019s energy and almost contributing to 40% of the primary energy requirement of India. Rising global concerns about climate change, deterioration of air quality due to the use of fossil fuels, and national concerns about energy security have led to a renewed interest in biomass globally, stimulating improvements in biomass energy production and modern, more efficient conversion technologies. These new production (by the commercial or co- operative sector) and conversion technologies, together with economies of scale, make biomass a potentially competitive commercial fuel in comparison to fossil fuels. 5.3.2.2 History of biomass gasification technology in India Gasification of coal and biomass has been a known technology for over a century. The technology was extensively used during the Second World War. However, modern biomass gasification technology has reached maturity only in the last few years. India is now an acknowledged world leader in conversion of solid biomass into clean gaseous fuel and is one of the few countries having an active research and demonstration programme on small-scale biomass gasification technologies. The programme started in the 1980\u2019s and has resulted in the availability of different gasifier packages with capacities ranging from 5 kW to 500 kW. The various applications include electricity generation, by running an engine-generator on producer gas; mechanical shaft power when producer gas is used as a fuel in an engine and the engine is directly coupled to the appliance (e.g. water pump, grinder, etc.) or, thermal applications in which the producer gas is directly burnt in a stove, furnace or boiler. An important development in small scale biomass gasification has been the development of 100% producer gas engines in recent years. There are 13 manufacturers of gasifiers and six manufacturers of gas engines in the country. TERI is a pioneering institute in the field of biomass gasifiers. In 2002 TERI undertook a collaborative programme called LIBERA (Livelihood Improvement through Biomass Energy in Rural Areas) with SDC and Gram Vikas (a grassroots NGO based in the State of Orissa in India), focusing on providing modern energy by harnessing locally available biomass resources. A 10 kWe wood charcoal based gasifier was developed \u2013 to reduce the maintenance requirements - and tested in Kanheiput in Orissa. The aim of this initiative was to test the concept and suitability of gasifier based power generation for remote village electrification. Subsequently TERI developed wood based gasifier systems. ",
        "105 So far, eight systems have been commissioned in the states of Orissa, Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan under the Village Energy Security Programme (VESP); and in association with NTPC Ltd. (a Government of India owned enterprise in thermal power generation). These gasifier systems, which are based on locally available biomass fuel, typically consist of 10 kWe gasifier-engine generators and electrical distribution networks set up within the village. They have been operational for the past 4 to 5 years, providing electricity for lighting purposes to villages with a population ranging from 150 to 600. They also support social development schemes such as lighting of Tribal Hostels (residential schools for the tribal population) and Oil Expellers (mechanical devices used to crush seeds to produce oil). The key learning from the cumulative field experience of more than 15,000 hours of operation is that although present gasifier systems are manageable in rural systems, a lot of regular maintenance is needed, mainly due to the presence of tar and particulates in the gas. In order to upscale gasifier based rural electrification, more reliable, low tar gasifier systems have to be developed. 5.3.2.3 Domestic fixed bed biomass gasifier technology A gasifier based power generation system ( Figure 34 ) consists of a biomass gasifier that converts the solid fuel into combustible gas. The hot combustible gas that is produced, contains impurities like dust particles and tar vapours, which need to be removed in the cleaning train before the gas is supplied to the IC engine for power generation. Generally, the biomass gasifier is coupled to a series of filters (gravity filters, wet scrubbers, cyclone separators and bag house filters). A paper filter is used to ensure permissible levels of tar and dust in the gas stream. The gas and air mixture is introduced at the air intake manifold of the engine. Valves are provided both for the air and the gas in order to vary the quantity of gas and air to obtain the optimum mixture. Figure 34: Line diagram of the general scheme of a biomass gasifier based power system Source: TERI The engine converts the chemical energy in the gas to mechanical energy by rotating a shaft, which is in turn coupled to the shaft of an alternator that converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. This electrical energy is distributed through electrical conductors to the connected load to power the bulbs, motors & other electrical appliances. TERI believes that the existing gasifier based solutions need further development and dissemination efforts. Technologically speaking, these efforts should primarily be directed at developing low-tar producing gasifiers, so that maintenance and operational problems are drastically reduced. The global experience shows that in this capacity range, DTU\u2019s two-stage gasifier technology is one such option as it is able to deliver clean gas requiring very little cleaning (and hence less maintenance problems and more reliability). ",
        "106 However, it is evident that the existing two-stage biomass technology developed by DTU would need further development for rural area applications in the developing countries. TERI, in collaboration with DTU and Sorena S.a., has developed a two stage biomass gasifier system 51 based on DTU and TERI technology which emits clean gas, thus minimizing the need for maintenance and other day-to-day operational problems. Description of the improved two stage biomass gasifier system of TERI-DTU The two-stage process is characterized by having pyrolysis and gasification in separate reactors with an intermediate high-temperature tar-cracking zone. This allows for a very fine control of the process temperatures, resulting in extremely low tar concentrations in the producer gas. The gasification plant named \u201cViking\u201d is a small-scale plant with a nominal thermal output of 75 kW. The plant is running automatically and unmanned, fuelled by wood chips, and feeding its gas to a gas engine. The main target for the Viking project has been to demonstrate and test a long-term combined heat and power (CHP) operation of a gasifier coupled with a gas engine. The plant was commissioned in the autumn of 2002 and has been operated for more than 3337 h (3017 h with engine operation). Feeding system : The fuel of typical size between 1\u2019-2\u2019 in length can be used in the gasifier which is compatible with the feeding system. The hopper with lock at the top and water seal contains the wood chips of 30x30x10 mm 3 size. At the bottom the screw conveyer is there which helps to take away the fuel through the pyrolysis reactor. The timings have been set for screw feeder, which are decided based on the fuel flow rate required. The hopper also acts as a drier for the fuel being fed to the system. Figure 35: Two stage gasifier system Source: TERI 51 In a Two-stage biomass gasification system, gasifier reactions occur in two different stages in two physically separated reactors viz. (i) pyrolyzer converts biomass into char and volatiles and (ii) gasification reactions occur in reactor where tar is cracked in presence of charcoal bed in high temperature reduction environment ",
        "107 Pyrolysis zone : conventional gasifier reactor, the system has been divided into two reactors. One of them is pyrolysis reactor which is being preheated using burnt gases of the thermal gasifier through annular casing around it. The reactor serves purpose of both drying and pyrolyzing the fuel. Screw helps to move the fuel inside the reactor. The pyrolysis process helps to release volatiles from the fuel and the pyrolysis gases along with the partially burnt fuel chips. At the entrance of the reactor the temperature is about 300\u00b0C while at outlet it is around 600\u00b0C. Gasifier reactor : The products of the pyrolysis process, char and gas, are led to the gasification reactor. Prior to the gasification process, the pyrolysis gas is partly oxidized to produce the heat necessary for the endothermic char gasification. Temperature of 1100-1150\u00b0 C is achieved in this oxidation zone. Because of the high temperature and the partial oxidation of the volatile pyrolysis products, the tar content in the volatiles is reduced to very negligible amount. Refractory lining is used in the oxidizing zone as very high temperature of about 1150\u00b0C. The whole reactor is made up of stainless steel with lower portion directly in contact with char bed. Char gasification in the char bed occurs in the temperature range of 800\u00b0C to 1000\u00b0C. The passage of partially oxidized pyrolysis gases through the char bed is the other reason for reducing the tar content in the raw gas. Finally the raw gas leaving the gasifier has temperature of about 600\u00b0C. Cleaning cooling system : Due to low tar content the cleaning and cooling system is also very simple. The high temperature raw gas has to be cooled down to about 50\u00b0C. Initially it is passed through cyclone to remove coarse particles and subsequently through the pyrolyser outer shell (heat exchanger) where the extracted heat is used to heat the pyrolyser part of the system and to preheat the air going inside the gasifier. The hot producer gas is then passed through a steam generator to produce steam required for the process which is fed inside the pyrolyser during the system operation. After that the producer gas is passed through the hot gas condenser where the gas is cooled to just about 90\u00b0C which is close to water dew point to avoid condensation and blocking of subsequent cleaning component. Then the gas is passed through the series of fabric filter fixed into a single casing to remove particles. Then in the natural air based second cooler the gas is further cooled to 50\u00b0C to remove condensate followed by a paper filter. Finally the gas is fed to engine to generated electricity. 5.3.2.4 Relevance of this case study for the project This case study shows a technology that was transferred from a developed country (Denmark) to a developing country (India), via a cooperation between a Danish and an Indian research institute. During this process, the design of the technology had to be adapted to meet the local context. A first prototype has been made, which is still under further improvement and development. Although gasifier technology has existed for several years in India, the new two-stage gasifier concept is still in its development and testing phase, with a first step towards diffusion being planned in 2014-2015 with the building of gasifiers in 4 villages.

        "110 NTPC Ltd: NTPC Limited, a Government of India Enterprise, with implementation and management expertise working with an aim to bring the benefits of electricity to the rural and vulnerable populations, through decentralized distributed generation, especially biomass gasification technology. NTPC is a major stakeholder and partner of the project. NTPC and SDC implement Renewal Energy and Distributed Generation (RE and DG) projects, using state of the art technology and ensuring long term sustainability. They are also active in technology development and transfer. The main focus of these projects is on biomass gasification, small hydropower systems and solar energy. In the case of the two-stage gasifier system, TERI has provided NTPC with all necessary details to produce the device. Performance testing is done in a joint effort of TERI and NTPC. Based on the results of this testing, NTPC will implement the field system in four locations in India. 5.3.3.2 Financial resources The total project budget for the technology development phase of the two-stage/low tar gasifier (2009-11) was around \u20ac 800,000 (TERI and other partners). Subsequently, for the period 2012-14 a budget of around \u20ac 950,000 is foreseen. In addition to this, NTPC is committed to provide the capital cost for five systems to be set up in villages. 5.3.3.3 Technical missions, training and exposure trip In order to facilitate the development of two stage gasifier, the project has conducted various missions of DTU team to India at regular intervals to strengthen the capacities of TERI team involved in the program. By the end of 2011, 7 missions were conducted to discuss various aspects of the two stage gasifiers technology developed at DTU RISO (possible desirable features, the various concept prototypes designs/elements of two stage gasifiers for rural applications, progress made, test results and future plan). These missions have helped TERI team to formulate and draw the internal plan and make decisions on various aspects of the technology. Exposure trip of NTPC and TERI joint team to the Technical University of Denmark, DTU was conducted. This included field visits to various two stage gasification installations in Denmark, visit to the bio-energy research facility of RISO-DTU, the low-temperature circulating fluidized bed gasification facility, and discussions on a large scale commercialization approach, future plan and recent advancements in two stage gasifier technology. Training to TERI technicians/manufacturers is provided by DTU team as part of the manufacturing process, installation and commissioning process to set up two stage gasifier system. Solutions to technical constraints (e.g. starting options without LPG, maintaining reactor temperatures, bed level control etc.) and guidelines on start-up, operation and shut down are developed jointly as part of the project. Institutional research capability is also an important aspect in the training activities of DTU and TERI. The research capability of TERI in terms of on-line gas measurement, data loggers and instrumentation has been enhanced under the project work. 5.3.4 Analysis: results, drivers and obstacles 5.3.4.1 Results Achievements: Over the years TERI has installed close to 550 thermal biomass gasifiers in 15 different small industry sectors and 18 electricity producing biomass gasifiers for rural and other standalone applications across the country. A cumulative capacity of 55MWth and 850kWe is installed with an estimated cumulative reduction of around 175,000 tonnes of CO 2 till today. The summary of biomass gasifier based rural electrification projects is given below in Table 9. ",

Thus biomass gasification has become an acceptable technology to the small industries as a heat source. On the technology development efforts, the two stage biomass gasifier prototype has been successfully tested for stable runs on its maximum capacity (10 kWe) \u2013 an important milestone for up-scaling the system to 20 -40 kWe capacity. The two-stage power gasifier design and features bring multiple efficiency improvements. These improvements are related to energy efficiency, resource use efficiency and environmental benefits over the fixed-bed gasifier systems, which have been used for decentralized energy applications in India. Table 10 brings out the efficiency improvements of the two-stage gasifier. ",
        "112 Table 10: Efficiency improvements in two stage gasifier Key parameters Fixed bed gasifier Two stage gasifier Improvements Energy Efficiency Overall efficiency (in terms of biomass consumption to electricity generated) 15% >22% About 50% efficiency gain due to reduction in parasitic loads and reduction in fuel consumption Resource Use Efficiency Input fuel moisture \u2013 quality of biomass that can go as an input up to 15% up to 30% Greater flexibility in terms of biomass quality (dry) and use. Environmental Benefits Tar (Raw gas) 500-600 mg/Nm 3 Less than 25 mg/Nm 3 Impurities in the raw gas in form of tar significantly reduced. This improves the overall environment performance of the system as less tar is generated. Gas cooling and cleaning system Water scrubbing - 350 litre of fresh water for 50 hours of operation Without water scrubbing Zero water usage for removing impurities in the gas Waste water generation 350 litre after 50 hours of operation No waste water generation Source: TERI The overall energy efficiency improvements are at about 50%, due to reduction of parasitic loads as well as reduction in fuel consumption. The specific fuel consumption in two-stage gasifier reduces by 30%. Less than one kilogram of biomass fuel is needed to produce one unit of electricity. This is a significant reduction when compared to about one-and-half kilogram in fixed bed gasifiers. The two-stage gasifier is also more resource efficient , because it allows greater flexibility in terms of quality and type of biomass fuel that can be used. In a fixed bed gasifier, input fuel moisture cannot be more than 15%, whereas in a two-stage gasifier up to 30% moisture content biomass can be used. The other important benefit of two-stage gasifiers is in terms of environmental benefits . As a result of more efficient combustion, there are lesser impurities such as tar ",
        "113 in the raw gas. Managing tar has always been a major challenge for biomass gasifiers and a huge environmental concern, and a two-stage gasifier makes significant improvement in this regard. The other major environmental benefit of the two-stage gasifier is related to freshwater and wastewater. Fixed bed gasifiers need about 350 litres of freshwater per 50 hours of operation, for scrubbing. The wastewater generated through the systems poses significant environmental concern in terms of disposal. In the two-stage gasifier there is no need for freshwater use, especially due to improved system performance. As a result there is no waste water generation, which brings significant environment benefits. 5.3.4.2 Drivers for success The following factors were identified as crucial to the success of the two stage gasifier system during the technology development phase: Technical drivers \uf0a7 Continuous technical development and R&D: Technical assistance of DTU-RISO in R&D was important in order to design an appropriate two stage gasifier system for the rural Indian context. Available manufacturing materials, local infrastructure and skills were all taken into account and discussed with partners before the final design was determined. Continuous efforts are made to improve the design, thermal energy use and materials used. \uf0a7 Re-engineering: The final design of the two stage gasifier system will be optimized in terms of an engineering and design point of view. \uf0a7 Standard operating manual: A good standard operating manual including quality control will be prepared as part of the project deliverable. This will be utilized for training and capacity building of operators and service technicians that are active in operation and maintenance of the systems. Financial and economic drivers \uf0a7 Long term technology development requires financial resources: The sustained, long- term vision and commitment of principal donor (SDC) helped achieve the technology development goal. Policy and institutional drivers \uf0a7 A supportive government policy: The Government of India has played a crucial role in the success of the Biomass Gasifier Program, mainly due to the financing of the subsidy scheme for biomass gasifier plants for rural electrification. Under the different Rural Electrifications schemes, the Government of India covered up to 90% of project capital cost through subsidies. Currently, this financial support is available for other approved biomass gasifier technologies in India. The project will work towards getting an approval for the two stage gasifier system, in order to use these financial incentives during the implementation phase. \uf0a7 Institutional support: the Government provides funding support, through the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and the Ministry of Power, for up to 8% of the project cost over a 5-year period. The goal is to meet the operational and maintenance cost of the biomass gasification technology for rural electrification/electricity generation. \uf0a7 Close partnerships: the TERI-SDC Biomass Project (TSBP) has worked in close partnership with NTPC Ltd the key institutional player in development and testing of the different two stage gasifier prototype units. ",
        "114 5.3.4.3 Barriers The following barriers are identified for a successful environmental technology transfer / adaptation and its application: Financial, economic and resource barriers \uf0a7 High dependency on subsidy: The current rural electrification program using renewable energy is based on a grant based program to help achieve 100% rural electrification in the country. The implementation of two stage gasifier technology for rural electrification will depend on availability of funding support by the Government of India. \uf0a7 Technology up-scaling funding support: the development of funding support for two stage gasifier systems is largely mobilized from SDC (principal donor). NTPC Ltd is committed to implement one prototype unit at NTPC Badarpur and subsequently four two stage biomass gasifier plants in rural areas. Efforts were made to seek additional support from other sources including bilateral, multi-lateral and government-funded programmes for technology development, testing and implementation. However, this effort did not materialize which limits the expansion of the technology in the local market. \uf0a7 High initial costs: the current two stage gasifier technology requires high initial investment costs when compared to existing fixed bed gasifier technology locally available. This is largely on account of high-grade stainless steel used and the high operating temperature. Efforts are made to reduce costs without compromising quality and reliability of the process. \uf0a7 Economic affordability: due to the low income level in rural areas and high electricity subsidies to these areas (through the conventional grid system), it is challenging to support RE based electrification projects. This is particularly the case for technologies based on biomass resources with a high fuel and labour cost. The lack of adequate income-generating/livelihoods activities in rural areas is an important barrier for biomass gasifier based rural electrification projects. \uf0a7 Lack of sustainable biomass supply: biomass supply is one of the key barriers in promotion of biomass gasifier technology in rural areas. The project is developing a methodology to assess different types of biomass streams and will develop supply linkage in pilot projects. Technical barriers \uf0a7 Continuous operation: The two stage gasifier generally takes a long time to start up and hence is more suitable for continuous applications. However, the electricity requirement in most of the rural areas is only during evening hours, with limited use in day time due to lack of productive loads. This technology barrier will be addressed by developing a quick starting option. \uf0a7 Lack of R&D: the technology has to be improved continuously to increase efficiency and develop a higher capacity system. Institutional barriers \uf0a7 Limited access to local service support and the lack of after sales service (particularly on issues related to the engine) are the main barriers to sustainable use of biomass gasifier technology in rural areas. \uf0a7 Village level institutional capacity building: in the earlier program the overall management of the biomass gasifier system was carried out by the village ",
        "115 administration unit. The lack of institutional capacity at the village level limits the operation of the plant. The second phase of the project aims to build village based management models such as Village Electricity Committee (VEC).The goal is to improve the capacity of these committees to manage the two stage gasifier system in pilot projects. 5.3.5 Lessons learned The two stage gasifier system is being developed in collaboration between TERI and SDC with technical assistance of DTU and Sorane S.a. Initially, the project team\u2019s goal was to build the system based on a direct technology transfer agreement. However, during the course of development several modifications had to be done to adapt the system to actual Indian conditions. Some important lessons can be learnt: 1. Development of a local partnership with the private sector: o Identification, capacity building and training of the private sector are crucial to build two stage gasifier units with effective quality control, fabrication, precision, testing and overall performance. 2. Technology and knowledge development: o Strengthening the capacities of the manufacturer, of local service delivery, of operators and of village level institutions is critical in dissemination of the biomass gasifier technology in rural areas. o The fact that DTU regularly conducts such missions, have helped the project team in this technology development project. It has proven to be a good strategy to carry out the development efforts, share knowledge and define short term project goals. Technology transfer and adaptation through multi-partner projects takes considerable time and efforts. o Standardisation of product design makes it easier to train manufacturers and users, make promotion, perform quality control and organise subsidies. It has proven to be a good strategy to start a project and introduce a new technology. However, it also hinders innovation initiatives of manufacturers. o Continuous R&D efforts and upgrading of research facilities are necessary to improve prototype design and overall performance. 3. Long-term guidance: o A Technical Advisory Group (TAG) was set up under the project monitoring system involving NTPC Ltd and others; that has been a crucial factor in attaining the programme objectives. o The overall objective of the TAG is to (a) deliberate on the technical issues and (b) review and provide inputs on technical aspects of the technology development. The TAG focuses on technology development aspects related to two stage gasification. The TAG also plays a guiding role and acts as a \u201cthink tank\u201d within the \u201cProject context\u201d. It reflects on the overall technical achievements and failures and suggests modifications, during various stages of development. ",
        "116 4. Network development: o Under the TERI-SDC partnership, a website (www.cosmile.org) was created to share the best practices and knowledge developed under this collaboration. The different case studies of biomass gasification applications are developed and shared with others. 5. Market formation: o Formation of joint venture arrangements and partnerships with local entrepreneurs to develop and disseminate the technology would help to create market demand for biomass gasifier technology. o An official launch event is proposed to inform all key stakeholders, including the Government, non-government institutions and private sector, about the development on two stage gasifier systems and its advantages. 6. Resource mobilisation: o NTPC Ltd has committed itself to implement one prototype unit at NTPC Badarpur and subsequently four two stage biomass gasifier plants in rural areas. o To link the two stage biomass gasifier technology with national level programs/policies would help to mobilize financial incentives (subsidy and low interest rates) for field implementation of the systems. 7. Creation of legitimacy: o From the earlier field implementation pilots, TERI has developed a good understanding of the targeted end-user, context and market. This helps to design, develop and promote a product accordingly, in a way that meets the local challenges. The potential of biomass gasification technology depends on local resources (availability of biomass), on technical aspects (electricity for different applications), financial aspects (fuel wood costs, manpower and maintenance costs) and local institutional (Village Committees/ Panchayat) aspects. 5.3.6 Policy guidelines Some of the lessons learnt can be translated into suggestions for policy: 1. Increase capacities of governments and institutions: the commitment of the government is crucial. Clear goal-setting is important. The set-up of a state- owned entity to coordinate the implementation of the technology can facilitate diffusion. Financial support for approved technologies (through subsidy schemes) stimulates technology development and implementation. 2. Quality and durability of the resulting products, combined with an accessible and high quality after-sales and maintenance service , is very important to gain acceptance of an alternative technology by the population. 3. When transferring technology from one country to another, design adaptations need to be made to create a technology/product that meets the local context in terms of material availability and prices, resource supply and user requirements.

        "118 5.4 Cement diploma course \u2013 up-scaling activity in Egypt 5.4.1 Summary Why is the case study interesting? This case study is a good example of up-scaling where a project between a European company and a local university has benefitted all cement companies in a region and upgraded the skills and curriculum of the university and its students. The case also provides an example of a transfer programme with focus on up-scaling and sustainability. Finally, the environmental aspect is that a whole module has been devoted to environmental aspects of the cement process, which is a new skill to the employees. Background Egypt is home to a large number of cement factories owned by both foreign and local companies. Until now, there has not been a university course available and suitable for the needs of the cement industry in Egypt. The companies found it difficult to find the employees with the right skills as they were only found in the competing companies. New employees were normally electrical, mechanical or process engineers from the local universities with generic engineering skills, and they needed to go through in-house training in the companies or were sent to universities outside Egypt \u2013 often Italy. This was, and still is, costly for the companies. For several years, the Danish company FLSmidth had talked about how to combat the lack of skills in regions where the company has clients or factories outside Europe. However, the final step to start an actual diploma course was not taken until they spoke to the Danish Industry Association, which provided knowledge on similar project in other sectors. FLSmidth then decided to start a process where they visited eight universities in Cairo, one private and seven public, to find the most suitable university fitting the needs of the companies. At that point, Helwan University had already collaborated with international partners, but mainly other universities, and R&D projects including FP7 projects. This together with the positive attitude of the managers and professors at the university was the reason that Helwan University was chosen. For Helwan University it was seen as an opportunity to work closer with international partners and local companies together with being able to expand the students\u2019 choices and upgrade the teaching skills and technological equipment of the university. At this point, the Danish development agency Danida was included in the process and financed several activities including developing course material, training university staff, the legal process, a pilot course as well as promotional activities for the diploma course to turn it into a self-financed project after project end. Results The pilot course has now ended. A total of 38 students enrolled in the course, 33 students completed the course, and 22 got jobs after the course. FLSmidth hired 8 of the students, 11 were hired by other local companies, and 3 were hired by the university. Some students have had to enter military service. All three students hired by the university are currently working in R&D projects with the main objective of reducing the environmental impact and cost of the cement process. The university has already started the promotion work and has carried out a small survey among the local companies. The response to the pilot course and the upcoming diploma course has been very positive. However, the main success factor is based on the ",
        "119 enrolment of students whose tuition fees are paid for by the companies. The survey shows that the companies have indicated that they will enrol new students. However, the enrolment will probably take place in 2013t based on an expected decision to implement the Diploma programme by the steering committee in January 2013. For the time being it is not possible to address the overall success and sustainability aspect of the project. 5.4.2 Context, selection, goals and ambitions 5.4.2.1 Country context Egypt borders the Middle East at the top east corner of Africa. The population of Egypt is 81 million, where approximately 18 million are located in the metropolitan area of the capital Cairo. The GDP per capita is $6500, which ranks Egypt in the middle of all countries in the world, just below countries such as Namibia, Algeria, Ukraine and Albania and above countries like Morocco, Jordan and Syria. 20% of the population live below the poverty line. 32% of the labour force is engaged in the agricultural sector, 17% in industry and 51% in the service sector. 5.4.2.2 History of the Cement industry Egypt The government of Egypt began nationalising the cement industry in the 1960s. By the 1990s, the entire sector was state-owned, and in 1993 Egypt was the second largest importer of cement in the world. In just over 10 years Egypt stopped having to import cement and became a major cement exporter. Privatisation has played a significant role in this transformation. By 2003, Egypt ranked fifth among the world\u2019s cement exporting nations. The industry\u2019s competitive edge was given a boost that year by the government\u2019s decision to float the Egyptian pound. The subsequent drop in the value of the Egyptian pound increased the demand for Egyptian cement in established export markets in neighbouring countries. In 2009, the Government introduced an export ban on cement to secure enough cement for the large demand in the construction industry. Thus, the cement industry provides vital materials for Egyptian infrastructure and construction projects and is crucial for Egypt\u2018s economic prosperity. The Egyptian cement industry has remained strong throughout the global financial downturn. Figures from World Cement show that the demand for cement in Egypt grew 25-30% in 2009. At present, Egypt has 22 cement plants with 27 production lines. It is estimated that the industry employs 2,700 engineers and approx. 4,300 technicians. The existing producers are busy providing cement for the growing Egyptian housing market and infrastructure projects. In October 2009, the Egyptian trade minister announced that five or six new cement production licenses would be granted. Hence, within the next 3-5 years, Egypt will include another 11 production lines, which will require an additional 1,100 engineers and 1,700 technicians. However, as the sector is expanding there is a major issue for the cement companies in Egypt. The industry is seriously challenged by a lack of skilled employees. This shortage is costly for the companies as they either have to train them internally or send them to universities with cement courses, which Egypt did not have until this project started. 5.4.2.3 Danida B2B programme \u2013 Innovative Partnership for Development (IPD) The Innovative Partnerships for Development (IPD) Programme supports partnerships that advance strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR), and partnerships that advance socially responsible innovation. This project was funded under the CSR heading with the overall programme objective to promote better working and living conditions for ",
        "120 employees, their families, the local community and society at large by advancing strategic CSR at the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) through innovative partnerships in developing countries. The IPD Programme provides assistance and economic support to companies, organisations and public institutions in three different phases: 1. contact phase; 2. study phase; and 3. project phase. The project focused heavily on the study and project phases. Nevertheless, the key focus was to ensure the sustainability of the project after project end (Phase 3). The overall aim of the project was to set up an Egyptian Cement Academy with three major aspects: 1. post graduate education for engineers within cement; 2. practical training at local cement plants; and 3. international and business relevant curriculum and teachers. Prior to the project, FLSmidth led a major self-financed exercise. This process is explained in more detail in the design section. Figure 38 shows the structure of the Egyptian Cement Academy. Figure 38: Structure of the Egyptian Cement Academy Source: FLSmidth The key activities in the project are: \uf0b7 develop the course and the material; \uf0b7 transfer knowledge from FLSmidth to Helwan University (staff); \uf0b7 build an organisational framework around the Cement Academy; \uf0b7 prepare and complete the formal process of setting up a new diploma course; and \uf0b7 train the first three groups of students.

        "121 5.4.2.4 Technologies This case is not a classic technological transfer project, but it is a good example of how up-scaling can be achieved through an innovative public-private-partnership and where the impact is much extensive than just the two partners involved. The technology transfer element is based on the knowledge of FLSmidth where environmental initiatives and green technologies are some of the main areas in their innovation portfolio as well as a competitive advantage in the search for talents. FLSmidth has established a programme for working with engineering and technical education departments of universities in countries ranging from the US to Russia, Egypt and India. The programme, which has its roots in the company\u2019s long-standing partnership with the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), aims to help FLSmidth attract and retain a qualified workforce through financial support, joint research projects, student exchange programmes, supplying educational material and technical expertise and active recruitment of students. 52 The Helwan University and FLSmidth partnership is rooted in this programme, which provides professors and students access to the latest green and more general technologies in the cement industry through the new diploma course. Environmental and safety management is also a central part of the course. The environmental input is an important part of the Cement Academy diploma programme. The cement engineering curriculum includes environmental aspects based on FLSmidth\u2019s high international standards concerning environmental issues. Through their training the students become acquainted with state-of-the art knowledge on, for example, energy efficiency, waste management, alternative fuels and other environmental issues of relevance to the cement business. The training strengthens the level of environmental awareness among the graduating engineers and provides them with practical know-how related to applying this knowledge at their future work places. Since cement is a high-energy consuming industry the impact of the training will be of significant value. 5.4.2.5 Relevance of this case study for the project The present case study is a good example of up-scaling where a public-private- partnership project between a European company and a local university has benefitted all cement companies in the region, upgraded the skills and curriculum of the university and the students. The case also provides an example of a transfer programme with focus on up-scaling and sustainability. As regards the environmental aspect of the case, a whole module has been devoted to the environmental aspects of the cement process, which is a new skill for the employees. Also, three of the students hired by the university after the completion of the first course all have research projects focusing on how to improve the environmental profile of the companies, mainly through enhancing energy efficiency. 5.4.3 Design The figure below shows the different phases of the project. 52 http://www.flsmidth.com/en- US/eHighlights/Archive/Group/2011/May/Its+a+tough+race+for+engineering+talent ",
        "122 Figure 39: Phases of the cement diploma course The first phase was FLSmidth\u2019s initiative to start a Cement Academy in Egypt based on their need to find qualified workers. From the outset, it was clear to FLSmidth that this step would unprofitable, but it was part of the company\u2019s strategy to develop initiaitves benfitting themselves and the local community as well. FLSmidth has often wanted to set up a Cement Academy in developing countries where they have a large precense and where there is a large potential. The trigger to the present project was a conversation with the Confederation of Danish Industry(DI), where a FLSmidth representative mention the idea and DI provided examples of this type of partnership. After an internal process in FLSmidth and NLS 53 the self-financed partner search started in December 2009 when the education system for Egyptian engineers was studied and screened for initiatives and potential partners. FLSmidth had initial meetings with eight universities where the majority were private. The public Helwan University was identified as the most promising partner for three reasons: \uf0b7 They had the best cement capabilities and some teaching experience within the field. \uf0b7 The university is strategically located in relation to the cement industry. \uf0b7 The university was highly motivated and demonstrated that a cement specialisation was in line with its strategic priorities and organisational capabilities. After several meetings between Helwan University and FLSmidth, the partners signed a Memorandum of Understanding stating their continued interest in pursuing the idea of establishing a cement academy. In March 2010, the FLSmidth Institute and NLS organised a \u201cCement Day\u201d together with Helwan University at the campus in Cairo to inform the engineering students about the cement industry. The \u201cCement Day\u201d was the first manifestation of the cooperation between the two partners. 217 interested students participated in the event. After conducting a feasibility study, the last details of the project were discussed and a final commitment to the \u201cFLSmidth Helwan Cement Academy\u201d was made before the feasibility study was approved by both partners in July 2010 and the \u201cDanida IPD FLSmidth Helwan Cement Academy\u201d started. 53 NLS is FLSmidth\u2019s associated company in Egypt Self-financed partner search 2009-2010 Phase 1 : Train- the-trainers & devlopment of diploma course 2010-2011 Phase 2 : Run first course & establish the Diploma degree course 2011-2012 Phase 3 : Post- priject phase 2012- ",
        "123 5.4.3.1 Main stakeholders The main stakeholders in the project are: FLSmidth A/S FLSmidth was founded in 1882 and is a global player in the cement and minerals industry. The company employs more than 10,000 people around the world. Currently, the main markets are the Middle East, India, Africa, CIS and North America. The customers are investors in cement/minerals plants and cement manufacturers. FLSmidth supplies equipment for cement production, engineered mineral processing equipment as well as services to the mining, metallurgical, pyro-processing, alumina, pulp & paper and power industries. Since 2007, FLSmidth has also used its long term (128 years) experience to add value to operations and maintenance (O&M) contracts. With instant access to a global pool of specialists and know-how, the aim of FLSmidth is to ensure that cement plants run smoothly while the owners focus on cement sales. FLSmidth Institute A business area for FLSmidth is internal and external customer training through the FLSmidth Institute. Drawing on the experience from cement production, the FLSmidth Institute has developed comprehensive training programmes. These training competences mean that the FLSmidth Institute offers both technical competences but also training in relation to disseminating knowledge effectively. NLS NLS is FLSmidth\u2019s associated company in Egypt. For the last two years, NLS has been responsible for implementing O&M contracts in the Middle East and North African region. The O&M contract presently under implementation at the Ramliya cement plant in Egypt was the first FLSmidth O&M contract. Through NLS and the contract with the owner of the Ramliya plant, FLSmidth has built a strong local organisation including a new training facility at Ramliya. Helwan University Helwan University is a governmental organisation established in 1975. It serves 90,000 undergraduate students and 11,000 postgraduate students (diploma, MA/M.Sc. and Ph.D.). It comprises 20 faculties covering all major areas of science and humanities. It also has 50 research centres and productive units which connect the university with the problems of the Egyptian society. Thus, it helps to solve societal problems and supports the building of the future of Egypt. Helwan University has more than 5000 faculty members. Most of the Egypt\u2019s heavy industy is located in Helwan. Being situated in the heart of an industrial community, Helwan University is considered a unique model among Egyptian universities. Helwan University\u2019s international linkages include more than 40 agreements of cooperation and partnership with universities and other institutions in the US, Europe, and Arab countries. These international linkages promote both student and professor exchanges, joint supervisions, curriculum development, and joint research. 5.4.3.2 Targeted beneficiaries There is a wide range of different types of beneficiaries in this project making it rather uniquie in terrms of upscaling. The direct beneficiaries are the students and the faculty, but the aim of the project is to provide cement companies with better opportunities to find new talent as well as increase research and development through the new knowledge on new technologies. Below is a short desciption of the benificiaries of the project and the expected impact in the short and long run. ",
        "124 Students The engineering students who are offered enrolment in the cement degree programme will receive a high-quality training programme and will become very attractive employees in the Egyptian cement industry and it will also provide opportunities for the students in companies or at universities outside Egypt \u2013 due to the knowledge about state-of-the-art technologies and methods. Faculty The professors at the Engineering Faculty at Helwan University have received \u201ctrain the trainers\u201d education and through the Cement Academy they will improve their competences in the cement area significantly. This knowledge will differentiate the faculty from other engineering faculties. The faculty will also benefit from the teaching facilities provided by the project together with the access to on-site training at the Ramliya cement plant. In a longer perspective, the partnership could provide opportunities for collaboration between Helwan University and other universities associated with the FLSmidth programme. The aim of the faculty is also to increase its research activities in the cement field. The first sign of this commitment is that the university has hired three graduates from the first course \u2013 all of whom are carrying out research projects related to improved efficiency, including better environmental performance. Cement companies In our opinion, the main beneficiaries will be FLSmidth and other Egyptian cement companies in the region that will gain much needed access to an increased pool of qualified candidates for job openings. In addition, the cement industry will be branded through the education system, and the aim is to increase the awareness about the career possibilities in the industry and increase the interest of potential candidates. In addition, the knowledge about cement will increase at faculty level, and this could potentially lead to increased interest in research and development in the cement field, which in turn would further benefit the cement industry. In later stages of the Cement Academy, cement technicians and students from the region will also benefit from the courses offered at the Cement Academy. This way the impact of the project will be scaled up significantly. Egypt Through improved cement engineering qualifications, Egypt will be in a position to increase its cement exports further. Moreover Egypt will increase its competitiveness as a destination for foreign direct investments from the global cement industry. Moreover, this type of public-private-partnership is new in Egypt and could open new opportunities for other industries with the same issues as the cement industry. 5.4.3.3 Financial resources Danida\u2019s IPD-CSR Facility Programme 54 (now replaced by the new Danida Business Partnerships 55 ) provided support to the project through the reimbursement of 90% of the total cost of the eligible reimbursable expenses including training and capacity building, environmental equipment, OHS and CSR activities. FLSmidt and Helwan Univeristy previously applied for support under the preparation phase for a Feasibility Study of 75% of the costs, with a maximum support of DKK 54 http://um.dk/en/danida-en/activities/business/partnerships/partnerships-for-development/facilities/ 55 http://um.dk/en/danida-en/activities/business/partnerships/ ",
        "125 350,000, which is \u20ac 46,930. They have finalized the first phase of the support. Both Helwan and FLSmidth plan to apply for the Second part of the Implementation Phase, still under IPD-CSR Facility. Until now FLSmidth has financed everything and they are waiting for Helwan University to sign the papers of the first phase to be reimbursed by Danida. 5.4.3.4 Training and capacity building The key element of this project is of course training and capacity building. There are two major types of training activities in the project: \uf0b7 train-the-trainers; \uf0b7 development of the course structure, cement curriculum and teaching material; and \uf0b7 pilot course \uf0e0 diploma course. Train-the-trainers To ensure that course continues after the projects ends, one of the key elements is to ensure that Helwan University\u2019s teaching staff is trained to a level where they can teach the course without further training and support. Therefore, a train-the-trainer strategy process has been completed. The training took place at FLSmidth as peer-to-peer training as well as at the FLSmidth Helwan Cement Academy. Prior to the first term of 2010, two teachers from Helwan University were included in a training course offered by the FLSmidth Institute in June 2010 in Copenhagen (part 1). From 30 August to 10 September 2010 the two teachers were trained in Copenhagen and from 13 to 17 September at Ramliya (part 2). Helwan professors were also trained through peer-to-peer training in conjunction with courses in the first year. This was done in two steps: \uf0b7 Class: The first year the FLSmidth/NLS trainer was responsible for classroom training. However, dedicated Helwan University staff was integrated in the training to take advantage of the dual teaching competences and ensure optimal coordination with additional curriculum and student support. This has been crucial in preparation for Phase 2, where Helwan University will take more responsibility for the teaching \uf0b7 Follow up: After the class, the FLSmidth/NLS trainer evaluated how the class progressed and discussed necessary adjustments (2 \u00bc hours were allocated to this task). During year 1, a teaching manual and evaluation report was completed after each class describing: o content of the class (which themes were presented); o course material (copies attached); and o evaluation of the class \u2013 suggestions for improvements. The report was completed by the responsible trainer (Phase 1 FLSmidth/NLS). ",
        "126 An important part of the project is to disseminate the knowledge to colleagues at Helwan University to ensure the continuation of the Cement Academy if the trained staff were to leave the university. Development of course structure, cement curriculum and teaching material In the second activity, the course structure was developed by the FLSmidth Institute and gradually transferred to the staff at Helwan University. In addition to the traditional classroom and practical training, four project topics were developed for the Cement Academy students\u2019 graduation projects. These topics were defined by FLSmidth on the basis of challenges faced at cement plants today, giving the students the opportunity to work with \u201creal life\u201d challenges. The four topics were: 1. electrical power; 2. electrical control (PLC); 3. machine alignment; and 4. condition monitoring. FLSmidth and NLS took part in grading and assessing the project reports by the end of the second term together with Helwan University. Development of on-site training The FLSmidth Institute and NLS have developed field visit programmes that support the subjects that have been taught at the Cement Academy with practical training. The students receive training at the training facilities at Ramliya and are taken through guided tours of the plant. On long visits, the students have a chance to apply their knowledge by executing small, supervised tasks at the plant. At least one teacher from Helwan University participates in the plant visits. This type of activity is new to Helwan University and is expected to bring real value to students, the faculty and eventually the companies. Completion of process to obtain official approval of diploma programme After the first year where the course ran as a pilot, the official application for the diploma programme was submitted and has just been approved. Financial sustainability The key to the project\u2019s sustainability and up-scaling will be developing income generating activities that can finance teaching hours and administrative costs. The following models have been discussed, but the main key to success is the fees for enrolment in the Cement Academy where the companies are expected to pay the fee. The other models include: \uf0b7 fee-based short courses with open enrolment for engineers and technicians; \uf0b7 corporate training; \uf0b7 regional expansion through development of \u201csatellite mini-academies\u201d; \uf0b7 research and development services; and \uf0b7 corporate sponsorships from other industry players. The project has dedicated funding for promotion activities and the university has been in close contact with local companies to promote the diploma programme and test the interest in the programme. ",
        "127 5.4.4 Analysis: results, drivers and obstacles 5.4.4.1 Results The result of the pilot course was that a total of 38 students enrolled and 33 passed the course. Of the 33 graduates, a total of 19 got jobs in local cement factories, 8 in NLS and 11 in the other local companies in the Cairo region. This result from the pilot course, which is not even a diploma programme, shows the project\u2019s value added in up-scaling terms as other companies also benefitted from the investment made by the two partners. Three of the graduates were hired by Helwan University where they are currently carrying out research projects on matters related to efficiency and better environmental performance in cement production. Eight of the graduates entered military service. Another successful result is that there has been a transfer of knowledge from FLSmidth to the staff at Helwan University and a full curriculum diploma programme has been established. However, the key to success is the enrolment of students for the diploma programme. Although there have been positive indications, there has not been made any final decision on implementing the Diploma programme yet. It is hoped that the steering committee will do that in January 2013. 5.4.4.2 Environmental impact It is extremely difficult to measure the environmental impact and tech-transfer success in terms of environmental technologies and knowledge as the main purpose of this case study is to show a good example of up-scaling with a different angle of environmental tech transfer. However, the inclusion of the environmental course in the curriculum, which will result in the students becoming acquainted with state-of-the art knowledge on matters such as energy efficiency, waste management, alternative fuels and other environmental issues of relevance to the cement business, will provide real value for the companies and industry as whole. Furthermore, this state-of-the-art knowledge on environmental issues can also be transferred to other industries with high energy use. Finally, the project represents a novel and unique approach to public private partnerships in Egypt and is as such unchartered territory for Helwan University and other universities in Egypt. 5.4.4.3 Drivers for success The FLSmidth decision to invest in the project - both in terms of the self-financed partner search and the investment in time - is the main driver for success. It has been of great importance that NLS opened up for practical on-site-training, which does not only provide relevant engagement of the students but also a chance to apply the technological aspects taught in the classroom. The willingness of Helwan University to engage in a new type of partnership and the risk that it is associated with this (uncertainty) as well as the international experience and profile were drivers for success. Moreover, support for this type of innovative public- private-partnership focusing on the wider impact and activities towards financial sustainability has, if successful, been a key driver of success in relation to the project results. Finally, the size and potential of the Egyptian cement industry and the major problem with finding qualified staff is naturally also an important aspect for the willingness of FLSmidth to investment in the project. Technical drivers : The transfer of technical knowledge from FLSmidth to the staff at Helwan University has improved the knowledge of the staff and this will benefit the current and future students. ",
        "128 The opportunity to obtain technical knowledge from companies has been a driver for the university\u2019s participation in the project. If the diploma course is successful, there is a potential for R&D projects at the university, which can add to the technological development related to environmental issues and energy efficiency in particular. The three students hired by the university after the pilot course are all involved in research activities related to environmental improvement of the production process. Policy and institutional drivers : There has not been any policy or institutional driver for this project. Promotion and awareness building : The activities in the self-financed partnership search have promoted the project and the cement industry amongst both students and local companies in Egypt. Promotion of the Diploma course is a key activity in order to secure financial sustainability of the Diploma program in the post-project period. This activity is funded through Danida project. 5.4.4.4 Barriers Cultural barriers: The only cultural barrier identified by the interviewees has been the difference in the way professors are trained in Egypt. It started in a classroom with students in Denmark, but this is not normal practice in Egypt. The format of the train-the-trainers had to be adapted such that the professors were not in the same classroom as the normal students. This was quickly changed without any delay or problems from either of the partners. Financial and technical barriers: The university has a limited budget to buy new equipment used for teaching at the university and this is a barrier as the state-of-the-art equipment is expensive, but the on-site training compensate for this to a certain degree. 5.4.5 Lessons learned Access to qualified skills is an issue in many countries and regions. In order to successfully transfer technologies from EU companies to companies in third countries trainng is required. In the cement industry in Egypt the training normally either takes place in-house or in Europe and this is costly for the comapanies. Creating a course where students, including employees at the factories, can be tought the neccessary skills, is therefore useful for all companies in the region (up-scaling). The on-site training is new and extremely useful as the students are now able to work with the technologies in a realistic environment. Here, the willingness of the local companies to participate is a must. If the training facilities are in place for the use of newer technologies, this should also ease tech transfers from EU to third countries as the cost of training for the inidividual companies are reduced \u2013 they already know the technology. The technological and environmental knowledge of the students can also be a trigger for new tech transfer projects as they have the knowldge on new technologies when hired by the local companies. R&D activites increase, as local professors/researchers acquire new knowledge., In this case, the university hired three students. They are all carrying out R&D projects and trying to involve the local companies. ",
        "129 One of the lessons learned is that European company willingeness is required. They should take the lead and spend neccessary un-paid time to find the right partners. The pre-support stage is important. One barrier to this type of project is that it is also to the benefit of competitors without them having to invest anything in the project. If the idea and request came from the university or an organisation in a third country, there might be an opportunity to get more companies involved, which should increase the chances of success. 5.4.6 Implications for future policy making In a wider and long run perspective, environmental technology transfer does not have to be based solely on business-to-business relations alone. As, it is seen in this case, a fast and up-to-date platform of academic courses within environmental technology can be set-up with the eventual benefit of having environmentally skilled engineers. Academic training is typically founded on academic research. This case shows a complementary way to upgrading or renewing academic training, namely by involving foreign companies. The R&D-oriented companies, in this case FLSmidt, have typically a forefront technological knowledge and insight which can be used in designing the academic courses, in training both at the university and on-site. Consequently, the courses will probably be further supported by the industry, and the trained engineers will become more suited for future employment opportunities as well since their competence levels have been raised. In the case, it is not only FLSmidth but the industry, as whole, that will ultimately benefit. This approach \u2013 as shown in the case \u2013 is driven by a few individuals/individual companies in a strong and successful bottom-up process. However, the challenge for this approach is up-scaling and having political support to reach a systemic level. Consequently, more generic tools and support instruments should be accessible in order to have several areas of environmental technology to be disseminated through linkages between universities and front edge technology industries which ultimately will be to the benefit of the society and not only to that of individual companies.

        "130 5.5 Fish feed factory in Egypt 5.5.1 Summary The potential demand for fish feed in Northern Africa is extremely large. For several years the local fish feed company, Zoocontrol (now Aller Aqua Egypt), has been trying to take advantage of this potential through several types of initiatives. Some of these initiatives included participation in a Dutch research project with a Belgian company, but these, although informative, did not provide the necessary input to take advantage of the opportunities. Zoocontrol kept searching for a solution to reap the potential benefits in the Egyptian market and in 2009 the CEO of the company participated in an Expo in Poland where they talked to the Danish company Aller Aqua Group. Over the following two years they went through a long process which prepared the two companies to start an official business cooperation, supported by B2B Program through the Danish Development Agency (Danida) in collaboration with IFU56. IFU today has a 20% share of Aller Aqua Egypt. The main objective of the supported B2B project was to finalize the process started by the two companies and to ensure long-term sustainability of the project. More specifically, the business collaboration had a focus on setting up a professional and quality oriented fish feed production where Zoocontrol could increase its skills with different management methods, new methods for production, exercising sales and marketing and procurement. The Danish company, Aller Aqua Group, was responsible for preparing and implementing a substantial training and technical assistance package, as well as for securing potential overseas clients for the products to be manufactured in Egypt. Zoocontrol provided the local infrastructure, manpower and the access to land where the production facility could be established. Reason for participation: For the Danish company, the aim was to gain market access in Egypt as they saw a huge potential in the aquaculture feed market. Aller also saw this partnership as an enabler to get access to the other markets in Northern Africa. For Zoocontrol this was an opportunity to increase capacity and tap into the large potential market of fish feed, also in other Northern African markets, through increasing its capacity of delivering high- quality fish feed. The results: This preliminary work and the B2B project have resulted in several interesting results and processes. These include: For Zoocontol: \uf0b7 New and more efficient technology implemented in Zoocontrol \uf0b7 Better products and new potential markets \uf0b7 Increased collaboration with suppliers and customers \uf0e0 mutual benefits for all partners \uf0b7 Increase in R&D activity \uf0b7 New management skills 56 Industrialisation Fund for Developing Countries (IFU), ",
        "131 \uf0b7 Better environmental performance for Zoocontrol, suppliers, customers and the Egyptian society in general \uf0b7 Establishment of a new company, which Zoocontrol will be part of and the CEO from Zoocontrol will lead For Aller Aqua Group: \uf0b7 New market in Egypt and potential to expand their business to other countries in Northern Africa. Up-scaling: \uf0b7 Benefits for other European technology providers in the aqua feed industry (including environmentally related benefits). New potential markets as they can sell their technology to Zoocontrol and possibly also their clients. \uf0b7 Increased efficiency for suppliers of raw material (farmers) and the aqua culture manufacturers \uf0e0 increased profit and reduction in negative environmental impact \uf0b7 Closer interaction with customers and possibility to provide them with better products \uf0b7 Societal benefits including also safety for workers \uf0b7 Aller Aqua Group is already planning a project with the customers to help them recycle the water used through installing a water pump. Key messages The case shows how the realization of a need and market opportunity, plus a proactive approach from the local company has led to much wider results than expected. The knowledge and technology transfer has not only benefitted the Zoocontrol, but also the wider supply chain and the European aqua feed and technology providers. The impact can be seen in economic terms, societal, and environmental benefits; The latter in terms of energy savings, and reduced use of materials/chemicals. But it can also be noticed that a much smaller share of the fish feed is being deselected and dumped in the waterways for not having the right combination of ingredients. Today 40% of Aller Aqua Egypt is owned by Zooncontrol, 40% by Aller Aqua Group and 20% by IFU. The focus of the Danida B2B programme has been vital for the success of the success of the project, but the case also shows how much work is required in advance in order to even consider such a programme. There might be a role for the European Commission and European governments to ease this preliminary process, which today requires a lot of patience, investments, and time from all company managers. In this case it was obvious that the preliminary process has been the key to success. Necessary conditions are an open mind and determination by the managers of both companies. It seems clear, that many other potential projects will not even reach the stage of contacting the different funding programmes as the process is perceived to be too complicated. 5.5.2 Context, selection, goals and ambitions 5.5.2.1 Country context Egypt is bordering the Middle East at the top east corner of Africa. The population of Egypt is 81 million, where approximately 18 million are located in the metropolitan area of the capital Cairo. The GDP per capita is $6,500, which rank Egypt in the middle of all countries in the world, just below countries such as Namibia, Algeria, Ukraine and ",
        "132 Albania and above countries like Morocco, Jordan and Syria. 20% of the population live below the poverty line. 32% of the labour force is engaged in the agricultural sector, 17% in industry and 51% in the service sector. Fish is a major food source in Egypt and its neighbouring countries. Aquaculture is the largest single source fish supply in Egypt accounting for 65% of total fish production. The production reached in 2009 more than 700,000 tonnes with a market value of US$ 1,354.656 million 57 . 5.5.2.2 Relevance of the aquaculture for Egypt The aquaculture sector is extremely important for Egypt as it is seen as the only possible solution to increase fish production and reduce import. The Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, has in the development strategy highlighted plans to increase Egypt's total fish production to 1.5 million tonnes by 2017 of which 1 million tonnes is planned to derive from aquaculture 58 . Until now the sector is growing at levels exceeding those targeted in the plan. This increase, alongside the planned development in poultry production, also has the target to improve the per capita consumption of animal protein. The current expansion of the aquaculture has already resulted in reducing and stabilizing the cost of fish in Egypt allowing accessibility to the poorer rural population to healthier and affordable animal protein. Aquaculture began in Egypt two decades ago and has since then seen a very rapid increase as illustrated in Figure 40. More than 50% of the aquaculture is in the Nile Delta area, including rice fields. The use of water is coming from drainage from agriculture water or deep wells. The figure clearly shows the development of the sector which started in the late 1990\u2019s. This process also led to the development of supporting industries, including aqua fish feed production.

        "133 The share of aquaculture fish production compared to total fish production has accelerated in the past couple of decades, as shown in Figure 41. In 1988 the share was 18%, in 1998 24% and already in 2000 it increased to almost half (47%). The latest figures (2009) show that the share is now 65%, which means that today more fish derive from aquaculture than \u2018normal\u2019 fish production 59 . Figure 41: Development in fisheries production by type (1988-2006) Source: CIHAM, 2008 There are no accurate statistics on the number of persons involved in the aquaculture sector in Egypt. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 60 provide an estimate. They divide the persons employed into four groups: \uf0b7 Land owners and those with land lease contracts for traditional fish farms. These are normally family businesses. These types of farms are labour intensive and use simple production technologies based on techniques passed on over several generations. The total number of people involved in this type of activity has been estimated to be around 40 000 persons. \uf0b7 Another group includes people working in fish hatcheries, cage farms and intensive pond aquaculture. The majority of people working in this sector are trained technicians and skilled labourers. The figure given in the official documents of the General Authority for Fish Resources Development (GAFRD) is around 25 000 persons. \uf0b7 Another group of persons work at Government-run hatcheries, fry collection stations, juvenile production facilities and fish farms. Their education level differs greatly, from unskilled to highly trained experts. The total number of governmental employees working with aquaculture in the field is approximately 1 000 persons. \uf0b7 The last group includes consultants, feed mill staff , engineers, transport, processing and other support activities. The number of registered consultants is 228 and the number of people working in fish feed production is estimated to be 540 persons . 59 http://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/16891/egypt_vca_2011.pdf?sequence=1 60 http://www.fao.org/fishery/en ",
        "134 The number of people working in the fish feed sector is therefore limited, but the aquaculture is expected to grow if the efficiency of farming increases The feed production is an important element to achieve this goal. The developments in aquaculture production are centred on the application of modern technologies, such as, recirculated systems, intensive farms with paddle wheels, upgraded processing facilities and floating feed or extruded feed instead of trash fish. This results in changes in the structure of the fish farming community, which also includes the feed manufacturing. The high rate of return on investment in aquaculture has attracted a large number of investors with more scientific background than the traditional farmers. Therefore, the sector is becoming more sophisticated and diverse. This is associated with a rapid expansion in support activities. One example is fish hatcheries, which has increased from 14 in 1998 to over 300 in 2009. More than 16 fish feed manufacturing companies have been established in the last 10 years. However, the main challenge for Egypt is to increase local production of fish and mostly fish feed to avoid having to import it. The problem is that the Egyptian aquaculture feed manufacturers are at their maximum production capacity able to produce around 50% of the potential market in Egypt. With severe import restrictions in place on fish feed, which is motivated by financial issues, high prices and also a preference in old methods using trash fish, this poses a major problem. The country has an untapped market to support a better and larger fish production output. Inefficient production using low quality pellet feet and trash fish also results in environmental issues, such as an increase in energy use. Another negative consequence from fish feed not meeting the quality demands is that the feed is often dumped into the waterways in Cairo which adds to environmental pollution. Egypt has limited water resources, so the quality and quantity of water is therefore extremely important for the aquaculture farmers. Intensification of the production systems is a must in order to increase production with limited resources. The quality of the fish feed is important for this intensification process as less additional resources (crops and water) will be needed. In short, improving the quality of fish feed and reducing the quantity of fertilizers used in the feed is a key aspect of reducing the environmental impact of acquaculture. This case will show how the quality of the fish feed can be improved through knowledge transfer and technological transfer between a local and European company. 5.5.2.3 Background The large potential market for fish feed in Egypt has been the driver for both companies. However, in order to fully understand why this is an interesting case, it is important to look at the activities carried out by Zoocontrol. They have been actively searching for opportunities to increase their market share on the Egyptian market and dig into the untapped potential, prior to the collaboration with Aller Aqua Group. Zoocontrol, established in 2001, has previously tried to collaborate with European partners Although they learned a lot from the programmes, it did not entirely fit their needs. One example was collaboration with a Belgium company. A concentrate was developed in search of a better quality feed to meet new demands, especially the type of fish served for tourists, such as sea bream and sea bass. The collaboration existed as a joint stock company where Zoocontrol had to pay a royalty fee. However, these fees proved too expensive for Zoocontrol as the profit margin was very limited. They therefore stopped the collaboration. Another example is an R&D project which Zoocontrol engaged in, sponsored by the Dutch Government The aim was to improve the aquaculture sector in Egypt. It involved study ",
        "135 tours, internal and external seminars and conferences. However, although very informative and inspiring, no direct results were gained in the project for Zoocontrol. It was not until the CEO of Zoocontrol went to an Expo and established a contact with Aller Aqua Group that a successful partnership was formed. The idea for the business cooperation between Aller Aqua Group and Zoocontrol was to establish a production facility for the production of high quality fish feed in Egypt. The existing producers in Egypt experienced a high pressure on both the quality of their output and a demand for increasing their capacity to meet market demand. Therefore, Aller Aqua decided to engage in this market opportunity, jointly with Zoocontrol. 5.5.2.4 The initial process The official Danida B2B project did not start until 2011. Prior to this, a long preparation process started in 2009. The reason for the long process was that Aller Aqua Group decided not to start a green field project. This would, in process terms, have been much easier. However, Aller Aqua Group saw a large potential in joining forces with Zoocontrol and decided to use their local knowledge and know-how to enter the market. At this point, Aller Aqua Group and Zoocontrol contacted the Industrialisation Fund for Developing Countries (IFU): an independent, self-governing fund associated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded back in 1967. The objective of IFU is to promote economic activity in developing countries in collaboration with Danish trade associations and industry. The fund offers capital and advice to joint venture enterprises in developing countries and participates as a partner in the joint ventures through committing equity capital and/or loans and through board membership. IFU has a long track record of working in Egypt and also has vital knowledge about the steps necessary to set up a joint stock company. IFU helped to identify a local lawyer for Aller Aqua Group and established other necessary contact to go through the due diligence process. Except from the legal work, several tests and site visits were completed in order to look at the potential for collaboration. Only when the two companies agreed on the mutual terms for collaboration did they make contact to the Danida B2B parthership programme, with the aim to finalize the process and to ensure long-term sustainability of the project. 5.5.2.5 Danida B2B programme The objective of the Danish Development Agency (Danida) in Egypt is to strengthen the production base in Egypt, which is an on-going process. This project has a direct contribution to limiting the dependence on foreign suppliers through the build-up of a stronger local knowledge base in Egypt, in a sector which is lacking skills and high quality solutions 61 . The aim of the project is to stand out as a highly competent production facility with highly skilled staff and to support skills development in Egypt. The aim of the support from Danida is to help establishing a sustainable business that would last even after the support stops, and thereby setting an example to other entrepreneurs in Egypt in a related line of business. The project will especially support the prevention of large expansions of ponds via an 61 Based on input from the Danish Embassy in Egypt - Danida ",
        "136 upgrade in the quality of fish feed, which would have a large negative environmental impact. The focus is to utilise the resources in the most efficient way, which can be done by expanding vertically in aquaculture through intensification. Furthermore the project will provide wider societal benefits via job creations in the private sector and via supporting initiatives in the fish feed industry which has the opportunity to become a much stronger part of the combined economic development of Egypt. In the official B2B projects, Aller Aqua Group CEO Henrik T. Halken and the CEO off Zoocontrol Mohamed Adel Mansour have jointly defined the benefits of the project for the industry in Egypt: 1. High quality fish feed without expansion of existing production; 2. Setting up of an upstream industry which is in great demand in Egypt; 3. New ways of internally organising production; 4. Upgrading professional skills among factory employees and food engineers. Moreover, it is envisaged that these business objectives will generate the following results: \uf0a7 Fish feed made in Egypt on the basis of Danish know-how on fish feed production is one of the key factors for success in the local market. Both partners are convinced of this. Furthermore, this step will support the development of Egypt. It will enable them to provide quality fish feed for the aquaculture industry and limit the dependence on imported solutions; \uf0a7 The project will demonstrate to Egypt that high quality fish feed can be made just as well in Egypt as in Denmark; \uf0a7 The partners will be offering job opportunities with a potential for upgrading of competences; \uf0a7 The partners will ensure proper working conditions including a proper salary for their employees. \uf0a7 The partners will demonstrate that companies with well-educated staff can provide a better working environment, better output and thus higher return on investment. In addition, the partners will take the following important corporate social responsibility (CSR) and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) initiatives: \uf0a7 Secure workers\u2019 rights and human rights; \uf0a7 Compliance with law; \uf0a7 Ensuring internal and external environmental standards are being followed; \uf0a7 Securing proper OHS standards. If the partners do not receive B2B support the above-mentioned issues will still be dealt with, but the implementation of the components would be planned over a longer time span. This gives rise to a scenario where the reaching of commercial objectives requires effort for an extended time span from both sides. Based on experience from the former programs and companies\u2019 increased focus on CSR, Danida Business Partnerships now offers more flexibility in relation to types of activities and partnerships that can be supported. There is an increased focus on results and sustainability, while higher requirements are made with respect to competences and resources of the participating partners. ",
        "137 5.5.2.6 Technologies and R&D The technologies involved in the technology transfer of this project are not high-tech, but still extremely important for both an increase in effectiveness and reducing the environmental impact. The new equipment (hammer mill and micro dosage technology) to be installed has been chosen in collaboration between Zoocontrol, Aller Aqua Group and producers of equipment in Denmark. The new equipment is an important aspect, but equally important is the transfer of knowledge on management issues and business models, which also has an important impact on the technologies in question. The knowledge on business models transferred includes increased use of R&D results (provided by Aller Aqua Groups R&D facilities \u2013see below), increased contact, communication and collaboration with suppliers and customers. Annual budget and investment plans are all new for Zoocontrol, which was previously family-run. The direct purpose of the technology transfer is not to decrease the environmental impact, but rather to increase efficiency of the production and the quality of the feed. Making production more efficient will decrease energy use and improve the quality of the feed. This results in lower use of fertilizers and lower use of feed. The reduced use of feed will reduce the water pollution (phosphor and NO3) at the same output level and thereby protect the already limited water resources. In the end this will reduce the environmental impact in the entire value chain, both from Zoocontrol and from suppliers and customers. Below is a short description of the technologies used in this project. But the upgrade and transfer of technologies is expected to continue after the project ends. Hammer Mill (Grinder) The aqua feed has to be finely ground in order to improve the quality. A new hammer mill has been installed and this has resulted in better products which are better ground. This is important for the quality of the feed. If the feed is not ground into pellets in the proper way, but instead would be mash ground, the fish will not be able to consume the feed. This waste would not only be a higher cost for the farms, but would also pollute the water. The pellets are more water stable when ground through the hammer mill compared to products that are not ground by a hammer mill, which will increase the uptake of feed for the fish. Micro dosage technology Micro dosage technology will be installed in the production line and will replace manual dosage. The manual dosage results in a larger part of the feed not meeting the product specifications due to wrong dosage. Without the technology there are large fluctuations in the feed quality due to fluctuations in micro ingredients dosages, which is created by manual mistakes. Wrong dosage will have an impact on the quality of the feed and, if in larger quantities, it will have to be recycled and reproduced. This would result in increased use of input materials, labour, water and energy. The micro dosage technology is seen as a vital part of the project. An increase the efficiency of the feed production means that less feed is needed by the farmers to feed the fish. This also results in less pollution and more efficient uptake, which then lead to a reduction in, for example, phosphor and NO 3 . Air compressor The old air compressor created wet compressed air and consumed a large amount of electricity in order to create the desired pressure. It also caused a lot of maintenance work due to water vapours in the production line. ",
        "138 The new technology produces dry compressed air and has basically made the production line maintenance free. It reduces the working hours and also the \u2018down-time\u2019; this is where production is stopped. R&D lab Aller Aqua Group has to comply with higher environmental and efficiency standards compared to the factories and markets that are located outside Europe. In order to continuously improve the products, Aller Aqua Group is constantly improving the formula for feed in the R&D lab which is situated in Denmark. This knowledge has been transferred to Zoocontrol (and other factories) to improve their products using new production processes, new materials and through new technologies. However, the knowledge is also transferred to the suppliers and customers of Zoocontrol, bringing added value to the project and industry in Egypt as a whole. Water pumps The work with the customers also included an environmental technology aspect. Aller Aqua Group visited the customers (Aquaculture farmers) and they offered them training in environmental aspects (see section on training below). In addition to the training, Aller Aqua Group is currently looking into funding opportunities for a project based on recycling the water at the aquaculture farms where water is a limited and a key resource. The technology is the same as the one used in European aquaculture farms, but yet to be introduced to Egypt. Pumps reduce water use and also increase the efficiency of the production and improve the product quality. 5.5.2.7 Relevance of this case study for the project This case is interesting in several ways. The first interesting point is that the initiative was taken by the company in Egypt, which suggests that this is a clear case where the project is based on a real need in the developing region, but which at the same time offered opportunities for the European company. The case also has an interesting element of up-scaling as the impact of the project has benefitted not only the two companies, but the entire supply chain: customers and other technology suppliers working within the aquaculture field (mills, pumps, compressors, dosage technologies etc.) . Also, further technology transfers are being planned. The case also shows how the transfer of knowledge and technology has an impact on the environment both directly and indirectly. Also, training courses in environmental management and technology are provided to both the direct participants and their customers, which results in a wide impact on the sector and society in general. The case does not show a transfer of a single technology making radical changes to the industry, but a more holistic approach to upgrading in terms of technology, management and R&D. The programme focuses on sustainability both in terms of the environment and long-term economic impact. It is difficult to locate the case study at a certain point in the technology development and diffusion curve, as it does not concern a single technology being transferred. The technology is already developed and used in European companies, but through the project it is being introduced to the aquaculture sector. It therefore has a niche/empowered niche status. However, the aim over time is for both the companies and the Egyptian Government to make the aquaculture sector increase in size and efficiency. The technology transfer is vital for indigenous Egyptian companies to be part of this development. ",
        "139 The case study has been located in the diffusion stage since it is currently being implemented in the aquaculture feed companies and spreading into the wider sector. There is still a large untapped market potential, which will spur the interest of non- Egyptian companies. So the technology transfer is expected to accelerate as the companies gain additional market share. However, in order to do so, the whole value chain needs to be included in the process. This is what the project, to a certain extent, aims to ensure. Aller Aqua has already started expanding the project in order to increase the efficiency and quality of the aquaculture farmers. Figure 42: Position of the fish feed factory case study on the technology transfer and transition curve 5.5.3 Design The figure below shows the wider picture of the process of the project.

        "140 Background: In Egypt the aqua culture production has reached a total of 630.000 tons p.a., hereof 1 million tons of fish feed. The fish consumption is approximately 16 kg per capita p.a. and with Egypt\u2019s population of more than 80 million people, the country is a serious consumer of fish 62 . The partners first met in 2009 and continued the project development discussion during 2010. Midyear 2010, they agreed on a preliminary investment planning based on taking over the existing Zoocontrol plant in Cairo. The partners then decided to request the Danida B2B programme for support to initiate and start working on the development of their long term partnership via initiating the pilot project phase. The pre-project due diligence activity showed that Aller Aqua could offer its skills and competences to the new venture in order that quality products can be manufactured at competitive prices. It also showed that Zoocontrol had a good market penetration and understanding of manufacturing processes in Egypt and that jointly their mutual efforts are well engaged into setting up a joint venture for a fish feed production plant. The business collaboration directly focused on setting up a professional and quality- oriented fish feed production. The local partner obtained a good opportunity to increase management skills, learn new methods for production and exercise sales, marketing and procurement. Clearly, both partners felt that they were excellent in many areas and jointly assessed that they would be able to form a strong partnership. During the project, Aller Aqua was responsible for preparing and implementing a substantial training and technical assistance package as well as securing potential overseas clients for the products to be manufactured in Egypt. Zoocontrol provided the local infrastructure, manpower and the access to land where the production facility was established. The following areas received special attention during the pilot phase training programme: 1. Management; 2. Production technology and processes; 3. Upgrading production technology; 4. Raw material handling; 5. Implementation of new recipes; 6. Quality assurance. The aim of the training was to secure the partners with a strong platform for further development. The pilot project commenced in February 2011 and initiated by outlining the steps to be taken for starting the transfer of training and technical assistance. 5.5.3.1 Main stakeholders The main stakeholders in the project are: \uf0b7 The family-owned local aquaculture feed producer, Zoocontrol, established in 2001. \uf0b7 The Danish aquaculture feed producer Aller Aqua Group A/S 62 http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/naso_egypt/en and input from Danish Embassy in Egypt ",
        "141 \uf0b7 The Industrialisation Fund for Developing Countries (IFU) was founded by law in 1967. The objective of IFU is to promote economic activity in developing countries in collaboration with national partners. \uf0b7 DANIDA, the Danish agency for development cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark through its B2B Programme. As a result of the activities and the development of the project, other stakeholders include the suppliers to Zoocontrol and their customers and national experts. All of these have been consulted and invited to participate in the training courses of the project. 5.5.3.2 Targeted beneficiaries The direct beneficiaries in the project are Zoocontrol and Aller Aqua Group as they have received the funding and are carrying out the activities in the project. However, the suppliers and customers have been involved in the project through site visits and involvement in the training activities. The site visits are a result of the new business model transferred from Aller Aqua to Zoocontrol, which include site visits to suppliers and customers. Further, local experts in aquaculture have participated in the training courses \u2013 funded by Danida as a project activity \u2013 which is expected to give them new insights. The overall aim is to increase the market share and production levels. This is in line with the Government target to increase local production. The improvement in fish feed will also improve the final product, the fish, and at the same time reduce the environmental impact. This has wider societal benefits. Finally, the project will also benefit European technology providers, who provide the technologies being transferred. Basically the whole value chain has benefitted from the project. The figure below provides a simplified overview of the value chain. Figure 44: Value chain in the fish feed factory case The suppliers are the producers of the input materials (fishmeal \u2013 but also alternative materials such as soybean meal). Zoocontrol uses the material to produce the fish feed. The feed is then sold to their customers , the fish farmers. The farmers sell the fish directly to the consumer or through a shop/supermarket. 5.5.3.3 Financial resources The Danida B2B Program provides support to the project through reimbursing 90% of total cost of eligible reimbursable expenses including training and capacity building, environmental equipment, OHS and CSR activities. B2B supports each project up to DKK 5,000,000 maximum. Until now, both partners have applied for support under the pilot phase with maximum support DKK 1,000,000. Both companies plan to apply for the Implementation Phase under the new DB rules of support (50%). The new application should not exceed DKK 4,000,000 budget for DB support.

        "142 5.5.3.4 Training and capacity building Training and capacity building are two of the key elements in this project. Training has included both management training and training of the workers. Two types of training were carried out in both Denmark and Egypt for the Zoocontrol staff: \uf0b7 Introduction to new methods and technologies (those that will be implemented) \uf0b7 Introduction to environmental management and business models (managers) \uf0b7 Health and safety course. The training has included alignment of business models, increase in production efficiency, CSR and OHS 63 and to train employees in new technologies. The expected pay-off is: increased efficiency, better products, increased market share for both partners, and increased environmental performance. One very interesting aspect of the training activity is that it does not only include Zoocontrol, but also the customers and Egyptian experts in aquaculture. In June 2012 a training course took place in Denmark where different environmental elements of the aquaculture sector were on the agenda. The three day training course included: \uf0b7 Environmental management in the aquaculture sector \u2013 both in relation to feed and the farms \uf0b7 Introduction to new technologies improving the efficiency (production and environmental) of the feed and the fish farms \uf0b7 Introduction to latest methods in aquaculture farming \uf0b7 Visit to different types of fish farms in Denmark \uf0b7 Visit to technology providers in Denmark with focus on environmentally friendly production. The participants included managers from Zoocontrol, fish farmers from Egypt (customers of Zoocontrol and Aller Aqua) and also an expert from the Egyptian Agribusiness association 64 . The aim of this training course was to ensure sustainability through involvement of the wider value chain and the development of the sector in general in Egypt, with a special focus on training the fish farmers and local experts. As previously mentioned, the work with the fish farmers is expected to result in a new project based on reuse of water through advanced water pumps. 5.5.4 Analysis: results, drivers and obstacles 5.5.4.1 Results At the time of writing this report, June 2012, the project was still on-going, so the final results were not yet ready. However, a number of insights can already be given. First of all the aim was to set up a joint venture and increase its turnover. The figure below shows the structure of the joint venture. 63 Occupational Health Services (related to production; suction, light, heat, draft, heavy lift, machinery precautions, general protection gear, others.) 64 http://www.eaga-eg.org/whoweare.asp ",
        "143 Figure 45: Organisational model of the joint venture Source: Danida As the organisational model shows, the ownership consists of 40% owned by Aller Aqua and 40% by Zoocontrol and 20% by IFU. It also shows that the training and technical assistance is provided by Aller Aqua Group. The target for the project was to increase the turnover and this has been exceeded with more than triple the amount. The partners in the project did not want to share the financial information, so it is not possible to include the actual figures. For Zoocontrol and Aller Aqua Group one of the aims was to reduce the amount of feed used to produce 1 kg fish meat. This goal has been reached as the feeding intensity evolved from 2.5kg fish feed to produce 1kg fish to 1.5kg fish feed to produce 1 kg. For the aquaculture farmers this not only affects the economics of the farm, but also improves the water quality and improves the production per m2 vertically. The hammer mill has been important in this process as it directly affects the feed quality. The better the company grinds the feed formula, the better the feed conversion they achieve. Finally the investment in the air compressor means that they now have dry compressed air to operate the air filter including filter bags. The dry air is used to blow away the dust. The investments in new technologies and equipment (hammer, mill, air compressor, and improvement of formula through the R&D lab) have improved the electricity consumption in the compressor room with a 30% reduction. But equally important, it has also reduced the time spent on maintenance. The micro dosing equipment, which is yet to be installed, will improve the quality of the product, but the result is more related to the precision of the formula and thereby the reduction of mistakes compared to how this previously was done manually. This will save energy, as less feed needs to be recycled. The development impacts of the project included: ",
        "144 Development impact Development issues Description Commercial impact Decreasing import of fish feed Savings due to efficiency Market access experience The new production facility, which is yet to be completed, will be able to cover a larger market and thereby be able to reduce the amount of imported fish feed. The inclusion of suppliers, customers and experts, and associated widening of technology transfer and more efficient production throughout the whole value chain, is also expected to further decrease import demand. The investment in the new technology and equipment combined, combined with the new knowledge, has increased the efficiency of the production and the quality of the product. This provides a benefit for both the fish feed producers and the fish farms. This has resulted in cost savings and reduction of use of water, phosphor and NO3. The partners have jointly secured a good market penetration. This can be derived from the increase in turnover, exceeding the targets of the project. Social impact Increases in employment opportunities Gender aspects in relation to employment opportunities From the beginning, the partners have focused on securing turnover targets. The objective was to use this as the future platform for a positive development of the business and a subsequent expansion of the workforce. However, due to over-capacity, the growth in workforce has been slower than expected. No discrimination will be allowed and inclusion of women in management will be supported. The partners will at a later stage create a labour code which as a minimum follows national Egyptian regulations. Equal employment opportunities for men and women will be pursued. A CSR strategy is currently under development. Several actions are implemented in terms of OHS, including a conveyor belt preventing lifting the heavy bags of feed onto the lorries. ",
        "145 Environmental impact Increased energy efficiency Reduction in pollution Training and investment in new technologies have already saved energy in the production. Further investments are planned, which are expected to reduce energy even more. Already there has been a reduction of 2.5 kg feed used per kg fish, to only 1.5kg. This results in lower water pollution as less feed is used. Training in environmental management and methods is in the longer run expected to decrease environmental impact for both fish feed producers and fish farmers. The planned micro dosage technology reduces the dosage errors and therefore also the re-production of the discarded feed. Technological impact Product/production upgrading New technologies Modern fish feed production equipment has been transferred from the Aller Aqua Group to Zoocontrol. This will also be part of the investment plan (which is new to Zoocontrol). The new technology has increased efficiency and product output quality drastically. The production technologies which are part of the project are new in Egypt. They can set an example to the industry that investments into new production technologies can improve return on investment and support better output targets. Up-scaling Wider impact The whole value chain is now involved in the project: from suppliers of materials to the workers in the factory to customers. The aim is to provide new standards and increase the performance of the industry in Egypt, but it is still too early to assess this impact. However, up-scaling is ensured through local experts being involved in the training activities. This helps to increase the standard of R&D in environmental aspects and efficiency of the sector. It is a good practical example of how investment in existing local companies can pay off \u2013 instead of foreign green field investments. 5.5.4.2 Drivers for success One of the key drivers in the project is the personal motivation of the CEOs from both Zoocontrol and Aller Aqua Group. There is a long process prior to the involvement of Danida, which has been driven by the two companies. \uf0b7 Zoocontrol learned from previous \u2018failures\u2019 in other programmes and were able to cope with the preliminary stages due to this knowledge. ",
        "146 \uf0b7 The knowledge of IFU on the preliminary process has been a major driver for success. The EXPO in Poland and, according to the interviews, similar events bring together companies, business associations and policy makers from the EU Member States and developing countries. This can be a trigger for many cooperation projects. Inclusion of suppliers, customers and experts in the training activities has already led to better communication and is likely to lift both the technological and knowledge level of the industry in general. The Danida B2B programme supports the above activities and focuses on sustainability through training activities with a wider participation than the two companies involved. Technical drivers: Through the training and R&D lab at Aller Aqua Group in Denmark, there is a focus on continuous knowledge development and R&D \u2013 with the aim of increasing the quality of the fish feed. When new potential applications are found, these will be communicated to Zoocontrol and their customers. Previously, this was not possible for the family-run business. Standardisation and quality control has been introduced, which will help to ensure good quality through professional control mechanisms. Zoocontrol has obtained an ISO 9001. Policy and institutional drivers: The Egyptian government\u2019s focus on growth in the aquaculture industry was an important trigger for the collaboration, but except from this there is little institutional support. The EXPO and similar events bring companies, policy makers and experts from different continents together. This was perceived as a very important driver for success, especially if a limited number of countries are represented. The latter makes it easier to get an overview of the opportunities. Promotion and awareness building : One very important element has been that the B2B has not only involved the two companies. The involvement of companies providing the ingredients for the feed, the customers (fish farmers) and regional aquaculture experts has promoted the project beyond the two companies. The transfer of business models from Aller to Zoocontrol is seen as the key to increase the efficiency and quality of the feed and decreasing the environment impact. It also results in a wider impact of the results of the increased R&D activities in the Aller Aqua Group R&D lab. 5.5.4.3 Barriers Cultural barriers: The main cultural barrier has been related to health and safety issues, where many of the new initiatives are new and it takes time to adjust to changes. These are simple things such as wearing hearing protection and helmets, which is not the norm. Financial and economic barriers : The local companies have a limited budget to buy new equipment helping to upgrade production and increase efficiency, both in environmental and production terms. Thus, although the technologies are available, it is often not possible to acquire the expensive technological equipment due to limited budgets. Technical barriers: ",
        "147 The technical barriers are mainly related to the gap between the technology level in the European factories compared to those in Egypt. Therefore, technologies need to be implemented gradually and this is a time consuming process. This gradual implementation is complementary to the gradual adjustment to changes that arises from curltural barriers. External barriers: The revolution in Egypt led to delays in the process as some partners, due to safety issues, were unable to meet up during the main part of the revolution. However, this inconvenience did not stop the process. 5.5.5 Lessons learned Focused events bringing together potential partners from the EU and third countries, such as EXPO\u2019s, are important to identify potential collaboration projects. According to the interviewees, the most effective method is to have events at a national level or sectoral level with a wide participation of companies, investors and policy makers. If events are too large, it is, according to the companies, hard to find the right potential partners. The initial stage, the pre-support stage, is extremely important in order to make technology transfer projects successful. This stage is costly for the companies, especially if it involves joint-ventures, because the two companies need a due diligence process. Market formation plays a vital part in all stages. Also, different national regulations need alignment in order to sign contract. This process involves negotiations and agreements. The advisory support from IFU at this stage was according to the companies very important as the knowledge of the local markets and legislation is difficult to handle for the companies alone. Involvement of the suppliers, customers and local (Egyptian) experts provide greater opportunities for up-scaling and further development of the project after the funding ends. The Danida B2B programme includes staged funding, where the project participants need to achieve targets in order to launch the next stage of funding. This is an incentive to achieve results quickly on the one hand, and on the other hand a way to secure that the funding provided is effective. Wide involvement of participants in the project \u2013 either directly or as an activity of the project \u2013 is more likely to create up-scaling and wider societal impacts. 5.5.6 Implications for future policy making The partners in the project did not see policies having an impact on the technology and knowledge transfer, but provided a few comments which could improve future policy making. Environmental regulation and standards in Europe have entailed that Aller Aqua has an advanced production system which is much more efficient than that of the competitors outside Europe. Aller Aqua sees this as a competitive advantage and as an opportunity to enter new markets in projects where they can transfer this knowledge and technologies used to reach this advanced level. Aller Aqua also mentioned the large potential in aquaculture as food resources are being drained through a growing world population. They see that research to make aquaculture and feed much more efficient is a way forward for Europe and an opportunity to enter new markets. ",
        "148 At Member State level, it was suggested that there should be a focus on bringing together potential partners, including a delegation of policy makers. The first contact is vital and trust is key to start collaboration. More focused events supported by governments in both the EU and third countries are important. 5.5.7 Bibliography for the case Fish feed factory in Egypt \uf0b7 Ahmed, Nassr-Alla (2008): Egyptian aquaculture status, constraints and outlook , CIHAM (2008) \uf0b7 Macfadyen, G.

        "149 5.6 A management system for sustainable aquaculture in Vietnam 5.6.1 Summary Some eight years ago, the Danish company Butler\u2019s Choice A/S was confronted with the devastating working and environmental conditions for aquaculture production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam for Pangasius fish and \u201cBlack Tiger\u201d shrimps. In 2008, Butler\u2019s Choice, which is a company with high quality and environmental standards (UN's Global Compact, certified for environment and labour conditions (ISO 14001 and SA 8000)), established a development project (the Butler\u2019s Choice project), which was funded by Danida (Denmark\u2019s Development Cooperation). The aim of the project has been to develop and implement environmental and social standards in the Pangasius and Black Tiger aquaculture production in Vietnam leading to improved competitiveness for Vietnamese aquaculture enterprises, higher productivity, more focus on environmental aspects, and improved working and living standards. The initial problems in aquaculture farming and production were related to a lack of technical and management skills as well as lacking technical equipment. Consequently, the farmers were unable to establish optimum aquaculture production conditions with a positive impact on the quality of the final product and the environment. Danish aquaculture has in-depth knowledge about the optimum conditions for fish farming in ponds, including water quality, especially oxygen content, and the optimum amount of feed needed to grow the fish as fast as possible without a negative impact on the water quality, and, in a wider perspective, on the external environment. Technologically, aquaculture production can be improved by relative simple techniques such as using an electronic controlling device to measure the quality of the water and automatic pumps or paddlewheels to increase the oxygen content in the water. In this project, the farmers were offered a simple fully automatic control system. However, the challenges to improve the production conditions were mainly been related to soft factors such as (management) skills and knowledge about aquaculture and less so to technological problems. The technology transfer included hard technology, but also knowledge on how to design and manage ponds. The key technology transfer instrument consisted of the establishment of demonstration ponds. The demonstration ponds were equipped with new technologies together with the newly developed management system. Training, and especially on-the job training, was the key approach to increasing the farmers\u2019 knowledge. To establish a close relationship with the farmers (and fish processing companies) Butler\u2019s Choice made used of a subsidiary in Vietnam dedicated to training and coaching the farmers almost on a daily base on how to operate the management system. Furthermore, an aquaculture expert from a Danish engineering company paid the demonstration ponds follow-up visits to check and adjust the management system. The results have been positive in terms of reduced production time and consequently reduced use of feed and energy. The fish has also become healthier by reducing the need for antibiotics. All in all, the quality of the fish has improved and the production costs have been reduced. Dissemination of the results took place by organising workshops for local farmers and producers, but up-scaling the results appears to be difficult because local framers and producers are hesitant about sharing knowledge and experiences and Butler\u2019s Choice is mainly dedicated to working with business relations within their own value chain. After termination of the Danida-funded Butler\u2019s Choice project, Butler\u2019s Choice continued its intervention for sustainable aquaculture in Vietnam by investing in two new demonstration ponds as well as addressing quality assurance in the fish producing companies. ",
        "150 In other words, the collaboration and transfer of knowledge and technology have been embedded in commercial relations and thus in a common value chain where all partners have a common interest in meeting market demands. 5.6.2 Context, selection, goals and ambitions 5.6.2.1 Country context In 1986, Vietnam began its transition from a centrally planned economy to a socialist- oriented market economy. Since then, Vietnam\u2019s economy has grown at an annual average rate of 7.3 per cent, which has transformed the country from an extremely poor country to a lower middle-income country in less than 20 years. However, the country is still facing many challenges in becoming a modern industrialised economy. 65 To illustrate the economic development, from 2003-2008 Vietnam\u2019s economy more than doubled from app. \u20ac 32b to \u20ac 71b, and its exports more than tripled from \u20ac 16b to \u20ac 50b. In order to understand the present case study \u201cManagement system for sustainable aquaculture in Vietnam\u201d, we will look back at the transition process forming the business conditions, e.g. for primary production. In general, the process has been characterised as a \u201cbottom-up gradualist approach\u201d by changing the farmers\u2019 refusal to grow rice beyond satisfying the needs of their own household requirements - from being chronically food deficient - to being a major exporter of rice. Some of the instruments used have been decollectivized agriculture, establishing land user rights, reducing the role of cooperatives, liberalising agricultural prices, and encouraging farmers to export. Significant reforms have also addressed the private sector including trade liberalisation. Consequently, the enterprise sector has become more efficient and there has been a significant boost to foreign direct investment. However, the manager of Butler\u2019s Choice stresses that the pursuit of economic gains has escalated the last few years without much concern for food quality and environmental issues such as overfishing in the rivers, overconsumption of feed to the fish in rivers as well as in ponds. This has a significant negative impact on the quality of the water and, in general, leads to water pollution. 66 5.6.2.2 The history of aquaculture in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam As the Butler\u2019s Choice project was implemented in 2008, this overview of aquaculture in the Mekong Delta focuses on the period until the project was initiated. The Mekong River Delta in the southern part of Vietnam provides good conditions for fishing and producing fish in cages and ponds, c.f. Figure 46. In the last decade, production from aquaculture has increased dramatically, and it has become one of the largest freshwater aquaculture industries in the world. 65 World Bank (2011): Vietnam Development Report 2012: Market Economy for e middle-income vietnam. http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/VIETNAMEXTN/0,,conte ntMDK:23087025~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:387565,00.html 66 http://viden.jp.dk/videnbank/landefakta/default.asp?cid=5886 ",
        "151 Figure 46: The Mekong River Delta in the southern part of Vietnam In the short period from 2002 to 2008, the Pangasius production has increased eightfold from 0.15 to nearly 1.2m tonnes per year, mainly for exports, c.f. Figure 2. Consequently, structural changes have also taken place in the Pangasius farming sector. 67 Extensive ponds and cages, e.g. in the rivers, have been phased out and intensive ponds have been introduced as this enables a better fish quality through better regulation of water exchange and control of the feeding of the fish. Furthermore, the production has mainly been undertaken be relatively small-scale producers, but recently very large, intensive ponds and farms have been established, and fish processing companies have established their own production (farming) facilities and strengthened the vertical integration and reduced the uncertainty related to fluctuating prices and supply. 68 The large farms have undertaken a large share of the increased production. However, the downside of the increased Pangasius production has been shortages in fishmeal and other feed ingredients and environmental pressure due to, for example, land and water use, water pollution, feed management, and use of antibiotics and chemicals. 67 Roel H.

        "152 Figure 47: The development in production and export of Pangasius in Vietnam Source: Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP) The WWF (World Wildlife Fund) argued that the Pangasius aquaculture production had significant negative environmental and social impact. WWF highlighted a number of issues which had been discussed through the Pangasius Aquaculture Dialogue, a multi- stakeholder process that began in 2007 and ended in August 2010, c.f. Box 4. Box 4: Issues raised by the WWF on the Pangasius Aquaculture Dialogue Source:http://www.worldwildlife.org/what/globalmarkets/aquaculture/dialogues-pangasius.html 1. Legal - Farms are sometimes constructed and/or operated outside the legal framework for addressing environmental, social and food safety issues of relevance to the area where the farming occurs 2. Land use and water use - As new farms are established, sensitive habitat can be destroyed and water often is diverted, which can affect other water users and the environment 3. Water pollution and waste management - Excess waste can pollute the water and negatively affect plant and animal habitat 4. Genetics and biodiversity - Pangasius that escape from aquaculture facilities may compete with wild fish and affect ecosystems, especially in areas where pangasius is not yet established 5. Feed management - Use of fishmeal, fish oil and trash-fish as pangasius feed is resulting in depletion of food sources that other fish rely on. 6. Health management, veterinary medicines and chemicals - Pangasius farms are prone to health problems that can impact farmed and wild stocks. Also, the inappropriate use of veterinary medicines and chemicals can have unintended consequences on the environment and human health, such as antibiotic resistance and unsafe products. 7. Social responsibility/user conflicts - Large numbers of workers are employed on pangasius farms and in processing plants, placing labor practices and worker rights under public scrutiny. Also, conflicts can arise among users of the shared resources ",
        "153 Further, the Pangasius had also been an issue in the EU where the environmental and social impact of the production have been discussed which also had an impact on trade. 69 Consequently, in 2008, an oversupply of Pangasius fillets reduced the farm-gate prices to less than production costs. However, the production of Pangasius has increased continuously until today. Shrimp farming has increased substantially in the Mekong Delta over the last 20 years, and Vietnam has become the global export leader with an annual production of more than 300,000 tons. 70 A traditional rice-shrimp farming production system has been applied for decades, where many rice farmers in the saline affected areas have adapted to the natural conditions by growing rice in the wet season and then using the rice fields for growing shrimp in the dry season. This farming practice has provided the farmers with an additional income. 71 However, the rice-shrimp production system in the coastal Mekong Delta only provides the farmers with a low average yield of both rice and shrimps as the production is very sensitive to the balance of rainfall and salinity in the soil and questions concerning the environmental and economic sustainability of the rice\u2013 shrimp system. 72 More intensive farming systems have also been implemented, but very high shrimp feed have led to a significant pressure on shrimp farmers to increase their productivity and this in turn affects the environmental system and increases the risk of epidemic diseases. Thus, in 2008, the shrimp production was adversely affected by epidemic diseases. Exports were affected and the farmers faced difficulties with making reinvestments in the new season. The area used for intensive shrimp farming also tended to decrease. 73 When initiating the Butler\u2019s Choice project, the Vietnamese fish farming practices faced both financial and environmental challenges to ensure that the industry continued to develop in a sustainable manner. 5.6.2.3 The Danish \u201cPublic Private Partnership Programme\u201d The project \u201cManagement system for sustainable aquaculture in Vietnam\u201d was funded by the Danish \u201cPublic Private Partnership Programme\u201d. The \u201cPublic Private Partnership Programme\u201d was launched by Danida 74 in 2004 and ran until 2010. 75 The programme offered the Danish business community the necessary tools to engage actively in local development and strengthening local business sectors (development activities) in the targeted countries. The programme included five sub-programmes: 1. Company CSR initiatives 2. Training programmes for CSR 3. Transfer of management knowhow 69 Bush, R.

        "154 4. Capacity building for researchers in programme countries 5. Business linkage programme The overall framework for the programme was poverty reduction and contribution to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) (e.g. Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability, and Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development), and more specifically the 10 principles of the Global Compact (GC) principles 76 (e.g. principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies). The Danish PPP Programme was explicitly expressed as a follow-up to the MDG/GC. The detailed guidelines distinctly formulate that: 77 \uf0b7 \u201cThe overall objective of the PPP Programme is to contribute to reducing poverty by promoting economic growth and social development in developing countries. \uf0b7 The immediate objective is to promote public private partnerships for better working and living standards in developing countries by advancing corporate social responsibility (CSR) and increasing opportunities for investments and enhanced competitiveness through innovation\u201d. The objectives are to be achieved by establishing public-private partnerships that promote corporate social responsibility within the framework of the United Nations` Global Compact. Corporate social responsibility is frequently applied by the individual enterprises, but by linking it with PPPs, the synergy effects, or additionality, attained through cooperation between several partners have the potential to contribute to wider social and economic development at local or national levels. Each PPP project is expected to have a potential to reduce poverty at the micro level, but a macro level impact requires that PPP/CSR be widely adopted by the private and public sectors in developing countries. Attainment of the programme\u2019s immediate objective is directly linked to the three types of partnership that were introduced with the guidelines. These partnerships \u201c can advance CSR by targeting the local workplace and supply chain in the developing country, or through broader efforts targeting the market, sector or community \u201d. The three types of partnership cover: \uf0b7 Workplace/supply chain partnerships Partnerships aimed at managing risks, minimising negative social and environmental impacts at company level and creating positive value for developing countries and communities by advancing CSR at the workplace and within the supply chain. \uf0b7 Partnerships for development of CSR tools Danish companies cooperating with their external partners, such as community-based organisations, NGOs and local authorities, which can mobilise core competences and resources such as money, products, skills, premises and people to support or strengthen local markets, sectors and communities. \uf0b7 Innovative partnership Innovative partnerships from both spheres that aim to enhance investment opportunities and/or the international competitiveness of local companies. 76 http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/index.html 77 PPP Guidelines, Danida, 2006 ",
        "155 Furthermore, a PPP-project must address at least one of the following six development impact criteria: 1. promotion of human and workers\u2019 rights; 2. protection and improvement of the environment; 3. promotion of sound business practices; 4. promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women; 5. combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; and 6. promotion of innovative partnerships for investments and competitiveness. Besides these criteria, \u201cadditionality\u201d and \u201clocal ownership\u201d are other important aspects that are emphasised in a PPP-project: \uf0b7 Additionality stresses that each partner\u2019s contribution to the partnership is essential for carrying out the project activities and must lead to efforts and activities in the partnership that would not otherwise have been undertaken; \uf0b7 Local ownership underlines that the local partner/partners play an essential role in implementing the project and continue to sustain project outcomes after project completion. The maximum support Danida can provide to a PPP project is 60 per cent of project expenses, but with a maximum of DKK 5m which is about \u20ac 670,000. 5.6.2.4 Objective and relevance of the Butler\u2019s Choice project The overall objective of Butler\u2019s Choice project \u201cManagement system for sustainable aquaculture in Vietnam\u201d was to develop and implement environmental and social standards according to ISO 14001 and SA 8000 in the Pangasius and Black Tiger aquaculture production in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam, leading to improved competitiveness of Vietnamese aquaculture enterprises, higher productivity, more focus on the environmental aspects and better working and living standards. The project was funded for the period 2008 to 2010 by the Danish PPP-programme, explicitly relevant for the sub-programme for \u201cTransfer of management know-how\u201d with an expectation to meet programme criteria as protection and improvement of the environment and promotion of sound business practices. The project focused on diffusion of existing generally rather low-tech technologies easily deployed in aquaculture and fish processing industries, followed by training and implementation of management systems. The focus of the project was not only the individual company, as the supply chain perspective is crucial for delivering high-quality and sustainable fish products. In a broader perspective, the intension was that the management system could by other companies through dissemination and up-scaling the system, cf. Figure 48. ",
        "156 Figure 48: Stage of technology transfer of the Butler\u2019s Choice project In a technology transfer perspective, the project aimed to meet the local companies at their skills and competence levels, and it had high aims regarding improving the environmental impact of the production and the social and financial benefits for the famers and employees. Generally, the outcome of the project was expected to be immediate at firm level (the fish farmer or producer), but in a wider perspective the improved quality of the fish enhances the international competitiveness providing the local farmers and companies with an increased income from exporting. In other words, the project was expected to bridge a local industrial perspective with a global perspective of being international competitive. 5.6.3 Project design and organisation 5.6.3.1 Main stakeholders This case study is a business- to-business project involving companies in the value chain from fish farming, manufacturing of fish products, transportation and trade (whole and retail) while the stakeholder network is in the the shadow of the project. Butler\u2019s Choice A/S 78 was the initiator of the project \u201cManagement system for sustainable aquaculture in Vietnam\u201d. Butler\u2019s Choice, which was established in 1997, is a small company with 24 employees situated in Denmark, Vietnam, and India. Its main business area is trading (wholesale) of fish products and company\u2019s main trademark is high-quality products (Fair Fish 79 ). Regarding quality, Butler\u2019s Choice argues that the living standard of the fish is crucial together with the production processes and working conditions. In other words, environmental conditions and social responsibility are closely linked to achieving high-quality product. In 2004, Butler\u2019s Choice was certified for environment and labour conditions \u2013 ISO 14001 and SA 8000 and since 2007 they had joined the UN's Global Compact. The main suppliers of fish to Butler\u2019s Choice are fish farms (aquaculture) as the company finds that it can be very difficult to control the quality of fish caught in the wild. 80 Since 2001, Butler\u2019s Choice has also had its own representative office in Vietnam. The main task of the office is to ensure high quality through the entire process from catching to processing, packaging and shipment. 81 Based 78 http://www.butlers-choice.com/butlers-choice/historien 79 http://www.butlers-choice.com/en/responsibility/fair-fisk 80 http://www.butlers-choice.com/en/responsibility/fishery 81 http://www.butlers-choice.com/en/responsibility/the-control The Butler\u2019s Choice project ",
        "157 on this business philosophy, Butler\u2019s Choice initiated the project in question aimed at improving fish farming and production conditions in Vietnam. Danida funded the project within the Danish \u201cPublic Private Partnership Programme\u201d (cf. Section 2.3). The Danish Vietnamese Aquaculture Technology Centre, VIDATEC 82 , is in 2012 in the process of being established and strictly speaking cannot be seen as stakeholder in this project but more as an outcome of a commercial relationship between the two countries. The Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP) 83 , which is not directly involved in the project, is a business association for Vietnamese seafood producers and exporters that provide services for the seafood sector. The association, established in 1998, supports its members in developing commercial activities and acts in the interest of their members. On the international stage, the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) 84 is a key stakeholder watching the environment and sustainable fish farming and production conditions. In Vietnam, the Mekong River Delta focus is on wild fishing and aquaculture. In 2010, the WWF found that the intensive Pangasius production was leading to unacceptable pollution of the Mekong River due to overconsumption of feed substances, medicine and other subsidiary materials, and Pangasius was black listed. This meant that it was placed on the WWF-red list. This means that the WWF advised buyers to look for an alternative seafood choice. 85 At the beginning of 2011, WWF upgraded the Pangasius after an agreement with Vietnam authorities to encourage Pangasius farmers to implement the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) standards. 86 87 5.6.3.2 Targeted beneficiaries The targeted beneficiaries were primarily the local participating companies and their employees as project activities, including transfer of technology and knowledge, were aimed at these target groups. The project has been running since 2008 by Butler\u2019s Choice and five local companies in the Mekong Delta have been involved in the project: \uf0b7 An Giang Afiex Company, An Giang province, a manufacturing company without its own ponds \uf0b7 Cuu Long Seaproducts Company, Tra Vinh province, a manufacturing company In a second and extended phase of the collaboration between Butler\u2019s Choice and Vietnamese companies other companies have been involved. 82 VIDATEC has been formed to transfer new technology from Danish aquaculture technology suppliers to the Vietnamese aquaculture industry. The VIDATEC is therefore expected to play a major role in establishing strong green partnerships between companies in aquaculture, and to set the framework for future development in the sector. The first in focus will be the Pangasius helping to develop a greener and more sustainable sector for the benefit of both producers and the environment. http://www.aquacircle.org/modules/default.aspx?pageid=8&newsid=662 83 http://www.eng.vasep.com.vn/ 84 http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/wwf_offices/vietnam/ 85 http://qualasaexpertise.wordpress.com/2010/11/22/pangasius-on-the-red-list-by-wwf/ 86 http://www.globefish.org/pangasius-february-2011.html 87 http://www.asc-aqua.org/index.cfm?act=tekst.item&iid=2&lng=1 ",

Butler\u2019s Choice benefits from the project by having access to high-quality products, which will also benefit the company\u2019s customers . Keeping the value supply chain perspective in mind, (Danish) suppliers of technology and consulting companies (technical consulting) are also found among the beneficiaries even though more indirectly as supplies. 5.6.3.3 Financial resources For the period 2008-2010, Butler\u2019s Choice received a total of DKK 3,851,000 (about \u20ac 510,000) from Danida\u2019s PPP programme as co-founding for the project. Additional founding was raised as investments by Butler\u2019s Choice and as working hours by the participating companies. The funding was mainly available for training, etc., and only to a limited degree for investment in technology. The extension of the project activities beyond 2010 has been financed. At this stage we do not know yet by whom and for how much. Note that these activities are only to a limited degree discussed in the case story. 5.6.3.4 Training and capacity building The Butler\u2019s Choice project has developed and transferred a management system for sustainable Aquaculture in Vietnam, involving development of new management schemes and new quality control schemes for Black Tiger shrimp production and Pangasius production respectively. The point of departure : Traditionally, fish farming has taken place as cage farming in the river or along the riverbanks. These two forms of aquaculture have increasingly been phased out due to problems with water pollution. This pollution is caused by use of too much animal feed and sewage passing directly into the river and affecting the living standards of the fish as well as its quality. Consequently, pond production turned out to be the only real alternative, but the farmers were inexperienced with pond production because they did not know how to design a pond (size and depth of the water) and hardly knew anything about water management. Consequently, the water became too hypoxic whereby the level of dissolved oxygen diminished below critical rates, generating bad living conditions for the fish. 88 The participants \u2013 the main target group The project was designed to support small companies with lack of skills for running aquaculture production as ponds. The ponds could either be managed by individual farmers supplying manufacturing companies or by the manufacturing companies themselves. In both cases, the supply chain perspective between ponds and manufactures was evident, and consequently there was also been some focus on the manufacturing processes. 88 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental) ",
        "159 Technology The technology to improve and optimise the pond production of Pangasius fish and Black Tiger is based on rather simple, low-technology, but in-depth (research-based) knowledge about the optimum living \u2013 production \u2013 conditions for farming Pangasius and Black Tiger shrimps in ponds. The project provided the farmers with knowledge about: \uf0b7 designing the ponds \u2013 optimal size and depth of the water; \uf0b7 the optimum oxygen content and the optimum level of pH-values; \uf0b7 the optimum volume of animal feed needed to maximise the yield; and \uf0b7 how to measure or monitor the water quality. Technologically, the fish farmers were equipped with a fully automatic monitoring system that can continuously monitor the water quality and keep a \u201cbook record\u201d of the water quality. Furthermore, the fully automatic monitoring system is linked to pumps or paddlewheels starting when asked by monitoring system to bring the quality of the water back to the optimum oxygen level, etc. Training and capacity building The training and capacity building was based on three elements. First, two demonstration farms (ponds) were established (one for each species). The demonstration ponds were equipped with new technologies (e.g. paddlewheels, tubes with filters, measuring instruments to measure oxygen, pH, etc., simple hand-operated instruments and a fully automatic monitoring system) together with the newly developed water management schemes. Second, training and capacity building mainly took place as \u201con the job training\u201d where Butler\u2019s Choice employees from Denmark and the Vietnamese office visited the farms often on a day-to-day basis and sometimes worked at the farms. These visits functioned both as training sessions and as control/feedback on how the water management system had been operated. Third, a Danish engineering company was associated with the project and a technical, environmental aquaculture expert visited the demonstration farms for in-depth control and training. During this visit, technical adjustments were made. 89 5.6.4 Analysis: Achieved results - drivers and obstacles 5.6.4.1 Immediate results of the Butler\u2019s Choice project An internal evaluation 90 stresses that the demonstration ponds equipped with new technologies and the new management schemes achieved exceptional environmental and economic results: \uf0b7 Two demonstration farms were selected to apply for Butler\u2019s Choice\u2019s new technology and management scheme and have earned much better crops than before. \uf0b7 The farmers also saved considerable production time and energy consumption. 89 This is a link to a short video presenting Butler\u2019s Choice A/S and the video follows a experts visits to the farms. http://www.butlers-choice.com/en/node/106 90 Made by the The Danish Embassy in Vietnam ",
        "160 The demonstration farms have, according to the internal evaluation, achieved the following technical results: \uf0b7 production time reduced from 120 days to 100 days; \uf0b7 energy consumption reduced by 42% compared to last crop/neighbouring pond; \uf0b7 food conversion ratio in fodder dry weight given per production weight gain (FCR) was reduced from 1.4 to 1.1; \uf0b7 reduced discharge of nitrogen & phosphorous to the external environment due to reduced FCR; and \uf0b7 no antibiotics used compared to a normal average of 5 applications per crop. All the reduced production costs have been turned into improved profits. Additionally, Butler\u2019s Choice has applied the UN's Global Compact, certified for environment and labour condition (ISO 14001 and SA 8000) which has given Butler\u2019s Choice a price premium of around 20 per cent. 91 Furthermore, a side effect has been improved living quality for the farmer because the fully automatic monitoring system no longer makes it necessary to visit the pond several times a night to start or stop the paddlewheels. In a wider perspective, Butler\u2019s Choice has also initiated some dissemination activities mainly by organising workshops for farmers and manufacturers. Also, presentations have been given by Butler\u2019s Choice and the consultants. Many have attended these workshops. 5.6.4.2 Continued actions and additional results In 2010, after termination of the 2008-2010 Butler\u2019s Choice project, Butler\u2019s Choice invested in two new ponds in the Dong Thap and Bac Lieu Provinces while continuing to maintain the two existing ponds. The ambitions are to disseminate results and experiences to a very large number of Vietnamese farmers thereby increasing more farmers\u2019 earnings and improving their living standards with great environmental benefits. However, since 2010 the Pangasius market has slowed down. Falling prices are caused by increased mass production and reduced amounts of quality fish. Consequently, the fish product of Pangasius was discredited, and as Butler\u2019s Choice did not want to be associated with bad quality, Butler\u2019s Choice decided in 2011 to terminate its engagement in Pangasius and focused more on ASC certified Black Tiger shrimps. It signed a co- operation agreement with WWF-Vietnam to support sustainable shrimp aquaculture in Mekong Delta. Butler\u2019s Choice joined WWF\u2019s three workshops in 2011 and supported oxygen control equipment for one of its farms under the WWF\u2019s project. In line with the original Butler\u2019s Choice project, Butler\u2019s Choice has invited processing factories such as Viet Cuong in Bac Lieu, Fine Food Co in Ca Mau to discuss how to set up a new form of co-operation between EU clients-farmers-producers.. From Butler\u2019s Choice point of view, they have now established import quantities from Vietnam amounting to approx. 1,000 tons/year serving mostly Scandinavia and European markets. Furthermore, Butler\u2019s Choice has promoted a new \u201cFair Fish\u201d brand since 2010. 1 per cent of the turnover from \u201cFair Fish\u201d and the product ranges \u201cWe Care to be Fair\u201d is donated to Choice Foundation, which supports the fish farmers\u2019 children and other people involved in the fish industry. 92 The Choice Foundation \u2013 or the CSR-approach of Butler\u2019s Choice \u2013 has made social investments such as: 91 Se also Nguyen Van Hao (2010) : Current Status of the Pangasius Industry in The Mekong Delta, Viet Nam.

Consequently, in the beginning some drivers of success may have been barriers but have later turned into drivers of success. Some of the barriers that have turned into drivers of success are listed below. In reviewing the partners, the organisation of the project and the process of implementation, the following drivers of success should be highlighted: \uf0d8 Butler\u2019s Choice effect: the company, and particularly the CEO, has high aims regarding food quality closely linked to improving the environmental and social conditions for aquaculture and the working condition. The CEO\u2019s own beliefs, ambitions, and enthusiasm have been a driving force. \uf0d8 Organisation of the project in a value chain perspective : by linking or including several parts of the value chain into the project, valuable knowledge has been shared and a common responsibility for producing high-quality, sustainable products has emerged. \uf0d8 Local knowledge/insight combined with international outlook in terms of technological knowledge and market intelligence : Butler\u2019s Choice has become a reliable and attractive partner for the local partners as they work \u201cat eye level\u201d with the local farmers and manufactures, and at the same time bring in new technologies and access to the market. Consequently, Butler\u2019s Choice and the local farmers developed a mutual, environmental and commercial interest. \uf0d8 Local representative of But ler\u2019s Choice: the local presence of Butler\u2019s Choice provides the local advisers with a unique insight and understanding that is a key competence for successful technology and knowledge transfer. \uf0d8 Hands-on training and learning by doing: in this case, technology transfer has been organised very practically and integrated into the day-to-day working process and not as academic class training. The new technology and training have come into immediately use and have benefitted the local companies and their employees. \uf0d8 A commercial perspective: the project is of vital importance for the income or welfare of all partners, and is not solely a philanthropic aim for environmental production. \uf0d8 Patience: changing an economic social structure and traditions can take time, but Butler\u2019s Choice\u2019s experience is that patience is more important than rushing on with the implementation of new technologies and methods. In an overall perspective, the key driver of success can be said to be a local approach with an international outlook. ",
        "162 5.6.4.4 Barriers Even though several drivers of success have been activated, some barriers have also been/are still a challenge. And in some cases they have even been a threat to the success of the project. The main barriers to project implementations have been: \uf0d8 Language skills: lack of language skills makes communication very difficult and is a barrier to successful training. \uf0d8 Business skills and traditions: in general, the farmers do not have any professional education and training and no tradition or business culture for working with quality management. \uf0d8 Technical skills related to fish farming and production : the technical skills related to aquaculture are often insufficient. Consequently, they may make wrong decisions, e.g. by trusting medicine dealers who may persuade them to buy medicines, and believing in the effect of such medicines even though it might not be the case. \uf0d8 Trust : lack of trust can be a hindrance for fruitful and constructive dialogue and training environment. \uf0d8 Lack of capital : access to capital is often crucial when companies have to invest in new equipment. In this case, the PPP-program did not offer capital for investing en machinery, and the farmers and manufactures have to rely on the local capital market. Some of the barriers are of a structural character, and Butler\u2019s Choice only has a limited possibility to change these conditions and then only marginally for participating partners. 5.6.5 Lessons learned Having the drivers of success and barriers in mind, some lessons learned can be highlighted. These are related to the implementation and effectiveness of the project, and to the possibilities for scaling up the experience: Implementation The hands-on approach in the Butler\u2019s Choice project can be utilised in other projects. The strength of the approach is that it incorporates and combines several elements or objectives, such as environmental improvements, improving the technology and competence platform of the companies, focusing on a commercial perspective at all stages in the value chain and, finally, caring about the financial and social well-being of the local companies. Effectiveness Applying a hands-on approach has meant that the participating fish farmers and manufacturers took along several outcomes. In this case, striving for an environmental and economically sustainable aquaculture production of fish has gone hand-in hand, as the new management system has enabled a production that has reduced the needed input of resources as well as reduced production time. At the same time, the farmers have earned much better crops than ever. Finally, the environment has benefited from reduced water pollution, and the quality of the products has been enhanced, leading to a positive effect on exports of the product. Up-scaling It is very difficult to estimate the scaling up effect of the Butler\u2019s Choice project, as the project has mainly focused on a small, local group of fish farmers and manufacturers without any wider objective of transferring or disseminating the project\u2019s results and experiences. The Butler\u2019s Choice project could be a \u201cgood practice case\u201d that can be used in promoting new production and management systems in aquaculture in the Mekong ",
        "163 River Delta or even in a wider perspective. If the approach was to be scaled-up, an institutional anchoring will most likely be needed. 5.6.6 Implications for future policy making When studying the Butler\u2019s Choice project, the experiences and the outcome and effects of the project seem very positive from both an environmental, social and economic perspective. The strength of the project is that it takes a holistic approach where a key factor of success is that all the involved partners must benefit from the project. The value chain approach, the local trainees and a dedicated project manager, i.e. the CEO of Butler\u2019s Choice, have tied the activities and engagement together. In a one-to-one technology transfer perspective, the applied approach is successful. Nevertheless, for future policy-making, this approach may in some ways be problematic if the overall aim is to scale-up the effects: First, if a considerable number of local companies have to be involved, it might be very challenging or even extremely difficult to initiate such a huge number of technology transfers projects. Second, the Butler\u2019s Choice project can be seen as a demonstration project serving as inspiration to other companies. The efficiency of such an approach may be rather low if not followed up by e.g. education, on the job training and consulting. If the political ambition is large-scale structural change to the benefit of the environmental and economic development in the Mekong Delta, an institutional approach will probably be needed, including: \uf0b7 Training - vocational training and education should be provided by institutions or business associations. \uf0b7 Improved access to capital. \uf0b7 Legislation regulating production affecting the environment, official control of food stuffs, etc. As Butler\u2019s Choice largely stands for a \u201csoft\u201d regime approach, the real challenge will be to combine the \u201csoft\u201d and institutional approach to gain long term and sustainable changes. Some of the recognised institutional challenges 93 seem to be related to monitoring and management of the seed quality, feed quality, water environment, and the final product. This could include the strengthening of the inspection networks for the whole supply chain. Another issue is related to standardisation and certification where many international standards and labels are used. The success of certification will depend on capacity and willingness of the farmers to adapt to international standards as well as to what extent influence can be exerted on related stakeholders. And in a technology transfer perspective, a final consideration could be how to strengthen structures to encourage deployment of updated biotechnology into the aquaculture production. 93 Bush, R.

        "164 5.7 Improved cook stoves for rural Uganda 5.7.1 Summary Research on improving cook stoves goes back to the 1950s. This research has been followed by decades of large-scale programmes to improve stove design and efficiency. Many implementation approaches have been tried all over the world, with successes, but also with many failures. In Uganda, several projects on dissemination of Lorena cook stoves are currently deployed. This case study report will present two of them: a large- scale dissemination programme by GTZ and a small-scale project by TRIAS. Some of the major barriers to cook stove diffusion are inappropriate technology, high investment and development costs for starting manufacturers, negative experiences from the past and lack of awareness of the benefits. Capacity building and training of all stakeholders is of great importance. Recent developments in carbon financing mechanisms provide a promising route for future funding of projects aimed at energy efficiency. However, care should be taken to spend these revenues in such a way that technology diffusion is facilitated, while maintaining good product quality and a healthy local market. 5.7.2 Context, selection, goals and ambitions 5.7.2.1 Country context Uganda is located in East Africa, with Kampala as capital city. The population is estimated to be about 32 million people, but growing fast (3.5 % p.a.). Most households live in rural areas and about 75% earn their income by farming. With 2 rainy seasons per year, the region has a moderate to high fertility. Farmlands are highly fragmented and mostly smaller than 2 acres. The average monthly income for a farmer is about 10 euro. Over 50% of women are illiterate (TRIAS, 2010). Access to modern energy services is very limited. More than 93% of primary energy needs are covered by biomass (firewood and charcoal), 6% by fossil fuels and only 1% by electricity from hydropower and thermal power plants (CREEC, 2011). Traditionally, a rural household in Uganda cooks its meals in a 3 stone stove, under which firewood is burnt (TRIAS, 2010). In addition to the low efficiency (9 to 14%) of this process, the combustion of biomass, which is typically fuel wood, generates smoke. This smoke spreads throughout the whole kitchen, as there is no chimney and insufficient ventilation. The smoke causes an unhealthy indoor environment, causing widespread respiratory diseases, eye infections and even cancer. The World Health Organization estimates harmful cook stove smoke to be one of the top five threats to public health in poor, developing countries. Women, who are traditionally responsible for cooking, and young children are disproportionally affected. In addition, women and children are also responsible for the collection of fuel-wood, which takes a lot of time and effort, and keeps them away from education and social activities. In Uganda, wood resources are overexploited due to population growth and increasing demand from small industries. It has been estimated that 91% of the wood harvested is destined as fuel. This leads to deforestation (2,3% in 2005 (CO2-Logic, 2011)) and increases the burden on women and children even more, as they have to wander farther away from their village to gather wood, making them more vulnerable to violence (e.g. around refugee camps and in conflict zones). Even though biomass is a renewable fuel, unsustainable harvesting of biomass will have severe impacts on the local and global environment (The World Bank, 2011). The Hoima District, where the TRIAS project is promoting wood-saving stoves, is situated in the South-West of Uganda and counts about 420.000 people. The area has a high rate of deforestation caused by cutting trees for fuel wood and charcoal making (TRIAS, 2011). ",
        "165 5.7.2.2 History of cook stove technology The research on improving cook stoves dates back to the 1950s. This was followed by decades of large-scale programmes to improve stove design and efficiency. In some cases, mud stove designs have developed without outside influence, due to firewood scarcity and local creativity (Gitonga, 1995). Over the past decennia the focus of stove introduction programmes has shifted from technology improvements to the socio-cultural contexts in which the stoves operate and the implementation approaches. Many implementation approaches have been tried all over the world, with successes, but also with many failures (The World Bank, 2011). In the late 1980\u2019s, the Government of Uganda attempted to stimulate the uptake of improved charcoal stoves across the country through the Household Energy Planning Programme. The programme identified suitable designs, tested them in the lab and produced them at large scale. The aim was to stimulate the commercial market of charcoal. However, the programme proved to be inadequate and policy commitment was poor (\u2018no funding, no facilities, no follow-up\u2019), causing the programme to fail despite high expectations. As a result, improved stoves and alternative fuels (such as LPG and kerosene) are not widely spread in Uganda due to their cost, lack of awareness and other socio-economic barriers. However, in other East-African countries such as Kenya and Tanzania, some positive experiences exist in the field of cook stoves (CO 2 -Logic, 2011). 5.7.2.3 Cook stove technology Clean cook stoves are designed to achieve a relatively efficient combustion, a maximized heat transfer to the cooking pot and a smokeless kitchen environment. A broad spectrum of cooking technologies exist, ranging from raw, unprocessed solid fuels (dung, crop residues, humid wood) in open fires or crude stoves to ultra-clean fuels (natural gas, electricity, solar energy) and modern all-metal cooking devices. In between are a variety of technologies and fuels with varying materials, performance, durability, safety and cost (cleancookstoves.org). Switching to cleaner fuels such as natural gas yields the greatest performance gains, but is only affordable to higher-income groups. In contrast improved biomass stoves and mud stoves are also accessible to the poorer segments of society. Mud stoves are especially suitable for emergency situations, such as refugee camps (Gitonga, 1995; USAID, 2007, The World Bank, 2011). Though solar/gas cookers do exist in Uganda, they are not competing technologies with wood saving stoves in rural areas due to the relatively higher costs and limited availability of gas (Barigye, 2012). There are two general categories of improved cook stoves that are disseminated and in use in Uganda today: simple models for household use and more sophisticated institutional cook stoves for larger establishments (CREEC, 2011). Simply put, all improved biomass cook stoves have some common characteristics (Gitonga, 1995). They consist of an enclosed fire chamber, insulated walls and in some cases close fitting links between the pot hold and the pot. In some cases, the improved cook stove also features a chimney that channels the smoke outside the kitchen. Improved cook stoves reduce money and time required for the gathering of fuel wood, leaving spare time for education, child care and social activities. A cheap and simple improvement on the cook stove can save up to 25-35% of fuel compared to a traditional 3-stone fire. This leads to a significantly reduced pressure on forest resources (CO 2 -Logic, 2011). Several programmes on improved cook stoves are currently deployed in Uganda. The stove type that is promoted in Uganda is the Lorena Stove, which was developed in Guatemala in the early 1980s (Gitonga, 1995). It is an energy-efficient stove made of very cheap and easily available materials: mainly earth, grass and water. The stoves TRIAS is promoting are made from clay/anthill soils, dry grass, water, sweet potato vines (exude a sticky liquid) and pseudo stem (to create passage for the heat) (Allertz, 2012). ",
        "166 Mud stoves are usually made by the user. A major disadvantage is its easy degradation and short life-span. Figure 49: Lorena stove Source: GTZ (2007) Three main business models that are used in the manufacturing and selling of improved stoves are (cleancookstoves.org): \uf0b7 Centralized industrial mass production, which has the advantage of a good quality control during production, delivering typically the highest performing and most durable stoves. It often offers the best possibility to quickly diffuse innovations to the market, through existing supply chains. However, large-scale centralized production needs large investments and has an additional distribution cost, leading to higher market prices. \uf0b7 Local, artisanal production: trained artisans construct mud stoves in people\u2019s homes, often according to a fixed design. This model creates local employment and offers cheap stoves, but quality control is very limited, leading to highly variable performance and results. \uf0b7 Local, semi-industrial production in workshops: This model forms an intermediate situation between the former two models, leading to moderately priced devices with an intermediate quality. 5.7.2.4 Relevance of this case study for the project Throughout the past decennia numerous programmes on dissemination of improved cook stoves have been implemented all over the world with some successes and many failures (The World bank, 2011). This rich history provides ample opportunity to learn lessons from the different approaches that were tried and has led to new insights and improvements that address problems encountered in previous programs. Many of these insights might not only apply to cook stove technology in Uganda, but to technology transfer in general. This case study report focuses on 2 different projects on cook stove dissemination in Uganda. On the one hand the large-scale, energy-focused programme of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) is presented, while on the other hand, a small-scale project by the Belgian NGO TRIAS is presented, which integrates cook stove technology promotion with other focus points. The combination of both projects ",
        "167 allows learning lessons from different approaches, at different levels and different stages of diffusion. Figure 50: Position of the case study on the technology transfer and transition curve 5.7.3 Design GTZ-programme Since 1999, GTZ has been cooperating with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) of Uganda to develop and implement successful energy policies and strategies. The improved household cooking stove dissemination programme started in the context of the Energy Advisory Project in March 2005), in combination with technical trainings, implementation of quality systems and marketing activities and awareness campaigns on energy efficiency and renewable energy. A vital aspect of GTZ's involvement is to provide capacity and resources for developing the staff of all key players in the sector, because the Energy Department of the MEMD, the private sector and local NGOs all suffer from a lack of resources and qualified staff, (GTZ, 2007a). The program is co-funded by the Dutch Directorate-General for International Cooperation (DGIS) (GTZ, 2007). GTZ\u2019s stove dissemination projects focus on market-based approaches. For reaching rural and urban households (and even institutions), the project follows a two-fold approach: in rural areas local artisans are trained to build household stoves, while in (semi-)urban areas, private companies produce household and institutional stoves. Some of the stove artisans in rural areas have now become small entrepreneurs in the stove business as well. Locally produced stoves are preferred over imported products to stimulate the development of local value chains (Blunck, 2010).

Since 2008 and 2009 respectively, the programmes in Hoima and Masindi are led by the Hoima District Farmers\u2019 Association (HODFA) and the Masindi Farmers\u2019 Association (MADFA). In 2011 a similar programme was started in Mbarara (South-West Uganda) by MBADIFA. One of the components of the HODFA/TRIAS programme (though not the core activity) is the promotion of Lorena stoves. The main focus is agri-business development and food security, together with natural resource management and forestry practices (TRIAS, 2011; Barigye, 2012)). An overview of the project budget and distribution is given in Figure 51.

In the TRIAS-project there is no formal cooperation with the government of Uganda or other institutions (Barigye, 2012). Implementing agency : they have the role to support and train a local NGO that is involved in the local community development. GTZ and TRIAS take this role. Local NGO : is responsible for mobilising and creating awareness in the community and for providing training to local artisans. GTZ works with different NGOs depending on the district, TRIAS works together with 3 district farmer\u2019s Associations of which HODFA is the main partner. Local savings organisations and credit co-operations: provide loans to farmers. Artisans : after being trained, the artisans build stoves together with the recipient households. The families participate in the construction of their own stove, provide construction materials and some form of fee. Private sector companies are involved in the GTZ-project in urban areas for the production of stoves. 5.7.3.2 Targeted beneficiaries The targeted end-users are mainly the Ugandan population, especially the poor households . Apart from these households, the GTZ-programme also targets small and medium-sized enterprises and institutions. The TRIAS-project is focused on rural households: about 800 rural households in the Districts of Hoima, Masindi and Mbarara now own a stove, while 1800 households have been trained in the construction of Lorena stoves (TRIAS, 2011). There are no subsidies or financial advantages for people buying /constructing stoves. Mostly, the motivating factors are social in nature and they relate to (Barigye, 2012): \uf0b7 Reduction in workload: More especially for women and children, who otherwise would spend more time in collecting firewood, thus limiting them to socialize with others, attend classes (children), or do other activities. \uf0b7 Creation of a clean kitchen environment, free of smoke. As such, all household members can join women in the kitchen and this creates time for household members to discuss and share more of the family developmental issues. \uf0b7 Using the same amount of firewood, one can prepare 2-3 meals at a go. This leads to improved nutrition at household level and less time spent in food preparation. \uf0b7 Most women do prepare meals while at the same time caring about their young ones. Children normally accompany their mothers in kitchen. Using Lorena stoves ",
        "170 creates a safe environment for children and protects them from being exposed to accidents and burns. 5.7.3.3 Financial resources Project financing In both projects, funding is provided respectively by the Belgian and German national governments as a part of development cooperation. In the TRIAS project, no funding or subsidies are provided by the government of Uganda. Financing instruments related to the carbon market As fuel-efficient stoves reduce CO2-emissions, it is possible to obtain CER-credits (certified emission reduction) and sell them to the carbon market under the CDM mechanism to fund stove programmes at a larger scale. Private stove companies can use this revenue in many ways, for example to reduce the stove price (increasing affordability), make promotion or to develop new markets. An improved stove may typically save about 1 tonne CO2-equivalent per year, which for larger businesses could quickly become a considerable source of income (cleancookstoves.org). An important challenge to be overcome in small-scale projects such as the TRIAS/HODFA-project is to establish legal contracts with the local community to ensure that the legal ownership of the carbon credits belongs to the coordinating NGO. The carbon financing facilitates technology diffusion, as it favours large projects. It also stimulates continued use of the stoves as regular monitoring is necessary. (CO2-Logic, 2011). Because there are different financing systems for carbon emission reductions (mandatory CER-market under CDM, more flexible voluntary offsetting markets) that offer a different price for the credits, choosing the most appropriate instrument is not simple and often depends on factors that may vary over time (such as project size, location, type of technology, available budget, etc.). The different systems work with a different methodology, making it important to start on the right track from the beginning. The application process is complex, time-consuming, expensive and imposes a heavy workload, especially for small projects. The typical lead-time between project validation and credit issuance can add up to 1.8 years. Transaction costs are high (between \u20ac 80,000-200,000 depending on project size and complexity). However, the PoA-system (Programme of Activities) under the CDM tries to overcome some of these barriers by allowing a single framework. Once this framework would be accepted by the UN, it can add an unlimited number of small-scale projects without having to go through the full validation procedure again, reducing transaction costs considerably. In Uganda, already 5 PoAs are registered or at validation in the field of energy efficient stoves (CO2-Logic, 2011). One of them is the \u201cImproved Cook Stoves for East Africa\u201d (ICSEA) Programme of Activities, an initiative of the Uganda Carbon Bureau. These PoAs play an important role in facilitating the up-scaling of stove production and dissemination. However, care should be taken to design the PoA in such a way that the existing stove markets are not disrupted by price dumping as a result of the subsidies. This could lead to a subsequent exclusion of local artisans and existing producers from the market (Blunck, 2010). One drawback of the CDM is the focus on GHG-reduction: improvements related to other environmental, social and health benefits do not receive financing through this mechanism. 5.7.3.4 Training and capacity building GTZ describes its capacity building strategy as a \u201csnowball\u201d effect: Firstly, NGO workers are trained, these again train sub-county level representatives who then facilitate the training of stove artisans (\u201cTrain the trainers\u201d concept). Along with the training, awareness messages about efficient cooking practices are spread so that clean practices ",
        "171 can be adopted together with the technological knowledge. A remarkable training component of the GTZ project is the integration of energy into the primary school curriculum. Energy teaching materials were developed to raise awareness among children (GTZ, 2007). The TRIAS/HODFA project provides rural population capacity building in a similar way, on the following topics (CO 2 -Logic, 2011): \uf0b7 natural resources management \uf0b7 tree plantations \uf0b7 construction and dissemination of improved cook stoves: HODFA has trained local farmers to construct the Lorena stoves and to motivate and instruct other community members to do the same. Demonstration stoves are built for this purpose. Some farmers have made a small-scale business out of the activity. Some women groups formed spontaneously to help each other with the construction (TRIAS, 2011). \uf0b7 Sensitization on the environmental problems, and benefits of the stoves (TRIAS, 2011). \uf0b7 Use of rice husks as an alternative for firewood (Allertz, 2012) These trainings are organized in a central and convenient place, where materials for the Lorena stove are easily accessible. First, the trainings start with theory on Lorena stoves creating awareness and also focusing on their advantages over the traditional 3 fire stones. This also helps in attitude change. The second session is practical where stove builders (local artisans) are taken through all stages of Lorena stove construction At the end of the session, a Lorena stove is constructed by the trainee under the guidance of the trainer. This is followed by a series of mentoring (Barigye, 2012). Awareness building in the community is reached by (Barigye, 2012): \uf0b7 \u2018Looking-at\u2019: Demonstrating the benefits of the wood saving stoves locally and during formal trainings/ sensitization meetings \uf0b7 Exposure visits. Farmer-Farmer/Group-Group exchange visits on wood saving \uf0b7 Use of local artisans who have been trained to help communities set up wood- saving stoves. Some communities are willing to pay the local artisans for this. 5.7.4 Analysis: results, drivers and obstacles 5.7.4.1 Results Worldwide, about 166 million improved cook stoves are in use (figures of WHO and UNDP for 2009). The technology (in all of its forms) has reached about 28% of the households that are depending on biomass for cooking in developing countries (The World Bank, 2011). The large-scale GTZ-project has deployed more than 750,000 stoves in Uganda by June 2010, using more than 3,000 trained \u2018village professors\u2019 94 . Worldwide, GTZ supported the introduction of more than 2 million energy-efficient stoves in more than 16 countries in the last 5 years (Blunck, 2010). Keeping in mind that installing stoves is not the main focus of TRIAS/HODFA, thus far (2011) the project placed approximately 658 improved cook stoves in Hoima, 152 in Masindi (of which 58 for demonstration purposes and the rest by farmers themselves) 94 http://www.gtz.de/en/presse/23841.htm ",
        "172 and 25 in Mbarara. These three initiatives should be considered as pilot projects which allowed for testing and verification of the system. It is projected that in the next three years (2012-14) about 6000 additional stoves could be installed in the area. 2800 households are sensitised on environmental degradation, and 1,800 households received a practical training in stove construction (TRIAS, 2011). Estimating that the traditional 3-stone fire consumes about 3 tonnes of wood (3.22 tonnes of CO 2 ) per household per year and a 40-50% efficiency gain can be obtained by using an improved stove, an annual CO 2 -saving of 1.45 tonnes (1.35 tonnes of wood) per household can be reached (CO 2 -Logic, 2011). Table 11: Overview of the main benefits of a Lorena stove (TRIAS, 2011) B e n e f i t s f o r t h e U S E R Gender: Reduction of work load for collecting fire wood by women and children free time can be used for education, leisure or income-generating activities. As the kitchen is a nicer place, men, women and children can sit together, have meals together and share some of the household issues. Men can also participate in cooking (Barigye, 2012). Health: Better kitchen environment and decrease of eye and lung problems less indoor smoke pollution Safety less risk of accidents and burns, especially in children Improved nutrition As more than one dish can be cooked on the stove, a more balanced diet is possible. Drinking water can be boiled (Barigye, 2012) Education It has been reported that children from households with Lorena stoves increased their attendance to classes, because of reduced demand for firewood (Barigye, 2012). Energy saving (cost saving) 40 to 50% gain in efficiency, saving of 1,350 kg of fire-wood per household per year B e n e f i t s f o r S O C I E T Y Creation of business opportunities and local employment in rural area Some farmers have started to construct Lorena stoves in organized groups or as independent artisans, allowing them to gain small money (Barigye, 2012). The selling of stoves opens job opportunities particularly for women, as they are the main users and have greater credibility as sales people (cleancookstoves.org). Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 1,450 kg per household per year Reduction of deforestation Not quantified, linked with fire wood reduction. This also reduces soil erosion and improves watershed management. ",
        "173 5.7.4.2 Drivers for success The following factors were identified as crucial to the success of the diffusion of improved cook stoves. In addition to the drivers identified by the specific cases, factors mentioned in literature and other case studies on improved cook stove technology were included. Cultural drivers and meeting a need: \uf0b7 Appropriate technology : Experience from many parts of the world has shown that stove technologies have \u2018niche\u2019 regions and communities (Gitonga, 1995). Cook stove technologies must meet the social, resource, income and behavioural needs of the targeted users. In the TRIAS-project some adaptations were made (movable stoves, cooking technologies that can use other biomass sources than wood) (TRIAS, 2011), however in some communities the Lorena stove is not well accepted due to its limitations of not being able to roast fresh maize and meat (Barigye, 2012). In the GTZ-programme different designs were used in rural and urban areas. Financial and economic drivers: \uf0b7 Potential of carbon financing : see section 4.2.1. \uf0b7 Subsidies to reduce cost and increase affordability facilitate diffusion among the poor households. However, care must be taken not to disturb existing markets. Instead, subsidies and CER revenues may be more valuable in reducing barriers for stove dissemination and promotion, such as building manufacturing facilities and distribution infrastructure, providing technical and business trainings to manufacturers, marketing activities, etc. (GTZ, 2010; The World Bank, 2011). Technical drivers: \uf0b7 The Lorena stoves are made locally, from locally available and cheap materials (dry grass, anthill soil/clay, water, sweet potato vines, bricks, pseudo stems). This makes it less costly, allows for the inclusion of local expertise and encourages adoption. Construction costs are about 20 euro (TRIAS, 2010). \uf0b7 Standardisation : standard design of the stoves makes it easier to train artisans and users. \uf0b7 The performance of an improved cook stove must be substantially better relative to the baseline conditions to motivate users to keep using it and replace it when its broken. \uf0b7 Centralised or semi-centralised production in factories or workshops allows for rigorous testing and quality control to assure performance (The World Bank, 2011). \uf0b7 Recent new research findings on the health and environmental benefits of clean cook stoves have increased scientific interest in clean cook stoves and stimulated new developments in design, testing, and monitoring (cleancookstoves.org). Policy and institutional drivers: \uf0b7 National cook stove programmes can stimulate diffusion by the setting of goals and development of implementing agencies. However, if programmes are not well- managed they can also hinder adoption, as was the case with former national programmes in Uganda (The World Bank, 2011; CO 2- Logic, 2011). ",
        "174 \uf0b7 There is a policy in Uganda concerning energy saving technologies which also supports the introduction of wood saving stoves (Barigye, 2012). \uf0b7 Recently, several coalitions supporting cook stove technology have been formed, such as the Global Alliance for Clean Cook stoves (GACC), a public-private initiative led by the UN Foundation. Founded in September 2010 by a range of partners (including GTZ, SNV, several European and US governments, Shell and the United Nations Foundation), the GACC aims at knowledge sharing, coordination of global research, market creation and awareness building (cleancookstoves.org). The Alliance aims to enable 100 million households to adopt clean and efficient cook stoves by 2020 95 . Figure 53: Mission statement of GACC Source: cleancookstoves.org Promotion and awareness building: \uf0b7 Dedicated promotion campaigns : adapted to the target groups, implemented by locally based NGOs that are better placed to spread the technology faster (Barigye, 2012), e.g. by using highly visual construction manuals (Gitonga, 1995). \uf0b7 Self-promotion by word of mouth : when quality of the stoves is good, satisfied users will be the best promoters. Other people will hear from someone who is using a stove whether it functions well, before they construct one themselves (Barigye, 2012). \uf0b7 Aesthetics : the finishing should be appealing enough to attract the users (Gitonga, 1995; Barigye, 2012). 5.7.4.3 Barriers From several projects it was concluded that the major difficulty of implementing improved cook stoves, such as Lorena, is the cost, but also the need to inform and educate the local population on their use and advantages (CO 2 -Logic, 2011). 95 www.snvworld.org ",
        "175 Cultural barriers: \uf0b7 The Lorena stoves are not suitable to prepare all types of traditional food (e.g. roasting of meat, maize, sweet potatoes and other root crops is not possible) (Gitonga, 1995). This barrier is one of the limiting factors for quick adoption in the TRIAS project (Barigye, 2012). Some households kept on asking if the technology of Lorena cannot be improved for those who want to roast. Some people still have that bias that Lorena stove cannot solve all their problems. Others first wait to see how Lorena stoves work at their neighbors place. \uf0b7 Users have to be convinced of the benefits of improved stoves (financial savings, indoor environment) (ClimateCare & CEIHD, 2009). Negative experiences from the past can jeopardise the chances of a new technology to gain confidence (cleancookstoves.org), as farmers often wait to see the benefits from their neighbours before they adopt the technology themselves. When the Lorena would be poorly constructed and does not give good results, others will be less likely to adopt it (Barigye, 2012). \uf0b7 Inertia to change traditional practices : as households are used to living in a smoky environment, creation of awareness requires significant efforts. Sensitisation, marketing, demonstration and word-of-mouthy promotion are necessary to overcome the challenges (ClimateCare & CEIHD, 2009). On the contrary, if people are aware of alternatives, they will go for it, but promotion is crucial (Allertz, 2012). \uf0b7 Lack of women empowerment in traditional households makes that the benefits of improved stoves are often not seen as a priority (CO 2 -Logic, 2011). Additionally, in patriarchal households, it may not be preferred that women do economic activities other than housekeeping and that socialising with others is not encouraged. In these cases, improved stoves that free women from their traditional activities may not be a priority (Allertz, 2012) Financial and economic barriers: \uf0b7 Affordability : Some of the more efficient energy saving stoves are priced higher than what most small scale farmers can afford, and even the materials for making local wood saving stoves especially good clay is non-existing in some areas. That calls for use of money to access the materials. This limits adoption (Barigye, 2012). \uf0b7 High investment costs for business creation and market development: Before a new stove can be introduced, high initial costs with a high risk have to be made by the manufacturer (ClimateCare & CEIHD, 2009): o Building of a factory or workshop o Training management skills o Training of artisans o Marketing o Awareness creation o Quality control system o Working capital \uf0b7 Poor financial return associated with selling improved stoves, as the acceptable market price can barely cover material and production costs, while marketing activities, training materials or other fixed costs are not covered. The uncertainty of ",
        "176 user acceptance, together with negative experiences with failures of previous stove programmes, increases the financial risks for investors 96 . \uf0b7 Potential manufacturers experience difficulties to get access to credit from standard financial institutions as the perceived risk is too high (ClimateCare & CEIHD, 2009). \uf0b7 Lack of capacity in business and personnel management, accounting, marketing and other skills required to set up a successful company (ClimateCare & CEIHD, 2009). \uf0b7 Many projects suffer from short-time financing , with little attention for market development and consumer-research for long-term business-development (The World Bank, 2011). \uf0b7 Short-term subsidies and giveaways hinder the development of a sustainable market for cleaner stoves (cleancookstoves.org). \uf0b7 Complexity of carbon-financing (see chapter 2) \uf0b7 Access to customer credit : Most financial institutions are reluctant to give credit to poor, small farmers because of lack of guarantees and high risks (Allertz, 2012). Technical barriers: \uf0b7 The health risks of harmful cooking smoke have historically received limited funding and research attention when compared to other risk factors (e.g., lack of clean water, sanitation, and hygiene) or diseases (e.g., malaria) that lead to similar levels of disease (cleancookstoves.org). \uf0b7 Mud stoves are simple, but time-consuming to make and they require constant repair and maintenance to prevent deterioration, especially when the workmanship was poor. They often need shelter from the rain, they are bulky, not easy to transport and they break easily. This can discourage the users. Some households, especially the aged and children headed households, cannot afford to construct Lorena stoves because it requires energy to make some of the materials like bricks (Barigye, 2012). \uf0b7 Mud stoves take time to heat up as the insulating walls absorb most of the heat during the initial stages. However, many people mistakenly believe that the cooking time will be reduced. \uf0b7 If the stoves are not well constructed (e.g . dysfunctional chimney), the stoves develop cracks and become less efficient. (Barigye, 2012). \uf0b7 Unavailability of skilled artisans : this means that significant time and effort has to be spent in training and maintaining the necessary skills (ClimateCare & CEIHD, 2009). \uf0b7 Many past biomass cook stove programs all over the world have failed, due to a suboptimal design (insufficient adaptation between laboratory and field implementation), leading to a fast deterioration (The World Bank, 2011). \uf0b7 A lack of standards and quality control (The World Bank, 2011). Institutional barriers: \uf0b7 Limited monitoring and evaluation of stoves programmes (cleancookstoves.org). 96 http://cdm.unfccc.int/filestorage/W/A/Z/WAZ804IV3C2LNHDFQ75YMTUK6RJBO9/PoA- DD_ICSEA.pdf?t=RE18bTU2eGcxfDCk7KFl0pL_2yMW5HtroUXe ",
        "177 \uf0b7 Lack of integration between policy makers in different domains: Household energy issues play across multiple sectors (energy, forestry, health, gender, climate change), while policy makers are reluctant to take responsibility for issues that do not belong entirely to their domain (The World Bank, 2011). \uf0b7 Lack of capacity within institutions to set up, coordinate and manage a successful programme (ClimateCare & CEIHD, 2009). Social barriers: \uf0b7 Illiteracy makes it difficult to carry out awareness campaigns and dissemination activities about technology benefits and health problems (CO2-Logic, 2011). \uf0b7 Poverty : In order to reach the poorest segment of the population, stoves should be very cheap, reducing their relative benefits compared with the baseline technologies. More refined cook stoves that perform much better do exist, but are often more expensive, making them inaccessible for the poorest households (The World Bank, 2011). 5.7.5 Lessons learned Some important lessons can be learnt from this case study regarding development and diffusion of technologies in developing countries. The discussion is based on the 7 functions of innovation systems by Hekkert, 2009: 1. Development of the private sector: \uf0b7 The development of a global clean cook stove industry that is constantly innovating to improve design and performance, while lowering the cost of stoves, is seen as the most sustainable way to tackle environmental and health problems in developing countries (clean cookstoves.org; The World bank, 2011). \uf0b7 When more advanced stove types can be produced on a large scale , the costs can be reduced and business opportunities exist for the private-sector (The World Bank, 2011). 2. Technology and knowledge development: \uf0b7 Continuous R&D efforts are necessary to test stove performance in the field, set up standards, increase understanding of relationships between stove design, exposure and health effects (The World Bank, 2011). \uf0b7 Ensure quality and reliability by developing an effective quality control mechanism and follow-up. \uf0b7 Designs should aim at meeting international standards for performance and safety (cleancookstoves.org). \uf0b7 It is important to find out the existing technologies, materials, skills and building capacities within the targeted community before embarking on a specific stove design. A participatory approach assures optimal benefits from indigenous knowledge , assures that needs are fulfilled and enhances acceptance by the community. \uf0b7 The performance of an innovative technology must be substantially than the baseline conditions in order to assure continued usage. Once a design is standardised, it should be able meet international standards for performance and safety (cleancookstoves.org). ",
        "178 \uf0b7 When developing technology, cultural issues need to be considered , in order to meet the needs of the communities to stimulate adoption. E.g. communities who prefer consuming roasted foods like meat, sweet potato, cassava etc. will not be motivated to use a Lorena stove, which is not suitable for these activities (Allertz, 2012). Another design should be considered for them. Ideally, people are given a range of options to choose from. 3. Network development: \uf0b7 Set up and build the capacity of national coordinating institutions to coordinate cook stove programmes, working together with the private sector, NGOs and research institutions for the implementation. \uf0b7 Develop strategic partnerships between different sectors and policy departments (health, agriculture, poverty alleviation, education, etc) in order to develop an integrated approach. 4. Long-term guidance: \uf0b7 Policies to encourage efforts in the field of improved stoves can include: setting national goals and stove standards, establishing testing facilities, giving tax reductions and reduce tariffs, supporting applied R&D (cleancookstoves.org). 5. Market formation: \uf0b7 Identify the financial incentives needed to create demand and to make the technology affordable by the targeted end-users. \uf0b7 Consumer research to identify needs and preferences. \uf0b7 Avoid direct subsidies and the giveaway of free stoves (cleancookstoves.org). 6. Resource mobilisation: The most successful cook stove programmes did not provide direct subsidies to the stoves, but rather directed funding towards research and development, infrastructure investments, monitoring, capacity building and promotion. However, an investment requirement can be a barrier to affordability, financial support to end-users can be necessary in certain contexts (The World Bank, 2011; Blunck, 2010). A very elaborate analysis of the pros and cons of direct and indirect subsidies, and the concept of \u2018smart subsidies\u2019 can be found in Gaul (2009). 7. Creation of legitimacy: \uf0b7 Enough funding should go to awareness raising and promotion campaigns (The World bank, 2011). \uf0b7 In the promotion and acceptance of stove technologies, issues such as how accessible, how affordable and how easy the stove is to use are important. Continued promotion of an inappropriate technology only leads to stagnation of acceptance. A possible solution to this is to give people a variety of stove technologies to choose from. When the technology is developed together with the community and locally developed stove technologies are recognized, ownership is created, which enhances dissemination (Gitonga, 1995). \uf0b7 Building a stove does not mean that it will be used. When users feel that the stove does not meet all their needs , that improvements are only marginal compared ",
        "179 to their current cooking system, or when functioning is suboptimal due to design or building errors, they often abandon the technology as a whole (Gitonga, 1995). The World Bank (2011) points out the following challenges for the up-scaling of improved cook stove technology: \uf0b7 National institutions promoting improved stoves \uf0b7 Intelligent financing mechanisms that support investment costs \uf0b7 Development of performance standards on safety, efficiency, emissions and durability \uf0b7 Technical research and development, including adaptation to national context \uf0b7 Development of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms \uf0b7 Development of durable, convenient stoves, combined with the freedom to choose according to individual needs and preferences \uf0b7 Consumer research on consumer preferences and behaviour \uf0b7 Clear designation of the respective roles of governments, NGOs, microfinance institutions and the private sector in cook stove promotion programmes. 5.7.6 Implications for future policy making EU-Policy could facilitate diffusion of cook stove technology by: \uf0b7 supporting country governments to create an enabling policy environment \uf0b7 supporting cooperation between government agencies across different sectors \uf0b7 evaluate in every context how financing or subsidies are used in the most sustainable way: indirect subsidies towards technology development, market creation, capacity building activities, quality assurance and infrastructure, or direct subsidies towards end-users (see also Gaul, 2009). \uf0b7 avoiding charity, avoiding price dumping and disturbance of existing markets \uf0b7 including local expertise in technology development \uf0b7 imposing rigorous consumer research, field testing and monitoring before embarking on large scale dissemination campaigns. \uf0b7 favouring locally produced products, made of locally available materials \uf0b7 keeping high quality standards and supporting monitoring and evaluation activities As rural areas become depleted of forests more efforts should be spend to (Barigye, 2012): \uf0b7 develop and promote alternative but realistic energy sources for rural households (e.g. solar or subsidized access to gas in rural areas) \uf0b7 to promote sustainable use of firewood through agro-forestry \uf0b7 to stimulate tree planting for firewood: government and private sector 5.7.7 References of the case Improved cook stoves for rural Uganda Allertz (2012): Communication from Mr. Paul Allertz, Regional coordinator of TRIAS in Uganda.

        "181 5.8 Integration of environmental technologies for improving agricultural production on family farms in the province of Muramvya, Burundi 5.8.1 Summary This case study concerns a project on agricultural practices and agro-forestry in Burundi. It aims at the integration of environmental technologies in agricultural practices on family farms, while also improving production and food security. The project was conducted from December 2008 to November 2011, under the guidance of the A.C.V.E. (Action Ceinture Verte pour l\u2019Environnement), a not for profit Burundian association for the protection of the environment. The project combines several land conservation practices, while improving crop productivity and strengthening the farmers\u2019 community. An important lesson from this case is that \u2018old\u2019 and well-proven technology experiences similar drivers and barriers during its transfer and diffusion process as \u2018new\u2019 and innovative technologies. 5.8.2 Context, selection, goals and ambitions 5.8.2.1 Country context Burundi is a landlocked country in the middle of Central Africa with an area of 27,834 km\u00b2. Population is estimated to exceed 8 million inhabitants, with an average density of 310 inhabitants per km\u00b2 and a demographic growth of 3%. Over 90% of the population lives in rural areas. Burundi is one of the 5 poorest countries in the world, with 70% of the population living with less than one US dollar a day, and 85% facing food insecurity. 10% suffer from severe malnutrition. The recent history of Burundi has been marked by recurrent crisis and violence that has worsened the economic and social situation. After a civil war of more than 10 years (1993-2005), a democratic government has been elected and the country is being rebuilt. National research institutions, such as the National Agricultural Institute (ISABU), have recently resumed their activities (MAE, 2011; ISABU, 2012). The Burundian economy is based on food agriculture with very low productivity, worsened by the former political and humanitarian crisis. Moreover, climate perturbations are more frequent in recent years causing agricultural production to drop further (MATTE, 2007). In rural areas the only energy source is wood. Over 92% of the population is active in agriculture, predominantly small scale and with very limited resources. The high population pressure causes farm land fragmentation, overexploitation of forest resources, soil degradation, increased erosion and the exploitation of marginal land and natural spaces. Moreover, traditional agricultural practices consist mainly of manual labour, making very inefficient use of water, energy, nutrients and other resources. Farmers have very limited access to quality sowing seed, plant protection and veterinary medicine, making them vulnerable to diseases and crop damage by rodents and insects. Farmer communities are poorly organised and education levels are low (MAE, 2011). The project region of Muramvya is located in the Western highlands, between 1,000 and more than 2,600 m of altitude, about an hour\u2019s drive from Bujumbura capital. ",
        "182 Figure 54: Location of Muramvya province 5.8.2.2 History of the project The project in the province of Muramvya aims at the integration of environmental technologies in agricultural practices on family farms, while also improving production and food security. The project was conducted from December 2008 to November 2011, under the guidance of the A.C.V.E. (Action Ceinture Verte pour l\u2019Environnement), a not for profit Burundian association for the protection of the environment. A total funding of 498,440 Euros was provided by the European Union (contract DCI-FOOD/2008/170-503). 5.8.2.3 Technologies introduced by the project Before the start of the activities, a needs assessment and population consultation was performed by ACVE to identify the priority actions for the project. Traditional agricultural practice in the project area is characterised by a disordered way of sowing and planting. Seed quality is low, while seed conservation often poses problems. There is only a limited access to phytosanitary products, making crops vulnerable to pests and diseases. As the fields are mostly located on hill slopes without anti-erosion measures, there is a severe erosion problem. This problem is worsened by increasing deforestation. Soils are poor in nutrients and in high need of organic matter. The project combines several land conservation practices: 1. Erosion control: a. Reforestation of slopes with forestry and agro-forestry species, that also yield useful products, fruit, fuel wood and charcoal b. Construction of anti-erosion ditches, lined with fixative vegetation 2. Improvement of soil quality: a. Introduction of composting, in order to improve soil structure and increase organic matter content While improving crop productivity : 1. Seed distribution: a. Seed quality control b. Construction of seed store houses 2. Adapted cultivation techniques for selected crops 3. Providing access to appropriate pest control ",
        "183 and strengthening the farmers\u2019 community: 1. Participatory decision making processes 2. Organisation of farmers into local committees, with attention to gender balance 3. Formation of farmers on cultivation techniques, forest management and environmental protection All together 400 rural households in the region of Muramvya participated in the project. The beneficiary households received on a regular basis a number of plants (agro-forestry tree species, banana plants, potatoes, slope fixating herbs), crop seeds (beans, wheat, maize, sweet potato, cassava), tools and other resources according to their available farmland and preferences. In addition they received education and training on erosion control, composting and cultivation practices. The selected households were visited regularly to discuss problems, further implementation and planning and to check the germination, the general condition of their fields and compliance to the guidelines. Figure 55: Tree planting in Mpehe, Muramvya Source: WATCU (2010) 5.8.2.4 Relevance of this case study for the project Although the environmental technologies that are implemented in this case study are not \u201chigh-tech\u201d, they are very relevant for the protection of the environment in vulnerable rural areas in developing countries. Basic agricultural conservation practices have an important impact on soil fertility, land conservation and agricultural production. The practices themselves are relatively simple and widely known by agronomists all over the world. However, the implementation and diffusion amongst small farmers is often a challenge. A lack of environmental and agricultural education, together with limited access to tools, quality seeds, fertiliser and pest control are important barriers for a widespread adoption of improved agricultural practices (MAE, 2011). The case study under consideration aims at the implementation of a set of simple, but effective soil conservation and cultivation practices on a community level. As the project evolved, also non-beneficiary households of the targeted communities got more involved with some of the project activities. As the project duration was only 3 years, technology diffusion outside the project area has been limited. However, there is some evidence that neighbouring communities have started to replicate some of the practices implemented in the project area (ACVE, 2011: Nditabiriye, 2012). ",
        "184 Figure 56: Position of the environmental technologies for improving agriculture case study on the technology transfer and transition curve 5.8.3 Design The project was conducted by the ACVE, a Burundian NGO, with funding from the European Union. For the execution of the field work, ACVE partnered with France Volontaires, a French organisation that recruits volunteers for international exchange programs in developing countries 97 . The project received local practical support from the DPAE (the Regional Agency for Agriculture and Cattle Breeding) and its agricultural supervisors in the targeted communities. The Burundian Government supported the project by providing state-owned land in the project area for reforestation. The private sector was not actively involved in the project, apart from the fact that the necessary resources (tools, seeds, construction material and services,\u2026) were bought from local suppliers after an official tendering procedure. 5.8.3.1 Main stakeholders The Association Action Ceinture Verte pour l\u2019Environnement (ACVE) is the beneficiary of the EU funding and lead executor of the project.

The Direction Provinciale de l\u2019Agriculture et de l\u2019Elevage (DPAE) is the Regional Agency for Agriculture and Cattle Breeding. The agency provided technical support to the project in the fields of agricultural training and education, agronomy, vegetal production and rural engineering. The agricultural assistants and supervisors responsible of areas targeted by the project were involved actively in the setup, prioritisation, planning and implementation of the activities. The inclusion of the DPAE as an important stakeholder in the project also intends to increase the sustainability of the activities once the project has ended. Community committees of the 4 hills: in order to improve communication between ACVE and the local community and beneficiaries, hill committees were set up. These consisted of members from the existing Comit\u00e9s Collinaires de D\u00e9veloppement Communautaire (CCDC), together with additional elected persons from the population (total of 11 to 17 persons each). Government of Burundi : The government of Burundi provided 15 ha of state-owned lands for reforestation with agro-forestry tree species (a total of 73 ha were reforested during the project of which 15 ha were state-owned and 58 ha private). In addition, parcels for the construction of the seed store houses were also provided by the local authorities (la Direction de l\u2019Am\u00e9nagement du Territoire, le Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Eau, de l\u2019Environnement, de l\u2019Am\u00e9nagement du Territoire et de l\u2019Urbanisme, le Cadastre National). 5.8.3.2 Targeted beneficiaries Households : 400 rural households were selected in the hills of Muhweza, Mpehe, Murambi and Gatwaro, in the region of Muramvya. The project areas and criteria to select the beneficiary households were determined by ACVE and DPAE. The final choice of beneficiaries was made during a general assembly of the population of each hill. At the start of the project a needs assessment was done by a local consultant, identifying the initial situation, problems, expectations and exact needs of the beneficiary households. The households received training, together with regular provisions of seeds, tools and phytosanitary products and they were visited on a regular basis by the project officials to monitor their progress. Local labourers . About 200 temporary jobs were created by the project in construction of anti-erosion ditches (WASCU, 2010). The Government of Burundi has received technical support to develop adequate national policies and regulations regarding management of state-owned forestry resources (Nditabiriye, 2012). Additionally, the project contributes to food security and agricultural development efforts carried out by the Government of Burundi. 5.8.3.3 Financial resources Project financing The project was funded by the European Union (498,440 Euros), directly issued to ACVE as executive agency. Financing instruments within the project Within the project, limited financing instruments were developed. The seed storehouses aim at financial independency by asking a minor contribution from farmers that wish to ",
        "186 store their seeds in the store houses, in order to pay the wages of the storehouse managers. Given the large need for fertiliser and plant protection products, it was decided to install a storage and selling point of fertiliser and phytosanitary products in the storage houses. This activity will serve as an additional source of income for the communities, as local farmers can buy their products there. Revenues will be managed by the local storehouse management committee. As the self-financing activities only started at the end of the project, the long-term effect could not yet be measured. ACVE is planning to construct a market stall along the road to sell part of the agricultural production, generating some funds for the continuation of the activities after the project has finished, and assuring the follow-up of the project. The revenues of the market stall will be divided in accordance to the amount of produce provided by each of the contributing farmers (Nditabiriye, 2012). 5.8.3.4 Training and capacity building Information transfer : At the start of the project a general assembly was organised to which all inhabitants of the hill areas were invited: the beneficiary households as well as the other inhabitants. This reunion aimed at informing the population on the project aims, the set-up and the criteria on which basis the beneficiary households were selected. It also allowed for a knowledge transfer between farmers and researchers on the current agricultural production, the environmental problems and the local priorities and preferences. Technical trainings : Each project activity was preceded by a technical training of the beneficiary households. The trainings were given by the agricultural expert of ACVE, experts from ISABU or employees from DPAE. Initially, training sessions were poorly attended by the households (ACVE, 2009). This could be explained by training sessions given in the framework of another project in the same period, lack of enthusiasm and the lack of transport fees and accommodation for the participants (Nditabiriye, 2012). However, ACVE reported risen attendance levels after reminding the beneficiary households that attendance of trainings was a condition to benefit from the project. The trainings included the following relevant topics: \uf0b7 Composting : The soil evaluation by ISABU identified a large need for fertiliser and organic matter. This result confirmed the importance of the introduction of composting practices to increase organic matter levels in the soil. \uf0b7 Agro-forestry : education of the households on the benefits, installation, maintenance and exploitation of agro-forestry species. Both continuous and specific trainings were provided. \uf0b7 Installation of anti-erosion ditches : a technical training on use of tools and calculations, targeted at the agricultural supervisors and assistants of the DPAE who were going to lead the labour teams of each hill area. \uf0b7 Continuous environmental education : combined with other activities and group meetings. \uf0b7 Improved agricultural practices : installation and management of a banana plantation and a potato plantation. \uf0b7 Organisation and management training : aimed at a sustainable management of the seed store houses, how to reach a maximum of beneficiaries and how to make the seed conservation activity financially self-reliant. \uf0b7 Food and nutrition \uf0b7 Storage and use of fertiliser and phytosanitary products ",
        "187 Organisational capacity building : \uf0b7 The formation of farmers\u2019 associations in each of the beneficiary hill areas has strengthened the capacity of the communities to take decisions and to react more quickly to activities. Cooperation between farmers (working together, division of parcels, creation of commercial activities) improved significantly. 5.8.4 Analysis: results, drivers and obstacles 5.8.4.1 Results Generally, the beneficiary households have realised the project activities in a satisfactory way, even though some were somewhat delayed in the execution of certain tasks. The project reports indicated the following results (ACVE, 2009, 2010, 2011): ",
        "188 Table 12: Overview of the main results of the project D IRECT RESULTS OF THE PROJECT (reported in ACVE, 2009, 2010, 2011) To provide a high quality organic fertiliser Composting technology 400 households were educated in composting technology to replace the traditional burning of organic waste. Most families have adopted this practice with success. Higher crop yields were measured, which can be attributed partly to the composting practices and partly from mixing the compost with chicken manure (Nditabiriye, 2012). Erosion management Anti-erosion ditches A total distance of 313 km of anti-erosion ditches, lined with fixative plants, was constructed along the slopes. The great majority of these ditches is well maintained. Creation of employment in rural area The project created 200 temporary jobs for local labourers in the construction of anti-erosion ditches. Reforestation to protect water sources and reduce erosion * approx. 147.000 forest trees were planted in a dedicated forest area of 73 hectares (15 ha state-owned land, 58 ha private land, mainly on mountain ridges and along watercourses). * In addition, about 133.000 agro-forestry plants were planted on beneficiary fields. * The communities reported a decrease in flooding of rivers and march areas. Improved agricultural practices * a total of 136 ha of fields were planted/sowed with potato, beans, maize, wheat, sweet potato and cassava. Seeds were distributed among the households by the project. * 16.000 banana plants were installed. * A new cultivation method for potatoes was introduced, which caused yields to rise significantly (6 to 7-fault higher yield!). * Production yields of beans, sweet potato, wheat and maize increased with respectively 123 %, 146%, 61% and 99% in comparison with the average yields before the project. In the case of beans, this rise can be attributed to the seed quality selection performing during the purchase of the seeds. * Production of cassava failed, and was abandoned. Availability of high quality seeds by local seed management Seed storage houses were constructed * 1 for each hill (4 in total), each managed by a local committee * improved seed conservation and storage, against a small fee * assures availability of quality seeds by making the farmers self- sufficient in seed production. * additional tasks: storage of seeds and sales of fertiliser and phytosanitary products to the community ",
        "189 Organisation of farmers in associations * The formation of representative farmers\u2019 associations in each of the beneficiary hill areas has increased the community\u2019s cohesion and strengthened their capacity to take decisions and to react more quickly to activities. Cooperation between farmers (working together, division of parcels, creation of commercial activities, reparations) improved significantly. Improved nutrition * Results in this area were only reached to a limited extent. Additional education on nutrition is necessary in order to have real effect on food patterns in the long run. * However, the better crop yields increased food security and households testified that their food situation has improved. Fewer families are in need of food aid. Market stall in the \u201cJardin public\u201d of Bujumbura * Opportunity to sell part of the production which generates income. Improvement of gender equality * Care was taken that a significant part of the beneficiary households were led by women (ca. 25%, which is already a significant improvement in the patriarchal culture of the area) * Community committees were chosen with attention to gender representation * Employment by the project (e.g. construction of anti-erosion ditches, management functions) was always open to both men and women. E VIDENCE OF TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION Composting technology * An estimated 325 additional households in the direct vicinity of the project areas have replicated the composting practices from their neighbours, which is an indication of a first spontaneous diffusion of the technology. However, they are not always using the correct methodology. * On the parcels of the seed storage houses, the households have spontaneously constructed composting pits, indicating that they understand well the benefits of this practice and are including it in their agricultural practice. Improved agricultural practices The alternative potato cultivation method was taken over by an estimated 225 non-beneficiary households in neighbouring hill areas, after the successful results became known in the community. Organisation of farmers in associations The way to create and structure farmers associations was taken over by communities outside the beneficiary area. OTHER RESULTS ",
        "190 ACVE capacity building This project on agro-forestry has been the largest project ever managed by the ACVE since its start in 2005. It has proven to be a valuable reference in further applications for project funding. It has reinforced their partner network, improved capacities of their personnel (management skills, financial skills), facilitated access to local experts and led to frequent exchange of knowledge and experience with other NGOs (ACVE, 2011). New national regulation under construction ACVE has recently been involved by the Burundi government to assist in the revision of the National Forestry Code. One of the elements that will be included in the new Code is the management of community-owned forest areas. This assignment is a valuable opportunity to anchor some of the project learning in national guidelines and regulations (Nditabiriye, 2012). 5.8.4.2 Drivers for success The following factors were identified as crucial to the success of the ACVE project: Cultural drivers and meeting a need: \uf0b7 Meeting an actual need : the preliminary need assessment, together with the participatory approach, assures that the planned activities meet the needs (e.g. for phyto-sanitary products and erosion control) and preferences (for certain crops and species) of the population. Financial and economic drivers: \uf0b7 Seeds, tools and resources were provided for free to the beneficiary households. As a poor responsiveness to the project guidelines could result in exclusion from the project and its benefits, people were motivated to follow the guidelines and attend trainings. \uf0b7 Labour fees for the team supervisors who coordinated the construction of anti- erosion ditches, were calculated according to the result, e.g. a day\u2019s work was set to be equivalent to 20 m of ditch dug. This resulted in a significantly higher amount of anti-erosion ditches installed relative to the project target. \uf0b7 A market stall of ACVE in the \u2018jardin public\u2019 gave the communities the opportunity to sell part of their produce and generate additional income. This activity also gave ACVE the opportunity to keep contact with the hill communities and support them after the project has ended. Technical drivers: \uf0b7 Involvement of local technical experts : soil and seed analysis, as well as the technical trainers, were provided by the National Agricultural Institute ISABU and the DPAE. This assured the quality of the trainings and information. Policy and institutional drivers: \uf0b7 Close partnership with local government \uf0b7 Farmers organisation : the organisation of the farmers in an association increases the community\u2019s cohesion and strengthens their capacity to take decisions and work together for the benefit of their community. ",
        "191 \uf0b7 Numerous NGOs and development organisations are active in the region (e.g. US Aid, Caritas, BTC,\u2026). This gives good opportunities for collaboration, further technology diffusion and follow-up after the official project ending (e.g. PRODEMA project on cattle breeding). However, available funding is usually limited. \uf0b7 The availability of an official agricultural expert per area to support the farmers technically. Promotion and awareness building: \uf0b7 Occasional promotion actions : During \u201cNational tree day\u201d the project was presented in a television and radio interview (ACVE, 2009). In February 2011 ACVE organised a press conference on the results and lessons learnt from the project. About 100 persons were present, representing funding agencies, local NGOs, local administration, local private sector representatives and journalists (ACVE, 2011). \uf0b7 Continuous motivation of the households : by closely monitoring the progress of the households, addressing their problems and taking into account their preferences, the overall acceptance of the project was high and recommendations were well followed. \uf0b7 Creation of project ownership : the participatory decision process leads to an increased project ownership amongst the beneficiaries, resulting in a high motivation to take care of the agro-forestry tree nurseries and to follow the cultivation guidelines. 5.8.4.3 Barriers A major concern, also expressed by the hill communities themselves, is the continuation of the activities after the project has ended. What will happen when the ACVE is no longer in charge of the management of the local committees in charge of the seed storage management? What will happen when the external funding stops? At the moment (June 2012), the hills are continuing the project activities, even though the execution rhythm has not stayed the same among the 4 regions. Especially the hills Gatwaro and Mpehe have continued to make progress and have started some income- generating activities for the community on the storage house parcels (potatoes and vegetables). The revenues are saved on the association\u2019s bank account. An association committee decides on the expenditures of this money. Additionally, the 4 associations have been enlisted as beneficiaries from a future project, called PRODEMA, aimed at the breeding of animals (Ntibarehe, 2012). The following barriers posed difficulties towards the project: Business culture barriers: \uf0b7 Unreliable suppliers: During the project numerous problems were encountered with suppliers that did not meet expectations or did not meet their obligations (e.g. consultant charged with the ordnance survey of the area did not react to numerous comments and broke the contract; seed suppliers delivered seeds of poor quality or infected material; the construction company that made the cheapest offer for the construction of the storage houses turned out not to dispose of a proper workshop, tools, materials or labourers) (ACVE, 2011). \uf0b7 Lack of knowledge of modern agricultural practices within the farmers communities (structured planting, irrigation, use of fertiliser and pesticides,\u2026). As ",
        "192 farming is a highly traditional practice, farmers are reluctant to alter their habits (ACVE, 2009; Lazare, 2012). \uf0b7 General custom of paying official institutions for their support: In developed countries, governmental agencies and officials are expected to provide service support to projects of general interest to society as a part of their job. However, in Burundi, as in many other developing countries, the public agency culture is different. Generally, government officials expect to receive remuneration for their collaboration to projects outside their daily job content (generally in the form of transport compensation). This habit is generally established throughout Burundi (and many other developing countries). Western funding agencies often do not accept this type of expenses in projects. This cultural difference impedes a good collaboration with local agencies, as it makes the project dependent on the goodwill of individual officials to put efforts into a project, without getting a strong engagement. As a consequence, many officials refuse to collaborate, or at least give priority to other requests that do provide a financial incentive. The ACVE did encounter some difficulties in motivating DPAE personnel to collaborate with the project, due to the lack of remuneration. Nonetheless, they succeeded in receiving support by continuously stressing the importance of the project. However, the issue will remain a weak point in the long run (ACVE, 2011). Financial and economic barriers: \uf0b7 Poverty : farmers have little money to spend on fertiliser and pesticides. \uf0b7 Access to credit is difficult for farmers and associations as little guaranties can be given. Banks are reluctant to allow loans for farmers\u2019 cooperatives due to negative experiences in the past. It is necessary to have an account and be able to deposit money on a regular basis. \uf0b7 Price variability of seeds and crop produce. \uf0b7 Lack of insurance or warranty fund for farmers in case of calamities or crop failure . \uf0b7 Dependency on funding: as the project has little means for self-financing \uf0b7 Lack of capacity in contract negotiations: in order to prevent difficulties and discussions with unreliable suppliers that do not meet expectations, sound and clear contracts are very important. However, most small organisations, such as also the ACVE, have little experience in contract negotiations. Problems have been arranged in a friendly manner; however, law enforcement facilities are accessible in case of severe disagreements (Ntibarehe, 2012). \uf0b7 Need for advanced payments: local NGO\u2019s (such as ACVE) often do not dispose of sufficient own funds to finance their activities before the EU project grants are paid. This obliges them to take a bank loan and pay interest rates until the grant is paid, which implies a loss of resources and often delays the implementation of activities. Technical barriers: \uf0b7 Lack of quality and traceability of seeds : plant production is sometimes low due to low quality seeds or infected seeds. Even official agencies, such as the Department of Forests, do not have a certification for the seeds they deliver. The quality of their seeds is not verified, and seed production is highly variable. Moreover, there is no traceability of seed origin or controlled conservation conditions between harvest and sales (ACVE, 2010). ",
        "193 \uf0b7 Lack of seed testing facilities : For certain seed types (sweet potato, wheat) there is no laboratory available in Burundi to perform quality analyses (ACVE, 2010). \uf0b7 Insufficient supply of subsidised fertiliser and pesticides by the Burundian government. As phyto-sanitary products and fertilisers are imported, they are extremely expensive to the population. The Burundian government has set up schemes to make these products more affordable, although still expensive (Nditabiriye, 2012). \uf0b7 Vulnerability of seeds and crops to deterioration by insects, rodents and diseases . \uf0b7 Lack of animal manure to increase soil fertility: in order to address this barrier, 13 out of 16 farmers groups from the 4 associations have applied for funding of the current PRODEMA project, which is aimed at the acquisition of cattle (ACVE, 2011). A useful side effect of the acquisition of cattle would be the additional animal manure that can be provided to the soil. \uf0b7 Lack of post-harvest technology hampers the commercialisation of agricultural products. Cold chains are not established within the value chain, food processing industry is virtually non-existing, of poor quality and unprofessional, leading to food waste and limiting the market for agricultural products (Lazare, 2012; ISABU, 2012). Institutional barriers: \uf0b7 Lack of capacity within the local structures to support the farmers\u2019 communities on technical and management issues. This is a problem in view of the continuation of the good practices after the project and support of ACVE has ended. \uf0b7 In general a poor institutional capacity within Burundi to organise and manage environmental activities (MATTE, 2007) Social barriers: \uf0b7 Lack of absorption capacity by the households: some plantation targets were not reached, due to a lack of labour capacity and insufficient field area in the households. At this point, remaining seeds and plants were distributed amongst about 100 non- beneficiary households with sufficient capacity. \uf0b7 Lack of skilled and educated people: due to the humanitarian crisis in Burundi, many educated people, such as scientific personnel in national institutions, have fled the country and not all of them have returned. This has led to severe gaps in the country\u2019s knowledge base (Hayitesi, 2012). \uf0b7 Lack of discipline to comply with the recommendations and practices taught during the training sessions (e.g. insufficient maintenance). 5.8.5 Lessons learned Some important lessons can be learnt regarding development and diffusion of technologies in developing countries. The discussion is based on the 7 functions of innovation systems by Hekkert, 2009: 1. Development of the private sector: Apart from supplying certain products or services, the private sector was not actively included as one of the key stakeholders in the project So no lessons could be learnt on ",
        "194 private sector development related to technology diffusion. However, some of the barriers that were identified are also important in view of a future development of the private sector: \uf0b7 From the case study it was seen that one of the major barriers to improve agricultural practices is limited and unreliable access to quality resources, such as seeds, fertiliser and pest control. In the future, the private sector could play an important role to overcome these barriers and provide affordable, reliable, sufficient and locally available agricultural resources to the farming communities. A first step was taken in the project by organising the seed store houses as local distribution points for phyto-sanitary products. \uf0b7 Care must be taken that private sector development is not impeded by governmental programs and other aid-initiatives that offer free or highly subsidised resources to the population. \uf0b7 Capacity building of the private sector is important to improve the technical, financial, marketing and contract negotiation skills of local companies, as well as farmers associations and storage house committees. A possible lesson might be that in an early stage of technology transfer, involvement of the private sector is not a prerequisite for a successful niche experiment, focused on technology validation. However, for the continuation of the initiative with own means, an adequate private sector involvement might be necessary. The engagement of relevant public institutions played an important role. 2. Technology and knowledge development: \uf0b7 The technologies that were being transferred in this project are not new. In fact, they are all well-known and proven good agricultural practices. However, they had to be adapted to the specific context (using local tools and plant species), and they were \u2018new\u2019 to the beneficiaries. The case study shows that even simple and well-known technologies do not diffuse and upscale in an automatic way . In fact, they experience the same type of drivers and barriers as more innovative technologies. \uf0b7 Apart from a needs assessment, it is also important to assess the adoption potential for the technologies to be implemented (Franzel, 2001). This was not done during the project, which caused the need to reduce some of the project targets. \uf0b7 Capacity building, together with regular quality control is necessary. Inferior resource quality or incorrect operation will negatively affect the results. This reduces the users\u2019 confidence in the merits of the technology itself. In this way, the lack of a quality control system can seriously hamper the diffusion of high- potential technology. An important lesson from this case is that \u2018old\u2019 and well-proven technologies experience very similar drivers and barriers during their transfer and diffusion in a new context as \u2018new\u2019 and innovative technologies. Additionally, quality control is key, as well as capacity building ",
        "195 3. Network development: Network development was not a particular focus of the project, so no lessons can be learnt in this field. The chosen approach focussed on a strong coordination by the executing actor (ACVE) and the individual participation of the farmers in the innovation process. Some informal networking activities took place as participating households showed the new technologies to others who were not involved. 4. Long-term guidance: \uf0b7 In the NAPA-plan (MATTE, 2007), 14 priority activities to adapt to climate change have been prioritised. The following activities are directly related to agricultural and forestry practices: o Preserve existing woodlots and reforest the stripped zones (2) o Reinforce the management of the existing protected areas and protect the threatened and vulnerable natural ecosystems (3) o Set up erosion control mechanisms in sensitive areas (5) o Identify and popularise dryness resistant forest species (7) o Popularise short cycle and dryness resistant food crops (8) o Identify and popularise the improved techniques of wood use and new renewable energies (10) o Identify and popularise the breeding of species adapted to local climate conditions (13) In the NAPA, the following intentions are expressed by the government: In the environmental sector, the government will concentrate its efforts on the following actions: o inform and train stakeholders on the rational management of natural resources; o [\u2026] o train and equip the environmental police force; o work out plans of natural resource management, support and accompany local communities in natural resource management; o revive the National Environment Commission; o reforest and completely develop all the slopes in the catchment\u2019s area; o identify and introduce substitutes to protect the threatened natural resources; o [\u2026] o explore the use of community woodlots as a source of income. o [\u2026] The government will also encourage fodder crops growing with emphasis on the [\u2026] leguminous species which [\u2026] improve soil fertility. However, as already feared for during the compilation of the NAPA, the Action plan did not succeed thus far in implementing any of these activities, due to lack of finance, weakness of the institutional framework and the lack of a sense of urgency as other problems receive a higher priority (MATTE, 2007; Hakizimana, 2012). Especially for technologies that target long term environmental benefits instead of short term profits, regulation and stimulation by government initiatives is crucial to motivate and support people in applying new technology that asks more ",
        "196 discipline, time or investment. Building the institutional capacities of authorities and agencies to prioritise, plan, implement and coordinate national action plans is very important to avoid losing the momentum created by a successful project. 5. Market formation: \uf0b7 By creating a potential market for the farmers\u2019 produce (e.g. a market stall in the public garden of Bujumbura or along the road) and the selling of fertiliser and pest control products to the local farmers, additional sources of income can be generated. In 2012, ACVE was working on this, outside of the project framework. \uf0b7 During the project, all resources and trainings were provided to the beneficiaries for free. However, on a larger scale this mechanism will not remain feasible. In order to stimulate diffusion of the technology, it is important to assess how the technologies and their necessary inputs can be made affordable (but not free) by the targeted end-users. Financial incentives (subsidies, grants, loan schemes\u2026) which can assist increasing affordability can be identified resulting in a transparent system of support. Technologies should be made available and affordable by the targeted end-users to create demand, while maintaining quality. The incorporation of financial incentives might be instrumental in developing a private sector and market. 6. Resource mobilisation: As the project\u2019s (financial) resources were provided by EU funding, some concerns have risen among the farmers what the future of the project will be after the end of the funding. At this moment there is no clear view on the mobilisation of resources to support the initiatives in the future. The development of mechanisms for (self-) financing will turn out to be very important for the continuation and up-scaling. 7. Creation of legitimacy: Working with local partners and including local NGOs with local expertise, has many advantages: it reduces time to get acquainted with local customs, it helps overcoming cultural and political obstacles and facilitate the inclusion of local actors (Morsink, 2011). The participatory approach in the selection and implementation of activities undoubtedly has contributed to the creation of project ownership and acceptance among the beneficiaries. 5.8.6 Implications for future policy making Some suggestions/conclusions for future policy making could be: \uf0b7 As well-proven and innovative technologies experience the same issues in diffusion, there is little need to distinguish between them in policy. \uf0b7 More flexibility in grant advances and payments in order to prevent cash flow problems within the executing organisations. \uf0b7 Strengthen the capacity of local authorities and institutions and support them to plan, implement and coordinate programmes, and to make adequate policies accordingly.

        "198 5.9 Salt water irrigation in Chile and Jordan 5.9.1 Summary The Dutyion\u2122 subsurface irrigation technology works by a network of pipes being filled with pure, brackish / salted or polluted water. This case study is of particular interest as it allowed the analysis and comparison of the transfer processes of the same eco- technology to different developing countries, both aimed at solving similar problems regarding the availability of (good quality) water for irrigation. In both cases a project was submitted to obtain public financing for a substantial part of the proposed activities. In Chile, financial resources were requested from a national development corporation, while the Jordanian project involves funding by international organisations as well as substantive and strategic linkages that would be established with a number of networks and programs. The Chilean proposal was aborted, but in the Jordanian case it has been accepted and is starting in 2012. The main objective of the project in Jordan is to reduce the vulnerability of the agricultural system in Jordan to climate change, particularly its impacts on water resources. The main target group in Jordan consists of rural farmers which are most vulnerable as a result of their poverty level. In view of the absence of evident barriers to implement the Chilean project, a possible conclusion could be that the intended submission of the proposal came too early in the technology development and diffusion process. To our knowledge, no further efforts were undertaken to transfer the technology to South-America. 5.9.2 Context, selection, goals and ambitions 5.9.2.1 Country context Jordan The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan stretches over an area of over 90,000 km2 in the hot and dry region of West Asia. It is an almost land-locked country, bordered by Israel and the West Bank to the west, Syria to the north, Iraq to the east and Saudi Arabia to the southeast. More than 80 percent of the country is made up of unpopulated desert. Water resources in Jordan depend chiefly on precipitations within-country. Exceptions are the Yarmouk River, which is fed mainly by rain falling on Syrian territory, and the Azraq aquifer, whose replenishment also depends on precipitation in Syria. The annual average rainfall ranges between 600mm in the northern uplands to less than 50mm in the southern and eastern desert areas. About 20 % of Jordanians live in rural areas where poverty is more prevalent than in urban areas; approximately 19 % of the rural population is classified as poor. Jordan is dominated by an arid climate and fragile ecological systems. The country suffered drastically from the sudden population increase as a result of the political conditions during the second half of last century. This affected natural resources and the environment and most of Jordan is now subject to desertification in one form or another. Jordan\u2019s natural resources are very limited and the country is among the world\u2019s most water-deficient. A major challenge for the government is therefore promoting the sustainable use of natural resources for agriculture. This is made harder by on-going degradation processes, coupled with climate change which undermines many social and economic development gains. Chile Chile is an upper middle-income country. In 2010, it became the second Latin American country to join the OECD. The population of Chile reached 17 million in 2010. About 85 % live in urban areas. Population growth is among the lowest in Latin America. The country has succeeded in reducing poverty significantly, and has the lowest poverty rate in Latin America. Nevertheless, income inequality remains a major challenge as Chile is one of the countries with the most skewed income distribution in Latin America, itself the most ",
        "199 unequal region of the world. The situation of Chilean water resources over the past three decades has probably been less influenced by the water sector itself than by the national development strategy, macroeconomic policies and developments in other sectors. The empowering role of the market and the promotion of export-oriented economy based on products such as copper, fresh fruit, wood and pulp, salmon, and wine - all of which use water in their production process - have led to a significant increase in water use, particularly in the relatively poor water basins of the northern and central parts of the country. It is likely that many of these trends will continue in the short and medium term. At the same time, water quality declines in some basins (especially in the north of the country), and the effects of climate change result in additional stress on the available water resources, especially in already poor water basins. As a result of these developments in supply and demand, it is expected that competition for water will raise, the interdependencies between water users and the associated conflicts will increase, and that the environmental pressures intensify. 5.9.2.2 History of dRHS technology development The dRHS technology is based on the physical phenomenon of pervaporation. The term pervaporation was first introduced by Kober (1917). Pervaporation is a separation process in which a liquid feed containing two or more components comes into contact with one side of a membrane while vacuum (or purged gas) is applied on the other side to produce a permeate vapour. The last decades, membrane pervaporation emerged as a promising separation process in biotechnology, chemical and environmental engineering because of its excellent separation efficiency and low energy requirement. Korngold (1996) described a new desalination process consisting of air humidification by pervaporation through hydrophilic or microporous hydrophobic hollow fibres followed by dehumidification by cooling water. Mark Tonkin and others invented a water purification apparatus that contained a homogeneous, hydrophilic, dense membrane. The patent was published in 2004. The membrane polymer (a thermoplastic copolyether esters elastomer) was developed by E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company. Qui\u00f1ones-Bola\u00f1os et al. (2005) investigated the suitability of this membrane as a novel wastewater micro-irrigation technology for enabling the reuse brackish and/or contaminated waters, and concluded the application to be promising. Initial trials were conducted using tomato plants grown in parallel with controls. These initial trials were carried out in the UK on very basic test systems. The Dutyion\u2122 sub surface irrigation technology which was developed from these initial trial systems appeared to be an extremely water efficient and cost effective solution to the global problem of irrigation water quality. The Dutyion\u2122 Irrigation technology works by a network of sub surface pipes being filled with water, almost any water. The water can be pure, brackish / salted or polluted. The functioning of the system is presented in Figure 57. ",
        "200 Figure 57: Dutyion Root Hydration System The system uses Dutyion\u2122 SmartPipe\u2122 technology which allows water to pass through its walls by a process of \u2018Phase Change Permeation\u2122\u2019 - \u2018PCP\u2122\u2019. As water diffuses through the pipe walls, there are no holes or emitters to become clogged or blocked; most contaminants are retained within the pipes. There is no requirement for pressure, the system is gravity fed from a supply tank. Plants take water according to their needs: more as the soil dries out, less if the surrounding soil becomes wetter. The system is extremely water efficient since there is virtually no loss of water due to evaporation or run-off. There is no requirement for monitoring or planned irrigation events: each plant may require a different amount of water at a different time. Further trials of the technology, both in the lab as well as in the field, were undertaken in the USA and Mexico. The results supported the conclusions of the work done in the UK and led to semi-commercial field trials. Locations that were selected to install trial systems included Chile, Libya, Tanzania, Mauritius and Spain. Crops which have been successfully trialled include tomatoes, radishes, courgettes, peppers, lettuce, sorghum, lawn grass, strawberries and beans as well as cherry, olive and Prosopis trees. The technology was displayed to the public at the Eden Project in Cornwall, England in 2007. In 2009, the dRHS Technology was voted winner in the Water Technology Idol 2009 category at the Global Water Intelligence/ International Desalination Association Awards in Zurich, Switzerland. The milestones in the history of the dRHS Technology are summarized in Figure 58.

        "201 5.9.2.3 Introducing dRHS technology in Chile and Jordan Chile In mid-2006, the Director of the Municipal Service of Environment of Arica, Chile, met with Mark Tonkin, chief technology officer from Irrigation Design & Technologies (DTI-r), during a visit to the facilities of Eden Project in Cornwall, England. Different options were assessed to introduce the revolutionary irrigation technology to the city of Arica, known as the driest city in the world (average annual rainfall < 1 mm). In November 2007, DTI- r representatives visited executives of the water company of Arica, local authorities and farmers in the valleys of Lluta and Azapa, in order to explore options of engaging in research and demonstration of the technology. A meeting with the national Corporation for Development of the Production (CORFO) was organized to analyse possible financial support, and a tentative work program was agreed upon. The visit led to the conclusion that the technology offered an excellent opportunity to use contaminated or saline water to irrigate crops and ornamental plants in the desert area of northern Chile, especially in public parks and agricultural areas with increasingly limited water availability and quality. The city of Arica presented obvious additional advantages for the further marketing of the technology and its applications. Its strategic location in the centre of the largest coastal desert of South America, extending to the neighbouring country of Peru, could hold significant future business opportunities, in view of the important agricultural and economic development of the last decade in the Peruvian coastal area, including the implementation of large irrigation projects. Together with CORFO executives, it was decided to submit a project proposal to the \u201cInnovaChile\u201d open call, aiming at individual business innovation. Different local partners showed interest in the project. At the beginning of 2008, a first draft was discussed at CORFO and several remarks were received. In July 2008 the final administrative, technical and practical setup was consented. The submitted project started from the specific situation of soil salinization, water scarcity and water quality problems of the city of Arica and the nearby agricultural valleys of Lluta, Azapa and Camarones. The proposed project considered the building of three separate irrigation modules in a time span of 20 months, aimed at providing a solution to the limitations of the area. After several months of fruitless discussions with the local CORFO agency, the private initiators of the proposal decided not to insist on its implementation and to abstain from further initiatives regarding the technology in Chile. Jordan In the Jordanian case, contacts were established with the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), thanks to several years of trials in different countries of the Middle East. An irrigation project proposal was submitted to the LDCF/SCCF Council, which was approved in November 2009, engaging the Rome based International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) as implementing agency. CEO endorsement for the project was obtained in June 2011. The project duration is 48 months, with the implementation foreseen for October 2012. The main objective of the project in Jordan is to reduce the vulnerability of the agricultural system in Jordan to climate change, particularly its impacts on water resources. Therefore, the dRHS technology will be tested on pilot sites. The project targets a total of 100 ha of agricultural land. The technology is expected to improve water use efficiency by at least 30%. This investment-oriented component represents the bulk of the project and it aims to efficiently deliver and transfer the technology to the ",
        "202 project beneficiaries. The component of training, capacity building and communication will focus on training professionals, farmers and local stakeholders on the installation, use and maintenance of the new technology. Extension service providers will also be a target of the proposed training program. Training sessions will be tailored to the needs and capabilities of the beneficiaries. An awareness campaign on climate change impact will be carried out. Furthermore, Government authorities (at both national and local level) will be trained on the potential of the proposed technology, which is considered as a potential adaptation measure to climate change. 5.9.2.4 Relevance of this case study for the project The dRHS irrigation technology represents an interesting case study for analysing the transfer of eco-technologies to developing countries, as specific information was available on two concrete project proposals, both aimed at solving similar problems regarding the availability of (good quality) water for irrigation, but in very different and distant countries. In both cases the project was submitted to obtain public financing for a substantial part of the proposed activities. In Chile, financial resources were requested from a national development corporation, while the Jordanian project involves funding by international organisations as well as substantive and strategic linkages that would be established with a number of networks and programs. The comparison of both project proposals is particularly interesting, because the Chilean proposal was aborted, while the Jordanian project proposal has been accepted and is starting in 2012. In Jordan, the Swiss Review of the Work Program of SCCF/C.7 remarked that the technology is still under pre- or semi-commercial testing, making the proposed project rather a technology demonstration than a technology transfer project. Even so, up-scaling was considered explicitly through the elaboration of scenarios to forecast the market share of dRHS plastic pipe for local market and for local and export market. Additionally, a preliminary economic feasibility assessment for the future potential of producing and implementing the dRHS irrigation technology in Jordan was undertaken, including a market study, an analysis of the possible investment modalities and a financial analysis related to the investment. In Figure 30 the case has been located on the technology transfer and transition curve. The implementation of the Jordanian project can be seen as the take-off of the technology. At the same time, the project is meant to end the development phase and start the diffusion of the technology transfer process. The projects\u2019 embedding in international networks and programs implies the opportunity to create a first empowered niche. Whether this empowered niche will develop to a new regime will depend on several factors, some of which will be uncovered during the execution of the project. ",
        "203 Figure 59: Position of the salt water irrigation case study on the technology transfer and transition curve 5.9.3 Design 5.9.3.1 Main stakeholders Chile Design Technology & Irrigation Ltd. (DTI-r) is the private company created by the inventor of the technical concepts of the dRHS Irrigation technology, and was the driving factor for transferring the dRHS technology to Chile. The Corporation for Development of Production (CORFO) is an executing agency of government policies in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation, through tools and instruments compatible with the main guidelines of a social market economy, creating the conditions for building an opportunity society. The selected instrument for submitting the Chile project was the open CORFO call \u2018InnovaChile\u2019. The Municipality of Arica was committed to the desalinization project, with a view to the development of a green beach strip and to improve the management of urban parks. The Centro Tecnol\u00f3gico Nuevos Horizontes and Agr\u00edcola Amberes Ltda . were local private companies specialized in issues related to irrigation technology, that were actively involved in the preparation of the project. Agr\u00edcola Amberes Ltda. was projected as the local company to submit the innovation proposal.

        "204 will make the tubes. Dupont also recommends the establishment of a local irrigation designer/installer to whom they will license the technology. A partnership to further develop the technology and make sure it is largely disseminated shall also be explored. The Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) , provides funding for the Jordanian project and was established under the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2001 to finance projects relating to: adaptation; technology transfer and capacity building; energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management; and economic diversification. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) , is the managing body of the SCCF and Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), with the World Bank as the Trustee. The GEF receives guidance from and reports to the UNFCCC COP. The governing body of the SCCF is the LDCF/SCCF Council which meets two times a year. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) , is a specialized agency of the United Nations, that was established as an international financial institution in 1977 as one of the major outcomes of the 1974 World Food Conference. It is the implementing agency of the project. The IFAD/SCCF component of the project will aim to enhance the adaptive capacity of poor rural farmers to address climate change impact and will adopt an investment-oriented approach to transfer an innovative water efficient technology to the local population. The principal executing agency for the project will be the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) with implementation undertaken by the National Centre for Agricultural Research and Extension (NCARE) which has the governmental mandate and expertise to address agricultural activities and is directly linked to the Ministry of Agriculture. The NCARE will maintain the project management unit (PMU) for field implementation activities within the pilot sites and will be responsible for the timely delivery of inputs and outputs and for coordination with all other relevant agencies. This structure provides for easy management and flexible decision making. NCARE will undertake the process to have the dRHS technology nationally certified after testing and disseminated to farmers at the national level. It is important to note that before NCARE provides certification for new technologies, it needs to be backed-up by proven results. The national level key stakeholder involvement comes from the Jordanian Ministries of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC), Environment (MOE), Agriculture (MOA), Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI), Agriculture Credit Corporation (ACC), and the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) . Additional national level support would also be expected from university groups , especially from the Departments of Agriculture. At the local level, stakeholders would include farmers, agriculture cooperatives, districts, villages and community groups . Each of these stakeholders plays a particular role in the project, as shown in Table 13. ",
        "205 Table 13: Role of stakeholders in the dRHS project in Jordan 5.9.3.2 Targeted beneficiaries Chile The scope of the Chilean project was to analyse and demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of different applications of the dRHS technology. The project was submitted to CORFO, the official Chilean Economic Development Agency promoting the establishment and growth in Chile of innovative, dynamic and accountable firms with access to global markets by supporting high-impact projects that contribute to making Chilean's aspirations for growth and prosperity a reality. Its mission is to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation to improve productivity in Chile. In this context, the direct beneficiaries are the private sector companies involved in the funded projects. The indirect beneficiaries of the proposal would have been the Chileans that would have benefited from improved water availability or quality, and from the production, implementation and commercialization of the technology. Jordan The main target group consists of rural farmers which are most vulnerable as a result of their poverty level. There is a relatively important overlapping between poverty level, desertification, and vulnerability to climate change. The priority farmer communities are in the Jordan Valley and Ghore el Safi. The project will particularly target poor rural women and youth who form the main active proportion of the farmers in the target areas. 20 training sessions on the installation, use and maintenance of the dRHS technology will be provided to about 200 farmers. Extension services providers will be also targeted by the training program. Government authorities (at both national and local level) will be trained on the potential of the proposed technology, as an adaptation to climate change measure in the country. 5.9.3.3 Financial resources Chile The Chilean project considered a total budget of \u20ac415,000, over 20 months, with a 58% share of CORFO grant. Non-monetary contributions included the land and water required to set up the different modules, that were to be made available by committed farmers, farmer\u2019s organizations and public bodies. The DTI-r share of the budget included the ",
        "206 provision of its technical expertise required to implement the project, the physical components of the technology, and technical assistance in the field during installation, planting and cultivation. The technology components would have been decommissioned or transferred when finalizing the project. Jordan Project financing The Jordanian project considers the following financial contribution: Table 14: dRHS project Jordan (co-)financiers (co-)financier US$ % SCCF Grant 2,000,020 27 National Center for Agricultural Research and Extension 4,100,000 55 Dupont 1,416,000 19 Project total 7,516,020 100 Financing instruments within the project No direct financing of targeted project beneficiaries is foreseen. An initial analysis of financial feasibility of the system has shown that for some of the key cash-crops in Jordan, the payback period of the technology would be in the order of 3 to 4 years. This calculation was based on local knowledge of costs to grow these crops in Jordan and on the overall investment cost of the technology. Such payback periods can be considered acceptable given the importance of the technology on a national scale. The economic feasibility of the dRHS system will determine the extent to which the scaling-up will succeed. Nevertheless, it is assumed that the Government of Jordan will continue to place sustainable water management as a high priority for investment and will promote the financial mechanisms and incentives to apply water conservation technologies and practices. The project will identify the relevant policies related to rural development, agriculture and water management and propose the adoption of water conservation technologies such as the dRHS in order to advocate for increased investments and the application of new financial mechanisms . The project is expected to sustain and further improve the decentralized management of land and water resources by up-scaling the project with identified financial mechanisms adopted by the end of the project\u2019s life. This will be achieved through a series of activities, including those to attract external resources and/or generate financial return and to identify and/or design viable financial mechanisms/models to support financial sustainability (e.g. public funds and programs, generation of environmental taxes, revolving funds schemes, and certifications). The Agriculture Credit Corporation (ACC) demonstrated a serious interest in integrating the project approach and technology into its lending programmes. ACC will help promote the technology by providing a special credit line (with no or very low interest) to interested farmers to adopt and implement the dRHS irrigation system. MOPIC will further support ACC in implementing that by supporting this policy at the national level as well as in relevant sectoral policies, plans and programmes. ",
        "207 5.9.3.4 Training and capacity building Chile Technical training of professionals engaged in the implementation of the different modules was foreseen. Jordan Training, capacity building and communication activities make 13% of the total project budget. These activities are aimed at enhancing the farmers\u2019 capacity to install, use and maintain the dRHS technology, and increasing the awareness at national and local levels on the potential of dRHS technology as an adaptation measure. The training considers courses for selected farmers as well as more advanced activities targeting professionals and extension workers to implement the project and upscale it, and replicate the experiences gained. 20 training sessions are foreseen on the installation, use and maintenance of the dRHS technology, provided to about 200 farmers. 20 irrigation technicians will be trained on the installation and maintenance of the dRHS. The project would seek the support of local networks and institutions, would provide \u201c training for trainers \u201d, and agriculture extension services, thus promoting the sustainable use of natural resources and up-scaling sustainable irrigation practices. An awareness campaign will be targeted to farmers, extension workers, relevant private sector entities, and public institutions at the national and local level across Jordan, with emphasis on the project pilot areas. Workshops gathering government representatives at both local and national levels will be organized and undertaken. 5.9.4 Analysis: results, drivers and obstacles 5.9.4.1 Results Chile After several months of discussions with CORFO, DTI-r together with the local submitting partners, decided not to insist in obtaining financing through the development corporation. The committed stakeholders were informed of the decision. To our knowledge, no further efforts were undertaken to transfer the technology to South- America. Jordan The start of the SCCF granted project is planned for October 2012, with a mid-term review in 2014. The expected incremented benefits of this intervention include: - Vulnerability to climate change impact on water resources and agricultural production systems in Jordan reduced. - Increase in water availability in targeted areas (m3/ha) - Increase in agriculture production area due to increase in water availability (m2) - Expected shortage in irrigation water in targeted areas compensated by the use of alternative water (m3/m3) - dRHS technology successfully tested and disseminated over 100 ha (approx. 12,000 m/ha of pipes installed). ",
        "208 - Anticipated loss of hired family labour, including women and children, reverted due to increased availability of water for agriculture - Risk groups such as poor farmers, women and youth benefiting from continued revenues from agriculture 5.9.4.2 Drivers for success The following factors were identified as crucial to the success of initiating the diffusion phase of the dRHS technology in Jordan. Some of these factors would have applied to the Chilean case as well. Yet it has to be indicated that the application of dRHS technology in Jordan is still at its infancy and therefore at this stage it is difficult gauging which drivers are the most effective and crucial ones. Nevertheless, the following set of drivers could be identified: Cultural drivers and meeting a need: \uf0b7 Appropriate technology : Jordanian farmers already are familiarized with irrigation technologies, mainly with drip irrigation. \uf0b7 Meeting an actual need : the increasing pressure on the available water sources, declining water quality, the availability of brackish water, and growing costs associated with irrigation are a strong incentive to look for alternative, more water efficient technologies that reduce the need for maintenance. Financial and economic drivers: \uf0b7 Reliable financial resources : the engagement of funds that operate under the United Nations and World Bank umbrellas are complemented by governmental resources, as well as by contributions from the globally active Dupont company. \uf0b7 Demand generation : activities are considered to attract external resources and/or generate financial return and to identify and/or design viable financial mechanisms/models to support financial sustainability (e.g. public funds and programs, generation of environmental taxes, revolving funds schemes, and certifications). \uf0b7 An efficient-public-private partnership : the project capitalizes on NCARE\u2019s regional centres and outreach to have easy and fast access to the farming communities in the different areas. NCARE has a coordinating role. DuPont will provide the raw material to make the tubes. Different forms for future investments, as public, private, and public-private partnership including an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each, were studied. \uf0b7 Development of the private sector : The technology might be licensed to a local irrigation designer/installer. A partnership to further develop the technology and make sure it is largely disseminated shall also be explored. \uf0b7 Effective use of funding : the programme was designed in such a way that the financial resources will reach the target groups. Technical drivers: \uf0b7 Continuous knowledge development and R&D : NCARE operates 13 research stations. The final evaluation will look at impact and sustainability of results, including the contribution to capacity development and the achievement of global environmental goals. It will also provide recommendations for follow-up activities. ",
        "209 The project will identify, analyse, and share lessons learned that might be beneficial in the design and implementation of similar future projects. \uf0b7 Quality control : NCARE will undertake the process to have the dRHS technology nationally certified after testing in order for it to be adopted by NCARE and disseminated to farmers at the national level. While NCARE provides certification for new technologies, it undergoes a rigid certification process which needs to be backed- up by proven results. Policy and institutional drivers: \uf0b7 A supportive government policy: the Jordanian government\u2019s policy is today to prioritize use of fresh water for domestic uses while identifying alternative sources of water for irrigation. The proposed project is closely linked with several on-going initiatives within the framework of regional and national development policies. \uf0b7 Setting of objectives: the Government of Jordan is actively preparing a number of national and sectoral policies and strategies aiming at reaching sustainable development and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Environmental management, including the sustainable use of water resources, is a high priority in several strategies. \uf0b7 Institutional support: the main institutions dealing with agriculture and water management in Jordan play a role in the project. \uf0b7 Close partnerships : the project considers close partnerships with the key institutional players, including the financial, technical and private sector and government and non-government institutions. Promotion and awareness building: \uf0b7 Dedicated promotion campaigns: Government authorities (at both national and local level) will be trained on the potential of the proposed technology, as an adaptation to climate change measure in the country. An awareness campaign will be targeted at farmers, extension workers, relevant private sector entities, and public institutions at the national and local level across Jordan, with emphasis on the project pilot areas. The awareness campaign will extend over the life time of the project. and will highlight the following main topics: - The impact of climate change on natural resources and agricultural development in Jordan - The responsibility of the different actors in mitigating and adapting to climate change impacts - The use of the dRHS irrigation system 5.9.4.3 Barriers The following barriers were identified that have led to the failure to set up a technology demonstration project to diffuse the technology in Chile: Cultural barriers: \uf0b7 Poor communication: The first contact between the UK company executives with regional CORFO officials was promising. The meeting was conducted in English, and the feasibility of the different available instruments for financing the particular innovation initiative was discussed extensively. A \u2018best fit\u2019 instrument, InnovaChile, ",
        "210 was selected, and the corresponding project templates were sent by mail shortly after. Nevertheless, post meeting communication was extremely slow, no strategic orientation was provided, nor was there any further active participation of CORFO to overcome executive or substantive obstacles during the writing of the project. Though the proposed project had a strong regional focus, regional officials ended depositing the responsibility for an eventual project approval completely with the central offices of CORFO in Santiago, 2.000 kilometres south. After several months, CORFO proposed to use a different financing instrument, requiring different project formats and an alternative organizational structure. A DTI-r executive described the efforts to get through the application procedure as \u201cdragging a quango\u201d 98 . \uf0b7 Lack of dynamic innovative entrepreneurs : Kantis et al. (2008) state that one of the greatest challenges that economic development poses for Chile has to do with strengthening the role that innovation plays both in already established and in newly- generated innovative enterprises. Earlier studies concluded that new entrepreneurial initiatives with a high potential are scarce in Chile, due to the lack of entrepreneurial skills to identify, evaluate and exploit opportunities, and poor linkage of these projects with appropriate funding sources, despite all different strategies to revert this situation. As opposed to the situation in more advanced countries, innovation still plays a minor role in the creation of new enterprises. Financial and economic barriers: \uf0b7 No evident financial or economic barriers were present: The proposal was meant to be submitted to an open call with plenty of financial resources. In the 2008- 2010 period, InnovaChile provided funds as grants to promote innovation for development for 226.3 million US$ (From: http://www.alide.org.pe/download/Financ_Sectorial/fn11_mic_rev1_InnovaChile.pdf). Founded in 1939, the objective of the Production Development Agency CORFO was to contribute to economic development. CORFO had a prominent role in creating several industries in Chile, and still holds over \u20ac1.4b worth of investments in companies. The total endowment of CORFO is over \u20ac2.8b. Today the role of CORFO and its division InnovaChile is to promote innovations through a number of instruments and programmes. CORFO is considered the executing agency of government policies on innovation and entrepreneurship. Reporting to the Ministry of Economy, the specific objectives of CORFO include promoting innovation and entrepreneurship. The target segments of CORFO are primarily companies and entrepreneurs (national and foreign), but also R&D organisations and universities, and not-for-profit-organisations. As an executing agency for public funding for business R&D, CORFO is the chief actor in policy implementation. (From http://erawatch.jrc.ec.europa.eu)) It was suggested by CORFO that the assets of the submitting local company, Agr\u00edcola Amberes Ltda., were not sufficient to qualify as a grant beneficiary in the proposed project. However, this was never expressed formally, and neither the issue nor its eventual solutions were further discussed. 98 The acronym \"quango\" stands for \"quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation\". It was coined as a joke, probably by Sir Douglas Hague, but has come into serious (yet typically pejorative) use in the UK and India. Especially in Great Britain, the term refers to a semi-public advisory and administrative body supported by the government and having most of its members appointed by the government. ",
        "211 Technical barriers: \uf0b7 No evident technical barriers were present: all of the agricultural land in the Arica valleys is irrigated, so farmers are familiar with irrigation technologies. In the Lluta valley, earlier attempts to introduce drip irrigation failed, since water quality, with boron concentrations over 20 ppm, does not allow to produce crops with a sufficient return on the investment in irrigation infrastructure. Still, Lluta farmers demonstrated willingness to adopt new technologies, and invested capital in doing so, in some cases even putting at risk the continuity of their small enterprises (D. Nelen, pers. comm.). Institutional barriers: \uf0b7 No evident institutional barriers were present : In the Azapa valley, in 1999, a CORFO co-financed innovation project allowed to experiment with state-of-the-art water treatment and irrigation technology for strawberry cropping 99 . In 2006, an agricultural innovation project concerning a new boron removal technology was financed and successfully implemented with an active participation of farmers of the Lluta valley 100 . Such projects demonstrate that institutional barriers might not have played an important role in the failure of introducing the dRHS technology in Chile. The fact that it was unclear whether the project proposal had to be approved by regional officials or at a central level can be categorized as poor communication. Social barriers: \uf0b7 No evident social barriers for implementing the dRHS technology were present. External barriers: \uf0b7 Poor connectivity : The connectivity between Arica and the main European cities is limited as Arica has no regular international flight connections. The trip from any European capital to Santiago de Chile or to Lima (Peru) takes 12 to 22 hours. National airlines connect Santiago with Arica through a four hour flight, or Lima with Tacna, a small Peruvian border town at a one hour drive of Arica. This poor connectivity and the distance to Europe would have been relevant factors for the transportation of people (technicians) and goods (irrigation pipes) required for implementing the proposed project. 5.9.5 Lessons learned The transfer of the dRHS technology to developing countries is still in an early phase. Two attempts to introduce the same technology to solve almost identical problems in different countries yielded contrasting results. The reason for such outcome is thus to be found in the approaches and/or instruments that were used to obtain financing to 99 Agr\u00edcola Silmar Ltda., Introducci\u00f3n del cultivo vertical de frutillas con alta tecnolog\u00edas y agua tratada en el norte grande. (FONTEC, 1999) 100 Innovation project FIA-PI-C-2002-1-A-075 was financed by the Foundation for Agricultural innovation.( Fundaci\u00f3n para la Innovaci\u00f3n Agraria, FIA) ",
        "212 implement the proposed test and demonstration projects, or in the barriers that had to be overcome. This observation suggests that important lessons can be learnt regarding the development and diffusion of technologies in developing countries. The discussion is based on the seven functions of innovation systems by Hekkert, 2009: 1. Development of the private sector: \uf0b7 Both the Chilean and the Jordanian projects finally aimed to improve the agricultural production and considered additional (future) development of the private sector, e.g. by including the prospect of the local production of irrigation pipes. \uf0b7 In the case of Chile, the selected financing instrument specifically focussed on improving competitiveness of national companies by co-financing individual innovation projects, engaging only private companies. The Jordanian case foresees a close monitoring of project results by international development organisations and an active participation of governmental bodies, and includes no direct private involvement other than the contribution of the technology proprietary. A possible lesson might be that at an early stage of technology transfer, niche empowering by engaging relevant public institutions is more important than the explicit consideration of private sector development, and that a too strong emphasis on the latter could even be counterproductive. 2. Technology and knowledge development: \uf0b7 In both cases, the focus is on the adaptation and implementation of the innovative irrigation technology under specific local conditions, responding to locally observed and acknowledged needs. Knowledge development and sharing is considered. \uf0b7 An important distinction between the two projects is that in the Chilean case, in line with the chosen financing instrument, the objective is to develop location- specific knowledge on technical and design related aspects of the technology, with the primary intention of favouring the involved private companies. The Jordanian project instead includes a component that will focus on training professionals, farmers and local stakeholders on the installation, use and maintenance of the new technology, targeting also extension services providers. \uf0b7 During the project preparation phase in Jordan, the National Centre for Agricultural Research and Extension (NCARE) undertook field experiments to test the dRHS technology prior to project start up. The experiments were used to demonstrate the technology to the stakeholders and showcase it in the field. Their technical objectives coincide to a great extent with those of the Chilean project proposal. The obtained results are seen as a strong basis to allow lessons-learned to be successfully transferred to the implementation phase. A possible conclusion could be that the intended submission of the Chilean proposal came too early in the technology development and diffusion process. ",
        "213 3. Network development: \uf0b7 In the Jordanian case an organisational structure is set-up in which an important number of national and global institutions and companies perform well defined roles. Stakeholders are clearly identified and given explicit opportunities to take part in further network development. The project will further identify and participate, as relevant and appropriate, in scientific, policy-based and/or any other networks, which may be of benefit to project implementation through lessons learned. Results from the program will be disseminated throughout Jordan within and beyond the program intervention zone through a number of existing information sharing networks, including replication and scaling up. \uf0b7 Network development was not an issue in the Chilean project, since the chosen instrument centred on individual innovation initiatives. The project considered contributions of only local stakeholders (farmers, farmer organisations, companies, municipal authorities). Especially in view of the absence of evident barriers to implement the Chilean proposal, it appears that extended networking and network development are essential from the very start of a technology transfer initiative. 4. Long-term guidance: \uf0b7 The Jordanian National Centre for Agricultural Research and Extension (NCARE) will undertake the process to have the dRHS technology nationally certified after testing in order for it to be adopted by NCARE and disseminated to farmers at the national level. The linkage of the project with existing networks, programs and platforms might facilitate technical and managerial guidance on the technology transferring process on a longer term. In line with the selected instrument, the Chilean proposal outlined future opportunities for the technology, but did not include concrete actions to consolidate them. It seems essential for the instruments chosen to initiate a successful technology transfer, to enforce or allow for the inclusion of tangible development perspectives at longer term. 5. Market formation: \uf0b7 Even though the present case is situated in an early stage of the technology transfer process, the Jordanian proposal recognizes the need of financial incentives to stimulate the market and to make the technology affordable by the targeted end-users to create demand. 6. Resource mobilisation: \uf0b7 Because of the early stage of the technology transfer process, no lessons can be learnt on resource mobilisation. 7. Creation of legitimacy: \uf0b7 The engagement of global organizations, the conducting of local field experiments prior to the project submission and the active participation of governmental ",
        "214 bodies undoubtedly will contribute to giving the Jordanian project legitimacy towards the targeted end-users. Site selection criteria to install the innovative irrigation system included the availability of smallholder farmers and their willingness to participate in technology innovation. The Chilean proposal was presented to a financing corporation without having created a wider societal platform of support towards the intended innovation. Such basis might have been vital, not only to assure the success of the future diffusion of the technology, but even to convince local officials to make available grants to test it and demonstrate its possible applications. 8. Capacity building: \uf0b7 In Jordan, capacity building is considered at the level of directorates of agriculture, specialized extension services, lobbying and advocacy agencies, microfinance institutions fostering a partnership approach and building commitment to follow through activities beyond the project funding phase. The failure to initiate a process of transfer of an innovative irrigation technology in Chile must be attributed in part to the unfortunate selection of the financing instrument, the format of which appeared to be unsuitable at the early stage of DRHS technology transfer. The proposal lacked societal support and a deeper integration in existing networks, programmes and platforms, and instead started from private sector development. The absence of evident barriers for technology transfer to Chile, others than surmountable cultural issues, makes such transfer conceivable in the future, especially at the moment that the Jordanian project would prove the technology to be ready for wider diffusion. 5.9.6 References on the case of Saltwater irrigation in Chile and Jordan European Comission (2010).

        "216 5.10 Plastic recycling in Kinshasa \u2013 Democratic Republic of Congo 5.10.1 Summary There is no concerted policy in place In Kinshasa for solid municipal waste management in terms of collection of waste, transfer to landfills, treatment and recovery. This fact led to the invasion of public space by waste, and particularly by plastic bags that are massively used by the population. Waste, and plastic bags in particular, dumped on the streets contribute to the spread of malaria as the bags clog drains, causing water stagnation and also to flooding. The initiative of the Ing\u00e9nieurs Sans Fronti\u00e8res (ISF), a Belgian non-governmental international solidarity organisation, considers plastic waste as a raw material with market value and as a means of income generation, which if traded can contribute to socio-economic development and sanitation. In addition to its positive impact on the environment, the project sought to contribute to local economic development through supporting a network of private businesses dealing with the collection, sorting, shredding, washing and drying of the plastic waste. These businesses are fully integrated into the local community and are an attractive source of supply of recycled plastic for industries manufacturing finished products. Recycled plastics are replacing, partially or completely, virgin raw material. The initiative addresses all stages of the activity chain leading to the recovery of plastic bags that covers the collection and sorting by local inhabitants, the triage and first treatment (scrub, cut) by trading houses, the processing (shredding, washing, drying and pelleting) by microenterprises and the sale of finished products to the manufactures. The innovative elements of the initiative lie in the simplicity of the technology and in the way it is adapted to the local conditions. The manufacture, operation and maintenance of the machinery and the necessary tools match the local market conditions. The ISF approach is building on the engagement of local micro or small businesses. The initiative provides a source of income to the poorest segment of the urban neighbourhoods. The ISF initiative is adapted to the difficult policy and institutional context of the DRC, its poor infrastructure and weak economy. 5.10.2 Context, selection, goals and ambitions 5.10.2.1 Country context Citizens of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are among the poorest in the world, having the second lowest nominal GDP per capita even though the country has many and diverse natural resources. The conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), also termed as Africa's world war, have left the country in an acute humanitarian crisis 101 . Despite a peace agreement and the formation of a transitional government in 2003, there is still continued unrest in the east of the country. The long and brutal conflict has severely affected the society and the economy of the country. Following the civil war urban areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were in particular crisis as a result of rapid growth, unplanned settlement practices and poor management of public services. These factors led to disastrous consequences, including the degradation of the urban environment, the decay of infrastructure and the deterioration of public health (MacDougall and McGahey, 2003). These problems are most acutely experienced in the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kinshasa. 101 See e.g. BBC (2012) Democratic Republic of Congo Profile, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa- 13283212 ",
        "217 Kinshasa is one of the most populated capitals of Africa. Founded as a port city, Kinshasa developed along the river. Around 1919, Kinshasa already had a population of 14,000, occupying a territory of 650 hectares. At the time of independence, in 1960, the city, which had been the capital since 1923, had an estimated population of 400,000 people occupying an area of 5,500 hectares (UNDP and UNOPS, 1998). Originally developed to handle a population of about one million, Kinshasa today is an urban area with a population of nearly 10 million inhabitants. The economy of the city is rather weak. Only 2% of the active population has a stable job in the capital. At the end of the war, there are several barriers to entrepreneurship such as poor infrastructure, ineffective state institutions and limited production tools. For the generally low-skilled population the sources of regular income are scarce. Sanitation provision in Kinshasa is grossly deficient, as in most cities in sub-Saharan Africa: most people do not have access to a hygienic toilet and large amounts of faecal waste are discharged without adequate treatment. This is likely to have major impacts on infectious diseases and quality of life (Hutton et al. 2007). Kinshasa has no sewerage system (many toilet drains are reported to discharge to the stormwater drainage system of the city) neither has it major facilities for treatment/disposal of wastewater or sludge. Institutional capacity for dealing with sanitation is minimal. For the past 40 years the drainage system has been continuously degraded as a result of lack of maintenance. 5.10.2.2 Status of waste management in Kinshasa There is no concerted policy in place In Kinshasa for solid municipal waste management in terms of collection of waste, transfer to landfills, treatment and recovery. This fact led to the invasion of public space by waste. In particular by plastic bags that are massively used by the population, and that are highly visible and damaging. Residents of Kinshasa termed their city as \"Kin La Poubelle\" (Kinshasa the Dustbin), after many years in which they use to call it proudly \"Kin La Belle\" (Kinshasa the Beautiful). Waste dumped on the streets and in particular plastic bags: \uf0a7 contributes to the spread of malaria: the bags clog drains, causing water stagnation and hence the proliferation of Anopheles mosquitoes, which are vectors for malaria. Accumulating waste has become a health hazard responsible for the return of other water-borne diseases like typhoid and cholera, for respiratory diseases and for water pollution. \uf0a7 contributes to flooding. Waterproof bags are sealing the soil rendering it impermeable, clogging the undersized, open stormwater canal system. In case of heavy rains water runs down in rivers making its way through the streets, into homes and damaged road surfaces. The consequences of these floods are multiple, bringing about diseases, soil erosion, destruction of roads, isolation of the population and hampering trade flows. \uf0a7 contributes to the bad condition of roads and the isolation of various city districts. \uf0a7 the soil sealing is also affecting the urban agricultural production. \uf0a7 farming also suffers from the abundance of plastic with lethal consequences for goats and other animals when these choke on the bags. \uf0a7 in the absence of organized waste collection, the city council tends to burn these plastics, dangerously polluting the environment, the fumes being harmful to the population. ",
        "218 The city council has just a couple of dustbin trucks for a population of nearly 10 million. There is no official attempt in the city to recycle any of the rubbish, which usually blocks the storm water drain system. 5.10.2.3 The plastic waste recycling initiative of ISF The initiative of the Ing\u00e9nieurs Sans Fronti\u00e8res (ISF), a Belgian non-governmental international solidarity organisation, considers plastic waste as a raw material with market value and as a means of income generation, which if traded can contribute to socio-economic development and sanitation. In addition to its positive impact on the environment, the project sought to contribute to local economic development through supporting a network of private businesses dealing with the collection, sorting, shredding, washing and drying of the plastic waste. These businesses are fully integrated into the local community, are an attractive source of supply of recycled plastic for industries manufacturing finished products (e.g. pipes, electrical insulation, watering cans, buckets, etc.). Recycled plastics are replacing, partially or completely virgin raw material. Figure 60: Waste dumped on a road in Kinshasa Source: Biopact The \u2018Ing\u00e9nieurs Sans Fronti\u00e8res\u2019 has set up from 2005 to 2007 a pilot project for plastic waste recycling in three communes (municipalities) of Kinshasa, in Lemba, Ngaba and Makala. The pilot project has confirmed that plastic recovery is possible, that plastic waste, as a raw material has an economic value and that recycling transforms a sanitation problem into an opportunity to develop an economic sector which provides opportunities for the people. While many actors in Kinshasa and in Africa recycle hard plastics (e.g. containers, bowls, etc.), ISF found that the bags are rarely recovered because of their light weight and volume that complicates the logistics of collecting and transportation; and because of the difficulties encountered during cleaning: bags trap the dirt and washing them is laborious work. The targeted plastics are high and low-density polyethylene bags, which are in practice bags in which water is sold on the streets of Kinshasa. ",
        "219 The initiative addresses all stages of the activity chain leading to the recovery of plastic bags that covers the following: - collection and sorting by local inhabitants; - centralization, triage and first treatment (scrub, cut) by trading houses; - processing: shredding, washing, drying and agglomeration (pellet) by microenterprises; - sale of finished products to the manufactures. The operation of the recycling chain covers the activities detailed below. Collection The collection occurs at the source, at the place where the waste is thrown by the population. Collection does not involve physical investments of the project: the inhabitants of the districts, organized or not, pick up the plastic in their neighbourhoods, on the streets, in markets, bus stops, from the gutters, and sell them. This activity brings revenues for hundreds of collectors, even though the size of the income varies by person as it is depends on personal initiative and motivation.. The collectors sell the bags at the counter purchase price of 0.1 USD/kg. Awareness campaigns were conducted by the project and directed to citizens with the slogan \"plastic means money\". Trading The central points of collection are the trading houses located in several areas of the city. The traders (entrepreneurs) mobilize a network of collectors and act as intermediary and wholesaler. They sell the collected plastic in units of minimum 50 kg to the processing plants. They also guarantee the sorting as they are responsible for the quality and cleanliness of plastic. After the scrubbing, counters realize a first waste treatment, cutting the bags into large pieces. Some traders, those who handle a certain volume, already run a small-size family business with a real organization behind it. These traders manage to earn enough to save for investments. From the fifteen trading houses initially created, nine have become regular suppliers of the processing plant. Trading houses supply a processing plant up to 6 tons/month in Kinshasa. The project subsidized the purchase of the collected plastic material to a certain extent. Their purchase price is 0.2 USD/kg, which is slightly higher than the market price. This corresponds to additional quality requirements, as well as requirements related to sorting and preparation. Bags need to be free of sand and water in particular. Processing To avoid pockets that hold dirt during washing and which retain water during drying, the bags are cut into small pieces in a crusher or a shredder. Shredding, especially when performed in a horizontal mill with a sieve, also helps unclogging plastics by shaking the sand that is stuck. ",
        "220 Figure 61: Plastic shredder Source: ISF In a liquid medium, polyethylene floats while sand, paper, adhesives and others sink. The bags are shredded, then placed in cells with an area of 2 to 4 m\u00b3, mounted on a low brick wall and equipped with a stirring system consisting of a vertical propeller driven by a small electric motor rotating at moderate speed. The reusable material is recovered by a fishing net or laundry baskets. Figure 62 : Plastic washing with fishing net Source: ISF After washing, the plastics are dried to remove as much water as possible. The spin dryer may be locally manufactured from a washing machine drum. For drying completely the plastic two possibilities exist: - sun drying and natural ventilation on a concrete slab or on stacked drying tables the top of which is made of a canvas mosquito net; - in the drying furnace equipped with vents for low and high air circulation. The washed and dried material is packed in raffia bags before agglomeration. ",
        "221 The aim of the agglomeration is to densify the flakes of plastic film by compressing the material in the form of small granules, which will then be formed directly by injection molding or extrusion. This operation is achieved by a \"giant grinder\", which a cylindrical tank of 80 to 100 litres, drilled in its bottom, and equipped with rapidly rotating propeller blades. During its passage through the machine, the material is stretched, torn and inflamed. The heating causes a softening of the material and then results in retraction and finally densification in the form of small hard balls. Figure 63 : Plastic pelleting machine Source: ISF Sale The materials are sold to the plastic industry of Kinshasa that incorporates 20 to 100% of recycled material in their products.

        "222 A second project following the closure of the first phase of the initiative in 2008 was focusing on diffusion and multiplication of the plastic recycling technology. The goal of the initiative was to develop successful start-ups that could manage self- sustaining waste recycling production lines and at the same time could contribute to socio-economic development, improved sanitation and decreased environmental pressures in the urban environment. 5.10.2.4 Relevance of this case study for the project The case study on plastic waste recycling in Kinshasa is particularly valuable, demonstrating a clear example of a simple and innovative technology transfer to a developing country and providing a solution to a serious problem that has health-related, environmental and economic aspects. The innovative elements of the initiative lie in the simplicity of the technology and in the way it is adapted to the local conditions: - The manufacture, operation and maintenance of the machinery and the necessary tools match the local market conditions. - The ISF approach is building on the engagement of local micro or small businesses. - The initiative provides a source of income to the poorest segment of the urban neighbourhoods. The ISF initiative is adapted to the difficult policy and institutional context of the DRC, its poor infrastructure and weak economy. All the above characteristics make the potential diffusion and up-scaling of this initiative possible in a great number of developing countries struggling with similar problems. For example, in India, where plastic bags are clogging up lakes, ponds and sewage systems due to unregulated disposal, in West-Africa, and in various parts of Latin America. Figure 65: Position of the plastic recycling case study on the technology transfer and transition curve ",
        "223 With the successful testing of the approach in Kinshasa and the similarly successful subsequent local diffusion and multiplication, the initiative has entered in the phase of broadening and up-scaling (see Figure 2). 5.10.3 Design During the first phase of the initiative between 2005 and 2007 ISF put in place a pilot project of plastic recycling in three municipalities (Lemba, Ngaba and Makala) of Kinshasa. Prior to that ISF, had already started in 2003 activities related to the initiative; preparing technological and economic feasibility studies for the establishment of the first pilot recycling chain in Lemba municipality. The pilot project consisted of the following tasks: \uf0a7 Implementing an experimental recycling chain of hard plastics and plastic bags, and rendering it lucrative. The task included the development of the technical and organizational prerequisites to ensure the feasibility of the production operations. \uf0a7 Supporting three independent recycling entrepreneurs and developing methodologies for their guidance. \uf0a7 Organisation of the plastic waste collection: the plastic waste is procured from various waste collectors. \uf0a7 Recruiting a local staff for ensuring the diffusion of the recycling activity. \uf0a7 Raising awareness among the population and the local authorities about valorisation of household waste as a means of contributing to sanitation. ISF provided the technological know-how on plastic waste recycling and also ensured the funding for the initiative. The Belgian organisation was closely cooperating with its Congolese partner, Umoja D\u00e9veloppement Durable (UDD), a non-governmental organisation with an aim of promoting sustainable development in the DRC. The role of UDD was essential for the implementation of the project. The Congolese NGO ensured the adaptation of the technology to the local circumstances. The activity of UDD was also vital in the local administration of the project, particularly in dealing with local authorities and in the training of the local entrepreneurs. Following the first project, which focused on research and development, ISF and its Congolese partner, Umoja D\u00e9veloppement Durable, implemented a second project (2008-2010) focusing on diffusion and multiplication. During the implementation of this project three production lines were established in the Limete district of Kinshasa. After project funding ended in 2010, production was moved to another district of the capital, Kimbanseke The government offered the operators a site free of charge there. 5.10.3.1 Main stakeholders Ing\u00e9nieurs Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Engineers Without Borders, ISF) launched the plastic recycling initiative in Kinshasa in 2003. ISF coordinated the plastic recycling projects in the DRC, provided technical assistance and the know-how of the technology and ensured the funding for the activities. Umoja D\u00e9veloppement Durable (UDD) a Congolese non-govermental organisation set up for the project implementation, responsible for adaptation of the technology to the local circumstances, local administration and training. Europaid provided the majority of the funding for the first phase of the initiative between 2005 and 2007. ",
        "224 The Belgian Cooperation for Development (Coop\u00e9ration Belge au D\u00e9velopp\u00e9ment) was the principal donor during the second project phase between 2008 and 2010, but also complemented the Europaid funding of the first project. Total Petrochemicals complementing the funds of the Belgian Cooperation for Development provided the remaining funding for the second phase of the project between 2008 and 2010. 5.10.3.2 Targeted beneficiaries Citizens : They are involved directly in the collection of waste; this activity brings extra revenues for them. Citizens are also indirectly affected by the positive impacts of plastic recycling activity: improvement of the sanitation of their neighbourhood andalleviation of the damaging effects of dumped waste in public space. Local entrepreneurs : The diffusion of the technology can provide opportunities to a growing number of entrepreneurs involved in the plastic recycling chain. Local NGOs : The role of local NGOs is vital for supporting the initial activities and providing adequate training for the entrepreneurs involved in plastic recycling. 5.10.3.3 Financial resources Project financing For the first project phase between 2005 and 2008, Europaid provided 75% of the funding to the project consortium (ISF and UDD). Co-financing was provided by the Belgian Cooperation for Development. Recognising the success and the importance of the project, the Belgian Cooperation for Development provided the means for the continuation of the initiative between 2008 and 2010 by making available funding covering 80% of the costs of the project activities. The remaining funding was ensured by Total Petrochemicals, one of the world's leading petrochemicals companies. The diffusion phase of the initiative lasted from 2008 to 2010. The table below shows the budget for the year 2008.

        "225 During the second project phase UDD was using the international funds to support the operation of the three recycling chains. Because of the external funding, the traders could pay a higher price to the collectors as re-compensation for the amount and the quality of the collected plastic. The full operation of the three recycling chains has a potential to process 18 tons of plastic waste collected in the streets of Kinshasa on a monthly basis. The three chains incorporate 24 companies and have a potential to create 54 direct jobs, Moreover, in case of full operation they can additionally provide a supplementary income to about 450 collectors. After project termination, two of the three production lines ceased operations and the higher price for the collected plastic waste could no longer be sustained subsidised. Nevertheless one recycling line still runs in Kimbanseke district even without project funding. Approximately 120 waste collectors, who are providing 200-500 kg of waste on a weekly basis for the remaining production chain, are being paid on the average 100 Congolese francs per kilogram. This provides a collector an income of approximately USD 4.1 per month. This amount means a supplementary income for the collectors, coming from the poorest segment of the urban population. 5.10.3.4 Training and capacity building During the first project phase, ISF was providing training for the employees of Umoja D\u00e9veloppement Durable and for the operators of the pilot recycling chain. The training contained technical and managerial guidance. In the second project phase it was UDD, that provided the training for the operators of the recycling plants. ISF was mainly caring responsibilities and managing the project. It primarily had to deal with economic issues. The traders of plastic waste were also trained: they were primarily informed on the quality and the type of the plastic that can be accepted from the collectors. From the time that the initiative was launched, several promotional and educational campaigns were run by ISF to raise the awareness of the inhabitants of the targeted districts of the capital and also to encourage potential collectors and entrepreneurs to engage themselves in the activities. 5.10.4 Analysis: results, drivers and obstacles 5.10.4.1 Results As a result of the initiative, three recycling chains were set up in Kinshasa. One of them is still operating in Kimbanseke following the project closure in 2010. Three larger trading houses operate in Kimbanseke district and one in Lemba supplying the Kimbanseke plant with plastic waste material. At present the collection and treatment of 200-500 kg plastic waste/week provides a revenue that covers only the costs of the operation (including the costs of the maintenance of the machinery and the purchase of the plastic waste) at the only remaining recycling chain. At current production rates approximately 20 tonnes of plastic is recycled in Kinshasa on an annual basis. ISF has elaborated a technological manual for setting up a processing chain similar to those of Kinshasa. The manual is going through all the steps of developing a plastic recycling unit and also provides detailed information on the parts of the machinery. It was going to be published early summer 2012. A business plan for setting up recycling ",
        "226 operations in developing countries is also being elaborated and is planned to be published at the end of 2012. The main barrier to self-sustainability turned out to be the frequent electricity break- downs in Kimbanseke district of Kinshasa. Because of the repeated electricity failures, the operators of the plants are forced to continue only with the activities that do not require electricity and suspend all the others. However the plastic industry cannot afford to wait in its production process. Consequently it is difficult for the operators to secure contracts with the plastic industry. With the financial crisis, the price of raw material for plastic production dropped substantially from October 2008, presenting another significant barrier to the operation. This decrease has also affected the price of the recycled materials, which fell from USD 1.000/tonne to USD 500/tonne. At this price, the costs of collection and processing cannot always be covered. This caused a decrease in the production level, as the entrepreneurs could no longer cover their non-subsidized costs and consequently payments for collected plastic bags had to be cut. In another large city of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Lubumbashi, ISF has initiated the operation of another plastic recycling chain. Here, financially viable operations can be ensured even despite the fluctuating price of the raw material for plastic production, because there are no failures in the electricity supply. Evidence of the Kinshasa and Lubumbashi cases shows that external funding is needed for the establishment and the starting up of the operation of a plastic recycling production line in the DRC. However, following start up, the self-sustainability of the operation can be ensured in case of uninterrupted electricity supply. On the basis of the experiences and the successful business cases in the DRC, ISF is already actively diffusing the technology in other developing countries. The Belgian non- governmental organization has initiated similar activities in Burkina Faso and Madagascar. Similarly, in Sri Lanka ISF is engaged in providing consulting services to support the establishment of a local plastic waste recycling chain. 5.10.4.2 Drivers for success The following factors were identified as crucial to the success of the diffusion of the plastic recycling technology: Cultural drivers and meeting a need: \uf0b7 Meeting an actual need : The initiative provides a solution to an acute problem contributing to sanitation, socio-economic development and preventing the contamination of the environment. \uf0b7 Appropriate technology : The technological solution is adapted to the local needs. It is a low-cost technology (see 1.3 above), which is imperative for a country like the DRC that is among the poorest countries in the world. It is also adequately simple, the maintenance of the machinery is not complicated, and the training of the operators is straightforward. The technology was designed for small local chains that can be operated by local entrepreneurs. Financial and economic drivers: \uf0b7 Revenues for neighbourhood inhabitants : The initiative provides income to the citizens in the neighbourhood of the processing plants, who are involved in the collection of plastic bags. This is particularly vital in a city where the vast majority of the active population is struggling to find a stable job. ",
        "227 \uf0b7 Development of the private sector : The operation of the plastic recycling chains contributes to the development of the private sector, as local entrepreneurs are engaged in the activities. \uf0b7 Effective use of funding : The programme was designed in such a way that financial resources have reached the target group directly. Mostly the training activities, the initial investments and the start-up of the operation were financed. This allows for a self-sustaining operation of the recycling chains. Technical drivers: \uf0b7 Demand for cheaper recycled plastic : ISF has recognised that the cheaper price for the processed plastic waste compared to that of the virgin raw material creates an increased demand for the products of the plastic recycling chain. Policy and institutional drivers: \uf0b7 Institutional support : The government of the DRC provided a site for the operation following the termination of the second project. This was important because the local entrepreneurs could not afford the rental fee of the former site in the absence of project funding. Promotion and awareness building: \uf0b7 Dedicated promotion campaigns : Promotional campaigns were essential to make the activity known in the targeted districts of Kinshasa. From the onset of the initiative several promotional and educational campaigns were run by ISF to raise the awareness of the citizens and the stakeholders. 5.10.4.3 Barriers The following barriers were hindering the implementation of the plastic recycling initiative in Kinshasa: Cultural barriers: \uf0b7 Lack of entrepreneurial motivation : Only 2% of the active population has a stable job in Kinshasa. As a legacy of the long years of civil war, the citizens of the DRC have lost their self- confidence necessary for starting up and managing businesses. Financial and economic barriers: \uf0b7 High investment costs : The investment costs necessary for setting up recycling plants, despite adopting the simplest possible technology, are still relatively high considering the economic conditions in the DRC. External funding from developed countries is needed for starting up the operations. \uf0b7 High dependency on subsidies : UDD came into existence with the launch of the first project in 2005. With the closure of the second project in 2010, UDD ceased to exist as a consequence of the withdrawal of external funding. At the same time this highlights the inability to generate cash flow to cover operational costs. \uf0b7 Fluctuation of market prices : The decreasing price of raw materials for plastic production diminished the demand for recycled plastic waste on the market. Technical barriers: \uf0b7 Electricity breakdowns : One of the most trivial barriers to the lucrative operation of the recycling plants are the regular electricity breakdowns in the district of Kimbanseke where the recycling ",
        "228 chain is operating. These frequent breakdowns can last for several days jeopardizing the security of supply for the plastic industry using recycling material. As a consequence, recycled plastic becomes less interesting for the clients in terms of price and risk premium compared to virgin plastic. Especially when the price of virgin plastic declines this additional risk plays a crucial role in the demand for recycled plastic. Institutional barriers: \uf0b7 Absence of regulations in general : As a consequence of the long years of war and the fragile governmental structure some of the most basic legislations are missing. For instance for the start- up and the management of an industrial plant in Kinshasa the necessary legislation is lacking. The role of UDD was essential in the management of the project as only a local organisation was capable of managing the administrative requirements of the projects. \uf0b7 Other governmental priorities : Support of waste management and treatment is not among the first priorities of the government. The provision of medicines, education and access to water and energy are the main concerns of the state in the DRC. Social barriers: \uf0b7 Low level of education. As a consequence of the turbulent recent history of the country, a low level of education hampered effective project implementation. \uf0b7 Lack of skilled labour force : Related to the low level of education, the lack of skilled labour force, which is also a result of the war, made it difficult to set up the small businesses for the recycling chain. \uf0b7 Poverty : General poverty in the country inhibits the rapid diffusion even of ISF\u2019s low-cost technology, hindering particularly the start-up phase as local entrepreneurs lack the necessary capital for the establishment of the plants. \uf0b7 Corruption : DRC is among the twenty most corrupt countries according to the Corruption Perception Index (Transparency International, 2011). External barriers: \uf0b7 Insecurity : There are still armed conflicts in the DRC frequently, particularly in the eastern territories of the country. The insecurity was hindering the smooth operation of the initiative. 5.10.5 Lessons learned \uf0b7 Simple solutions are necessary for the successful adoption of an environmental technology in a developing country with a particularly weak economy. The manufacture, operation and maintenance of the machinery and the necessary tools should match the local market conditions. \uf0b7 The technology has to be adapted to the local market and infrastructural conditions. Similarly, the operation of the technology needs to be adapted to the local policy and institutional context. \uf0b7 External funding is needed for starting up of the operation . Investment costs are necessary for setting up recycling plants. In spit of adopting the simplest possible technology, these costs are still relatively high for local entrepreneurs in a developing country market. External funding from developed countries is necessary. ",
        "229 \uf0b7 The business model has to be resilient in order to be able to withstand to a certain extent fluctuating market prices. \uf0b7 Enabling local businesses is vital for achieving self-sustaining operations combined with local socio-economic benefits. Training is important in empowering local entrepreneurs. But also providing the necessary legal environment for setting up and managing companies is crucial in this respect. \uf0b7 Active cooperation with local organisations is necessary: Local organisations have more experience with the local administrative and market conditions. \uf0b7 Trivial technological barriers can hinder the overall success of the initiative. Such trivial barriers as frequent electricity breakdowns or the lack of transformers can seriously inhibit operation of even a simple technology. \uf0b7 A lot of time is needed for up-scaling the technology. Several years of testing, pilot implementation and local diffusion are necessary before activities aiming at up- scaling the technology to different country settings can be considered. 5.10.6 Implications for future policy making Joint assessments of governance and capacity . In countries with a recent history of conflict donors need to conduct joint assessments of governance and capacity before they provide external funding. They should examine the causes of conflict, fragility and insecurity. In this process they should engage developing country authorities and other relevant stakeholders to the maximum extent possible. The solutions need to be adapted to environments of weak ownership and capacity. Long-term funding modalities are needed for the broad diffusion of environmental technologies. Each of the subsequent phases of technology diffusion, such as the calibration and testing of the technology, the pilot implementation and the local diffusion take substantial time and also require external financing, particularly in countries in situation of fragility and particularly weak economic performance. Following successful local diffusion, the up-scaling activities might also require additional funding as various regional conditions might call for new solutions in other countries. Lasting partnerships with local organisations are vital for successful technology transfer. The role of local organisations in the management of the projects is indispensable particularly in regions with fragile governmental structure. Local organisations have a good \u2018know-how\u2019 of the local conditions and are capable of tackling the specific administrative requirements of the projects. They are also aware of the local market-related barriers and the possible solutions to overcome these barriers. Supporting the use of local energy sources . Combining the plastic reycling technology with the application of local energy sources could secure operations, eliminating one of the most significant technology barriers in Kinshasa: the regular electricity breakdowns. The application of solar energy would be appropriate for the local conditions. Maintaining aid for funding for investment in the up-scaling phase . Potential target countries for the up-scaling of the technology have weak economies, similar to that of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As the investment costs necessary for setting up plastic recycling plants are typically high (even in case of the simplest possible technology), availability of external funding mechanisms are necessary for starting the up-scaling phase of technology transfer. Periodic monitoring of the status of the technology transfer is imperative in order to align the funding scheme with the changing local market and administrative conditions; ",
        "230 and also with the diverse requirements originating from the subsequent phases of the technology diffusion. 5.10.7 References for the case Plastic recycling in Kinshasa Katsongo, K., 2005.

The total generated WEEE, including quantities that escape the established collection and recovery organizations is estimated at 9 million ton. It is estimated that only 13% of e-Waste is reported to be recycled with or without safety procedures. The rest of e-waste is exported to developing countries where e-waste is routinely disposed on uncontrolled dumpsites, while waste volumes are periodically reduced by setting them on fire, causing a range of toxic substances to be released, heavily contaminating air, soil and water resources. The case study provides an overview of a Material Recovery Facility in Cape Town, South Africa, that was established in 2008 to test the feasibility of an integrated value adding local e-Waste management system. This system is designed to maximize the potential of refurbishment, repair, re-use, dismantling and recycling of equipment, with environmentally responsible disposal as a last resort only. The case study contains a description of the project, financial and performance analysis and conclusions on further opportunities for the technology for up-scaling. Moreover, proper e-waste management experience in other developed countries is presented and the technology is situated in the technology transfer process. In this case study, drivers and barriers for effective operations of the recovery facility are revealed. These drivers and barriers provide the basis for future policy making recommendations on both national and international level. The final analysis indicated the crucial points for establishment of an effective e-waste management system. First of all, financial issues are of importance: to ensure a sufficient support for environmentally sound management of e-waste a producer compliance scheme should be introduced. Another significant issue is lack of proper national legislation dedicated to e-waste management and failure in its harmonization with international legislation. In addition, it should be noted that legal e-waste management systems should closely cooperate with the informal sector of e-waste recycling. Conditions for cooperation should subsequently be involved it into the legal framework. 5.11.2 Context, selection, the project description, goals and ambitions 5.11.2.1 The problem definition Rapid changes in technology, changes in media and falling prices have resulted in a fast- growing residue of electronic waste around the globe. The amounts are also affected by planned obsolescence and a product design with a limited useful life. These are commercial practices to increase demand for electronic production. Waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE or e-waste) is increasing three times faster than all other types of domestic waste. According to the European Commission, the total officially reported WEEE collection in Europe is estimated at 3 million metric ton annually. The total generated WEEE, including quantities that escape the established collection and recovery organizations is estimated at 9 million ton. 102 Similar estimates were provided by the United Nations University which indicate that current e-waste generated across the twenty-seven members of the European Union amount to around 8.3 \u2013 9.1 million tons per year; global e-waste volume is estimated to 102 http://www.eera-recyclers.com/sites/default/files/EERA%20prospectus%20for%20membership_1.pdf ",
        "232 be around 40 million tons per year. 103 Currently, only 13% of e-Waste is reported to be recycled with or without safety procedures (according to Basel Convention 104 ). The difference in access to information and communication technologies (ICT) between developed and developing countries is commonly referred to as the \u201cdigital divide\u201d. Africa has been undergoing rapid ICT transformation in recent years, attempting to bridge this divide by importing second-hand or used computers, mobile phones, and TV sets from developed countries. It is unclear how much of the imported used EEE functioned for a reasonable time after it was sold. This so called \u201cnear-end-of-life\u201d equipment can be a major source of e-waste which was imported into African countries as equipment but turned into waste in a relatively short time. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal (Basel Convention) is an international treaty that was designed to reduce the movements of hazardous waste between nations, and specifically to prevent the transfer of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries. The Convention states that illegal hazardous waste traffic is criminal but at the same time contains no enforcement provisions. Nevertheless, a flow of e-waste to developing countries exists, mostly conducted as export of used products. Exports of new and used products are not separately reported 105 , which makes it difficult to evaluate the volume of potential e-waste. Some estimates assume that over 10% of all custom declared electronic exports are either used EEE or WEEE. Moreover, the developing countries also generate e-waste by themselves. The estimates 106 of the quantity of e-waste that is generated by developing countries in metric tons/year is presented in Table 16. 103 Huisman J. et al. 2008 Review of Directive 2002/96 on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE).

While in some countries these activities are performed by individuals with a low material throughput, other countries have an organized informal sector with medium to high volumes of processed materials (e.g. steel, aluminum and copper). 107 In many African countries e-waste is routinely disposed on uncontrolled dumpsites, where waste volumes are periodically reduced by setting them on fire, causing a range of toxic substances to be released, heavily contaminating air, soil and water resources. Even unburned, many e-waste fractions will soon release major pollutants due to the tropical climate, damaging human and environmental health. Tests show extremely high levels of pollution due to e-waste. Tests at a school beside an informal electronic waste salvage site in Ghana\u2019s capital Accra reveal contamination due to lead, cadmium and other health-threatening pollutants over 50 times higher than risk- free levels 108 . The e-waste management problem is rather urgent in South Africa. ITA Industry Waste Management Plan 109 estimates that between 1,129,000 and 2,108,000 tons of accumulated e-waste is already situated in South African households, and that on an annual basis nearly 84,000 tons is generated. At the same time the WEEE recycling sector in South Africa is incapable to deal with this amount of e-waste, so all the negative impacts on human health and environment described above take place. 107 http://www.basel.int/Portals/4/Basel%20Convention/docs/pub/WhereAreWeeInAfrica_ExecSummary_en.pdf 108 According to United Nations University (Institute for Sustainability and Peace), 2011 (http://isp.unu.edu/news/2011/tests-detail-high- toxic-levels-at-school.html#null) 109 http://dynamicreflections.co.za/ita/ITA_IWMP.pdf ",
        "234 In general, Africa is lacking the infrastructure for e-waste recycling. Only South Africa has managed to take steps in developing an e-waste recycling industry over the recent years. Figure 66: E-waste adjacent to the lagoon at Agbogbloshie, Accra Source: \u00d6ko-Institut 2010 5.11.2.2 The project description The project under consideration is a part of the \u201cE-Waste Management in Africa\u201d project, launched in 2007. As a component of Hewlett Packard\u2019s international Extended Producer Responsibility, the project \u201cE-Waste Management in Africa\u201d started in 2007 in cooperation with the Global Digital Solidarity Fund (DSF) and the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research (Empa). This project is investigating the e-Waste situation in various African Countries, including South Africa. A pilot project in Cape Town, South Africa started in February 2008, supporting the start-up of a low tech/labor intensive material dismantling and recovery facility (MRF) for the pre- processing of e-waste. When choosing a place for a pilot material recovery facility, stakeholders (hp, Empa, DSF) took into consideration countries where following conditions could be met 110 : \uf0b7 A problem with e-waste recycling exists; \uf0b7 A special regulation of e-waste or framework legislation or at least an awareness of necessity of such legislation can be observed; \uf0b7 Some recycling activities were held and as a consequence a need of a middle- scale facility was recognized; \uf0b7 Empa, one of the stakeholders, was going to establish an educational center in the place to conduct practice studies for students from EU, so the place had to be suitable for the purposes. In the beginning of the research three countries were examined: China, India and South Africa. Other African countries were not considered since there was no activity concerning e-waste management. China and India were not chosen due to a negative role of the informal recycling sector there. At the same time in Cape Town (South Africa) a strong support of a local government was provided: it was quite proactive, some dismantling 110 Telephone Interview with Sussanne Dittke, 3 May 2012 ",
        "235 activities already existed in the city and there was a pool of companies which could participate in the pilot project establishment (for example, as downstream recyclers). First small-scale e-waste collection and dismantling activities in South Africa were already initiated in 2004 by various NGOs and private individuals. It became evident that the demand for such services exceeded the operational capacities of these small-scale activities by far. The need for a regional, medium-scale dismantling facility was therefore identified, in order to be able to process larger volumes and a wider range of e-waste materials. \u201cThe aim was to test the feasibility of an integrated value adding local e-Waste management system, designed to maximize the potential of refurbishment, repair, re-use, dismantling and recycling of equipment, with environmentally responsible disposal as a last resort only .\u201c 111 Thus the project had to fulfill the following objectives: \uf0b7 Redirection of material flows from uncontrolled informal to formal operations; \uf0b7 Detoxification of processed items, by removing toxic components and material streams, and safe disposal thereof; \uf0b7 Guaranteed occupational health and safety measures for workers in alignment with accepted international and HP standards; \uf0b7 Creation of jobs, skills transfer, capacity building and encouragement of small/medium enterprise business opportunities to promote \u201cblack economic empowerment\u201d; \uf0b7 Creation of added value through collaboration with local business and NGO partners and government initiatives including Waste2Art projects, educational centers, etc. \uf0b7 Generation of data including base-lining, monitoring and regular evaluation of progress made for the future replication of the pilot model; \uf0b7 Compliance with the relevant international, national, provincial and local municipal laws and policies; \uf0b7 Findings should contribute to the development of a viable national e-waste management system. From the onset of the e-waste project, it was decided to limit activities to the collection, testing, refurbishment and manual disassembly of electronic equipment, in order to maximize the value of recovered materials. Any physical shredding or mechanical granulation processes, which could lead to the creation of a hazardous working environment, were excluded. The Materials Recovery Facility was divided in three distinctive working areas, namely testing/refurbishing, dismantling and waste to art production sections. The total covered area of the e-waste MRF was about 300 m2. The number of regular staff was estimated at 20-22 people. Also, it was planned that the plant will be able to process about 100- 150 tons of e-waste annually. This pilot project aimed to explore how additional local jobs can be created in a formal environment, while making the recycling of electronic equipment safer and developing a blueprint for a sustainable e-waste management system in African countries, in collaboration with existing local recycling projects. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 111 M. Schluep, S. Dittke, G. Newson, C. Kane, K. Hieronymi, \u201cA Material Recovery Facility in Cape Town, South Africa, as a replicable concept for sustainable e-waste management and recycling in developing countries\u201d, 2008 ",
        "236 were established for the project. KPIs were set in each of the distinctive key activity areas of the MRF, which are: \uf0b7 Collection and sorting of e-waste; \uf0b7 Testing and refurbishment of suitable equipment; \uf0b7 Dismantling and stripping of the non-refurbishable e-waste portion; \uf0b7 Manufacturing of \u201cwaste to art\u201d products from suitable and non-toxic e-waste components; \uf0b7 Educational and awareness creation activities. KPIs were mainly structured into three areas to cover volumetric, economic, social and environmental indicators, as well as health & safety indications. These KPIs were used for the internal monitoring of the facility\u2019s performance and for reporting to HP and EMPA. 5.11.2.3 Project relevance for study Schluep 112 (2009) notes that within the relevant literature on environmental problems the terms \u201ctechnique\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d are often used synonymously. However, he highlights that within the e-waste discussion \u201ctechnique\u201d refers to methods of creating new tools, establishing products of tools and the capacity for constructing such artifacts. In contrast, the definition of \u201ctechnology\u201d implies the know-how required to develop and apply techniques and technical procedures. So, technologies are not only technical installations, but also skills, processes and combinations thereof. This case provides a good example of the importance of organizational aspects. In the report \u201cSocio-economic assessment and feasibility study on sustainable e-waste management in Ghana\u201d 113 , a study was made on opportunities to improve the recovery performance in developing countries by introducing a well-organized recycling chain. An example for an average desktop computer (without monitor and peripherals) is shown in Table 17 .

        "237 With the best applicable recycling technologies, a very large share of steel and aluminum can be recovered. These figures are based on the assumption that a thorough manual disassembling and sorting is able to recover 95% of the steel and 88% of aluminum of massive components like cases, frames and large heat-sinks. For printed wiring boards it is estimated that only large aluminum parts (heat sinks) are removed prior to refining. Unlike in the presently applied recycling technologies, smaller aluminum parts are not removed in order not to damage the integrated circuits components and to prevent precious metals losses. As aluminum is not recovered in the subsequent processes (copper and precious metals refining), this leads to approximately 10% aluminum-losses. Nevertheless, it is rather important to indicate that the best applicable technology in many cases is not the best available technology. When implementing a MRF in developing countries it is necessary to adjust technologies to local conditions. This may influence much of the facility\u2019s design. For example, in developing countries low-cost low- skilled workforce are widely available. Therefore, all the dismantling procedures should be run manually rather than by means of machinery. This helps to mitigate start-up costs. It can also be more effective when dealing with a stream of non-similar equipment for recovery. The trade-off between the best applicable technology and best available technology is also affected by the financial performance. For example, during the pilot project in Cape Town it was observed that the typical PC power supply incorporates an unclean circuit board, a fan, some wiring and a light steel casing. The time required to dismantle it could easily be 15 minutes, for just a few cents increase in raw material value. Given an average labor cost, it turned out to be more cost effective to remove any external wiring and classify it as light steel. Also, some recycling technologies are not present in developing countries due to high costs and complexity of servicing. For example, in Africa recycling technologies are unavailable for ABS plastics, Chargeable and Non Chargeable batteries (excl. lead acid type), CRT tubes, CFC extraction and treatment of fridges and printer cartridges. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors are also likely to present a challenge in the future, because the technology for environmentally sound recycling doesn\u2019t exist at the moment. Anyway, while lack of technologies can be overcome by exporting these materials to capable recyclers, material recovery facilities are necessary for decreasing negative impacts on environment and human health. This is achievable in two ways. First of all, efficient materials recovery helps to avoid environmentally unfriendly practices like uncontrolled landfilling, melting or burning operations. Results of the Greenpeace studies in Accra and Koforidua (Ghana) 114 near informal burning sites confirmed the presence of \" numerous toxic and persistent organic chemical pollutants, as well as very high levels of many toxic metals, the majority of which are either known to be used in electronic devices, or are likely to be formed during the open burning of materials used in such devices \u201d. The concentrations of copper, lead, zinc and tin were found to be over one hundred times typical background levels. It is known that children, due to their hand-to-mouth behavior, are one of the most vulnerable groups in areas where soils and dusts are contaminated with lead. For instance, deaths of 18 children between November 2007 and March 2008 due to mass lead intoxication from informal lead-acid battery recycling in Senegal, was attributed to inhalation and ingestion of soil and dust contaminated with lead. Homes and soils in surrounding areas of lead-acid recycling activities were found to be heavily contaminated with lead. Similarly, negative health impacts of flame retardants, such as PBDEs, could also occur. This could be caused not only through direct exposure, but also through food contamination. For example, in China high levels of PBDEs have been reported in the blood of local residents around e-waste recycling activities. PBDEs are known to cause 114 S. Prakash, A. Manhart \u201cSocio-economic assessment and feasibility study on sustainable e-waste management in Ghana\u201d, August 2010 http://www.basel.int/Portals/4/Basel%20Convention/docs/eWaste/E-waste_Africa_Project_Ghana.pdf ",
        "238 abnormal brain development in animals, endocrine disruptive properties and anomalies in the immune system. Secondly, materials recycling facilities can contribute to decreasing the CO2 emissions via secondary material production. Primary production, i.e. mining, concentrating, smelting and refining, especially of precious and special metals has a significant carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) impact due to the low concentration of these metals in the ores and often difficult mining conditions. \u201cMining\u201d old computers to recover the contained metals \u2013 if done in an environmentally sound or correct manner \u2013 needs only a fraction of energy compared to mining ores in nature. Some examples 115 of primary and secondary production\u2019s global warming potentials are presented in Table 18. An environmentally sound recycling of refrigerators, air-conditioners and similar equipment is also significant in mitigating the climate change impact at end-of-life. The ozone depleting substances in these devices have a very high global warming potential and effective recycling ensures that these substances are not released into the environment. Table 18: Examples of global warming potential during primary and secondary production for some materials.

Prakash, A. Manhart \u201cSocio-economic assessment and feasibility study on sustainable e- waste management in Ghana\u201d Moreover, the value of the elements in e-waste can be high: 100,000 cell phones, for example, contain an estimated 2.4 kg (or $130,000 worth) of gold, more than 900 kg (or $100,000 worth) of copper, and 25 kg (or $27,300 worth) of silver \u2013 more than $250,000 if all was recovered. 116 But it should be noted that income generated by recovered materials depends on prices for these material which can vary every day. It should also be noted that the WEEE contains considerable quantities of critical metals and other elements that may soon be in short supply. The shortage of these elements threatens to drive up the cost of products ranging from flat-screen TVs and mobile phones to electric cars and wind turbines. 117 A booming demand for precious and special metals is expected: according to different estimations demand for critical metals is expected to grow between 20 and 50% by 2020 118 . This growth is linked to increasing functionality of the products and the specific metal properties needed to achieve these. For example, electronics make up for almost 80% of the world\u2019s demand of indium (transparent conductive layers in LCD glass), over 80% of ruthenium (magnetic properties in hard disks (HD)) and 50% of antimony (flame retardants). Some metal price increases, which are observed over the last years are directly connected to the developments in the electronic industry. The monetary value of the annual use of important \u201celectrical and electronic equipment metals\u201d represents USD 115 S. Prakash, A.

        "239 45.4 billion at 2007 price levels. Due to supply risks, such as regional concentration of mining (a 90% share of global mining is concentrated in three countries), physical scarcity, temporary scarcity and others, recycling of essential materials is highly important. At this moment in South Africa there is a lack of technologies available for refining such metals. But it also fails in gathering e-scrap, containing precious metals, in an appropriate way to deliver it to capable recyclers in developed countries. This case study presents the technology to recover materials from e-waste without affecting environment or human health in a way that involves particular safety regulations.. Moreover, the technology use can be beneficial in terms of attaining precious metals. Taking into account forecasts for e-waste volumes in following years, it is essential to replicate such facilities especially in developing countries. 5.11.2.4 Other developing countries\u2019 experience in e-waste management India is considered to be one of the biggest dumps for the WEEE in the world. The Times of India (Apr. 4, 2012) announced that an additional 50 000 tons of e-waste is imported from developed countries. According to the Environmental Ministry of India (2011) the country is likely to generate about 800,000 tons of e-waste in 2012. In spite of these facts, Skinner et al. 119 report that during a study in 2009 a variety of stakeholders indicated the general lack of e-waste available for recycling purposes for formal recyclers. These recyclers have all the necessary licenses and ensure an environmentally sound management of e-waste. As an example, an overview of the E-Parisaraa facility was provided. E-Parisaraa is India\u2019s first Government authorized electronic waste recycler, engaged in handling, recycling and reuse of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment in an eco-friendly way. It started operations in September 2005. At the time of the survey, the E-Parisaraa facility was able to treat 10 tons of e-waste every day, yet it was supplied only 3 tons per day. In developing and emerging economies the WEEE is often considered to have its own value. Thus, citizens in India are not only unwilling to pay for e-waste disposal, but often expect a reward for it. For instance, if governmental bodies or manufacturers need to dispose their end-of-life EEE, they arrange an auction for it. Taking into consideration that there is no requirement for collectors to have a certificate ensuring an environmental sound management of the e-waste, only price matters and the highest bid wins. Thus, it is not surprising that 95% to 97% of estimated 120 volume of e-waste collected in India funnels into the informal sector, where it is recycled under unacceptable terms both for health and environment. In contrast to the toxicity effects, the informal recycling sector\u2019s social performance is hardly worse than that in the formal sector. The formal workers and collectors earn roughly the same, while the informal workers may earn even more. (Skinner et al., 2010) The recovery rates for formal and informal sectors are roughly comparable, but other economic forces act as a barrier to formal recycling. Recycling of the plastic in e-waste faces some difficulties because of the range of fire- suppressant and heat-resistant chemicals added to the product. While physically possible, environmentally sound recycling of plastic is not yet economically efficient. In the report by Skinner (Skinner et al., 2010) the following conclusion was made: at present metal concentrations, the informal sector will be more efficient (strictly economically speaking) and the formal sector will remain inactive, because market prices for the materials do not allow to cover all the costs of environmentally sound recovery. However, market prices 119 A. Skinner, A. Lloyd, Y. Dinter, P. Strothmann \u201cDoes the Basel Ban form an effective and sustainable means of addressing the health and environmental problems caused by export of e-waste from developed countries to developing nations and countries in transition?\u201d Free University of Berlin, April 2010 120 The Times of India (Apr. 4, 2012) http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2071920,00.html ",
        "240 are favorable for cherry-picking. Unburdened by environmental legislation, the informal sector is able to employ gold recovery techniques that are more efficient than the basic techniques employed by formal recyclers. Significant operating costs (licenses, taxes, use of environmentally sound technology) prevent the formal sector from being more efficient. The current economic and legislative practices prevent formal recyclers from becoming more active. As long as circumstances exist that allow the informal sector to purchase e- waste at prices above those that formal recyclers can pay, the illegal waste shipments and informal waste processing in India will continue to occur. In addition, it is worth to mention the key role of environmental awareness. Many studies show that the people of developing countries are largely unaware of the damage to health and environment that informal recycling entails. Informal waste recycling is often carried out by poor and marginalized social groups who are struggling to earn money to survive. It is reported that up to 2% of the population in Asian and Latin American cities depend on waste picking to earn their living. 121 Thus, environmental concerns rank low on these people\u2019s personal agenda, which is understandable in the context of poverty. (A. Skinner et al., 2010) But environmental unawareness is true also for the general public. Most manufacturers ship their products without any information about proper disposal after their end-of-life. Gerry Newson and Susanne Dittke (in the Final Report on the Establishment of a Cape town Based Processing Facility for Electrical and Electronic Equipment) noted that very little e-waste was received in the form of small domestic appliances such as kettles, toasters and hair dryers, even though they are all prone to early failure. This suggests, and has been confirmed by subsequent discussions with members of the public during the pilot project in Cape Town, that people are conscious of the need to dispose of large equipment. But when it comes to less bulky items, they consign it to the regular household waste without a second thought. X. Chi, M. Streiche-Porte, M.Y.L. Wang, M.A. Reuter (in an article \u201cInformal electronic waste recycling: a sector review with special focus on China\u201d) suggest the following reasons for the low e-waste management activity and the existence of informal recycling activities in developing countries: \uf0b7 unwillingness of consumers to return and pay for disposal of their old EEEs; \uf0b7 no coordination at higher level on imports of e-waste as second-hand devices; \uf0b7 lack of awareness among consumers, collectors and recyclers of the potential hazards of e-waste; \uf0b7 lack of funds and investment to finance improvements in e-waste recycling; \uf0b7 absence of recycling infrastructure or appropriate management of e-waste; \uf0b7 absence of effective take-back programs for end-of-life EEE; \uf0b7 lack of interest/incentive in e-waste management by multinational IT companies; \uf0b7 absence and/or lax implementation of e-waste specific legislation. The authors mentioned four national pilot projects in China (Hangzhou Dadi, Beijing Huaxing, Qingdao Haier and Tianjin Datong) launched sequentially since 2004 in order to gain practical experiences in collection network design, e-waste management standards and regulations and recycling technologies. These government pilot projects have not, as yet, seen any successes, being unable to compete with the informal sector, most notably in collecting e-waste and in covering the costs of environmentally sound processing. Taking Hangzhou Dadi as an example, despite having 36 collection points and a 121 X. Chi, M. Streiche-Porte, M.Y.L.

        "241 treatment plant of 7000 tons annual capacity, it had just received 133 tons of e-waste and 1325 units of discarded home appliances between January 2005 and March 2006. It had only dismantled 92 tons and recovered 59 tons of steel, copper and plastics. Informal collection is one of the main reasons for supply problems in the formal sector. In contrast to informal collectors, formal collectors are not able to collect e-waste at low prices using a household network that offers door-to-door collection services. Also, formal recyclers can hardly afford competitive prices for old EEEs since they have to bear significant treatment costs due to technology requirements that prevent soil contamination and harm to human health. The low profitability of formal recyclers limits their financial ability to compete with informal recyclers. In addition, informal recyclers have the same access to a steady downstream demand as their formal counterparts. For instance, products from informal recycling sites in Guiyu are regularly sold to big electronics centers in neighboring cities such as Shenzhen. Iron, copper and aluminum fractions separated from computers are supplied to metal refineries, often via waste brokers as intermediates Shredded plastics are locally recycled to low or medium grade and offered to toy manufacturers in the nearby Shantou city \u2013 often at price 1/3 cheaper than original plastics. 5.11.2.5 Technology transfer stage The MRF established in Cape Town has been the first fully integrated facility which included collection, refurbishing, dismantling and waste-based-production under one roof. Until that time the individual e-waste recycling initiatives focused on particular parts of this process. Such integration was achieved by putting together a group of partner entities, each responsible for a particular part of the process. As it was mentioned above, in some other countries (developing countries and emerging economies) similar pilot recovery facilities were established. In line with the Material Recovery Facility project in South Africa different activities connected to e-waste management took place in Africa. Assessment studies on the e- waste problem were conducted in Morocco, Senegal, Benin, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. As of this moment, the e-waste recycling initiatives are still in the stage of being active in particular geographic or operational niches. Empa is one of the main stakeholders of the project and previously initiated different activities connected to e-waste management in South Africa. Empa is not active in South Africa any more, but it gave a good impulse. The former members are still active even though the facility was split up. The key partners of the project are now partners in an E- Waste Alliance initiative. They organize monthly meetings, mostly for education, as a think tank, in an advisory way and for donation of refurbished equipment. E-Waste Alliance now works to expand its membership; different companies from different specializations join the organization. Such a diversification is desirable for many reasons, including a larger access to e-waste sources. Companies that provide environmentally sound e-waste management also exist at the moment in Johannesburg and Durban, but exactly the same facilities do not exist since companies prefer to specialize in one particular activity. At the moment we can define the case to be a niche implemented by a few early adopters, as no significant broadening and framework change took place. But it can be said that experience obtained up to this moment is crucial for subsequent up-scaling. Therefore the position in the technology transfer stage is \u201cdevelopment\u201d, close to the diffusion stage. ",

        "245 Initially, it was planned that the facility would be able to treat 100-150t of e-waste annually. However, the actual volume treated during the 9 months project period (taking February as a set-up stage) was only 60.9 tons of e-waste; so the planned production level was only performed for 54.1-81.2%. It was noted in the final report that the estimated time to establish a large enough presence to ensure a continuous flow of material would be at least 6 months, but even after this period there was no assurance that material inflow would be sufficient to supply just one permanent staff member. Nevertheless, it should be noted that an organized e-waste management chain was established and all the flows of WEEE were controlled to ensure an environmentally sound management of e-waste. During the operational process, all the necessary conditions to avoid any health damage were established. The most risky activity for health was dismantling. In dismantling monitors, care was taken to release the vacuum in the tube at an early stage to eliminate injury. This way, the staff was not exposed to any hazardous materials inside the monitor. Also the use of protective glasses, gloves and respirator masks was essential for workers. Despite the fact that a good deal of the equipment collected was already partly dismantled, the recovery rate achieved was rather high \u2013 72.4%. But still a lot of waste was landfilled: 24.1% of volume treated, most part of it was hazardous. For example, the CRT tubes were stripped of the copper wiring. Then, they were not dismantled any further but shipped to the special hazardous waste landfills. The main reason for that was that the technology necessary for the safe disposal of the led glass is still way too expensive for implementing it in developing countries. In this situation, as well as in most other situations, further recycling was not possible due to financial constraints. 5.11.3.2 Stakeholders Hewlett Packard Corporation : as a part of the Extended Producer Responsibility Programme, HP started a partnership with the Swiss Federal Institute for Materials Testing Research (EMPA) and the Global Digital Solidarity Fund (DSF) to launch the \u201cE-waste Management in Africa\u201d project in 2007.

The income/cost ratios for particular key activities are: Testing, Repair and Refurbishment: 86%, Dismantling: 47.6%, Waste to Art: 40.4%. The gap between income and expenditures can be partly explained by not working at full-capacity, in particular for dismantling. Some additional analysis can shed light on this issue. The final report provides the data about the monthly staff employment. For dismantling there were following number of workers available (March: 2, April: 2, May: 4, June: 4, July: 5, August: 5, September: 5, October: 5, November: 5, December: 5 (in total 42 man*months)). Given the average of 20 working days a month, 90kg on average which one worker can process (according to the Final Report by G. Newson and S. Dittke, February 2009), the volume the facility needed to perform under full capacity can be estimated: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) So it is estimated that for a full-capacity working the facility needed 75.6t of e- waste for the given period. Taking into consideration that the facility actually treated 60.9t of e-waste, on average the dismantling activity performed at 80% capacity. Subject to 47.6% income/cost ratio it can be said that working at the full-capacity still could not cover the expenditures under the given market price for the material for certain period. But it is worth mentioning that commodity prices of metal do influence the financial sustainability of the section. Figure 68 presents the price index evolution for one of the recovered materials, aluminum, during the period March 2002 to March 2012.

        "250 The significant price decrease during the project time (March \u2013 December 2008) is expected to have had a considerable negative impact on financial performance of the dismantling activity in the MRF. At the same time, Sussane Dittke 126 expressed the fact that even at current price levels the activities are still not viable without additional financing. The indirect costs of the project (project management, protection clothes and other) represent about 36% of total expenditures. At the same time, the initial set-up costs (including site clearance, materials, labor, electrics, transport and maintenance) presented only 9% of total expenditures. The main expense item was labor, but it should be noted that from the outset of the project it was decided to honor the social responsibility by providing a reasonable salary above minimum level for previously unskilled workers. As Table 20 shows, the most expensive material (copper) that generates the highest income per kg make up only less than 1% of the total volume of recovered material. The cheapest materials (steel and plastic) constitute 86.8% of the total volume processed. This can be somewhat explained by the fact that a large part of WEEE collected was partly dismantled and most valuable components were absent. At current commodity prices for metals, it is unlikely that the facility would have made profit or reached the level of financial sustainability. It should also be noted that, in the framework of the project, efforts have been made to increase labor productivity. This goal was not achieved. The facility paid its workers on a performance basis, but these incentives were not enough to stimulate additional gains above the achieved level. The pilot project shows that the intrinsic value of the obsolete appliances does not cover all the expenditures of an environmentally sound management of WEEE. To make such a facility self-sufficient, additional sources are needed. Subsidy financing could be provided through different schemes that are usually distinguished by the stakeholder that is responsible for the e-waste: \uf0b7 The entire society: use general taxes or the government provides land and/or buildings for e-waste recycling facilities, free of charge; \uf0b7 The consumers (\u201cpolluter pays principle\u201d): o Fee on disposal: a fee is paid by the final user at the moment consumer returns end-of-life equipment for recycling; o Advanced recycling fee: a fee is paid by the initial user at the moment that the consumer buys a new appliance; this scheme may be supplemented with a deposit which is refunded at a collection site where consumer returns this appliance in order to intensify incentives for return; \uf0b7 The producers (a part of the extended producer responsibility, it should be noted that although financial flows are ensured by producers, costs are likely to be borne by the consumers): the producers bear costs for a take- back system and recycling. The cost for each producer can be unit-based, weight-based, according to their market share or return share. It is very important to provide financing not only for recycling of currently sold appliances, but also for historical waste. \uf0b7 The importers: in alignment with the above schemes, it can be an important element when importing used EEE. 126 Telephone Interview with Sussanne Dittke, 3 May 2012 ",
        "251 EU Directive 2002/96/EC on WEEE is intended to establish an environmentally sound management of e-waste and to protect human health through the adoption of waste management strategies that focus on recycling and reuse. Since 2005 EU member States\u2019 WEEE laws were enacted implementing extended producer responsibility through which producers are responsible for recycling their end-of- life equipment. According to the Directive, producers may join a collective take back system or draw up an individual management plan. Also, the Directive suggests whether the producer can request a refund from the collective system under certain conditions, if the producer exports appliances for which he has already paid contributions to the national supplier. In developing countries such laws are not established at the moment, which makes it difficult to make profits while recycling e-waste in an environmentally sound way. 5.11.3.4 Training The facility raised awareness and provided training/education to formerly disadvantaged individuals, creating opportunities for entrepreneurship in the technical maintenance, dismantling and waste-to-art project sectors. The project has trained a range of individuals - from immigrants to school leavers - looking to gain hands-on expertise. Most had no experience in the e-waste sector and several used the knowledge they gained to move into permanent employment elsewhere. Also, some school visits were carried out within the training activity. While setting the goals for the project, a privately operated waste recovery and educational center for schools, households and companies was suggested. The ultimate aim was to make a fully-fledged educational resource center for e-waste with a small demonstration site for learners, showing the testing, dismantling and waste to art activities that are practiced on a large scale at the pilot MRF. This initial objective had to be scaled down to mostly providing on the job training for the new-coming workers at the MRF. Footprints (an alliance member that focused on education and awareness) developed a short course aimed at provision of training, specifically related to the handling of e-waste. It had to close its doors in December 2008, because this was the end of the building leasing contract. However, ITA Industry Waste Management Plan 127 points to the significance of raising awareness and recommends introducing an e-waste education as part of primary, secondary and tertiary schooling. It argues that correct e-waste handling, disposal and processing must become part of normal behavior to ensure environmentally sound way of dealing with WEEE. For the moment there appears to be no tertiary institution that is able to provide formal training which draws on the practical experience obtained in a real-life recycling environment; be it eWaste or otherwise. The alliance with the Salesians Institute was an attempt to bridge the gap, and to provide a basic knowledge on IT equipment maintenance and repair for the facility\u2019s technical staff and for others in the community. This facility typically provides IT technical training for previously disadvantaged women, but does extend the program to include men when space is available. Further training is currently under way at Cedara in Natal. There, interns have recently been sent to the MRF in Maitland for preliminary training as part of their EWaste management and educational program. 127 http://dynamicreflections.co.za/ita/ITA_IWMP.pdf ",
        "252 5.11.4 Analysis 5.11.4.1 Results Environmental results. During the period from March to December 2008 (February 2008 is considered to be a set-up stage) there was 60.9t of e-waste treated. The recovery rate is 72.4% (it can even increase to 75.9% if material removed to waste-to-art section is included if it is not landfilled). The rate is quite high compared to the informal sector, but can still be improved by introducing better technologies or implementing a residual transfer to downstream recyclers. Landfilled hazardous waste (22.4%) mostly contains CRT tubes. Mitsubishi Electric in 2011 declared a recycling ratio for CRT TVs to be 91% 128 , PETEC (Panasonic Eco Technology Center) announced a 98% recycling ratio for CRTs. 129 Nevertheless, the Material Recovery Facility contributed to the environment of Cape Town by environmentally sound management of e-waste. Considering a truck capacity of 6t 130 , approximately 10 trucks of e-waste were recycled and disposed without damage to environment or human health. Also, we can estimate the volume of carbon dioxide prevention due to secondary production of materials instead of primary production. Taking the indicative ratios given above, 29.6t of steel recovered prevented producing of 816.7t CO2 during primary mining. In terms of local environmental needs it can be said that the technology meets all the requirements, given to unfavorable normal e-waste management conditions in the country. Stop Awareness and training. The pilot helped to raise awareness and provide training and education to previously disadvantaged individuals, from immigrants to school leavers. Most had no experience of the e-waste sector and several used their experience to gain permanent employment. The project created opportunities for entrepreneurship in the technical maintenance, dismantling and waste-to-art project sectors. Also it had a knock on effect for other enterprises including the manufacture of timber replacement products and building materials such as roof tiles and paving slabs. It was important to show an alternative of e- waste disposal process, which prevents damage to the environment and to human health. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the desired goals were fully achieved. This is partly due to the breakdown of training activities during the project timeline. Social results. The job creation with adequate salaries is one of the biggest strengths of the project. This results from to the fact that it was set up as a labor- intensive, low-tech operation. The project made a difference for a number of people and their families in Cape Town. The project\u2019s community nature motivated staff. From personal meetings 131 with all staff members it was evident that the outlook of each individual was very positive and the personal motivation to overcome any obstacles was high. Refurbishment activity contributes to narrowing digital divide by making electronic equipment more affordable. Some part of refurbished equipment was donated to registered educational and charity organizations making information and communications technologies more accessible. 128 http://www.mitsubishielectric.com/company/environment/report/products/recycle/index.html 129 http://panasonic.net/eco/petec/material/ 130 http://www.empa.ch/plugin/template/empa/*/51484/---/l=2 131 M. Schluep, S. Dittke, G. Newson, C. Kane, K. Hieronymi, \u201cA Material Recovery Facility in Cape Town, South Africa, as a replicable concept for sustainable e-waste management and recycling in developing countries\u201d, 2008 ",
        "253 Financial results. Due to the high fixed and rental costs, the integrated facility did not reach the break-even level given the scale of the materials recycling. At this moment the key participants of the pilot project are still active and manage to remain financially viable by specializing on the individual activities (for example, only collection or only refurbishing). Key activities such as Repair and Refurbishment, Dismantling, Waste to Art have an income potential. However, each of these activities also has particular difficulties in ensuring sufficient income flow to cover its expenditures. Financial sustainability was not achieved in any of the individual business units, but it has laid the ground work from which information can be extracted. Apparently it is more feasible to reach such a level when one organization specializes in one type of activity. So far, financial unsustainability may be considered as one of the main problems for material recovery facilities to be established in developing countries. Additional financing is needed on top of project revenues. Additional funds can be provided under a compliance scheme, probably by producers and importers, as far as consumers in developing countries are unwilling to pay for their end-of-life equipment recycling. Given the large weight of the start-up and the rental expenditures (i.e. paying for using land and buildings), some public support on this side could make a difference. Sustainable blueprint. Jobs can be created while recycling is made safer. The project highlights the main advantages and disadvantages of the facility. This has improved the knowledge on operating such kinds of facilities and enhances further projects\u2019 prospects. The blueprint is already being used as a model for a materials recovery facility in Durban and Johannesburg. 5.11.4.2 Drivers Large stakeholder network (both national and international) Due to a well- diversified partner and stakeholder network, the project managed to obtain additional support on different production chain segments. If necessary, new partnerships were created in order to meet the project\u2019s objectives. International participation (mostly those brought in by HP and EMPA) ensured a sound project management and clear evaluation of the project. Moreover, it attracted additional attention of market players for the project (both upstream and downstream the value chain). International funding. This project has been started with the substantial external financing that covered the start-up costs. This financing was an important condition for the successful start of the pilot. If a similar initiative is to be launched somewhere else, the issue of the start-up capital is very important. Inability to find out necessary financing for the project inside the country can be explained by both lack of awareness and expected financial inefficiency of such a facility. So it appears to be a crucial point for the project to emerge. Local government as a strong supporter of the project It should be noted that the support from local government came mostly in the form of \u201cproviding a positive attitude environment\u201d, i.e. there has been an informal agreement with the local authorities to start up the facility without going through an extensive process of obtaining permits and licenses. In the context of possible expansion of such initiatives this serves clearly as an argument for streamlining the registration procedures for formal e-waste recyclers. Conformity to local needs By the time the project started there was no such facility (a fully integrated value chain for collecting, refurbishing and dismantling e-waste) in South Africa. At the same time the volume of e-waste and the extent of informal recycling has already started to cause problems with environment and ",
        "254 potential damage to human health. So it can be said the project completely met the local needs that helped it to secure support of local government. 5.11.4.3 Barriers Business and Finance Barriers connected to project business design and financing depend on particular activities managed: \uf0b7 Collection and Sorting: o Shortage of e-waste available for recycling purposes; o Not sufficient level of consumer awareness; o Transport costs (in spite of free-of-charge collection of e-waste during the project, these costs are considered to be high enough); o Particularly for white goods it was noted that storage costs and floor space are cost drivers. \uf0b7 Testing, Repair and Refurbishment: o A large part of equipment collected comes partly dismantled; o Some part of equipment that comes from IT repair shops is considered to be hardly refurbishable; o During the given period there was no sound connection to other companies in order to form a joint corporate refurbishment scheme. \uf0b7 Dismantling: o A large part of equipment collected comes partly dismantled without valuable materials inside; o Shortage of e-waste available for recycling purposes; o Absence of opportunities to remove the additional part of dismantled equipment (mostly CRTs) to downstream partners though it can be further recycled; o Absence of a compliance scheme that could provide additional financing to ensure an environmentally sound management of e- waste; o Costs for disposing and transport of hazardous waste are cited as key concerns for large-scale recycling business models; o Commodity markets fail to distinguish between recycled and raw materials, so there is still little incentive to refine such elements. \uf0b7 Waste to Art: o Rather time-costly producing causes rather high prices for the production, so many items could not be sold at initial prices; o Sufficient marketing efforts are needed to promote the production. Economic barriers High level of initial funds needed to run a start-up recovery facility restrains the entrepreneurship activity. With no state help in the form of preferential credits or subsidies it makes impossible to make an initiative without external financing. Also it was found that rental space generates the biggest expenditure. Having a government support in the form by providing free rental space or a strong support in obtaining it at a reasonable price could have made a difference. An environmentally sound management of e-waste causes a low profitability of formal recyclers compared to informal recyclers which are cherry-picking. ",
        "255 Absence of a compliance scheme hinders development of environmentally sound management and up-scaling of material recovery facilities. Moreover, commodity prices volatility (especially in metal prices) causes instability of facilities\u2019 income flows that can be destructive for the recycling sector. As far as prices for primarily mined metals and recycled metals are equal, it could be proper to provide a support for recyclers when commodity prices are in decline. Further barriers are: \uf0b7 Many e-waste recyclers and refurbishers are not yet ISO compliant. While environmental management programmes are in place, challenges exist, including on-site incineration, exposed e-waste and the insufficient containment of potential site run-off; \uf0b7 Lack of enforcement of EHS standards (workers protection, lack of safety equipment and safety information); \uf0b7 Hazardous disposal of e-waste fraction is minimal. Potentially hazardous e- waste is disposed of in landfills. Current legislation The current legislation on e-waste in South Africa is very poor and doesn\u2019t specify the necessary regulation of WEEE. In other African countries no special legislation exists and the laws are in process of being formulated. To improve this Sussane Dittke 132 suggests to adjust and adopt relevant European standards: identical legislation frameworks worldwide (under assumption of equal control) would abate incentives to import WEEE to developing countries. South African legislation is centrally defined with a Waste Management Act. Concerning particularly e-waste management the government requested the industry to develop an industrial waste management plan to discuss and approve as a voluntary agreement. At present there are two voluntary systems developed in South Africa. One was designed by eWASA (e-Waste Association of South Africa), a non-profit organisation established in 2008 to manage the establishment of a sustainable environmentally sound e-waste management system for the country. Thus, eWASA was the main party to perform it with a strong encouragement. Nevertheless, other industry stakeholders were not satisfied with the executed plan because of problems with transparency and accountability (for instance, HP pointed out the shortcomings). To improve the situation the IT Association of South Africa Producer Environmental Group independently developed an Industry Waste Management Plan to deal with e- waste (an initiative by Dell, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Microsoft, Nokia, supported by Acer and Cisco). The draft version of it was sent in October 2011 to the government. It implied establishing an Extended Producer Responsibility system with a common take-back system. Fees for producers and importers are suggested to be determined by the market share. The market share should be estimated by a separate non-profit organization, which is supposed to be established to register EEE coming to the market. For the moment, having two draft industry waste management plans, the government is inactive and takes no further measures. This inactivity of government concerning the e-waste legislation is commonly explained by two reasons. Firstly, the fact that at the moment South Africa has many other problems (for example, unemployment) makes environmental issues to be relatively less important. Secondly, the enforcement of e-waste ",
        "256 management lies with different government departments and agencies, so there is no uniform approach in dealing with it. In the MRF, parts were dismantled only to the stage where units containing potentially hazardous materials were passed on to third parties \u2013 namely professional and registered recyclers that can deal with such materials in the appropriate manner. The actual dismantling of equipment was done predominantly with a screwdriver and at a similar technical level to any of the thousands of TV repair shops in South Africa. The issue of a permit requirement for potential \u201chazardous waste\u201d storage was currently being discussed on other levels as well. With recent commitments from major South African retailers to provide collection facilities for batteries and mercury containing fluorescent tubes it was clear that recent national legislation on hazardous waste storage was not helpful or did not grasp the actual situation and resulting needs. A dialogue with the relevant government authorities needed to be started to get final clarity on this point. In particular the following points are noteworthy in this respect: \uf0b7 Analyzing policy and legislation exposed numerous barriers connected to e-waste management in South Africa. In general, South Africa currently does not have any special legislation dedicated to dealing with e-waste, as indicated above; \uf0b7 Enforcement of laws dealing with e-waste is done by different government departments, at alternative levels of government, so that there is no uniform approach in dealing with e-waste or hazardous waste in general. Some by-laws at the municipal level have a potentially negative impact on recycling or collection activities. While it is debatable to what extent e- waste should be treated (in the same manner as other hazardous waste in terms of collection, storage and transport), it nonetheless poses a possible difficulty for e-waste recyclers; \uf0b7 There often is a rivalry and lack of cooperation between national and provincial government since both share the constitutional power over pollution control. 5.11.5 Lessons learned \uf0b7 Financing is a crucial point. A self-sufficient business can have two income sources: intrinsic value of the recycling output fractions or materials and the \u201cpolluter\u201d who pays for the proper recycling and disposal of his waste. \uf0b7 From the standpoint of financial sustainability the integrated material recycling facilities are in a more difficult position than their more specialized counterparts. They face larger fixed and rental expenditures and thus require reaching much higher processing volumes than other recyclers. A business model where different recyclers specialize in different segments of the material recovery value chain and operate in a network seems to be a more viable business model for such activities. \uf0b7 Formal recycling businesses should closely interlink with current informal e-waste recycling structures to avoid competition in acquiring obsolete equipment and to ensure a sustainable flow of e-waste for recycling purposes. \uf0b7 Training activities should take an important role in an environmentally sound e-waste management to improve consumers\u2019 awareness. Specifically, a grassroots public education programme needs to be launched to educate informal collectors and recyclers to deal with hazards of e-waste. ",
        "257 \uf0b7 A proper national legislation framework for e-waste is absolutely needed. It should establish a take-back system; include requirements for recyclers to ensure an environmentally sound management of e-waste. It also should introduce a compliance scheme with special requirements to importers of used EEE to support financial sustainability of the integrated recovery facilities. Additionally, in terms of enforcement the legal framework should be provided, both at the level of the regime (country) and the niche (region, municipality), by introducing a ban on unhealthy and dangerous processing of e-waste. \uf0b7 The pilot revealed many opportunities. Operations with a high ethical standard attract corporate users, which are interested in e.g. making use of the project as part of their corporate social responsibility projects (refurbish and donate, sustainable recycling, corporate gifts from the Waste to Art section etc.). 5.11.6 Implications for future policy making Implications for future policy making can be derived for both the national and the international level. The following paragraphs are a set of policy suggestions on these two levels covering various aspects from environmental technology transfer to business and legislation. National level : \uf0b7 To establish a special framework legislation to deal with e-waste, including its definition and description of activities connected to its management; \uf0b7 A regulatory impact assessment would be helpful to study the existing municipal, regional and national legislation in order to harmonize the legislation, to expose and remove regulations that hinder establishing a coherent environmentally sound management of e-waste; \uf0b7 To adopt standards for activities connected to e-waste; the standards should preferably correspond to European standards; \uf0b7 To establish an Extended Producer Responsibility system, including requirements for importers of used EEE; the system should also take into account following issues: o Incentives for users to bring their end-of-life equipment to official certified collectors (increase in number of drop-offs, obligatory WEEE disposal for governmental bodies and companies, provide rewards for private consumers and informal collectors); o Responsibility for improper disposal of e-waste; o Issues such as how to deal with illegally imported e-waste and who should be responsible for its recycling; \uf0b7 To ensure sound law enforcement; \uf0b7 To promote establishing material recovery facilities by promoting entrepreneurship that can be very important to assist existing informal recyclers to move to a legitimate scheme; \uf0b7 To provide adequate training and establish (educational) programmes for raising consumer\u2019s awareness \uf0b7 To provide a government support for formal recyclers: o Subsidy schemes, favorable taxation and/or investment schemes (such as favorable credits) for MRF start-ups; o Support scheme for MRF if a slump in commodity prices is observed \u2013 potentially guaranteed minimum prices; ",
        "258 \uf0b7 To facilitate the technology transfer for further recycling of dismantled materials (for example, CRTs); \uf0b7 To provide adequate control of imports of used EEE. International level : \uf0b7 To promote unique global standards for e-waste management in order to avoid shifting streams of e-waste imports from one country to another; \uf0b7 To ensure an effective and EU-wide control of EU exports of used and end-of-life EEE in all European ports. \uf0b7 To promote the enforcement of global e-waste legislation; \uf0b7 To promote the establishment of a regional hub in Africa for materials transfer to attain a fair trade of sufficient amounts of materials with downstream recyclers in other countries. Working separately recyclers cannot operate with considerable amount of residual materials that leads to forced landfilling. If a hub is introduced, it can concentrate the residuals and provide further recycling. ",
        "259 6 OVERVIEW OF THE MAIN LESSONS LEARNED AND SUGGESTIONS FOR POLICY MAKING 6.1 Introduction Each of the case studies described in this report has a specific story to tell, with niche, regime and landscape elements that differ across cases. Common patterns emerge as well. Yet in order to draw meaningful environmental technology transfer lessons, as has been highlighted in our analytical framework (see section 3.5), it is important to bear in mind the perspective of the wider context or landscape conditions, such as the development stage of the host country, as well as the regime and niche conditions that co-determine the technology transfer outcome and its environmental impact. Evidently, the nature of the environmental technology transferred matters as well, as well as the actions of the various stakeholders. With respect to the latter a workshop was held on the 11 th of October 2012, in order to focus on the potential policy actions and lessons for each of the stakeholder groups. The workshop gathered project officers from the case studies presented in the previous chapter and policy makers from the European Commission, UNEP, UNIDO and the OECD. The workshop discussion was centred on the following set of questions: \uf0b7 What can the main actors do to improve the transfer, development, adaptation and up-scaling of environmental technologies to/for developing countries? o Governments o Private sector o NGOs o Interaction \uf0b7 What are your views and expectations on future developments? These questions and topics were discussed in three parallel sessions where the cases were grouped according to the type of environmental impact: water \u2013 materials and land \u2013 (micro-) energy. Figure 69 shows an overview of the cases by type of environmental impact and by technology transfer phase. Subsequently the outcome of the individual group sessions was presented and discussed in a plenary feedback session where the future prospects and expectations of the case project officers were also indicated. The workshop concluded with an overview of the main policy lessons. The output of the workshop is presented in the minutes which are attached in the annex of this report. In the next part of the report the main lessons learned from each of the approaches or pillars will be presented. We start with the lessons from the literature review in various stages of the project. Subsequently the lessons from the analysis of a sample of environmental technology transfer initiatives and programmes will be presented. This is followed by the lessons from cases and from the workshop. The last section concludes with suggestions for policy making. In each subsequent section we will focus on the unique lessons that emerged in each analytical step. ",
        "260 6.2 Lessons from the literature There is a vast literature on the various elements that (co-)determine the success of (environmental) technology transfer to developing countries. The importance of absorption capacity, a supportive innovation and R&D policy in the receiving country, appropriate and stable framework conditions for technology transfer, FDI and international trade are among the key elements that are discussed. The sophistication of the technology also matters, with a positive relation between sophistication on the one hand and absorption capacity and level of economic development on the other. While these aspects are relevant for all countries that want to adopt technology, both environmental and other, there are a number of lessons in the literature which particularly pertain to environmental technologies in developing countries. First of all the critical importance of developing indigenous eco-innovation capabilities in companies and research institutes has been highlighted. A second aspect is the limited access to intellectual property rights. In particular the OECD stated that a major obstacle in this respect is the lack of an international policy framework. Another observation from the literature is the need to adapt products that have been invented in developed countries to the demand conditions of the developing countries. Furthermore it has also been observed that international technology markets tend to ignore products that meet the specific needs of developing countries, especially if the expected market volume is relatively low. It was shown that low income countries predominantly need technologies that have no market potential in upper middle income countries. Examples of such technologies are improved charcoal appliances, agricultural soils recuperation, solar cookers, crop waste gasification and various low cost water treatment techniques. We also reviewed the literature of two important non-energy environmental technologies: efficient waste management and efficient water management. These studies re-iterate a number of elements mentioned above, such as the importance of adaptation of the environmental technology to the local circumstances and investing in capacity building. However, they also mention the role of including local know-how and institutions early in the project design and the use of local networks for dissemination of information and experience. 6.3 Lessons from the analysis of a sample of initiatives and programmes (Pillar 1) We identified and analysed 69 environmental technology transfer initiatives, 25 of which were programmes and 44 individual projects. The interrelation between the various programmes was analysed in order to get a better view on the existing environmental technology transfer support mechanisms. Existing studies on the design and effectiveness of these programmes were reviewed as well. At the global scale, inter-governmental institutions dealing with climate change are relatively well developed with e.g. the UNFCCC as an overall framework for inter-governmental efforts to handle climate change challenges and the Global ",
        "261 Environmental Facility (GEF) as the main inter-governmental institution that provides funds for environmental technology transfer. With respect to implementation the UNFCCC hosts the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the Joint Implementation programme (JI). At the COP meeting in Durban, December 2011, the establishment of a Green Climate Fund (GCF) was agreed. The GCF is intended to become a major mechanism to transfer funds from the developed to developing countries for adaptation to and mitigation against, climate change. It has been argued by several authors that the GCF is too state-centred. A multi- stakeholder approach with a larger role for civil society (such as NGO representatives and local partner institutions) is thought to be much more effective in reaching its goals than a strictly inter-governmental climate fund. The GEF, which is also strongly government-led, has been perceived by a number of authors as a typical aid programme with little or no additionality in the area of environmental technology transfer. The CDM relies more on the private sector for its functioning. It has been evaluated as an effective mitigation device. Yet as a dissemination mechanism for environmental technology towards developing countries it does not perform well. Our network analysis of the more than 4,000 CDM projects showed indeed that mainly emerging economies are benefitting from this initiative and also particular technologies and industries. Half of the initiatives were related to grid-connected renewable electricity, and less than on fifth of the initiatives with bio/waste gases recovery and use. Fourteen of the 20 biggest initiatives in terms of GHG reductions were about the decomposition of fluoroform and nitrous oxide, which are side products of the petro-chemical industry. This is not to say that there are no small scale initiatives. The CDM contains more than 2,000 initiatives that have annual GHG reductions of less than 100,000 CO2 equivalent tonnes. These initiatives are geographically less concentrated than the big initiatives. There is a good interconnection and transfer of technologies, and most host countries participate with multiple donor countries. However, countries in Africa and in the Middle East are noticeably less involved in the CDM than countries in Asia and Latin America. Our results suggest that economic deployment possibilities matter a lot, e.g. infrastructure, local skills, industrial readiness, entrepreneurship and local financial capacity. Many of the developing countries do not have the minimum deployment assets to benefit from the CDM. Furthermore even the small-scale CDM initiatives are often too big and technically too far away from the needs and conditions of local communities. 6.4 Lessons from the case studies (Pillar 2) Pillar 2 of this study focussed on drawing lessons from 10 case studies where the environmental technology was introduced in a bottom-up manner starting from a small scale initiative. Individually, these micro-initiatives are far smaller than the CDM initiatives. But after up-scaling the aggregate effects can nevertheless be substantial. For instance, in the case of the biogas support programme in Nepal an individual biogas installation is estimated to reduce 2,500 Kg CO2 equivalent ",
        "262 GHG per year. In 2011 more than 250,000 installations were operational, which resulted in an aggregate GHG reduction of 625,000 tons CO2 equivalents. This would correspond to a large CDM project. Compared to the CDM initiatives, evidently it takes more time to reach a similar scale of environmental impact. Yet the projects tend to be better embedded and the economic and social benefits are spread among a larger group of people. Additionally a wider set of environmental technologies can be applied ranging from micro-energy, water purification, waste management to soil protection and sustainable production. 6.4.1 The cases in the technology transition scheme according to type of environmental impact In deducing overall lessons it is especially important to have an eye on the position of the case in the technology transition scheme. As a working hypothesis and based on the literature it can be expected that some drivers and/or barriers receive more weight during the developing phase while others only start to appear at the diffusion and use phases. Figure 69 shows the relative position of the ten cases in the environmental technology transition scheme. For each case the position at its current stage of development i.e. the year 2012, was rated on a 1-10 scale and subsequently projected on the scheme. The figure also classifies the cases according to their major type of environmental impact. Figure 69: Position of the cases in the technology transition scheme according to type of environmental impact Source: IDEA Consult, VITO, DTI, REC, Ecorys-UK It is clear that the ten cases represent various stages in technology transfer, with about half in the development-diffusion stage and the other half in the diffusion- use stage. The salt water initiative in Chile did not get further than the development stage, while the same environmental technology got to the \u2018take-off\u2019 Technology development Implementation by early-adopters technology is mainstream practice Broadening towards neighbouring regions NICHE NEW REGIME Technology transfer Widespread adoption in all rural areas EMPOWERED NICHE Development Diffusion Use Take-up of certain services by cooperatives or private sector Fish feed Egypt Aquaculture - Vietnam Cement - Egypt Biogas - Nepal Recycling - DR Congo Irrigation - Chile Irrigation - Jordan Biomass - India Stoves- Uganda Soil - Burundi WEEE - South Africa 0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Water Materials & land (Micro-) energy ",
        "263 diffusion stage in Jordan. The biogas support programme is the most mature case, with a private sector that is developing around this technology. It is also the oldest initiative. The WEEE recycling initiative in South Africa has been positioned at the relatively early stages of diffusion. The material recovery facility was not implemented in its integrated form as intended in the project. However, the local private sector imitated and adopted those parts of the WEEE recycling activity that generated the highest value added. Although the project as a whole was not applied elsewhere, certainly parts of its recovery activities were. Commercial oriented initiatives such as the aquaculture in the Mekong valley, the fish feed factory in Egypt and the cement course, are more focussed on the private sector and are positioned relatively closer to the up-scaling and regime stages. One of the first observations from figure 69 is that things take their time. The Biogas support programme in Nepal started in the 1970s and it came only two decades later to full momentum. The other cases are substantially younger. But it easily takes a decade before the pilot and demonstration stage results multiply to sizable environmental impacts at the up-scale use stage. Yet age is not all that matters. Even young projects can reach the use stage relatively quickly. In the case of the cook stoves in Uganda an important aspect was catering to a real local need in combination with affordability and ease of use. Also in other projects the technology was frequently adapted to local circumstances and needs involving local R&D and innovation activities. For example the two stage biomass gasifier for rural India is a relatively sophisticated technology which was virtually continuously adapted to the local conditions for an improved effective functioning. The adaptation is not only in the technological sphere, but in the economic and organisational aspects as well, as illustrated by the case in Muramvya, Burundi on agricultural production. Virtually all the projects of the cases were developed on the basis of results and experiences of other projects, either in the technological sphere, as well as in the practical fieldwork sphere. As such one may perceive the case projects as valorisations of previous experiences and know-how, where one project builds further on the results and lessons from the other. Also in the area of developing appropriate framework policies, both locally, nationally and globally, an on-going process can be observed. However, a cross-case comparison shows that in countries with relatively unstable political and economic climates, much of the experience and know-how and often infrastructure is lost, which makes these countries much more dependent on input from abroad than others. Closely related to the local needs aspect is the involvement of the private sector. Knowing the local demands and needs is a key condition for the success of an environmental technology transfer project. Therefore involving the private sector in an early stage should be encouraged both in helping to identify the needs as in providing (part of) the solutions. This coincides very well with the \u2018buy-in\u2019 principle as buy in needs to include as many parts of society and the economy as possible. Interesting cases in this respect are for instance the fish food farm in Egypt and the Aquaculture at the Mekong valley in Vietnam, as well as the plastic recycling case in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the WEEE recycling case in South Africa. In the first two cases the projects were particularly focused on the sustainable production process of existing companies. In the latter two projects, business development had to start from scratch trying out new sustainable business models as a lever to reach the environmental goal, namely reducing waste. However, together with the benefits of involving the private sector also come the typical risks attached to it. For instance the cement course in Egypt is another example focussing on making the production process of existing (cement) ",
        "264 companies more sustainable. The success of its up-scaling activity essentially depends on the interest of the Egypt cement industry to enrol their employees for the course. A potential risk is that in times of bleak business prospects, companies will focus relatively more on reducing costs and as a consequence might show less interest in the course. This would jeopardize the up-scaling of the course substantially. Furthermore, the same goes for companies in developed countries. In times of a downturn of the business cycle the companies\u2019 commitments to environmental technology transfer projects to developing countries might be seriously tested. Private sector involvement also requires a regulatory level playing field, and especially with respect to the environmental impact, a well-functioning quality control system. Quality control helps orienting the suppliers of environmental technology solutions towards a shared and known quality standard, both in terms of training and in terms of production and service. Additionally it reduces the risk of malfunctioning and of lost investments for the client-user. Both aspects stimulate the formation of local markets in environmental technology solutions. There is clearly a role for the various government levels in setting the appropriate quality standards and in the control of its implementation. Government support and endorsement is essential for creating an appropriate and conductive regulatory framework, both in the start-up phase as in the phase of up-scaling. This is clearly shown in the Salt Water Irrigation case in Chile and Jordan. In both instances the same environmental technology was used. Yet in Chile the interaction with the government administrations turned out to be inadequate, partly fuelled by a lack of a wider platform and network in support for the technology, while in Jordan a supportive policy framework with clear objectives was formed which included all the relevant institutional stakeholders. The case studies show a wide variety of non-energy environmental technologies in various stages of the technology development chain. Another observation is that the varying projects are primarily targeted at different objectives. For example the fish food and cement projects are basically commercially driven projects \u2013 where the driver is the potential profits (and CSR). Other projects are more focussed on social benefits \u2013 e.g. the Lorena stove and farming co- operation in Burundi. These do have environmental benefits but the social impact is equally important. From this observation one may derive that it is not credible to have projects which can maximise their benefits against all objectives - environmental benefits, technological capacity upgrade and social benefits to the same extent. This might be theoretically possible but in practice it is very difficult to implement. It would be possible to have a programme with say three streams - one focussed on environmental benefits, one focussed on social and one focussed on technological capacity. All the projects would deliver some benefits against all three objectives but would primarily focus on one. The key success factors (in design) to maximise the achievement of one set of the objectives are different. The fact that the individual projects are capable of delivering social, environmental and economic benefits is arguably the reason why policy makers are interested in this area, as this combination is difficult to find. 6.4.2 An overview of drivers and obstacles Drivers For the technology diffusion cases, a first important driver for success seems to be that the technology actually fulfills a real need for the local population. If this is the case, the local population is much more motivated to adopt the technology transfer and the chances of success are significantly higher. A first ",
        "265 recommendation would thus be to look for benefits for the local population when environmental technology transfer is considered, in addition to potentially beneficial effects on the global environment. For effective adoption, it is also important that the actors involved have correct and realistic expectations ex-ante. This is important as it avoids disappointments, which lead to negative experiences which are often shared, creating a poor image for the technology and//or approach which can be a serious obstacle for diffusion of the new technology. A second key driver for success is to ensure sustained financial support during the entire lifetime of the project. A stop & go policy on the financial side has clear negative consequences. If financial means are uncertain, the recommended approach would be to go for a smaller scale but continuous approach as opposed to starting large-scale projects that may remain uncompleted. A gradual approach is also appropriate for another reason: target groups are often poor and have limited financial resources to dispose of. This makes projects that require large up-front investments from the local population very unlikely to be successful. To attract financial resources, it is important to motivate both the private sector and the public sector to participate. The private sector can be motivated by higher quality products or the fact that they can open up to new markets. International conferences or networking events can be interesting venues for bringing together complementary needs of developed and developing world. Another approach is to bring together knowledge from different firms (potentially of developed and developing world) within a certain value chain. This approach is often successful, because product improvements in the upstream (typically developing country) firm directly benefit the downstream (typically developed country) firm. This can be a strong motivation for a firm to invest in technology transfer towards poorer regions. The public sector can participate if it is demonstrated that the project will lead to clear environmental and societal benefits which are not necessarily of significant interest to the other parties involved, i.e. external benefits or positive spillover effects. This may, however, sometimes be contradictory to the desires of private sector parties. They do not wish any of their competitors to benefit from commercially beneficial positive spillover effects for which they have made the investment and assumed the risks. The exact form of financial support from the public sector should also be considered. Direct subsidies of the technology to be diffused are a possibility, but alternatives involving directed funding towards research and development, infrastructure development and capacity building are often more effective. Another point related to the issue of financial resources is to dedicate most financial support to the target groups directly. Involvement of multiple intermediate parties can be costly and unnecessarily threaten the project\u2019s financial viability. A third key driver is market development. To obtain effective technology diffusion, it is important to make the target group as large as possible. Word-of-mouth promotion is often very effective for spreading knowledge and positive experience and to make the diffusion process take off. However, promotional efforts are also necessary in the initial stages of the diffusion process. For effective market development, it is also important to avoid the creation of monopolies. Therefore, multiple parties should be included in the diffusion process. Knowledge transfer and capacity-building are important. Training should preferably be hands-on; the development of local small-scale demonstration projects should be considered. The transfer of knowledge related to management issues and business models is often equally (or even more) important than the pure technical knowledge or the transfer of equipment. A fourth key driver for technology transfer & diffusion is the institutional perspective. Parties that are interested in transferring environmental technologies ",
        "266 should firstly look for institutional support at local, national and international level. Large international networks can be an important asset for effective technology diffusion, as partners can be relied upon to bring specific knowledge to deal with certain problems. Support by the government entities in the target area is also a necessary pre-condition for success. A supportive environment should also be present at the local level, since local promotional campaigns will need to be developed. It is also a good idea to promote farmers organizations (or organizations of other local stakeholders) through which collaboration can be enhanced, as well as their role in the sharing of knowledge and mutual experiences. Related to this, a sense of ownership should somehow be instilled among the local population. This means that the technology is perceived as something that is locally effective and that the community has invested in achieving this effectiveness. This can be obtained by, for example, ensuring that adoption of the new technology has some cost for the local population instead of giving it away for free. There should also be some investment in terms of time or effort from the local population, in order for the technology to be fully appreciated. Another way of promoting a sense of ownership is to make sure that the technology diffusion occurs through a participatory process. This leads to more effective technology diffusion than if the innovation is perceived as being externally imposed. A final key driver is the need to tailor the technology to local needs. It is key to adapt the products to local circumstances before effective diffusion can take place. As mentioned earlier, developing small scale applications is often good practice in a developing world context. One should also keep an eye on the supply side and ensure local availability of the necessary input for the technology. If the technology can be produced locally, this would also enhance the local sense of ownership. Additionally, one should standardize the tailored application. Standardization of products allows for more effective knowledge sharing and easier diffusion of the technology over a large number of people. Diffusion is also enhanced by the provision of a clear and high quality operating manual that is also tailored to local circumstances. Alternatively, as already mentioned, a small number of demonstration projects can be conceived to enable hands-on learning. Obstacles With respect to the barriers that emerge for effective technology transfer, we find many \u2018usual suspects\u2019. Cultural issues can form important barriers, as well as problems related to communication such as language or illiteracy. Cultural barriers often entail inertia in the sense that it is difficult to throw away traditional approaches in favour of new technologies. Also, it is often observed that there is a lack of empowerment of women. This leads to technological benefits for women and children often being downplayed or simply neglected. The lack of financial resources in the developing world is invariably cited as a potential barrier for technology transfer. The involvement of private sector parties is not straightforward if the ability to pay is very limited. This often makes the use of public funds a necessity for the projects to be viable . In addition, large upfront investments are often impossible because access to credit is limited. This entails that a gradual, small-scale approach towards technology development is required. A related concern is the fact that market prices can fluctuate a lot. This makes certain investments less reliable and can jeopardize the success of a project even though it is viable in the long run. The ability to pay has an important link to the ex-ante management of expectations mentioned earlier. If a private sector party is to be involved it is important that they recognise the nature of the market that they are entering and that the way in which they may be able to commercially benefit from this market may be very different to the way in which they are used to benefitting from developed country markets. For ",
        "267 example the product margin may be much lower in the developing countries, though the volume of sales can compensate for this. Another important barrier is the lack of knowledge and education in developing countries. There is often a significant technological gap, but the lack of management & business skill can be equally important. Entrepreneurial sentiment may be relatively low, especially if this spirit has been hindered for many decades by a difficult business environment which is common in the developing world (e.g. due to political instability, lack of trust, corruption, etc.). The set of capabilities required for effective technology transfer absorption is summarized by the term \u2018absorption capacity\u2019 of a certain nation/region. If the absorption capacity is limited, there is very little chance of success in trying to obtain large-scale, high- tech developments. In general, the lower the absorption capacity, the more the projects should be aimed towards implementing small-scale approaches and avoiding big investments or the use of complex technologies. Among the barriers for technology diffusion, concerns related to institutional capacity are also often voiced. The regulatory framework in developing nations is often insufficient or completely absent. This can be a serious obstacle for environmental technology diffusion since environmental benefits can be discounted in the absence of appropriate regulations. The limited (reliability of) supply of necessary resources (such as fresh water, biomass or electricity) can be important hindrances. Other barriers that are cited are insecurity and a lack of trust. The often complex preparatory requirements requiring a lot of administration work and involve a significant up-front investment. Another obstacle is that demand characteristics can also be significantly different between developing and developed world. For example electricity demand may be highly intermittent in local villages that are not connected to the network. This relates back to the recommendation that one should really ensure that the technology fulfills the local needs if one wants the local community to embrace the new technology. A major concern for effective technology diffusion is what will happen with the innovation after the project ends? It is often an open question whether the positive results of a project can be sustained and disseminated further, once external knowledge, know-how and financial support fall away. For this, it is necessary that local institutional and know-how capacity is raised to a certain level. Also, awareness should be created among all the local stakeholders that can contribute to and reap the benefits of the new technology. Finally, certain co-benefits or positive spillover effects can remain untapped. This can be due to the difficulty of connecting with external stakeholders or due to the fact that private sector firms that make the investments do not desire their competitors to benefit from positive spillover effects. This problem is avoided if the project is mainly funded through public money. 6.4.3 Key messages from the case studies The following key messages can be summarized: 1. Tailoring: It is almost always a necessity to tailor technologies to local circumstances. It is often a better idea to focus on small-scale developments and use a gradual approach, rather than to implement large-scale projects that make use of sophisticated high-tech solutions. It is also observed that for effective technology diffusion tailoring is a necessary condition, whether the new technology is high-tech or already well-known in the developed world. ",
        "268 2. Finance: Provision of a constant stream of financial resources is a key condition for technology diffusion. Public sector funding is often necessary because of financial constraints in the developing world. Private sector funding has a high potential but may impose some limits in terms of limiting the potential positive spillover effects. 3. Legitimacy (+ sense of ownership): It is necessary to somehow create legitimacy among the local population. Legitimacy can be enhanced through the use of local partnerships. Another requirement for successful implementation is that a sense of ownership is somehow instilled among the local population. 4. Awareness & knowledge creation: Invest in the knowledge of the local community. This will increase the chances of effective technology adoption. 5. Hands-on learning: Consider setting up small demonstration projects to enable hands-on learning and highlight the benefits to the local population. 6. Institutional capacity: Establish the correct framework and conditions for effective technology diffusion. This can be in the form of subsidies or financial support or in the form of a good regulatory framework. Strong environmental regulation is often necessary to make the environmental investments profitable for firms. This could also lead to competitive advantage. For example, EU firms have a competitive advantage in efficient production technologies due to high environmental standards in Europe. This can be used as a future asset to enter new markets, and last but not least, 7. Patience is necessary. Projects and their technologies will usually take a relatively long time to be adapted, accepted and diffused into the host country. 6.5 Lessons from the international workshop (Pillar 3) The international workshop generated a number of valuable additional lessons. Evidently the ones that emerged from the case studies came to the surface as well. In this section we will focus primarily on the additional ones. 6.5.1 Governments Governments have different roles in different stages of the environmental technology transfer process. Whereas in the developing stages of the environmental technology governments can play an important role to step in where the private markets fail to function such as subsidizing the development of demonstration and pilot projects of which the financial return on investment is still below market expectations, at the up-scaling stage it is important that the adequate framework conditions are available for market development. Governments, both in the developing countries and in Europe, can play an important role in bridging the so-called \u201cvalley of death\u201d between laboratory and market. Especially for the poorest developing countries precisely the support and setting of the right framework conditions for promoting the deployment of environmental technologies might be very challenging. Countries with little or no facilities and appropriate human resources that are burdened with bureaucracy and corruption, the provision of medical supplies, access to clean water and energy have higher ",
        "269 priorities than environmental issues. Furthermore, often in these countries there is little political stability and (local) authorities tend to change quickly. 6.5.2 Private sector The important role of the private sector has been underlined in the workshop as well. One of the key drivers for the private sector is a positive return on investment. It has been argued that buy-in generates results which tend to last longer than pure give-away schemes. The danger with the latter is that when the subsidies for the scheme dry up, also the entire project comes to an end, while with buy-in the owners still have an incentive to valorise their investment. Yet it is important to have realistic expectations of profitability quite early in the environmental technology transfer project, both for the local private partners in the developing countries as for the ones in the developed countries. The return on investment from environmental technology transfer projects might differ substantially from those of one\u2019s core business both in rate and in timing. It is better for the project\u2019s development and success if the risks are hedged beforehand rather than ex post through tough and unexpected restructurings. Yet not only profitability and income generation matter. One of the ultimate questions is also: does the environmental solution deliver? Only a positive answer on this question allows the development of a thriving private sector for environmental solutions. This implies that the private sector should be taken on board quite early in the environmental technology transfer project. For instance, in the cases of waste recycling it was advocated to engage retailers of products early in the project. This also provided the advantage that quite early in the project deployment informal private activities could be brought in line with basic safety and environmental standards. Quality assurance is essential for private sector leverage of an environmental technology diffusion process. A system to ensure a good quality of the environmental technology solutions is necessary to avoid unreasonable expectations both with the entrepreneur and the client. In this manner quality assurance is an important ingredient in market formation. Also the sharing of best practices and knowledge helps creating a market. Setting quality standards, monitoring and enforcing these should essentially be done by an independent stakeholder, such as a government organisation or an independent not for profit organisation. In relation to the previous aspects it has been argued that a thorough market study is a necessary ingredient of any environmental technology transfer project that envisages involving the private sector. The central question is whether the environmental technology that is going to be transferred fulfils a real local need. If so, this provides a strong incentive for all potential stakeholders. Therefore, a market study should also assess the expectations and views of all relevant stakeholders, such as local governments, NGOs, investors, producers and end- users. The literature stresses the importance of IPR for environmental technology transfer and private sector development. Indeed for particular technologies access to IPR is essential. In this respect it was offered to explore the potential of patent pools in order to enable a more effective technology transfer of certain patented technologies. However, it was also indicated that in the market context of developing countries the use of non-patented technologies can already lead to significant environmental improvements. For instance in the field of micro-energy the diffusion of currently known, relatively low-tech technologies can already lead to strong environmental improvements. Furthermore the fact that these ",
        "270 technologies are not protected by patents provides an additional benefit for its cost-efficient uptake. In the area of micro-energy most projects are initiated by not-for-profit companies that use non-patented technologies. 6.5.3 NGOs NGOs are essential in the environmental technology transfer process to developing countries. NGOs fulfil various roles, all of which have their proper value in the tech transfer chain: \uf0b7 Mediating between government, private sector, local population \uf0b7 Promoting PPPs \uf0b7 Providing know-how and information \uf0b7 Advocating favourable policies and regulatory reforms \uf0b7 Monitoring of business practices and government integrity; (\u2018watchdog function\u2019) \uf0b7 Contributing to public awareness raising on environmental issues Not only environmental NGOs are important. Also NGOs focussed on social and economic aspects are needed. NGOs fit perfectly in a multi-stakeholder tech transfer model. As such NGOs have a pivotal function among the various stakeholders to make the environmental technology transfer happen \u2018in the field\u2019. In relation to private sector development it was indicated that NGOs play an important role in bringing environmental technologies to the remote rural areas where the market is \u2018too thin\u2019 for running profitable enterprises. In many developing countries for-profit companies often limit their operational fields to the urban areas with enough purchasing power. Consequently NGOs operate in conditions, times and places that are not mature (yet) for private market services. 6.5.4 Media At the workshop the importance of the media was stressed for the proliferation of best practice examples and for generating a genuine interest in environmental technology dissemination. The media can provide visibility for the project and for its stakeholders. In principle the media can also be involved for dissemination of know-how for a wide span of the population at an accessible level. 6.5.5 The effects of the economic and financial crisis The business prospects in most of the developed countries and in the EU in particular have been moderate or even for some Member States very bad in the past three to four years. A decline in the business cycle combined with budgetary austerity measures have not been a particular favorable climate for financing environmental technology transfers to the developing countries. It became more challenging for business to finance eco-innovation activities, due to the decline in output. In times of uncertainty companies tend to fall back on their cost- competitive core businesses and hesitate investing in projects, let alone the ones that provide sustainable benefits only in the long term. Yet the challenges of the crisis brought also a number of positive side effects. First of all, in countries where the subsidies or favourable tax regimes for conventional energy or non-sustainable production have been reduced or abandoned, eco-technology solutions become relatively more interesting. Second, due to the budget cuts in many developed countries a search for more diversification in the funding was started. Additionally the selection processes became more competitive which, in the end, may lead to the funding of better ",
        "271 prepared projects. Finally, it has to be indicated that not all countries were equally affected by the economic crisis. In this context the South-South transfer of technology gained importance. 6.5.6 Expectations for the future It is expected that micro-energy, water, and material and land use will remain important issues in the future, if not increase in significance. Access to water and energy remains crucial. The waste stream is expected to grow in the developing countries, despite the efforts to limit it. New business models will be developed which allow more companies to participate in the environmental technology transfer market, with very small profit per unit sold but on the base of a large market. Also new innovations are expected, some of which might be quite radical from technological point of view. Access to energy is a fundamental issue for growth and wealth creation in the developing countries. Micro-energy as a potential solution has gained ever more support in developing countries\u2019 governments. However the hope and expectation is that more resources will be devoted to finding good market-based solutions. For deployment in the poorer rural areas, these solutions certainly will need to be cost-effective. The hope is that the global actions will be translated adequately into effective local private sector initiatives from which local communities will benefit. 6.6 Policy recommendations On the base of the lessons from the case studies, the review of programmes and projects and from the international workshop a set of valuable policy recommendations can be formulated. The main question to provide an answer for is: Which policies can be deployed to improve the transfer, development, adaptation and up-scaling of environmental technologies to/for developing countries? Favour a stable political, social and economic \u2018climate\u2019. This is particularly relevant in some of the poorest developing countries. The review of the case studies and feedback from the workshop indicated that in countries that are disrupted by wars and political unrest the incentives to engage in environmental technology transfer are virtually nil. On the contrary there is a substantial risk that all that has been build-up will be lost, e.g. human capital, know-how, experience and infrastructure. Although peace and prosperity are rather long- term objectives that are not necessarily easy to obtain in the short-term, nevertheless these are essential. Apply a set of policies that are earmarked for multiple environmental technology development stages. Develop policies for every major technology development stage, in particular the development stage and up-scaling. The role of the government changes as the environmental technology project evolves. In the development and adaptation stage, the outcome of the project is not always clear generating uncertainty on whether the technology really works and delivers the expected environmental, social and economic results. Therefore it will be hard finding private funding at this stage and the total amount collected may be insufficient to do the necessary adjustments. Some environmental technologies require large upfront investments while the returns come only in the longer term. Also in this stage it is not always clear in which way the private investors may capture (part of) the revenue stream to pay back the investment costs in a later stage of development. Therefore in pre-commercial stages government action ",
        "272 focusses primarily on providing co-funding which may reduce the risk for private stakeholders as well. The co-financing of demonstration projects and pilot plants is a good example. Other policies are needed as well such as promotion of network formation, knowledge formation and learning, contributing to awareness building, promotion of (international) exchange of expertise, creating the appropriate legal framework and last but not least policy and political support. However, as the environmental technology reaches maturity and delivers its first positive results, the time is ripe for preparing the right conditions for up-scaling. Funding can more easily be shifted towards the private sector and stress should be put on creating the appropriate conditions for private market development and private market management of the technology. Therefore since at one point in time a developing country may have several projects in different stages of development the complete set of policies that span the entire environmental technology transfer chain should be in place. At the level of the EU this set of policies are already in place, yet opportunities exist to link them further with environmental technology transfer to developing countries, which would generate, in aggregate, a substantial positive effect on the environment. An example is the experience with producer responsibility schemes in the EU and the application in the context of waste material streams in developing countries. Remove subsidies and tax favours towards conventional technologies that compete with environmental friendly solutions. Therefore an independent assessment of how much the existing regulation favours the incumbent producers and conventional technologies would be an important asset for policy making and project design. The removal of these types of favourable fiscal measures could also be included as a condition for receiving funding from the EU for environmental technology transfer projects. Provide platforms and encourage networks where environmental technology providers can meet with other providers, NGOs, companies and representatives of communities, regions, and countries. At the EU level several initiatives and platforms exist such as the Eco-Innovation Action Plan and the European Innovation Partnerships. At the global level, the UNFCCC hosts the CC:iNet and the TT:Clear. Yet the need for environmental technology platforms is especially felt in the developing countries, at the level of the country, but for bigger countries also at the level of the regions. The platforms and networks could be instrumental in helping to find technological solutions for adaptation and implementation, for setting up joint ventures between companies, NGOs and for interaction with policy makers. At a global scale the local networks can be tuned in with the EU and UN initiatives which would provide the potential for large scale environmental benefits. Especially in the areas of the know-how of providing workable framework conditions the experience at the EU and UN can be very helpful for local policy makers, e.g. on green public procurement, setting and guarding of environmental quality standards, innovation policies. Evidently in the transfer of policy know-how adaptation to the local situation and possibilities is necessary. While platforms and networks are important at the level of the developing countries and their regions, it can be argued that best practices and experiences can be exchanged at the international level as well. There is no need to set-up new institutions. Within the existing initiatives of the EU such as the Eco- Innovation Action Plan and the UN various initiatives could be taken either specifically focussed on particular stakeholders, e.g. NGOs dealing with environmental technology transfer to developing countries, or in a more horizontal sense bringing various types of stakeholders together around a particular environmental technology or environmental impact. To a certain degree this happens already, but more avenues in this direction should be explored. ",
        "273 Tailor the environmental technologies to the local conditions. Adaptation to local conditions is very important for the effectiveness of the technology, and therefore a precondition for further up-scaling of the technology. This implies among others that the right niche and landscape conditions should be created for adaptation of the technology, which includes local R&D and innovation activities that allow the technology to be tuned to local conditions, and possibly the adjustment of national innovation policies, promotion of network activities, and also finance. Provide financial support on a longer term; avoid stop-and-go. The case studies showed that the application and development of environmental technologies do take time. Especially in the start-up and development phase, external project finance is necessary to bridge the \u2018valley of death\u2019 from the laboratory of the R&D centre where it was invented to the deployment on the field. Especially in the pre- commercial phases a credible prospect on an adequate funding trajectory is important. Use the funds as a catalyser to engage the stakeholders, especially the private sector. Longer-term financing does not mean give-aways. Partial funding increases the commitment of the other stakeholders in working towards the project\u2019s success, since they co-invested (part of) their assets, e.g. money, infrastructure, buildings\u2026 This also promotes co-ownership and the embedding of the project in the local social, economic and environmental situation. Create co-ownership. As indicated before, an important part of this is co-finance. Yet another important asset, which is often the only one that poor people have, is time. Ownership is not only a financial term. It has also a social connotation. Involving civil society, local authorities and local businesses increases the identification of the local communities with environmental technology transfer project and increases the chances of success and therefore of up-scaling and wider social and environmental benefits. Involve local authorities as a project partner early in the environmental technology transfer projects. This generates co-ownership and remedies the lack of understanding is quite often met. This would foster local authority support which is an important condition for reaching sustainable results in the field. The support of local authorities does not necessarily have to be in terms of financial aid. More importantly is providing the optimal regulatory framework conditions for the project at the level of the niche, whereas national and international authorities would be responsible for the regulatory conditions at the level of the landscape. Removing administrative obstacles is a valuable aid in this respect. It was argued in the workshop that the EU could act as an endorser of environmental technology transfer projects which would generate more leverage with the local authorities. Invest in knowledge building and awareness. This is a typical function that is taken up by governments and NGOs, but by private companies as well, as was shown in the case studies. First of all at the level of the project knowledge transfer is essential as well as further development on the base of (incremental) innovation. Second, sharing of best-practices and experiences is instrumental for up-scaling activities. Third, not only environmental technology knowledge is important, also designing appropriate framework conditions matter, and last but not least entrepreneurship and business skills. Fourth, with respect to facilitate implementation by the private sector, the organisation of regional or national one-stop shops would be beneficial. Especially for SMEs, both local and abroad, have relatively less time to spare apart from their core business than large companies. A one-stop shop where the necessary information, contacts and administrative requirements are provided would save a lot of time for the private companies and therefore increase the willingness to explore, if not engage in environmental technology transfer projects. ",
        "274 Consider incorporating the media especially in the up-scaling phase. The situation of the media is very country specific especially in terms of control, content and demand. So the way to involve TV, radio, press, and internet will be very country specific and also how to report the information and successes of the environmental technology projects. Yet the media technologies are quite common across countries. Therefore irrespective of the local situations, advice could be provided to local niche stakeholders on how to prepare input for the media, media dependent minimum quality criteria, and also on how to follow up on the various responses that one might get in a constructive manner. Initiatives could for instance be taken at the level of the EU in co-operation with NGOs and specialised stakeholders to prepare materials, teach the tricks of the trade and deliver at the project level. Evidently not only policy makers, civil society and NGOs are interested in media private businesses will be as well. As in developed countries media can contribute to market formation of environmental technology solutions. This is not to say that advertising is the most preferable way. Documentaries, newspaper articles, radio programmes and websites are valuable channels through which the awareness and interest in the benefits of environmental technology projects can be nurtured. Make a thorough market study before engaging in environmental technology deployment in developing countries. It has been argued at several instances in this study that private sector leverage is essential for up-scaling. However, it is of utmost importance to have an idea at the onset of the project what the private market potential is. It has been reported in the workshop that far too often environmental technology transfer projects run into difficulties after the pilot plant phase because the market potential was not adequately assessed. The crucial question of a market study is: does the environmental solution address a real existing need? If so, this provides a strong basis to invest in the project by the local private sector, and potentially by foreign enterprise as well. Furthermore it legitimates the support of local authorities, NGOs, and national and international policy makers. An additional advantage is that the results of the market study helps defining a workable long-term vision for the environmental technology transfer project, not only on how to involve the private sector, but on the potential contributions of NGOs and authorities. The EU and governments of developing countries can foster making market studies by promoting the sharing of tools, examples and know-how on good assessment practices. Explore the usefulness of patent pools as a means to facilitate the take-up of environmental technologies in developing countries. Most of the case studies that were discussed in this study used non-patented technologies. One of the lessons was that even by using non-patented technologies significant environmental benefits could be obtained. Yet as the environmental technology deployment progresses, and as the economies of these countries develop, one might expect that at a certain point in time the demand for patented technologies will increase. Evidently emerging economies, such as China, India and South Africa have already reached that point, as was also suggested by our analysis of the CDM initiative. In these countries economic progress finances the access to patents. Yet in the majority of developing countries the needs for environmental remediation cannot be financed by a buoying economy. Especially for these countries patent pools might be of interest. The European Commission, as well as other international organisations, could play a supportive and stimulating role in this respect.

Welcome and policy context Mr. Timo Makela welcomed the participants and provided an overview of the policy context. After Rio+20 conference the theme of an inclusive green economy became part of the global policy agenda. Job creation is key and environmental technology transfer is an important instrument. The number of direct jobs in cleantech in EU27 is estimated at 3.5 million. On Wednesday the 10 th of October Commissioner Tajani (DG ENTR) presented the update of the Industrial Policy flagship initiative focussing on five large growth areas. Cleantech is one of them, despite the economic and financial crisis. ",
        "288 The EU2020 strategy has 7 Flagship Initiatives. Renewable energy, innovation, energy and climate and industrial policy in a globalised world are initiatives where environmental technology play an important role. The Eco-Innovation Action Plan focusses on seven key areas which stimulate the environmental technology development and diffusion: 1. Environmental policy and regulations 2. Demonstration Projects to bridge the gap between R&D and the market 3. Standards and performance targets 4. Finance and support to SMEs 5. International cooperation 6. Green jobs and green skills 7. European Innovation Partnerships The current project links in to this in various areas: the needs of the developing countries with respect to environmental technology transfer, the mobilisation of investments, addressing potential trade barriers, and development of skills and knowledge. 3. Presentation of the interim project results See presentation of the project team 4. Break-out session 1: Water Role of governments \uf0b7 Key role is to signpost companies to the opportunities, as the national governments should be aware of the \u2018on the ground\u2019 opportunities \uf0b7 To help facilitate links between the technology providers and the opportunities, e.g. help set up joint ventures, by finding suitable local partners (companies and NGOs). \uf0b7 International and donor countries also have a role in helping to transfer know how, including on the development of policies and practice that helps build a market demand for the technology (e.g. the EU could advise on how to start green public procurement, how to enforce legislation, etc.) \uf0b7 There is a role in helping to fund demonstration projects, but it is important to remember that every country / market may well need its own demonstration to reflect the unique combination of physical and market conditions that apply. Role of private organisations \uf0b7 Need to accept that all companies will want some positive return from an investment. However there is a need for the companies to accept that the rates (and type) of return they can get from technology transfer are highly likely to be different from those in their traditional markets. This requirement for flexibility in accepting market appropriate returns is key. ",
        "289 \uf0b7 Companies have a role in setting up joint ventures between local and international partners \u2013 both can gain from this. \uf0b7 The international companies can also learn from the host countries as they will have expertise in their own market and physical conditions that can help adapt (and often improve) a product. Role of NGOs \uf0b7 Have an on-going role in raising environmental awareness (of governments, companies and public) which is key to stimulating market demand for green technology. Mass media is important in this. \uf0b7 The \u2018multi stakeholder model\u2019 is central to the UN approach \u2013 this helps address the different languages (i.e. core objectives) that the parties involved in a tech transfer project have, E.g. academics are most interested in the quality of the research, each NGO will have a key issue at its heart (which can vary from human rights to environmental protection) the national government wants economic development most of all, the donor country and exporting company may want export profits etc. Involving all these parties should help achieve a project which meets some of all of their objectives (Though they all may have to accept that the project will not be optimised for their primary objective). \uf0b7 NGOS also have roles in bringing in the private sector (And the term NGO in this context includes colleges, trade associations, skills providers (colleges) \u2013 all of which should be included in the multi stakeholder model. 5. Break-out session 2: Materials and land Role of governments \uf0b7 A lack of support from local governments is felt, especially in the DRC. Environment is not a priority. Other issues such as medicine, energy supply, access to clean water have higher priority. \uf0b7 With respect to the DRC the conditions are very challenging: little or no facilities and appropriate human resources, bureaucracy and corruption, authorities change quickly. \uf0b7 In South Africa the local governments can provide informal support (by, for example, easing the regulatory requirements), but do not provide any assistance that is costly (such, as providing land and/or buildings free of charge) \uf0b7 Therefore a suggestion is to involve the local authorities as a partner, preferably early in the projects, granting them ownership over the initiative. This would help to remedy the lack of understanding and generate local authority support. ",
        "290 \uf0b7 Local authorities can support projects not necessarily by providing direct financial aid but by removing certain administrative obstacles as well. \uf0b7 The EU could act as an endorser of the project which would generate more leverage with the local authorities. \uf0b7 As the issue of material recycling to a large extent depends on behaviour of electronics producers, the EU can contribute to the creation of the international regulatory environment for recycling via trade policies and safety and technology standards. Role of private organisations \uf0b7 The private sectors needs evidence that the project really works. This means both in terms of environmental impact (materials and waste) and especially in terms of income and profit. \uf0b7 Furthermore, actions are needed to bring the informal activities in the private sector (such as waste recycling) in accordance with the basic safety and environmental standards. \uf0b7 It is important to focus from the beginning on retailers who are eventually trading the products. \uf0b7 In numerous developing countries producer responsibility schemes are missing. The EU could have a significant role in endorsing the adoption of such schemes in the developing world. Role of NGOs \uf0b7 NGOs \u201cmake it happen\u201d. They fulfil an important role in pushing initiatives, lobbying, and providing a link to funding initiatives. They can be motivators, knowledge providers and mediators at the same time. \uf0b7 Not only environmental NGOs are relevant in the environmental technology transfer, also social, economic ones. \uf0b7 Compared to other relevant actors, NGOs are more oriented towards social aspects. They can drive public awareness raising activities. \uf0b7 The position of NGOs can be improved by bringing them together in consortia and teaming them up with NGOs in other countries. \uf0b7 The Ing\u00e9nieurs Sans Fronti\u00e8res developed a manual on technological requirements of the production. This was complemented by an economic study. Additionally a social study has been planned. The role of the media has also been highlighted as well to disseminate the results and endeavours of environmental technology transfer projects. The media can provide visibility for private companies sponsoring innovative initiatives. 6. Break-out session 3: (Micro-) Energy ",
        "291 What is the role of the government? In the technology transfer development & adaptation stage The government should promote investments in R&D because (or especially where) the market will not always invest sufficiently. Specifically technologies which require large upfront investments without immediate direct returns are less likely to be picked up by the private sector, unless government support is available. The government can play an important role in bridging the so called \u201cvalley of death\u201d between lab R&D and market launch. The government should fund technology transfer projects, but: \uf0b7 There should first be a thorough market study to assess whether a market can be developed for this environmental technology and whether it addresses a real need in the local context. Far too often pilot plants or cases are worked out without a decent market study. The government can play an encouraging role in this process by providing/sharing tools and know-how of how best to conduct such a market study. The market study helps to develop a vision. \uf0b7 The government should then use its funds as a catalyser. This means that it should fund the project only to a partial extent (not the full 100%) and try to use these funds as leverage for private sector funding and involvement. Such a \u2018partial funding\u2019 mechanism also ensures that the government funds are flowing into useful projects that address a real market need. This is a more sustainable way of providing aid, as the goal is to be a catalyser for market development and not that the projects are aborted once the flow of government funds stops. \uf0b7 A combination of direct investment subsidies and indirect funding through support of facilitating aspects (market formation, awareness building, sector development,...) is advisable. In the up-scaling stage A good (environmental) technology transfer project moves, after a certain time, from adaptation to up-scaling. This process should be accompanied by a shift from government support to private market development and private market management of the technology. The role of the government is then mainly to act as a supporting agency: \uf0b7 By providing the right policy and regulatory environment. \uf0b7 By acting as a coordinator for (international) network development. Fragmentation of development projects & technology transfer project is ubiquitous. Fragmented initiatives often have very little impact and success and sometimes do more harm than good. Thus, it is important to have knowledge- and experience-sharing networks to encourage good practices in project management and implementation. The government can set up such a network itself or can be an enabler for network development. \uf0b7 By setting quality standards, and monitoring and enforcing these standards. It is necessary that an external and independent player is responsible for this. This role cannot be left to the market. ",
        "292 In addition a very important factor is abandoning the current practice of subsidizing conventionally produced electricity which is a clear obstacle for renewable energy proliferation. How can the EU contribute to these goals? In the development and adaptation stage It should continue to fund environmental technology transfer projects. However, it should take into account the message that pure \u2018aid\u2019 is unlikely to lead to sustainable technology transfer. Rather, market-based technology transfer that fulfils an actual need is much more likely to lead to sustainable results in the long run. Therefore, it should ensure that its funds are targeted towards projects that fulfil a need and for which a market can be developed in the local context. One should also bear in mind that the practice of subsidizing existing energy technologies is a major barrier for new micro-energy technology development. The EU can try to use its influence in an indirect way (through e.g. the assignment of funding projects and eligibility conditions) to discourage the subsidies that are in place to support existing technologies. In the up-scaling stage The EU can encourage standard setting indirectly because it can set importing/exporting standards for tradable goods/technologies. Because the EU is such a large market, this way it can affect many local markets/countries in an indirect manner. However this is true for technology in general, it is less applicable to micro-energy particularly, as micro-energy solution have a strong local component and are less likely to be exported from developing countries to Europe. The EU can encourage knowledge sharing by setting up/encouraging international networks for environmental technology transfer. Another idea is exploring the potential of patent pools in order to enable more effective technology transfer of certain patented technologies. On the other side, in the market context of developing countries often the use of technologies/practices which are not very new (but well-known in the developed economies) can already lead to significant improvements. What is the role of the private sector? In developing/adaptation stage The role of the local private sector is often very limited because there are not yet any profitable market opportunities to be reaped yet. However, the catalyser of government funds can be a carrot for private sector involvement from this stage onwards, because private sector entities can envision long-run profits once the market effectively develops. The Western private sector\u2019s involvement in micro-energy is only very limited (or non-existent). In up-scaling ",
        "293 In this stage, it is the role of the private sector to encourage the technology diffusion. In the context of a developing country economy, this sector often consists of newly created firms by individuals which have been trained by NGOs/government and which have seen the market potential. The step of seeing the market potential is often not straightforward and may need some additional encouragement and training by government/NGOs. What is the role of NGOs and how can EU maximize its benefits? NGOs have an important function in: \uf0b7 Promotion of public-private partnerships. \uf0b7 Drawing attention to certain issues (of government and community). \uf0b7 Advocate certain policy/regulatory reforms \uf0b7 Bring new business models and technologies to certain remote areas or markets. NGOs have a much larger outreach than private market, because for-profit firms often limit their activities to urban areas in developing countries as they are more profitable. \uf0b7 Monitoring of business practices and government integrity; the so- called watchdog function. \uf0b7 Local presence in remote rural areas and knowledge of local conditions. Their role can be enhanced by the government through: \uf0b7 Network-building \uf0b7 Encouraging good practices/sharing knowledge \uf0b7 Including them/their voice in the policy development process What can be done to improve the interactions? \uf0b7 Keep a focus in TT projects, avoid fragmentation. This can be enhanced by network-building to learn from each other and encourage best practices. \uf0b7 Ensure that a thorough market study has been conducted to identify whether there is a real need to be fulfilled. This can be facilitated by governments through the provision of resources and know-how. \uf0b7 The creation of a coordinating agency or the development of a sector organisation can improve interactions and collaborations between stakeholders: government, private sector, research institutes, NGOs, \u2026 \uf0b7 For micro-energy: focus on diffusion of currently known, relatively low-tech technologies can already lead to strong improvements (additional benefit is that these technologies are not protected by patents). \uf0b7 Create the appropriate regulatory and policy framework to increase the demand for environmental goods. At international level much can be done, such as increasing demand for GHG-reductions. The national level is also important: support technology diffusion process, abolish inefficient subsidies for existing energy technologies, etc. \uf0b7 In the area of micro-energy, IPR-issues are not so important because most projects are initiated by not-for-profit firms and use non-patented technologies. ",
        "294 \uf0b7 Government-NGOs should guide the technology transfer process from public initiative towards private market development. Training in entrepreneurship is often necessary because this may only by available to a limited extent. \uf0b7 Quality assurance is key for the technology diffusion process. A system should be set up to ensure good quality. Quality in information provision is also important to avoid setting of inadequate expectations. 7. Interactive feedback from the sessions: questions and remarks \uf0b7 It was suggested that as far as IPR is concerned it might be a beneficial strategy for an SME to join a large company that can support the filing and also defend the patent rights. \uf0b7 It would be interesting to assess how much the regulation favours incumbent producers and traditional technologies. \uf0b7 Mass media may play an important role, what would be the best approach for advocating environmental technology transfer? \uf0b7 Business models are essential for involving the private sector. The know-how of doing business is therefore an important asset. 8. Feedback on the future expectations and perspectives 8.1. Case studies and sessions 8.1.1. Water Future opportunities Water \uf0b7 Development of alternative business models to allow more companies to participate in tech transfer markets. E.g. the \u2018bottom of the pyramid\u2019 where a company accepts very small profits per unit on the basis of a very large market. \uf0b7 There continue to be innovations which are disruptive technologies, so even though most markets appear saturated there is still potential for positive innovation. \uf0b7 Some are predicting an ever increasing trend of south-south transfer, i.e. emerging economies trading (And transferring technology) between each other (This could be seen as a threat if the aim is to help northern economies export). ",
        "295 Future risks Water \uf0b7 Market stability (e.g. political unrest is a major problem for any one looking to invest / tech transfer into a country). \uf0b7 IPR remains an issue - though this is linked to the business model of the company in question and the extent to which they only want to make profits from protecting and selling their IPR. 8.1.2. Materials and land \uf0b7 Waste is a material flow with a potential negative environmental impact. But it is a resource as well. Recycling becomes more important, especially since consumption is expected to grow structurally. \uf0b7 It is generally expected that despite the efforts to limit the generation of waste, its volumes in developing countries are going to grow. 8.1.3. (Micro-) energy What are likely developments? \uf0b7 Access to reliable energy is a primary requisite to allow further technological development of a country. \uf0b7 The need for focus on micro-energy as a fundamental issue for growth and wealth-creation in the developing world has gained support in recent years. However, more effort is required. This means more resources and finding of good market-based solutions on which to spend the resources. \uf0b7 The hope is that global actions will be translated adequately into private sector initiatives. \uf0b7 Innovations will still need to be affordable in the context of a poor rural area in a developing country. This means that they will need to be cost-effective, also in the near future. \uf0b7 The phase between technology development and technology adaptation and diffusion is critical. \uf0b7 Patent pools may be useful for environmental technologies to facilitate the take-up of environmental technologies in developing countries. \uf0b7 Focus on the local context: develop technologies that are based on local materials, local skills and local companies. 8.2. What are the effects of the financial and economic crisis on environmental technology transfer? \uf0b7 Because of the uncertain future, companies tend to focus on short- term profits, the \u201cbean counter\u201d attitude. The output decline made it more challenging for funding eco-innovation, yet at the same time greening of products may generate an increased market (share). Companies tend to focus on their core businesses, and are ",
        "296 less willing to invest outside this area and in projects that provide long-term sustainable benefits. \uf0b7 However, the crisis with its fiscal challenges may actually stimulate the uptake of eco-technologies in cases where conventional solutions have been subsidized or taxed in a more favourable manner. \uf0b7 The crisis highlighted the need for an innovative partnership for financing the development, dissemination and up-scaling of environmental technologies. \uf0b7 Alternative financing resources are needed. Budget cuts affect funding and this brings a need to diversify funding. Selectivity in project funding may also have good consequences as selection processes may be more thorough and competitive, leading to the funding of \u2018better projects\u2019 in the end. \uf0b7 It is however very important to realise that not all countries in the world are equally affected by the recent crisis. In this respect the South-South technology transfer is becoming a more important flow with lots of potential. This implies a shift in the role of the EU. \uf0b7 With respect to (environmental) technology transfer it is worth nothing that there is also competition among receiving countries. \uf0b7 It was indicated that UNEP and UNIDO are developing a joint initiative to help businesses, especially SMEs, with product design, resource-efficiency projects. The sector focus is on agro-food and chemicals. This intermediary service provides (examples of) business cases and policy cases. In terms of countries the focus is on 18 emerging economies. 9.

Role of NGO as innovation promoter towards private sector. \uf0b7 In some cases, retailer involvement can be an important factor \uf0b7 IP backing by big companies has advantages (and disadvantages) for technology diffusion Knowledge development (learning) \uf0b7 R&D is the basis for new technologies, stable policies towards R&D are therefore important. \uf0b7 Local R&D is important, and can be complementary to R&D results generated in the EU \uf0b7 Need for capacity building Knowledge diffusion through networks \uf0b7 Globally active companies + internationally shared knowledge + cross-border impacts, require international networks \uf0b7 Governments can play an important role in setting up exchange mechanisms for environmental technology (know-how) \uf0b7 [Environmental] technology brokering as a potential role for governments \uf0b7 Importance of industrial and business associations \uf0b7 Knowledge diffusion requires multi-stakeholder development \uf0b7 NGO role of linking stakeholders Guidance of the search \uf0b7 Role of NGOs: o Guidance based on knowledge of local factors o Market creation based on understanding local market mechanism and structures o Promote Public Private Partnerships o Taking social aspects on board, particularly via NGOs that operate often in unprofitable areas and technology stages \uf0b7 Role of governments o Signpost function o Technology brokering o Provide conditions for testing the adaptability of technologies \uf0b7 Guiding roles of NGOs and governments can differ in developed vs. developing countries Market formation \uf0b7 Producer responsibility schemes \uf0b7 At first sight, market formation is a responsibility of private actors.

No price, no market. o Deal with subsidies that favour non eco-friendly technologies (e.g. for fossil fuel derived energy) Resource mobilisation \uf0b7 No give away schemes. Promote buy-ins. \uf0b7 Although there is a clear role for governments in the early environmental technology development stages, private initiative should be included at an early stage. \uf0b7 Mechanisms have to be in place that facilitate financing of activities required for further technology diffusion and up scaling \uf0b7 A diversity of financing sources is crucial (especially in a (post-) crisis context). Creation of legitimacy and counteract resistance to change \uf0b7 Realise that new environmental technologies do involve (social, economic) changes. \uf0b7 Environment is not always a priority in developing countries. Therefore governments can act as an \u201cembracer of initiatives\u201d. \uf0b7 Create a sense of local ownership and local government entitlement. \uf0b7 Role of the media regarding the credibility of innovative technologies is growing. 10.
