        "May 2001 3 N o 7 E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s Ten years ago, the Rio Earth Summit focused the collective conscience of humanity on the growing environmental problems facing our planet. Julio Garcia Burgues, Head of DG Environment\u2019s International Affairs, Trade and Environment Unit, assesses the progress made since Rio and highlights the current problems and future challenges facing policy-makers. > S u s t a i n a b l e d e v e l o p m e n t Rekindling the fires of Rio B ack in 1987, the Brundtland Report defined sustainable development as: \u201cmeeting the economic, social and envi- ronmental needs of the current genera- tion without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.\u201d After Rio \u2013 inspired by a sense of resolve and urgency \u2013 governments, NGOs and the whole stakeholder community joined forces to recite the mantra of sustainable development. That definition was valid in Rio and remains so today. It underpins the European Commission\u2019s sustainable development strategy, which revolves around three inextricably linked pillars: economic development, social development and environmental protection. Sustainable development is only achievable if these factors are an equal part of the equation. But why has progress been so slow since Rio? Why did initial vision, enthusiasm and commitment not bring success? Unsustainable patterns With growing populations and consump- tion demands, the planet\u2019s natural resources are being consumed more quickly than they can be replenished. \u201cAchieving sustainable development requires meeting two major challenges: changing unsustainable patterns of con- sumption and production, particularly in industrialised countries, and combating poverty and poverty-related problems,\u201d explains Garcia Burgues. \u201cBecause of the lack of internalisation of environmental costs, consumption and production pat- terns still remain largely unchanged. At the same time poverty is, in the develop- ing world, the fundamental cause of degradation of natural resources.\" He echoes the sense of underachievement since Rio, but adds perspective. \u201cClearly, all that was promised has not been deliv- ered. Developing countries are especially frustrated that the aid promised has not materialised. But it is not right to say that nothing significant has been achieved. Rio triggered many positive initiatives: several important international conven- tions, for example on climate change, and actions at local and national level in both developed and developing coun- tries. In the EU, the Fifth Environment Action Programme, with its emphasis on achieving sustainability, and the new pol- icy initiatives and actions to integrate the environment into other policies emanate from the spirit of Rio. Thanks to Rio, the international stakeholder community is now a key player with a valuable contri- bution to make in the fight to achieve sustainable development.\u201d So what about the future? World Summit The United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannes- burg offers global partners the opportuni- ty to redefine and restate their commit- ment to the fight. There should be a genuine desire, backed by political will, to see it succeed. Garcia Burgues is realistic but upbeat about the chances of the sum- mit\u2019s success. \u201cIt will require solidarity, commitment and continuous effort from all parties, and much remains to be done if sustainable development is to get back on track. We are determined to get it right this time.\u201d There are positive signs that an increasing sense of urgency is giving fresh impetus to the cause of sustainable development. For example, the third report of the Inter- governmental Panel on Climate Change recently confirmed the now-accepted view that greenhouse gas emissions cause Julio Garcia Burgues: \u201cIt will require solidarity, commitment and continuous effort.\u201d 01 DG Env News n\u00b07-En LO 1.4 3/05/01 15:43 Page 3 ",
        "E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s N o 7 May 2001 4 and production is, once again, a prerequi- site. It would also be important to set tar- gets to ensure the sustainable manage- ment of natural resources. An OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) target for reversing the decline of natural resources by 2015 already exists. The question is whether the UN will recognise this target and whether it can be made more specific by setting clear sectoral targets for energy, land resources or fresh water. Targets can be quantitative or relate more to process- es that promote eco-efficiency. If met, they would encourage better use of natu- ral resources. Poverty A second key issue is poverty and the environment. \u201cThe summit must pro- mote a better understanding of the close link between environmental degradation and poverty,\u201d says Garcia Burgues. Poorer countries are caught in a vicious circle. Because they are poor they cannot think long-term. They think of short-term sur- vival. This often leads to the depletion of resources, which leads to greater poverty. Also, poor people suffer most from envi- ronmental degradation, especially when it comes to health. Infant mortality often results from a lack of social and health- care education or from poor sanitation due to environmental degradation. Many diseases are more prevalent in the poorer nations, where short-term economic development is the key. \u201cBy helping to repair or prevent environmental damage and by providing basic sanitation and access to clean water, we can help combat these diseases,\u201d argues Garcia Burgues. Linked to poverty is the question of aid. Investment and funding projects from donors are very important for helping developing countries to reach their goal of sustainable development. Investing in people is particularly important. We need to mobilise resources to promote capacity building and invest in education and training. A third key issue under the Johannesburg spotlight is how to make globalisation sustainable. When it comes to reaping the economic benefits of the liberalisation of international trade, some countries do, while others do not. This imbalance must be corrected. It is important to maximise the benefits that economic globalisation can bring to sustainable development. For example, it can ensure that environmen- tally sound technologies are available. climate change and that current emission levels are unsustainable for the environ- ment. Such acceptance is, in itself, a step forward and consolidates the need for action. Preparations The World Summit is just around the cor- ner and the Commission is keen to trans- late this renewed sense of urgency and commitment into action. Preparations are being made. The Commission\u2019s recent Communication on the summit shows how the EU should play a central role in the preparatory process. The Commission intends to promote dialogue with civil society and a steering group will be set up in which NGOs, business representatives, trade unions and consumers will play a crucial role in preparing for the summit. The meeting must also encourage busi- ness to give a clear commitment to sus- tainable development, and play a full part in achieving it. The Commission has highlighted four major issues that may dominate proceed- ings in Johannesburg. The first of these is the protection of the natural resource base of economic development.

        "5 May 2001 N o 7 E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s 5 Good governance Finally, the summit will debate the issue of good governance. This refers to democ- racy, respect for human rights and public participation in the fight against corrup- tion. According to Garcia Burgues, \u201cWe must try to develop more instruments, like the Aarhus Convention, that pro- mote good governance by ensuring pub- lic access to information and to justice.\u201d However, good governance must be on both a national and international level. The EU has supported UNEP (the United Nations Environment Programme) in its fight to improve international environ- mental governance. An institutional framework exists for economic gover- nance, but we must ensure that the struc- tures of environmental governance are equally strong. Effective measures The credibility of the EU\u2019s position in Johannesburg will depend on its ability to define and implement effective measures. At the G\u00f6teborg European Council, the commitment we made at Rio +5 in 1997 to adopt a sustainable development strat- egy will be fulfilled. In this respect, the Sixth Environment Action Programme with its focus on nature, climate change, health and waste management is a major statement of intent. It defines a range of measures that emphasise the environ- mental aspect of the sustainable develop- ment strategy. The 6 EAP, together with the EU\u2019s efforts to integrate environmen- tal considerations into all areas of policy, underpins the sustainable development strategy as a whole and enhances the Union\u2019s credibility at the summit. Another positive factor is enlargement. This is probably the single most impor- tant contribution the EU can make to sus- tainable development. A greater number of countries will soon be actively involved in improving the environmental standards of the Union. In addition, the candidate countries will bring greater biodiversity to the EU and stimulate economic and social development across Europe. High stakes As the world\u2019s population continues to expand, so does the scourge of poverty. Unsustainable consumption and produc- tion patterns place an ever-increasing burden on the natural resource base of the planet. Urgent global action is needed to reverse current trends. Countries must adopt a more holistic approach to achiev- ing sustainable development, taking equal account of economic, social and environmental factors. Only then, can developed and developing countries achieve the global sustainable develop- ment the planet so desperately needs. Garcia Burgues knows that the stakes are high. \u201cWe must rekindle the fires of Rio and strive, together with our internation- al partners, to make Johannesburg a springboard for achieving sustainable development.\u201d We cannot afford to fail. \u275a Interview by Mark O\u2019Donovan 01 DG Env News n\u00b07-En LO 1.4 3/05/01 15:43 Page 5 ",
        "E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s N o 7 May 2001 6 In a speech at a Chatham House conference in the UK, entitled \u2018Rio+10: Words are not enough\u2019 , Poul Nielson, Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, outlined some of the activities that the European Commission is undertaking on the links between environmental degradation and poverty. I t is often stressed that poor people are driven to an irresponsible use of natural resources. Economic growth would be the remedy to this situation. On the other hand, economic growth in development countries based on the North\u2019s develop- ment path and industrialisation is clearly associated with more environmental degradation. \u201cBecause it is the poor people of the developing world that suffer and will suf- fer more, we must break this vicious circle and try to understand better the inter- linking of poverty and environment, and shape our development co-operation policies accordingly. \u201cWith the aim of finding out more about practical win-win approaches simultane- ously alleviating poverty and reducing environmental degradation, the Euro- pean Commission, in co-operation with the United Nations Development Pro- gramme, launched an initiative to study the links between poverty and the envi- ronment in 1998. Six studies were con- ducted, examining poverty and environ- ment linkages in a range of sectors (urban areas, water resources, agriculture, energy, macroeconomic reforms and forests). This review confirmed that policies to improve the environment could reduce poverty. The EC is committed to continu- ing to support this initiative. Working with poor people \u201cThe EC/UNDP Poverty and Environment Initiative contributed to identifying poli- cy options that are considered to be \u2018pro- poor\u2019 and \u2018pro-environment\u2019. Poor peo- ple, contrary to what is often stated or believed, often have both the knowledge and the motivation to manage their envi- ronment in a sustainable way, provided they have a supportive and functioning legal and institutional framework. Along the same lines, these policy options also point to the importance of working with the poor, rather than just for the poor, for example in protecting and expanding their current assets base, or in co-manag- ing resources with the poor and co-invest- ing with them. Land reform especially in Africa, and especially in Southern Africa, is one of the necessary responses. \u201cIn a similar way, we are planning work on these issues with the World Wide Fund for Nature. The Economic Change, Poverty and Environment project will operate at country level in China, South Africa, Zambia, and Indonesia and carry out a range of case studies in selected areas. An important part of the project is to bring together different stakeholders in each of these countries, in order to promote broader discussions on poverty reduction and environment protection pro- grammes.\u201d Involving stakeholders Looking ahead to the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Develop- ment in Johannesburg in 2002, Commis- sioner Nielson shared some of his expec- tations. \u201cA necessary condition for suc- cess at the summit in 2002 is that the preparations are thorough and that they involve a critical mass of stakeholders. Rio managed to do that, and it will be a real challenge to repeat that performance in 2002. \u201cThis coming Earth Summit raises a lot of expectations amongst citizens around the world. Some progress has been achieved in a few areas, but increased population growth will put further pressure on glob- al natural resources. Soil degradation, pol- lution and lack of fresh water all add to a picture of environmental degradation and increased poverty. \u201cIn terms of the international architec- ture for sustainable development, I think it will be crucial for the summit to obtain agreement to move towards a more inte- grated and coherent follow-up of the development targets of the UN summits of the 1990s. The 2002 summit should promote the integration of the environ- ment dimension in the implementation of these targets in areas such as health and education. Furthermore, it should promote better integration and coherence > S u s t a i n a b l e d e v e l o p m e n t Twin aims: to end poverty and protect the environment \u201c 01 DG Env News n\u00b07-En LO 1.4 3/05/01 15:43 Page 6 ",

The UN Financing for Development Conference in 2001 will be a key event in this regard. \u201cIt is my sincere wish that the summit will result in a renewed spirit of partner- ship between developed and developing countries. There must be a clear sense of equity in the preparations for its out- come. It will be crucial to reassure devel- oping countries that the developed coun- tries\u2019 global environmental concerns do not take precedence over the develop- ment goals. Compared to 1992, there is now much greater common awareness on how environmental problems affect our health, our economies and so on. This should lead to converging negotiation positions. \u201cSince 1992, the links with good gover- nance have also become clearer. I would like to stress that in my view, questions of governance and open dialogue are equal- ly important to the North and the South. The political choices made both by the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific states in the Cotonou Agreement show convergence in this line of thought. The agreement foresees a strengthening of the political dimension of the ACP-EU relationship and of mechanisms to strengthen democ- racy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and good governance. This is not conditionality. The provisions are based on text agreed among the 15 EU member states and 77 ACP countries. This is the biggest and best development partnership to date. EU and ACP partners have also agreed to open their partnership to civil society and other non-governmental actors, such as the private sector and social partners. These improved working conditions will enable us to target sus- tainable development better and to strengthen efforts to deliver on the Rio agenda. \u201cFinally, the levels of official develop- ment assistance, together with technolo- gy transfer and capacity building, are cru- cial markers of the political commitment of the North, and will continue to be a prime concern of developing country partners. Even though private financial flows are now economically more impor- tant overall, ODA is of strategic impor- tance in moving towards sustainable development. I would therefore like to call on EU governments and OECD donors alike to make an effort to achieve the promised 0.7% GNP aid target. We have the G7. We also have the G77. It is good to know that we also have the G0.7!\u201d \u275a Text by Patrick Rabe 01 DG Env News n\u00b07-En LO 1.4 3/05/01 15:43 Page 7 ",

Member States need to agree on what the meeting should aim to achieve. E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s N o 7 May 2001 O n 6 February 2001, the European Commission adopted its paper on Preparing for the World Summit on Sustain- able Development in 2002 (COM/2001/53). This will form the basis of a debate among EU Member States and in the European Parliament, leading to the EU positions for the summit. In this paper, the Commission suggests four strategic objectives that the EU should pursue at the summit: \u275a Increased global equity and an effective partnership for sustainable develop- ment; \u275a Better integration and coherence at the international level; \u275a Adoption of environment and develop- ment targets to revitalise and sharpen the political commitment; and, \u275a More effective action at national level, and mechanisms to monitor progress internationally. To achieve these, it is important that the summit has a forward-looking agenda that focuses on achieving results. The Rio outcomes and Agenda 21 should not be renegotiated.

The issues at stake F elix Dodds, Executive Director of UNED Forum, identifies the key issue for the summit as development finance. \u201cIn Rio it was believed that a bargain between the developed and developing countries had been struck,\u201d explains Dodds. \u201cNew funds would be made avail- able to enable developing countries to develop sustainably. For 2002 new funds will need to be put on the table. It was reassuring to hear recently the UK Devel- opment Minister Clare Short call for a 50% increase in the Global Environment Facility. We hope other countries will back this call. \u201cIn addition we need to look for new sources of finance. The EU has backed an international airfuel tax that could also be a source of funding. NGOs hope that the EU will announce a plan to introduce it within the Union for the summit.\u201d Dodds wants to see five other crucial out- comes from the 2002 Summit: (1) Ratification of the 6 Rio Conventions and relevant protocols on climate, biodiversity, the straddling fish stocks agreement, adequate funding to com- bat desertification, the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Convention and the Convention on POPs (persistent organic pollutants); (2) A review of Agenda 21, identifying the successes and how to replicate them, and the obstacles and how to over- come them; Useful links: DG ENV on Europa: http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/environment DG DEV on Europa: http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/development Official United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development website: http://www.un.org/rio+10/ United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UN-CSD): http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd.htm United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP): http://www.unep.org/ United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): http://www.undp.org/ UNED Stakeholder Forum: http://www. earthsummit2002.org/ Earth Negotiations Bulletin: http://www.iisd.ca/ 01 DG Env News n\u00b07-En LO 1.4 3/05/01 15:43 Page 9 ",
        "I n Europe, people share common values and a common concern about some of the problems we will face in the future. In response to these worries, the European Union will discuss a Sustainable Develop- ment Strategy for Europe at the G\u00f6teborg European Council in June. This strategy will focus on the most significant unsus- tainable trends and set out to tackle them. Key unsustainable trends The strategy takes a critical look at our economies, our societies and our environ- ment. At times we are obviously not getting the balance right, or are failing to exploit opportunities and synergies. The result is that we are building up severe problems for ourselves in the future: \u275a climate change is making our weather more extreme and unpredictable; \u275a over-exploitation of natural resources will push species towards extinction, run down our fish stocks, and produce ever-increasing amounts of rubbish; \u275a new risks endanger public health , such as air pollution which kills more people than traffic accidents; \u275a poor choices on mobility and land use threaten to upset the balance between transport and urban development and the impact they have on people and the environment; E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s N o 7 May 2001 > S u s t a i n a b l e D e v e l o p m e n t S t r a t e g y f o r E u r o p e 10 Sustainable development means making sure that we get the most out of the economies we work in, the societies we live in and the environment around us. Our quality of life depends on all three. The Sustainable Development Strategy identifies the main unsustainable trends that threaten our future quality of life and sets out to tackle them. \u275a social exclusion deprives people of equal opportunities to succeed; \u275a coping with our ageing population places stress on our societies and pen- sion systems. Tackling the problems Of course, we must recognise the links between these problems. The socially excluded are more likely to suffer ill health or die young, and transport is the fastest growing contributor to climate change. Similarly, if countries co-operate, they can deal with these problems better, for example by acting together to cut greenhouse gas emissions. We need to tackle the root causes of these problems, and we need to tackle the prob- lems together. It should be no surprise that the solution to one issue can deliver benefits elsewhere. For example, 'green' technology can boost economic perfor- mance as well as improving the environ- ment. We need to make more use of such 'spillovers' between policy areas. In doing so, we need to recognise that each one of these problems will challenge us not just for the coming year but for a generation at least. The strategy must therefore provide some clarity about the future we want to see, and we will need to measure our progress towards this future, by setting out indicators, targets and goals. Market reform Our approach must include reforming the market so that consumers and producers get the 'right' prices. For example, we could remove market distortions like environmentally harmful subsidies. We must also improve our understanding through scientific analysis of problems and make sure that producers and con- sumers have the right information on which to make informed decisions. This way of working is set out in more detail in the Sixth Environment Action Programme, which will support the implementation of the strategy. Summary The Sustainable Development Strategy for Europe will take due account of the inter- play between our economies, societies and environment. It will identify the most worrying unsustainable trends facing us, and then tackle them. In doing so, it will provide a better quality of life for future generations. \u275a Text by Stephen White Changing the course of history 01 DG Env News n\u00b07-En LO 1.4 3/05/01 15:43 Page 10 ",
        "W ith its emphasis on protecting human health and the environment and stimulating innovation and competi- tiveness in the chemical industry, the White Paper is one of the most important initiatives the Commission has taken in the context of sustainable development. Few areas of EU environmental policy provoke such emotive debate, or give rise to so many concerns among stakeholders, as chemicals do. On the one hand, anxi- eties that certain substances provoke tox- ic effects and life-threatening diseases like cancer have fuelled anti-chemicals hyste- ria. On the other hand, pharmaceutical products contain chemicals that help save lives and combat these diseases. The challenge for policy-makers is to strike the right balance, and that is what the new strategy does. \u201cThe overriding priori- ty\u201d, says Eva Hellsten, \u201cis to protect human health and the environment. But it is also vital to support and promote an innovative and competitive chemicals industry that contributes effectively to the Community\u2019s GDP, provides jobs for up to 3 million people and improved quality of life for EU citizens.\u201d Addressing concerns In recent years, increasing worries about the risks that certain chemicals pose to human health and environmental safety have brought the shortcomings of the current system into sharp focus. Existing provisions for testing and registering are clearly inadequate for the large majority of chemicals on the market. The White Paper highlights the strategy needed to redress this unacceptable situation. It has three fundamental objectives: 1. to contribute to a high level of protec- tion for human health and the envi- ronment; 2. to encourage an innovative and com- petitive EU chemicals industry; 3. to enable users, professionals and the public to make informed choices about which chemicals to use, through bet- ter product information. Two guiding principles underpin the White Paper: precaution and substitution. Whenever there is doubt as to the safety of a chemical, precaution must be shown. Whenever possible, a safer product should substitute a product that is unsafe or suspected of being unsafe. REACH At the heart of the new strategy is the so- called REACH system. An expanded Euro- pean Chemicals Bureau will provide the technical, scientific and administrative expertise to run this new system in col- laboration with Member States. REACH states clearly that the burden of proof as to the safety of chemicals lies firmly with industry, importers and, in the case of manufactured products that contain chemicals, with downstream users. \u201cREACH is based on three new elements that distinguish it from the current sys- tem,\u201d explains Hellsten. \u201cThese are clear provisions for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of existing and new substances.\u201d New provisions Of the more than 100,000 chemicals list- ed as having been marketed before 1981, 30,000 are produced in volumes of over one tonne per producer per year. Once new legislation is in place, these chemi- cals will have to be registered in a central database. Industry and importers will have to submit data on the physical, chemical and toxic properties, carry out preliminary risk assessment and propose risk management measures. The authori- ties will check that this information com- plies with legislation, or suggest addition- al testing procedures. The second element of the REACH strategy is evaluation. Industry will be responsible for in-depth testing of the longer-term toxic effects of chemicals with volumes of over 100 tonnes per producer per year. But, as Hellsten is quick to point out, \u201cwhere dangerous effects are suspected, more in-depth test- ing may also be required at lower ton- nage, so that these chemicals do not escape the evaluation net.\u201d The third element is authorisation, based on clearly identified criteria and focusing on the chemicals that cause most con- cern. These may be carcinogenic, muta- May 2001 11 N o 7 E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s > W h i t e P a p e r The European Commission recently adopted its eagerly awaited White Paper on the future EU strategy for chemicals. Eva Hellsten, Head of the Environment DG\u2019s chemicals unit, highlights the main objectives of the White Paper and analyses what is at stake for industry, authorities and consumers alike. Safer chemicals within reach Eva Hellsten: \u201cThe overriding priority is to protect human health and the environment.\u201d 01 DG Env News n\u00b07-En LO 1.4 3/05/01 15:44 Page 11 ",

Further research will be needed into other chemi- cals, such as \u2018persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic\u2019 substances (PBTs), before the Commission decides what action to take. The REACH scheme lays down a clear timetable for the collection of essential data and calls for effective legal sanctions. Promoting innovation The Commission\u2019s strategy also aims to encourage the EU chemicals industry to produce innovative new products that will boost competitiveness. \u201cIt is impor- tant to remember that the industry pro- vides work for around 3 million people,\u201d says Hellsten. Proposals in the White Paper include greater flexibility for chem- icals used in the development of new products; limiting testing, where possible, to in vitro methods for substances pro- duced at levels of between one and ten tonnes per producer per year, and greater flexibility for substances in the ten kg-one tonne range, unless there is cause for con- cern. Sustainability Although industry accepts that it should play a greater role in testing and risk assessment, it has voiced concern that perhaps the White Paper goes too far and that the new measures might threaten jobs, particularly in small and medium- sized companies. Eva Hellsten responds: \u201cThe sustainable production and use of chemicals is the key to the long-term per- formance and prosperity of the industry. By manufacturing safer chemicals and providing consumers with more informa- tion on the safety and environmental friendliness of their products, the indus- try will instil greater confidence in con- sumers and continue to be profitable.\" Enlargement offers another window of opportunity, creating a larger market with more consumers and greater potential for growth. The new strategy, in encouraging economic growth while promoting safer, more environmentally friendly chemicals, is also the first concrete outcome of the Sixth Environment Action Programme and will contribute to the EU\u2019s overriding goal of sustainable development. Stakeholders In addition to being receptive to the views and concerns of industry, the Commission is canvassing the opinions of all stakehold- ers and involving them in discussion on the new EU chemicals strategy. \u201cCon- sumers need accurate information about the chemicals in the products they buy. It\u2019s all about making informed choices,\u201d argues Hellsten. In contrast to the views of industry, many NGOs believe that the White Paper is not radical enough. They want hazardous products banned altogeth- er, even more stringent testing and regis- tration requirements, and an end to the use of animals in testing. The Commission is actively promoting research into alterna- tive methods using fewer animals or no animals at all. Although in vitro testing is available for health problems like skin irri- tation, no alternative methods exist yet for carcinogenic and reprotoxic diseases. One approach under consideration is the use of theoretical calculations called QSARs. Through computer profiling, they help to predict certain toxic properties, but QSAR technology still needs further develop- ment. Optimism Eva Hellsten is optimistic about the future: \u201cThe White Paper, with its empha- sis on more abundant but also more tai- lor-made testing, on registration, evalua- tion and authorisation and on the more rapid restriction of substances causing concern, will usher in a new era of greater protection for health and the environ- ment. Its emphasis on bridging the knowledge gap by providing downstream users, professionals and consumers with clear information on the safety and efficacy of chemicals addresses public concerns with regard to health and the environment. It also provides industry with an incentive to compete effectively in a growing market.\u201d \u275a Interview by Mark O\u2019Donovan 01 DG Env News n\u00b07-En LO 1.4 3/05/01 15:44 Page 12 ",
        "May 2001 N o 7 E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s 13 M any of us in Europe are aware that our natural resources are precious and that they should be used judiciously and efficiently. We also desire that the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat should not be polluted. In order to attain this we must take on more responsibility for our choice of lifestyle and the impact it has on the environ- ment. Our society must strive for inno- vative ways of improving the environ- ment while at the same time promoting economic growth. A tool for sustainable development One innovative approach to reaching our environmental objectives is to use market mechanisms. In this respect, the Eco- label provides the perfect tool for produc- ers and consumers alike to promote sus- tainable consumption and production. The scheme, which now covers about 300 products across 15 product groups, awards the European Eco-label to prod- ucts with a reduced environmental impact. In this way, by simply buying Eco-labelled products, environmentally conscious consumers can provide the necessary impetus for producers to adopt more environmentally friendly produc- tion processes. In the same way, purchas- es of Eco-label products can be seen as a stamp of approval to producers who have made the effort to abide by the stringent criteria of the Eco-label. Manufacturers are not forced to apply for the European Eco-label. They alone decide, albeit with the help of consumer pressure, to take the step towards sustainable production. The Eco-label scheme, which was launched in 1992, is based on the \u2018cradle-to-grave\u2019 approach. It considers the ecological impact of a product throughout the various stages of its life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to its production, distribu- tion, use and subsequent disposal. The European Commission recently adopted a Green Paper on Integrated Product Policy (IPP), which sets a broader framework for this relatively new approach to environ- mental policy. It presents ideas for strengthening product-specific environ- mental policies and fostering the growth of markets for greener products. Bright future for the daisy On 24 September 2000, a new Regulation on a revised Community Eco-label Award Scheme entered into force. This includes measures designed to streamline the scheme and make it more attractive to producers. But it also contains new ele- ments aimed at increasing public aware- > E u r o p e a n E c o - l a b e l The European Union's Sixth Environment Action Programme calls for the active involvement of all sections of society in the quest for sustainable solutions to environmental problems.

The following improvements are of spe- cial interest to manufacturers: \u275a reduced fees for SMEs and developing countries; \u275a introduction of a ceiling on the annual fee; \u275a reinforced co-operation and co-ordina- tion with national Eco-label schemes; \u275a the opportunity for traders and retailers to apply directly for their own brand products and for non-EU producers to apply directly. Most important, however, is the opening of the Eco-label to the service sector. The product group \u2018Tourist Accommodation\u2019 is to be the first to be incorporated into the Eco-label scheme. Already in 1994, the Greek and the French Competent Bodies had started an \u2018Initiative on tourism\u2019, and parts of the tourism indus- try itself are keen to have their services recognised as environmentally friendly. 14 has also recently published an Info Kit explaining the benefits of the Eco-label and providing targeted information on the scheme. This includes an application guide, a business facts sheet for producers, additional facts sheets for end-users and a consumer guide. Contacting companies Member States have become very active in promoting the daisy logo. Hanne Kold from Vivatex, a Danish textile company that has recently obtained the Eco-label says: \"Currently, strong efforts are made to raise awareness about the EU Eco-label scheme amongst producers. The compa- nies are contacted directly by EPA (the Danish environmental protection agency) and we have been invited to workshops and information seminars. I think the Eco-label flower has a very good future!\" Already, the positive effects of this rein- forced promotion can be seen. In recent months the number of new registrations in Denmark has increased significantly. To strengthen this positive image, the environmental criteria of existing prod- uct groups are revised on a regular basis, taking into account technical improve- ments and market changes. In addition the Commission, in close collaboration with the EUEB, develops environmental criteria for new product groups to meet demands from consumers and producers. There are currently eight product groups being worked on, and more will follow in the coming years. \u275a Text by Nicola Breier Product group Status All-purpose and sanitary cleaners Criteria under development Hand dishwashing detergents Criteria under development Hard floor coverings Criteria under development Televisions Criteria under development Vacuum cleaners Criteria under development Tourist accommodation Feasibility study completed Furniture Feasibility study under development Tyres Feasibility study completed Product groups under development For more information Eco-label Info Kit http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/ ecolabel/infobrochures.htm List of Eco-label awards http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/ ecolabel/award.htm Competent Bodies http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/ ecolabel/compbod.htm Information brochure (in all 11 languages) http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/ ecolabel/infobrochures.htm#triptyque Eco-label Helpdesk: Tel/Fax: + 32 2 282 8454 e-mail: ecolabel@cec.eu.int Involving stakeholders Several changes reinforce transparency and public awareness and guarantee stronger stakeholder participation: \u275a The daisy flower logo of the Eco-label now includes three short descriptions of a few words, stating the reduced environ- mental impact of the particular product. \u275a An EU Eco-labelling Board (EUEB) has been created, consisting of the Compe- tent Bodies in each Member State and the Consultation Forum comprising interest groups such as industry associa- tions, environmental NGOs and con- sumer associations. This will be a central body for the scheme, with a comple- mentary role to the Commission, and a rotating chair in line with the EU presi- dency. It will contribute to the setting and reviewing of the Eco-label criteria. There will be new activities to disseminate information and promote the scheme. The Commission has set up an Eco-label Helpdesk that responds to inquiries about the scheme and plays an important role in collecting data on Eco-label holders, their products, and also on product groups.

        "May 2001 15 N o 7 E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s > E c o - M a n a g e m e n t a n d A u d i t S c h e m e EMAS, the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, has been revised \u2018from head to toe\u2019. It provides for voluntary participation in an environmental management scheme, based on harmonised lines and principles throughout the European Union. The Council of Ministers and the European Parliament adopted the new EMAS regulation in February 2001. Promoting the new EMAS regulation T he new regulation expects Member States and the European Commission to increase their efforts to promote the scheme at national and European levels respectively. To this end, the Commission has expanded the task of the EMAS Helpdesk \u2013 previously responsible for the EU-wide collection of data on sites and verifiers, the maintenance of the EMAS website and an enquiry service. Since the beginning of this year, the Helpdesk has been preparing a communication strategy and helping the Commission to organise events and design communication and promotion tools such as information brochures, articles, fact sheets, and a pre- sentation kit. On the national level, all Member States are promoting the scheme more actively, but efforts vary a lot according to budgetary restrictions and the level of general interest. Germany, for example, launched an important awareness-raising campaign at the beginning of the year, with a website introducing the new logo and a series of advertisements published in national newspapers and magazines. This campaign \u2013 a joint initiative financed by the federal environment ministry, regional environmental agen- cies, industry, trade unions and environ- mental organisations \u2013 not only explains the scheme and its main objectives but also gives registered organisations the opportunity to personalise the advertis- ing by inserting their own logo and text. The picture above is a translation of one of the German advertisements published in major national magazines. Interactive web services Sweden is currently preparing promotion activities to be launched in the late spring. These include a set of new brochures, advertisements in newspapers, information about the use of the logo and reinforced co-operation with existing EMAS organisations and with current EN ISO 14001 certified companies \u2013 since they are seen as the main target group for future EMAS registrations. The existing website is due to be extended, using the interactive web-services open to EMAS- registered organisations for disseminating information about their work through environment management data sheets and environmental management declara- tions. The French communication and promo- tion strategy includes the creation of a website on environmental management focusing on information about the regis- tration procedure and the cost of EMAS and practical guidance on how to upgrade an EN ISO 14001 certificate. The French Competent Body also plans to publish a brochure about the scheme and guidelines on how to set up EMAS in an organisation. \u275a Text by Val\u00e9rie Drezet Main improvements of EMAS II > extension of the scope of EMAS to all sectors of economic activity including local and public authorities; > integration of EN ISO 14001 as the environmental manage- ment system required by EMAS, so that progressing from EN ISO 14001 to EMAS will be smoother and not entail duplication; > adoption of a visible and recognisable EMAS logo to allow registered organisations to publicise their participation in EMAS more effectively; > involvement of employees in the implementation of EMAS; > strengthening of the role of the environmental statement to improve the transparency of communication of environmental performance between registered organisations and their stakeholders and the public.

Many companies are environmentally aware. But not all of them qualify for the EMAS logo. The logo shows that companies have undertaken a voluntary commitment to comply with the tough requirements of the European Eco-Audit-Regulation. It also proves that their environmental protection measures go beyond mere legal compliance, and that they allow environmental verifiers to carry out regular environmental reviews of their company. And that information concerning their environmental performance is available to all in an environmental statement.
