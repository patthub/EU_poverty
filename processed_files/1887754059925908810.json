        "In January 2002 the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) became an autonomous Paris-based agen- cy of the European Union. Following an EU Council Joint Action of 20 July 2001, modified by the Joint Action of 21 December 2006, it is now an integral part of the new structures that will support the further deve- lopment of the CFSP/ESDP. The Institute\u2019s core mis- sion is to provide analyses and recommendations that can be of use and relevance to the formulation of the European security and defence policy. In carrying out that mission, it also acts as an interface between European experts and decision-makers at all levels. Chaillot Papers are monographs on topical questions written either by a member of the EUISS research team or by outside authors chosen and commissioned by the Institute. Early drafts are normally discussed at a semi- nar or study group of experts convened by the Institute and publication indicates that the paper is considered by the EUISS as a useful and authoritative contribution to the debate on CFSP/ESDP. Responsibility for the views expressed in them lies exclusively with authors.

        "5 Nicole Gnesotto I s it because they were so profoundly affected by the attacks of Sep- tember 11 2001 that the United States, under the Republican administration of George W. Bush, have so ardently tried to trans- form the world? The war on terror, regime change, the promotion of democracy, the Middle East domino democracy theory \u2013 most of the ideas successively put forward by American leaders presupposed a highly intrusive form of diplomacy, even implying the right to use military force to overthrow dictatorships. Which is what happened in Iraq, despite the other arguments about the existence of weapons of mass destruction or the alleged link between Iraq and terrorism having turned out to be fal- lacious. This approach ultimately found both its political and administrative incarnation in the concept of transformational diplomacy, articulated by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in late 2005. Basically the con- cept involves transforming the instruments and structures of American diplomacy so as to make it more capable of transforming the world. Much more than a slogan, the term \u2018transformational diplomacy\u2019 reflects a determination to thoroughly revamp the practices of the US adminstration in this area. All of this is brilliantly demonstrated in this Chaillot Paper by the historian Justin Vaisse, special advisor on transatlantic relations at the Centre d\u2019Analyse et de Pr\u00e9vision at the French ministry of Foreign Affairs, and an expert on the United States, where for a number of years he was a Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institution. This Chaillot Paper constitutes a unique in-depth analysis of the ideological, govern- mental and operational implications of the transformational policies conducted by the US under President Bush. Beyond the way in which it explains the ideological dimension, this study\u2019s originality lies in the way it gives the reader an insight into the heart of the American system. The author cogently dissects the administrative and financial upheavals which occurred in the different departments and agencies in charge of the external action of the United States, whether concerning development aid, the State Department or the Pentagon. Preface This Chaillot Paper is a translation of Chaillot Paper no. 95, \u2018Etats- Unis : le temps de la diplomatie transformationnelle\u2019, published by the EUISS in December 2006, under the directorship of Nicole Gnesotto.

        "This highlights a dual paradox. There is a striking discrepancy between, on the one hand, the relatively sceptical European reaction to the freedom agenda discourse that is so pervasive in American politics, and on the other the extreme seriousness with which the US administra- tion has engaged in the idea of transformational diplomacy. On the other hand, the embracing of transformational diplomacy seems to have coin- cided with the very moment when the reality of the various crises in the world \u2013 civil war in Iraq, the election of Hamas, the rise of Hezbollah \u2013 undermined the appropriateness and the feasibility of this policy. If it is true that the whole of the Middle East has been transformed by the Amer- ican intervention in Iraq, it is difficult to feel that this transformation has been positive for the stability and democratisation of the region. Does this mean that this transformational interlude in American diplomacy was inappropriate with regard to the strategic reality of the post 9/11 world? Not necessarily. Not least among the merits of this Chaillot Paper is the fact that it distinguishes, within this American con- cept, those elements that derive from an excess of ideological fervour and those that constitute a vital ingredient for the management of interna- tional insecurity today.

        "Introduction On 18 January 2006, speaking in front of an audience of George- town School of Foreign Service students, Secretary of State Con- doleezza Rice outlined a new concept to describe her policy direc- tions: transformational diplomacy (see Annex 1): \u2018I would define the objective of transformational diplomacy this way: to work with our many partners around the world, to build and sustain democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system.\u2019 It would be just as excessive to identify the core of American for- eign policy in those two words as it would to consider transforma- tional diplomacy a mere slogan, a mere dressing up of a policy based on more conventional factors. It would also be inaccurate to view transformational diplomacy as being synonymous with George W. Bush\u2019s \u2018freedom agenda,\u2019 with the will to \u2018transform\u2019 the Middle East and to democratise the region, by force if need be. This flexible concept might be defined as the transformation of American diplomacy (in the broadest sense, encompassing objectives, ways, and means) to enable it to reshape the interna- tional system through the transformation of failed, weak or divided regimes into strong and democratic ones, or at the very least into better governed ones. The concept of transformational diplomacy is useful in that it draws a link between: (cid:90) on the one hand, a new understanding of international reality (today\u2019s challenges come from failed states as much as they do from wars between states), an understanding that must remain compatible with the Bush doctrine inherited from the first term (i.e. democratisation as a universal cure for any and all security problems) but that is more realistic and sophisticated (holding elections is not enough); 7 Transformational diplomacy CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 7 ",
        "(cid:90) and on the other hand, the adaptation of America\u2019s foreign pol- icy instruments to this new context. Nation-building is becom- ing more important than negotiation. Both diplomats and sol- diers must therefore redefine their roles and act directly upon foreign societies. Hence new reforms and a convergence, a reor- ganisation and an \u2018alignment\u2019 of the tools of diplomacy, recon- struction and stabilisation, democratisation, and of develop- ment or good governance assistance. This Chaillot Paper outlines the political and ideological roots of transformational diplomacy (Chapter One), then focuses on its different components, starting with the changes it implies for America\u2019s diplomatic instruments (Chapter Two), its develop- ment assistance as well as its democratisation programmes and support for good governance (Chapter Three), its reconstruction and stabilisation tool for countries in turmoil (Chapter Four), ending with a brief review of the ongoing changes at the Pentagon (Chapter Five). The conclusion of this paper will place transfor- mational diplomacy in the broader framework of American for- eign policy formulation. It will also look at the future of this con- cept and, in particular, at the reforms that it brings with it in a deteriorated security environment. 8 Transformational diplomacy CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 8 ",
        "The political and ideological roots of transformational diplomacy A few lexical considerations Who coined the expression \u2018transformational diplomacy\u2019? Every- thing points to Condoleezza Rice herself, or to someone from her inner circle (Jim Wilkinson has been mentioned as one of the possi- ble \u2018inventors\u2019 of the phrase, as well as Steve Krasner), the concept having progressively taken shape over the course of 2005, and com- ing into frequent use, in its current meaning, in December 2005- January 2006. 1 The etymological origins of transformational diplomacy are easy to pin down: they start with the World War II and Cold War victories. For George W. Bush, and even more so for Condoleezza Rice, who was directly involved in the latter events, the corner- stone is George Bush Senior\u2019s \u2018transformative\u2019 action in Europe in 1989-91, which followed Ronald Reagan\u2019s, and which \u2018won\u2019 the Cold War. The memoirs written by George H.W. Bush and Brent Scowcroft, which focus mainly on the diplomacy which accompa- nied the collapse of the Soviet empire, are entitled A World Trans- formed . 2 Condoleezza Rice and Philip Zelikow (who, under the title of Counselor, until December 2006 was her highly influential personal advisor on these issues) wrote a book on a very similar topic, entitled Germany United and Europe Transformed . 3 In her speech at Sciences Po in Paris on 8 February 2005, the Secretary of State referred to the power of transformative action undertaken by freedom fighters: \u2018In Poland, Lech Walesa had had enough of the lies and the exploitation, so he climbed a wall and he joined a strike for his rights; and Poland was transformed.\u2019 4 This same understanding of \u2018transformational\u2019 is present in the ambition of \u2018transforming\u2019 the Middle East through the 2003 intervention in Iraq. \u2018Soon after the conclusion of World War II, 9 Transformational diplomacy 1. The formula, in its current ac- ceptation, can be found in an early \u2018Fact Sheet\u2019 from the White House Press Secretary, dated 14 Decem- ber 2005.

        "1 America committed itself to the long-term transformation of Europe. (\u2026) Today America and our friends and allies must com- mit ourselves to a long-term transformation in another part of the world: the Middle East\u2019, 5 wrote Condoleezza Rice in August 2005. This phrase is therefore clearly tied to the democratic agenda set forth by President Bush, and to his personal belief in the active virtues of freedom. Natan Sharansky, the well-known Soviet dissi- dent turned Israeli hawk, highlights this connection in the preface to the second edition of his book, The Case for Democracy \u2013 The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny . He explains that the president read and enjoyed the book to the point of inviting its authors to the White House: \u2018When he greeted us in the Oval Office, the Presi- dent expressed his firm belief in the power of democracy to trans- form the Middle East.\u2019 6 The religious undertones of the word \u2018transformative\u2019 are clearly visible in the various uses that have been made of it. Bush, for instance, in a speech to the Organisation of American States in 2005, opposed the \u2018wrong vision\u2019 of the future of Latin America, that of Hugo Chavez, to his own vision, \u2018one [which] offers a vision of hope \u2013 it is founded on representative government, integration into the world markets, and a faith in the transformative power of freedom in individual lives.\u2019 7 We can note that the president does not base his vision on the \u2018transformative power of freedom\u2019 but on his faith in the existence of such a power \u2013 faith is the primary redeeming factor. In the same way that, in 1986, Jesus \u2018changed the heart\u2019 of the president and made him stop drinking, freedom can transform countries that give up authoritarianism. This idea of redemption underlies the 2006 National Security Strategy\u2019s men- tion of Beijing: \u2018China\u2019s leaders proclaim that they have made a decision to walk the transformative path of peaceful develop- ment.\u2019 8 China is on the right path, heading towards salvation; it may be unaware of it, but this path of peaceful development will, in a way, \u2018change its heart.\u2019 Although they are generally less ideologically loaded, the phrases created from the root word \u2018transformation\u2019 always carry connotations of prestige and mystery. In this way, \u2018transforma- tional presidents\u2019 are presidents who reorganise for the long term, in domestic policy or foreign policy, the structural framework of the national or international political system, the way American politics works, instead of simply managing it \u2013 and who therefore appear as demi-gods. 9 George W.

        "1 \u2018transformational president\u2019, 10 along the lines of Franklin D. Roo- sevelt and Harry Truman. As for Donald Rumsfeld, he focused on the \u2018transformation\u2019 of the American military, a coded notion which refers to a set of reforms in the structure of the military tak- ing it towards greater agility and greater technological intensity (see Chapter Five.) This objective made him look like a wrestler battling a gigantic bureaucratic organisation, the Pentagon and its 2.1 million employees, in a clash of titans. But in the international relations vocabulary used by the administration, \u2018transformation\u2019 has come to refer to a more pre- cise reality, that of taking political factors and good governance in a given situation into account. (cid:90) In this way, within the framework of the Millennium Challenge Account programme (see Chapter Two), \u2018transformational states\u2019 are those demonstrating efforts towards governance (fighting corruption, opening up the economy, etc.) and there- fore eligible for the programme. 11 (cid:90) Andrew Natsios, the former director of USAID (United States Agency for International Development), started using the phrase \u2018transformational development\u2019 as early as 2005. USAID continues to use it in its budget to refer to the ambition of polit- ically changing the countries the Agency is helping, starting with an in-depth analysis of the structural causes of these coun- tries\u2019 instability (youth unemployment, lack of access to land ownership and the like). 12 (cid:90) One last example: \u2018conflict transformation\u2019 is defined, according to Marcia Wong of the Office for Reconstruction and Stabiliza- tion, as \u2018the process of identifying and diminishing the means and motivations for conflict,\u2019 the idea being to foster a simulta- neous process of wiping out causes of conflict and strengthen- ing institutions \u2013 the only way to come out of a crisis. 13 Very ideological in 2002-2003, and almost synonymous with \u2018regime change\u2019, the term \u2018transformation\u2019 has therefore taken on added layers of meaning, shifted, and become more complex. The end result of this evolution is \u2018transformational diplomacy\u2019, a phrase whose meaning was not really set until mid-2005. Of course, the ideal end goal remains democratising authoritarian regimes. But two developments have clarified the concept: the shortcomings of the democratisation agenda and a better under- standing of the new challenges of the international system. 11 The political and ideological roots of transformational diplomacy 10.

        "1 Transformational diplomacy: the mature phase of the Bush doctrine Elections are not enough; indeed they can even make a difficult sit- uation worse. The Bush administration has had many opportuni- ties to recognise this fact: from the situation in Iraq, where sectar- ian violence has got worse, to Palestine, where Hamas has triumphed, to Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood is gaining ground. Each of these events contradicts the Bush doctrine accord- ing to which freedom, and more specifically democracy, is the solu- tion to all our security problems: terrorism (democracies do not breed terrorism), wars and proliferation (democracies do not go to war against each other, according to the theory of democratic peace), trafficking of all kinds \u2026 The mystique of democracy does not bring an end to civil wars, or to the dissolution of a state\u2019s power, or to authoritarian leaders\u2019 stranglehold on power. Transformational diplomacy therefore appears at a time in his- tory when the Bush doctrine has been discredited and it is, in a way, the successor of that doctrine as a fall-back position or as a temporary refuge during a forced retreat. It seems to be a clever attempt by the Secretary of State to \u2018triangulate\u2019 between several constraints: (cid:90) the need to avoid renouncing the idealistic part of the president\u2019s agenda, which he reasserted in grandiloquent terms in his Janu- ary 2005 inaugural speech (\u2018ending tyranny in our world\u2019); 14 (cid:90) the pressure coming from neoconservatives, who are suspicious of Condoleezza Rice\u2019s perceived \u2018realist\u2019 instincts, and who want to be reassured on this point (Bill Kristol, editor-in-chief of the neoconservative journal The Weekly Standard , has given his bless- ing to transformational democracy); 15 (cid:90) the need to take into account criticism coming from defenders of the realist school of thought, especially in Congress, and crit- icism coming from European allies, on the cul-de-sacs of the Bush doctrine, the illusions of the \u2018democratisation only\u2019 agenda, the importance of nation building, the evident limita- tions of the Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative (BMENA), and the need to bring in allies (transformational diplomacy is supposed to focus more on all-out cooperation, at least in principle, and does to a certain extent, as the example of the Reconstruction and Stabilisation Office will show, see Chapter Four); 12 Transformational diplomacy 14. \u2018We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual tri- umph of freedom\u2019; \u2018So it is the pol- icy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\u2019 See the full speech at http://www.whitehouse.gov/new s/releases/2005/01/20050120- 1.html. 15. \u2018Transformational times re- quire transformational diplo- macy. The term is a fancy term, but it captures a real truth\u2019, says Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Stan- dard and a prominent voice of neo- conservative Washington. \u2018The US is not now a status-quo power. That is unusual for a superpower.\u2019 William Kristol, quoted in Daniel Dombey and James Harding, \u2018The US administration wants help for its transformational ambitions in some unstable regions of the world\u2019, Financial Times , 18 Febru- ary 2005.

        "1 (cid:90) the constraints of the situation on the ground in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, which make it necessary to scale down the grandiose aims and pursue a more pragmatic and less ideological stance. Transformational diplomacy, a clever synthesis of idealism and realism, fits in perfectly with the 2006-2007 zeitgeist . It fits in, for instance, with the evolution of a thinker such as Francis Fukuyama 16 who is distancing himself from neoconservatism and, in particular, has been criticising the outsize ambition of undertaking social engineering in a distant and poorly known country \u2013 Iraq \u2013 when, originally, neoconservatism was largely born from a critique of the illusions of social engineering in Amer- ica, specifically Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s \u2018Great Society\u2019 programmes. To the objective of democratising the universe, Fukuyama prefers more modest but more attainable goals, goals that bear a kinship with transformational diplomacy. The main focus should be on political institutions and the rule of law while at the same time supporting economic progress through development aid policies. In other words, we need to pay attention to good gover- nance if we want to strengthen weak states. It should be noted that international financial institutions started going down that path in the mid- to late-1990s. More specifically, Fukuyama considers that, in many cases, before focusing on limiting power \u2013 which is the objective of democratisation \u2013 power should be concentrated, so as to establish order \u2013 which is the goal of nation-building. Civil war, anarchy, and the absence of sovereignty are often the real problems, more so than the absence of democracy. This last point is at the core of transformational diplomacy. The objective of democratisation remains, but it is no longer the exclusive obsession of the United States\u2019 action abroad. Instead, the focus is on rebuilding the damaged international system by consolidating its basic units \u2013 individual states \u2013 and by trans- forming them into responsible members of the community of nations, members that can stand up to terrorism, trafficking, pro- liferation, countries that can assert their sovereignty and interact positively with other countries. To use the terminology of Stephen Krasner, the former Policy Planning Staff director, they can then be \u2018responsible sovereigns\u2019 in the international system. 17 There- fore, even if the attributes of \u2018responsible sovereigns\u2019 are generally found in democratic regimes \u2013 although this is far from being 13 The political and ideological roots of transformational diplomacy 16.

        "1 always the case \u2013 and even if democracy is indeed the end goal, transformational diplomacy is not infused with the abstract ideal- isation and na\u00efve sacralisation of democracy that was contained in the Bush doctrine. \u2018We are trying to establish a certain degree of order to keep extremists from acting freely\u2019 admitted, pragmati- cally, a senior official in the Reconstruction and Stabilisation Office in autumn 2006. The Secretary of State, for her part, reaf- firms her commitment to democracy (\u2018I\u2019ll be very straightforward about it, we want to see well-governed democratic states. We don\u2019t want to see well-governed dictatorships, and we don\u2019t want to see poorly governed democracies.\u2019) 18 but, in practice, the primary focus is on strengthening states. Transformational diplomacy as the result of lessons learned from 9/11 The second source of inspiration for \u2018transformational diplomacy\u2019 therefore clearly comes from the post 9/11 analysis of security chal- lenges. Starting with the 2002 National Security Strategy (NSS), one can find numerous statements that emphasise the transition from a Cold War and post-Cold War world, in which the reigning para- digm was that of inter-state competition, to that of a \u2018post 9/11\u2019 world, in which the greatest perils come from the conjunction between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and especially from failed states. The 2002 NSS could not be clearer on this point: \u2018America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones.\u2019 19 It is therefore necessary to try to wipe out lawless areas, \u2018grey areas\u2019, including through development aid: \u2018The events of September 11, 2001, taught us that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist net- works and drug cartels within their borders.\u2019 20 This new world view, however, only reaches full maturity a few years later, after the interval of the Bush doctrine, once the illusion was dispelled that a change of the status quo in the Middle East and the holding of elections would make security problems disappear 14 Transformational diplomacy 18.

The administration is progressively rediscovering the need for nation building, stabilisation and reconstruction operations and good governance assistance, and is measuring the consequences for its own organisation. To face the challenges of a new world, the destructive force of the Pentagon and the diplomatic force of the State Department are no longer enough: the power to thoroughly reconstruct is necessary. Or, as Stanley Hoffman put it, \u2018hard power\u2019 and \u2018soft power\u2019 are not enough and need to be joined by \u2018building power\u2019, the power to help others construct their institu- tions.\u2019 21 This inspiration can be found in Condoleezza Rice\u2019s 18 January 2006 speech on transformation diplomacy (see Annex 1): \u2018Technology is collapsing the distance that once clearly sepa- rated right here from over there. And the greatest threats now emerge more within states than between them. The fundamen- tal character of regimes now matters more than the interna- tional distribution of power. In this world it is impossible to draw neat, clear lines between our security interests, our devel- opment efforts and our democratic ideals. American diplomacy must integrate and advance all of these goals together.\u2019 In this paragraph, two points are especially worthy of attention The first one is the ambition of defining the new international environment in an abstract and general way, by putting it on a the- oretical level. The statement that \u2018the fundamental character of regimes now matters more than the international distribution of power\u2019 22 is an exact counterpoint of the realist theory of interna- tional relations, and more specifically of structural realist theory, among whose representatives is Kenneth Waltz, whose starting premise is the non-differentiation of regimes (all states behave in the same way) and the primacy of systemic effects, i.e. the effects of the international distribution of power. 23 Broadly speaking, structural realist theory is not well equipped to take failed state phenomena and grey areas into account. Condoleezza Rice, who one should not forget is a professor of international relations, 24 is thereby highlighting her intent to root her diplomacy in an updated vision of contemporary international relations that com- bines ideological elements (Bush doctrine, democratic peace) and pragmatic elements (the new challenges coming from failed 15 The political and ideological roots of transformational diplomacy 21. Stanley Hoffmann, \u2018The For- eign Policy the US Needs\u2019, New York Review of Books , 10 August 2006: \u2018But as soon as we turn to other kinds of power-\u201chard\u201d economic power, which is the power to re- ward, or bribe, and to coerce; \u201csoft power\u201d; and what I would call \u201cbuilding power,\u201d the power to help others construct their in- stitutions \u2013 we see that we live in an increasingly multipolar world\u2019. 22. It should nonetheless be noted that in the 2006 National Security Strategy, which came out some two months later, the theoretical turnaround has been toned down: \u2018In the world today, the fun- damental character of regimes matters as much as the distribution of power among them\u2019 (author\u2019s italics). 23.

The second point that should be noted in the 18 January 2006 speech is the opera- tional conclusions drawn by the Secretary of State. If one wants to produce changes in the new security environment, and act more specifically on the \u2018 fundamental character of regimes \u2019, then the lines separating stabilisation, reconstruction and peacekeeping on the one hand from development aid efforts, democratisation and good governance support programmes on the other hand, need to be blurred. In other words, it becomes indispensable to \u2018align\u2019 these different functions. Transformational diplomacy has a clear goal: to reconfigurate America\u2019s foreign action tools and \u2018align\u2019 them in order to acquire the ability to directly shape regimes and not only influence their international behaviour. This ambition to reform therefore will have an impact, at the very least, on the following areas: (cid:90) The State Department, whose agents must no longer behave only as diplomats, tasked with following the evolution of their host country and negotiating with their counterparts, but also work as \u2018social engineers\u2019 or, rather, as \u2018good governance engi- neers\u2019, by establishing links with civil societies to help them \u2018transform\u2019 themselves. New international structures might also be put in place, along the lines of the good governance sup- port ideas put forth by the Policy Planning Staff (see Chapter Three); (cid:90) USAID, whose programmes can no longer be restricted to \u2018pure\u2019 development aid while ignoring all political dimensions. These programmes must be reconfigured to serve the transformation 16 Transformational diplomacy 25. Steve Krasner, conference at the Center for Global Develop- ment, 20 January 2006.

        "1 objectives, in other words integrate far more political and good governance elements. Clearer priorities need to be defined (among other things by creating a so far non-existent budget assessment for each country) and by giving foreign aid clearly defined political goals once again, as it did in its early days dur- ing the Cold War; (cid:90) Actors in reconstruction and stabilisation operations (Depart- ment of State, Department of Defense, and a very large number of governmental agencies), who need to acquire additional power and, crucially, need to organise themselves in a more rational and sustainable manner in order to avoid a repeat of the disastrous \u2018phase IV\u2019 (occupation and reconstruction) in Iraq; (cid:90) Organisations responsible for democratisation programmes (State Department, USAID, National Endowment for Democ- racy or NED, Defense Department), who must coordinate their programmes. Finally, if ideological considerations on the one hand, and the new understanding of the international environment on the other, make it possible to explain the appearance of this concept of transformational diplomacy, it must also be understood as a tool for bureaucratic management, as a formula for reforming and rationalising the State Department and USAID. The natural ten- dency of the American administrative system is proliferation, jux- taposition and disorder. Periodically, liaison and coordination tools need to be introduced, and priorities need to be imposed and, to do so, power must be concentrated \u2026 It is easier to imple- ment such reforms by articulating them around a new coherent security doctrine rather than implement them piecemeal. With transformational diplomacy, this coherence materialises: in the same way that the tools for American action abroad were rationalised in 1947 by the National Security Act to adapt to the Cold War context, transformational diplomacy offers a frame- work which allows for a convergence and an alignment of Ameri- can tools to adapt to the post-9/11 context of the war on terror, and more specifically to favour the emergence of sovereign, strong, and well-governed states. 26 With this reform, the resources of diplomacy and especially of foreign aid are more clearly put to work for political objectives \u2013 just as they were during the Cold War. 17 The political and ideological roots of transformational diplomacy 26.

        "1 Transformational diplomacy, a consensual concept in the United States? It would be an understatement to say that the Bush administration has significantly changed its views on interventions abroad and more generally on what is possible and desirable in terms of action vis-\u00e0-vis foreign societies: there was a total volte face after 11 Septem- ber 2001. The majority opinion, in the incoming administration in January 2001, is that \u2018superpowers don\u2019t do windows\u2019 (John Hillen 27 ), that \u2018we don\u2019t need to have the 82 nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten\u2019 (Condoleezza Rice 28 ), in short that the nation-building and even peacekeeping operations undertaken by the Clinton Administration, in particular in the Balkans, had con- stituted a strategic mistake because they had weakened the combat readiness of the American armed forces, whose only mission is to be prepared for \u2018major wars.\u2019 From 2001 to 2003, the Bush Administration went from one extreme to the other, from an aversion to anything even resem- bling peacekeeping to the outsize ambition of transforming two societies, Afghanistan and Iraq, whose foundations, what is more, were known to be particularly fragile, into stable democracies \u2013 as a prelude, as far as Iraq is concerned, to a reconfiguration of the entire Middle East. 29 This turnaround marked the victory of the neoconservative school of thought, confident and optimistic, over the realist vision, cautious and pessimistic. Condoleezza Rice herself is the incarnation of this evolution. 30 Having been Brent Scowcroft\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and having worked with James Baker from 1989 to 1992, she underwent, under the impact of the events of September 11, an \u2018idealist-interventionist\u2019 shift that followed George Bush\u2019s shift, step by step \u2026 before returning, starting in 2005, to an intermediate position that expresses itself in transfor- mational diplomacy. Instead of launching an all-out crusade to democratise the world as quickly as possible, less ambitious pro- grammes are preferred: consolidation of fragile states, long-term action on civil societies, strengthening of the rule of law via devel- opment aid, etc. Wilful ignorance was replaced by utopia; utopia was replaced by a more realistic sense of modesty in terms of what can be achieved. In short, it took the Bush administration six years to come back to concepts and practices that were, mutatis mutandis , those of the Clinton administration at the end of its second term.

        "1 democracy \u2013 albeit on a less triumphal tone \u2013 and nation building had been the hallmarks of Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright\u2019s diplomacy, especially in 1999 and 2000. They had, it must be said, gone through the opposite evolution from the two Bush adminis- trations: a confused enthusiasm in 1993-1994, followed by a pull- back, and then by progressive rediscovery. Beyond the significant amount of experience that had then been acquired in peacebuilding and consolidation (by profes- sionals such as James Dobbins and Marc Grossman, for instance) \u2013 experience that was deliberately ignored and left aside by the Bush administration when it decided to go into Iraq \u2013 there was a strong interest in democratisation and good governance pro- grammes. Around Morton Halperin\u2019s Policy Planning Staff team (on these issues, some of those involved were Penn Kemble and Ted Piccone), at the end of the second term, ideas very close to those which underlie transformational diplomacy had been developed: (cid:90) focus on strengthening a few key states in their respective regions, considered to be fragile \u2013 Nigeria, Colombia, Indonesia, a group to which Madeleine Albright had added Ukraine \u2013 and which received special attention (an interagency process to focus political attention on those countries); 31 (cid:90) support for NGOs and dissident groups (Otpor in Serbia); (cid:90) or, of course, the \u2018Community of Democracies\u2019 project in 1999- 2000. Numerous scholars, on the Democratic side, continue to work on these topics (Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay on the Community of Democracies, or their updated proposal of a \u2018Concert of Democracies\u2019, for instance 32 ), and some have even seen their ideas \u2018stolen\u2019 by the Bush administration (Ken Pollack and Ron Asmus on the \u2018Greater Middle East\u2019, for instance 33 ). In short, there are no fundamental disagreements between the cur- rent team and moderate Democrats on the starting hypotheses for transformational diplomacy, and most of the changes that go with it. From a certain angle, administrations, be they Republican or Democratic, all seem to succumb to the \u2018calls to empire\u2019 34 that come their way, and arrive at the same unavoidable conclusion: to answer the challenges of the new international context, it is neces- sary to intervene directly upon States and regimes; in the long 19 The political and ideological roots of transformational diplomacy 31.

        "Reforming the State Department: from a diplomatic tool to a transformational tool If threats to the security of the United States now come from within States rather than from their foreign policy, then nation building and good governance aid become more important than diplomacy. As a result, the work of diplomats is being redefined. That is exactly what transformational diplomacy implies. According to Philip Zelikow, former special advisor to Condoleezza Rice: \u2018You need a diplomatic corps that\u2019s not just watching, observing and reporting, but a diplomatic corps that is helping with local partners to actually make change happen on the ground. What does that mean? That means things like advising them on how to build a better court system, on how to build a stronger border security system, on how to train their police.\u2019 35 In her speeches of 18 and 19 January 2006 (see Annexes 1 and 2), Condoleezza Rice emphasised this aspect: more and more, For- eign Service Officers (FSOs) will have to work in the field, in direct contact with civil society in new major cities, and not only in con- tact with their counterparts in the capital of the country in which they are posted. They will work on ever more varied tasks, in par- ticular in the area of reconstruction and stabilisation, side by side with American troops. And if they want to advance in their careers, they will have to serve in \u2013 and no longer just apply for \u2013 \u2018hardship posts\u2019 such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, or Angola. To do so, they will receive special training that will turn them into not only spe- cialised political analysts but also into programme managers able to help citizens of other countries, on the ground, to consolidate the rule of law, improve their health system or their educational system. \u2018If I go to our embassy in Kyrgyzstan, as I recently did,\u2019 explained Condoleezza Rice in her speech of 19 January 2006, \u2018they are working directly with people on educational programs, they are working directly with people on democracy promotion 21 Transformational diplomacy 35.

        "2 programs. And I think we have to recognise the changing nature of what our diplomats do. Our diplomats, of course, continue to report on the policies of a country, of course continue to try and influence governments, but they also engage the citizenry much more directly\u2019. 36 On 21 March 2007, in her address before the House Appropriations subcommittee to present the International Affairs FY 2008 budget, she insisted: \u2018We\u2019re asking our civilians to do far more than manage the existing international order these days. We are charging them with helping foreign citizens and their governments to literally transform their countries, to move them toward peace, freedom, prosperity and social justice.\u2019 37 This determination to \u2018operationalise\u2019 the State Department is matched by an ambitious geographic adaptation of American diplomatic deployment throughout the world to take into account recent demographic and political evolutions. At the end of the Second World War, the Department of State increased its presence in Europe and in Asia, and increased the training of its staff; it also contributed to nation-building efforts in Japan and Germany. At the end of the Cold War, it opened fourteen new embassies in Central and Eastern Europe and reassigned about a hundred diplomats, with a special focus given to strengthening democracy and the freemarket economy in those countries. It is the same adaptation to a new geopolitical context that Condoleezza Rice intends to implement today \u2013 benefiting, it must be said, from Colin Powell\u2019s efforts during the first term. He had managed to create no less than 2,000 new positions for Amer- ican diplomacy, of which 1,000 diplomat positions (Foreign Ser- vice Officers \u2013 FSOs) as part of the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative . In her 18 January 2006 speech, the Secretary of State noted that the State Department has as much personnel in Germany (popula- tion: 82 million) as it does in India (population: over one billion), and that 200 cities in the world with more than a million residents exist in which the United States has no diplomatic presence what- soever. She therefore intends to redeploy about a hundred post- ings from Europe and Washington towards countries such as China, India, Nigeria, and Lebanon: this is the Global Repositioning Initiative . Among the first decisions that have already been imple- mented, 15 new positions have been redeployed to the embassy in China, 12 new positions to the embassy in India, 5 new ones in Jakarta, and, all in all, 74 new posts had been created by mid-2006. As a result, 61 posts have already been axed: 10 in Russia, 7 in Ger- 22 Transformational diplomacy 36. Condoleezza Rice, speech of 19 January at USAID (question and answer session), cf. Annex 2. 37.

        "2 many, 2 or 3 in Belgium, Poland, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Brazil. 38 In a second step, Condoleezza Rice wants Congress to create 100 additional positions in \u2018key transitional countries,\u2019 for a total cost of $23 million. 39 More importantly, she intends to also carry out other large-scale geographic redeployments, for up to a third of all 11,000 FSO positions. 40 Among the innovations announced in the 18 January speech, two seem particularly interesting: (cid:90) the \u2018American Presence Post\u2019. An experienced diplomat will be chosen to live and work outside the embassy, in a large develop- ing city, without local staff or consular assignments. This sys- tem is currently being tested in Alexandria (Egypt) and Medan (Indonesia); 41 (cid:90) probably less groundbreaking, the \u2018Virtual Presence Post\u2019 will use the Internet to communicate formally with a given \u2018commu- nity\u2019 (a large city, a region, for instance) via a specially created website, and accompanying this with regular visits from the embassy personnel coming from the capital, and occasional public diplomacy initiatives. In the 2007 budget proposal that she submitted to Congress, Condoleezza Rice asked for no less than $102.8 million to imple- ment this aspect of transformational diplomacy: the redeploy- ment of diplomats, the creation of regional \u2018public diplomacy\u2019 centres to strengthen the United States\u2019 influence and communi- cation capabilities, the multiplication of \u2018American Presence Posts\u2019 and \u2018Virtual Presence Posts\u2019 mentioned earlier, training diplomats for more operational tasks and in \u2018new\u2019 languages (Mandarin, Arab, Farsi, Urdu, etc.), practice working with the Pen- tagon and other federal agencies, etc. The responsibility of devel- oping new courses for the continuing education of American diplomats falls to the Foreign Service Institute, which is the con- tinuing education institute for American diplomats. The themes selected are democratisation, control of epidemics, promotion of human rights, the fight against corruption, counter-terrorism and the rule of law. The Institute is also putting together, starting in late 2006, a long-distance course on the concepts of transfor- mational diplomacy, as well as a practical manual for diplomats currently on assignment. How can this first component of transformational diplomacy be assessed? First of all, we should note that it includes several commonsense evolutions and several administrative measures 23 Reforming the State Department: from a diplomatic tool to a transformational tool 38.

From Great Britain to India, other coun- tries are adapting their own networks, 42 and what remains to be seen is the extent to which the redeployment envisioned by the Secretary of State will in effect take place. Other developments are even more dictated by necessity: in Kabul, just as in Baghdad, Americans have had no choice but to strengthen their capabilities, and diplomats have had to get directly involved in governing those countries \u2013 in the direct management of certain ministries, for example. Here, transformational diplomacy corresponds to a real- ity that has been in place for several years (i.e., a situation of quasi- colonial management), and the rationalisation comes after the fact. However, the idea of making the work of FSOs more opera- tional, more turned towards civil society and good governance, runs up against four obstacles. (cid:90) First, that of security: the \u2018embassy-fortress\u2019 syndrome has gained ground, as threats to the safety of diplomats have increased, especially in those locations where, paradoxically, they are being called to act in the field, in contact with civil soci- ety (the Middle East, East Africa, South Asia). Otherwise, an increased protection of all American agents will be needed, as it is for the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) made up of several dozen people, who must sometimes be protected by 200 Marines ready to intervene. Andrew Natsios, former director of USAID, emphasises that the origin of this problem is not 11 September 2001, but 7 August 1998, with the Al Qaeda attacks against the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-Es-Salam that led to a whole series of reforms aimed at drastically strengthening the security of all American embassies around the world. \u2018Midlevel diplomats and aid officers who were supposed to spend their days interacting with the soci- eties in which they served were more handicapped by the new secu- rity measures than ambassadors and AID mission directors, who usually had security details at their command. For aid officers who previously had done much of their work in the countryside, this meant fewer and fewer opportunities to build the relation- 24 Transformational diplomacy 42. For Great Britain, see Julian Borger: closing of offices in Port Vila (Vanuatu), Nuku\u2019alofa (Tonga), Tarawa (Kiribati), Maseru (Lesotho), Mbane (Swaziland) and Antananarivo (Madagascar) in order to make up the cost of, among other things, the increase in security ex- penditures and the reopening of the embassies in Baghdad, Kabul and Pyongyang.

It meant less chance to see firsthand what was happening in out-of-the-way regions, and to adapt programs to changing local realities.\u2019 43 To reduce exposure to danger, one of the solutions selected has been to keep diplomats in their posts for shorter periods of time, and without their families. But this type of measure brings with it negative consequences in terms of the possibility of conducting \u2018transformative\u2019 action. A report from the State Department Inspector General came to the conclusion that the overly rapid rotation of personnel in Pakistan had led to \u2018a lack of continuity in leadership, program management and contacts\u2019. 44 In Riyadh as well, this rapid rotation has revealed itself to be disastrous both for the quality of work done and management follow-through. 45 What is evident here is the recognition of a fundamental contra- diction between the ambition of \u2018transforming\u2019 a country, which implies working over the long term, and the short term careers of our times \u2013 French or British administrators and colonial officers certainly did not leave their assigned countries at the end of one year. How can you claim to develop relationships of trust with a society that knows you will leave in under twelve months and never come back? (cid:90) The second possible obstacle to this increasing \u2018operationalisa- tion\u2019 of diplomats\u2019 work could come from opposition from FSOs, for various reasons. They have pointed out that, despite the problems mentioned above, they have indeed been leaving their offices for years, often endangering their safety, in order to be in direct touch with foreign societies, and that there is not much room for manoeuvre left in this area, unless they are to no longer carry out any of the diplomat\u2019s traditional functions. 46 After all, even if new funds are made available, an enormous part of an American diplomat\u2019s job is to handle visa requests, a decid- edly non-\u2018transformational\u2019 task that is unlikely to disappear soon. 47 The problem is that the means available to FSOs, especially when compared to those of the Pentagon, are far too small to seri- ously focus on transformative action: According to Barbara Bod- ine, former ambassador to Yemen, \u2018Our posts in the developing world are almost impossibly small \u2026 We don\u2019t have the people; we 25 Reforming the State Department: from a diplomatic tool to a transformational tool 43.

        "2 don\u2019t have the resources.\u2019 48 This is even more true, say diplomats, now that USAID, which had significant experience with managing programmes in the field and \u2018transformational\u2019 action, has seen its means considerably reduced over the course of the 1990s, and has lost much of its experience, having to rely more and more on subcontractors (see Chapter Three). In the end, many fear the dilu- tion of the State Department\u2019s \u2018diplomatic culture\u2019 into an overly broad and vague conception of tasks assigned to diplomats abroad, a little like American troops, who fear they will have to go from being soldiers to being full-time peacekeepers and nation- builders. (cid:90) Third obstacle: there is an unrealistic, \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019 side to the ambition of transformational diplomacy understood as in-depth transformation of the governance of weak countries. Why would the Angolese, for instance, take American advice on reshaping their educational system or their programmes to fight against AIDS? Why would Indonesians listen to American diplomats\u2019 advice on how to reform their judicial system? Not only are these incredibly complex fields, but these are areas where the sovereignty of states is directly involved. And, even if many States are suffering, de facto , from a lack of sovereignty in many fields, they generally still have enough left to reject foreign interference. 49 (cid:90) Finally, initiatives that promote contact with civil societies risk being often limited by similar political considerations: will American diplomats really involve themselves in the creation of an opposition union or even of a simple consumers\u2019 association, will they even be able to officially support a NGO that would do so? 50 That would be to overlook the backlash against democra- tisation initiatives that has been seen over the past few years in many regimes throughout the world, especially following the \u2018colour revolutions.\u2019 51 In this context, it is clear why the second component of \u2018trans- formational diplomacy\u2019 has so much to do with an area in which there is direct interaction with foreign societies: development aid. 26 Transformational diplomacy 48.

        "Development aid \u2013 the second component of transformational diplomacy Why is American development aid in crisis? During the Cold War, when it was born, American development aid policy possessed a strong coherence that derived from the fight against communism. Basically, it was about promoting economic development and prosperity of European societies, and later of Third World societies, in order to reduce the appeal of communist ideology and the threat of revolution. But it was also, in a more direct way, about buying influence, prestige, permission to estab- lish military bases, or offering military assistance to allied coun- tries \u2013 be they democratic or not \u2013 in their efforts to battle insurrec- tions or communist infiltration. 52 At the end of the Cold War, with the victory against the Soviet empire, American development aid lost its ballast and went into crisis. Without an overarching policy line, \u2018priorities\u2019 for develop- ment aid have multiplied, to such a point that there are currently no less than fifty-odd \u2018strategic objectives\u2019 written into law. 53 A number of them are inherited from the history of recent decades: (cid:90) traditional development aid (education, agriculture, etc.) decreasing in recent years (except for certain health issues), a budget defended by the NGOs, companies, and consultants spe- cialised in this area; (cid:90) support for the Camp David Accords and the peace process (beneficiaries: Israel, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority). In this way, since 1979, Egypt has regularly been the second largest recipient of American aid after Israel, receiving about $2 billion a year. The pro-Israel lobby in Washington are the strongest proponents of this budget; (cid:90) support for the transition to democracy in Eastern Europe and in the former USSR \u2013 which has decreased over the last few years; (cid:90) support for the Northern Ireland peace process, of a low and also decreasing amount, benefiting from the support of the Irish- American lobby in Washington; 27 Transformational diplomacy 52.

        "3 (cid:90) democratisation and stabilisation operations in countries in cri- sis, such as Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda, Kosovo, Liberia, and Sudan; (cid:90) war on drugs operations, especially in Columbia; (cid:90) the fight against AIDS, whose budgetary advocates include, but are not limited to, the pharmaceutical lobby; (cid:90) aid to strengthen the defence capabilities of allied countries, the budget for which is notably advocated by the weapons industry; (cid:90) and, of course, since 9/11, support for the war on terror, the budget for which has increased substantially (see below). The net result is that American foreign assistance is a large patchwork made up of multiple accounts, and amounting to over $23 billion, of which, in 2006, some $16.6 billion went to bilateral non-military aid of all kinds (actual \u2018development\u2019 for reducing poverty, education, healthcare, fight against drugs, direct budget- ary assistance, etc.), $5 billion for military assistance, and $1.6 bil- lion for multilateral aid. 54 To make matters worse, the list of strategic objectives intro- duced above shows the heavy \u2013 and incoherent \u2013 weight of Con- gress on this issue. This is true on both a large scale (AIDS, follow- up of Camp David, etc.), and on a much smaller scale, with the \u2018earmarking\u2019 phenomenon, through which elected officials gar- ner support from this or that segment of their constituency by requiring executive agencies to disburse funds in this country or for that programme, in particular to benefit certain NGOs, or even some private companies located in the home state or district of a specific senator or representative. 55 USAID asserts that up to 90% of its programmes are thus \u2018geared towards\u2019 a country or type of action, leaving it with no scope for manoeuvre in its management. In truth, earmarks can be more or less specific (\u2018hard earmarks\u2019 and \u2018soft earmarks\u2019): a number of them do leave a certain amount of leeway to the implementing agency. But these is no doubt that this phenomenon increases the incoherence of American action abroad, making it virtually impossible to rationalise, to designate priorities and a clear policy line. Lack of strategic choices in the objectives, lack of coherence in the political process: duplication and even competition are not rare occurrences in American aid programmes. As a logical conse- quence of the globalisation and internationalisation of their activities, numerous executive agencies, more than 15 in total, have set up their own aid programmes, in addition to those of the 28 Transformational diplomacy 54. The budget of the Department of State, including diffusion pro- grams and participation in inter- national organisations, comes to about $11 billion. 55. For instance, if a university has a research centre on Afghanistan, the Senator representing the state where the university is located can insert a subsidy into the finance bill to help support the activities of that centre. He could insert it into the \u2018USAID\u2019 section, without giv- ing USAID any say in the matter. CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 28 ",
        "3 State Department and USAID: the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, etc. \u2013 and this does not include par- ticipation in multilateral efforts. This duplication can be seen, for instance, in the case of programmes to fight against drugs: on the Pentagon side, there is the DoD Counterdrug Program, and on the State Department and USAID side, there are the Interna- tional Narcotics, Crime, Law Enforcement (INCLE) and the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI). Another example would be military assistance: on the Pentagon side, there are the Train and Equip, the Loans on Defense Articles, the Warsaw Initiative Fund, the Coalition Support Fund programmes, and on the State Department side, the very important Foreign Military Financing (FMF). The most obvious symptom of the problems American foreign aid is experiencing is probably the crisis affecting USAID. This independent agency, founded by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and put into place two months later, was created with the objective of rationalising the supplying of development aid by the very numerous agencies that had proliferated since World War II. Its dual mission of development aid and promotion of American interests in the bipolar contest during the Cold War has generally been deemed efficient and useful. But, starting in the 1990s, devel- opment aid budgets went down significantly (from about $23 to barely $15 billion between 1991 and 1998) and the Republican Congress elected in 1994 has sought to eliminate the agency. 56 USAID has been at the centre of a power struggle between the State Department and Republican elected officials, in particular the ultra-conservative Senator Jesse Helms (North Carolina), who has made this a personal issue. A compromise finally emerged at the end of the 1990s: USAID was saved but its remit was reduced, it had to come back within the State Department fold, and had to take on private sector methods. USIA and ACDA, also being fought over in the same power struggle, were not as lucky: they were swallowed up by the State Department. 57 Nevertheless, USAID had to close 24 field offices between 1993 and 1997 and reduce its personnel by 40% between 1992 and 1999 (from 11,150 to a little over 7,000). As a logical consequence of the downgrading of its remit, USAID is no longer primarily an operational agency but a clear- inghouse. The majority of its funds (90%) are subcontracted to NGOs or private companies and consulting firms, often better 29 Development aid - the second component of transformational diplomacy 56.

        "3 versed in the bidding process for USAID contracts than in provid- ing development aid. Since it can no longer lobby Congress directly, USAID now largely depends on its \u2018partners\u2019, i.e., its con- tractors, who have become its real constituency, to convince sena- tors and representatives that it should be funded. These operational problems are heightened by two phenom- ena. On the one hand, the loss of availability \u2013 and thus of experi- ence \u2013 of USAID operatives, who no longer have the time to do their monitoring job as well as they once did: the number of mon- itoring studies dropped from 529 in 1994 to 167 in 2004. On the other hand, the requirement that they \u2018buy American\u2019 increases operational costs and pushes out most local operatives, who are often more experienced and less expensive. 58 Above all, the weakening of USAID has gone hand in hand with the creation, over the past few years, of new entities such as PEP- FAR (President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), and particu- larly the MCC (Millennium Challenge Corporation), both dis- cussed below. In other words, the logic of rationalisation of foreign aid actors that prevailed in 1961 to the benefit of USAID has been completely abandoned. It would be an understatement to say that USAID is no longer the main actor of American foreign assistance. One only needs to look at where the money is being spent: 59 It should be noted that the total cost of the United States\u2019 pres- ence in Iraq (military deployment, stabilisation, reconstruction, development aid) by mid-2006 came close to $2 billion a week. 60 USAID\u2019s own budget therefore is equal to less than three weeks of American operations in Iraq, at the 2006 spending rate. 30 Transformational diplomacy 58.

By aggregating all of the spending lines, it comes to $308 billion total expenditures (for Iraq only, without factoring in Afghanistan) in 170 weeks, i.e., over $1.8 billion a week (see http://nationalpriorities.org/in- dex.php?option=com_wrap- per&Itemid=182). The congres- sional unofficial estimate, for its part, is of $1.5 billion a week. The cost is much higher if future ex- penditures (veterans and their medical bills) and budget short- falls are taken into account.

        "3 Terrorism, democracy and AIDS: the policy directions of the first Bush administration The Bush administration, when it came to power, shared Republi- can ideological prejudice towards USAID and more generally towards government-financed development aid. As a result, it tried, on the one hand, to reorient the philosophy and implemen- tation of this aid, in particular by creating the Millennium Chal- lenge Account to avoid \u2018throwing money down rat holes\u2019, in the oft- quoted words of former Senator Jesse Helms. On the other hand, after 9/11, it found itself searching for cooperation tools in the war on terror. As early as 2002, the State Department began justifying its foreign assistance budget through the war on terror, by putting the monies given to 28 states on the \u2018front lines\u2019 of the war on ter- rorism in the same column. While they were at it, reconstruction and stabilisation aid for Afghanistan and Iraq (in amounts far higher than all other aid combined) were justified in the same way. This process is reminiscent of the Cold War: helping other countries develop both to keep them from \u2018producing\u2019 terrorists or from being too weak to stand up to terrorist networks, 61 and to co-opt them, to \u2018buy\u2019 them \u2013 all the while regilding, in the eyes of the general population, the image of the United States (e.g., pro- viding aid after the tsunami or the earthquake in Pakistan). Hence the direct aid for key coalition countries, in particular for those 28 countries \u2018on the front lines of the war on terror\u2019: $52.3 billion in four years (2002-2006) for budgetary aid, antiterrorism training programmes, but also for the reconstruction of Iraq and support for neighbouring countries. All in all, 43% of all \u2018foreign opera- tions\u2019 budget appropriations over the past five years have financed the war on terror and the war against Iraq. 62 A typical example: Pakistan. This country was no longer eligi- ble to receive development aid (except for humanitarian assis- tance) because of the sanctions imposed after the May 1998 nuclear tests, the 1999 military coup , and the appearance of arrears in the debt owed to the United States. But these sanctions were put on hold in October 2001, and Islamabad received over $3.3 billion from Washington over the following four years. Afghanistan, Jor- dan, and Indonesia are among the other main recipients of this aid linked to the war on terrorism, which makes up about 29% of the total provisional 2007 American foreign assistance budget. 31 Development aid \u2013 the second component of transformational diplomacy 61. Another line of reasoning ex- ists, though it is rarely invoked. It would be to use prosperity and progress in good governance to push back corruption and im- prove public services to keep Is- lamic organizations from making inroads that would enable them to legally take power, through the ballot box (Egypt, The Palestinian Authority, Lebanon.) 62.

Military assistance programmes have traditionally been managed by the State Department, while the Pentagon implemented them. Starting in 2005, Congress transferred the management of these funds to the Pentagon, while requiring the Secretary of State to give her approval to decisions made by the Department of Defense. This funds have therefore gone from the Foreign Operations budget account to the Defense Department budget and do not appear in this chart. ** The amounts indicated in this chart do not include multilateral emergency humanitarian aid; in some cases, in particular for countries labelled with two stars, the total amount of American aid is much higher, for instance for Sudan. Beyond this redirection of foreign assistance towards the goals of the war on terror, the Bush administration has launched two important initiatives in recent years. The first focuses on the health sector (AIDS and malaria): in 2003, President Bush announced the PEPFAR programme (President\u2019s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief) which purports to be the most important effort ever launched to fight a pandemic, with an announced budget of $15 billion over five years (in real terms, this has amounted to about $8 billion actu- 32 Transformational diplomacy 63.

The manage- ment of these funds is mainly the responsibility of the \u2018U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator\u2019, directly appointed by the president and work- ing alongside the Secretary of State \u2013 in other words, outside of USAID. However, President Bush\u2019s June 2005 initiative to fight malaria (President\u2019s Malaria Initiative, or PMI), with a planned expenditure of $1.2 billion over 5 years, is the responsibility of a coordinator within USAID. But the most important programme launched by the Bush Administration in the area of development aid is the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), announced in March 2002 and financed starting in 2004. Reflecting the ideological preferences of conservatives and Republicans, the MCA aims to massively help a few well-governed countries, selected on the basis of objective cri- teria, in order to make every aid dollar useful and to prevent them from disappearing into corruption circuits. The new programme enjoys considerable privileges: it chooses the countries it focuses on, enjoys a large amount of flexibility in the way it uses its funds (no or very few earmarks) and, most importantly, does not need to retrocede budgetary leftovers at the end of the year. It is adminis- tered by the MCC (Millennium Challenge Corporation), which is in fact not a private company \u2013 but this term really does reflect the ideological preferences of the administration and the effective- ness which is expected from it. 64 The president was aiming for a 50% increase in American development aid, that is to say an addi- tional $5 billion a year, to the benefit of the MCA. In the end, the administration merely asked Congress for $3 billion a year and only received $3.7 billion in total, from 2004 to 2006. To top it all off, it appears that the MCC has only managed to spend a small part of that $3.7 billion, even if the MCC Director claimed that he had committed all his budgets to the end of 2006 and was asking for another $3 billion appropriation for FY 2007 65 He got $2 bil- lion, a significant increase but still short of the $3 billion goal. At this stage, the MCC has selected 23 countries whose results corre- spond to its 16 performance indicators in terms of governance 66 and signed eight \u2018compacts\u2019 (Madagascar, Honduras, Cape Verde, Nicaragua, Georgia, Benin, Vanuatu, and Armenia). What lessons can be learnt from the innovation that is the MCA? Although it has made an increase in American develop- ment aid possible, and has represented a welcome experiment 33 Development aid \u2013 the second component of transformational diplomacy 64. The MCC is led by a CEO (\u2018Chief Executive Officer\u2019) ap- pointed by the President and con- firmed by the Senate. It is super- vised by a board of directors made up of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the US Trade Representative, the USAID administrator, and civilian ex- perts. 65.

        "3 and innovation in the way foreign aid is carried out, it has never- theless received its share of criticism. First of all, it is a programme that helps countries that are already doing well \u2013 as their eligibil- ity with regard to the performance indicators makes abundantly clear \u2013 and has nothing to offer countries encountering major problems or even threshold countries, those that almost fulfill the eligibility indicators. The MCA risks increasing the trend of giving more to mid- to high-income countries (who receive $10.50 of aid per inhabitant and per year from the United States on average) than to low-income countries ($3.50). 67 Currently, Washington provides each Macedonian with $28 of aid, each Egyptian with $24, but each Bangladeshi only gets $0.50 and each Indian $0.06. 68 Then, despite the administration\u2019s denials, it is obvious that the MCA money has not been entirely added to the development aid budget but has in fact partially reduced other lines in the budget \u2013 in the affected countries, the amount spent by USAID has consequently decreased. 69 But it is mainly its negative effects on the role of USAID that are deplored by numerous observers: instead of being re-stimulated by the increase in the overall devel- opment aid budget, the agency has been further marginalised, its field of operations is now defined by default, it is no longer (or less) intervening in the MCA eligible countries, in countries being reconstructed (those come under the purvey of the S/CRS, the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Development, see below) or as the primary actor in the programmes to fight AIDS. Finally, the MCA is criticised for its lack of coordination with multilateral development aid agencies, specifically in terms of eligibility criteria. This harms the effectiveness of global aid and leads the recipient countries to develop a specific bureaucracy to bring in funds. But in the eyes of the administration, the MCC has, among other assets, one clear advantage: it is a \u2018transformational\u2019 agency, one that looks at governance conditions in the countries it helps, both upstream \u2013 through the selection of candidates via the good governance indicators (laid out in Annex 3) \u2013 and downstream, including through the involvement of civil society, consultations with the population, etc. 34 Transformational diplomacy 67. While it is true that Latin Amer- ica has been on the losing side of recent priority setting, American aid for Africa went up 56% from 2000 to 2004 \u2013 which, while high, is not the \u2018tripling\u2019 that George W. Bush had announced shortly be- fore the Gleneagles summit.

        "3 Transformational diplomacy and the creation of the Direc- tor of Foreign Assistance position When the Secretary of State started using the phrase \u2018transforma- tional diplomacy\u2019 in her speeches, it confirmed the policy direc- tions taken by the Millenium Challenge Account. This is hardly surprising considering that those ideas were developed by a small group of advisers (Stephen Krasner, Philip Zelikow, Andrew Nat- sios, and later Randall Tobias). If the first component of transfor- mational diplomacy \u2013 the geographic redeployment of diplomats and the evolution of their mission \u2013 was described in the 18 January 2006 speech (see Annex 1), its second component \u2013 the evolution of the ways and means and bureaucratic structures of development aid \u2013 was described in the remarks of the following day, 19 January 2006 (Annex 2). \u2018Foreign assistance is an essential component of our transfor- mational diplomacy. In today\u2019s world, America\u2019s security is linked to the capacity of foreign states to govern justly and effec- tively. Our foreign assistance must help people get results. The resources we commit must empower developing countries to strengthen security, to consolidate democracy, to increase trade and investment, and to improve the lives of their people. Amer- ica\u2019s foreign assistance must promote responsible sovereignty, not permanent dependency.\u2019 70 There are, in fact, two essential aspects to this \u2018development aid\u2019 component: on the one hand, a revamped view of foreign aid philosophy and objectives, that insists on good governance and the taking into account of political considerations; on the other hand, an internal bureaucratic reform to provide the means to implement this vision. Let us start with the first aspect. We saw (Chapter One) that the adjective \u2018transformational\u2019 referred to the inclusion of gover- nance and political factors. \u2018Transformational development\u2019 is defined by USAID as a higher ambition than simply improving quality of life. It implies fundamental changes, deep ones, in the governance of a country and in its economic structure, putting it on the track for sustainable autonomous development, having shed the crutches of development aid. 71 That is why Condoleezza Rice describes transformational diplomacy as \u2018rooted in partner- 35 Development aid \u2013 the second component of transformational diplomacy 70. Condoleezza Rice, \u2018Remarks on Foreign Assistance\u2019, 19 January 2006. 71. \u2018Transformational develop- ment does more than raise stan- dards of living and reduce poverty. It transforms countries through far-reaching, fundamen- tal changes in institutions of gov- ernance, human capacity, and economic structure that enable a country to sustain further eco- nomic and social progress with- out depending on foreign aid. The primary determinants of progress in transformational development are political will and commitment to promote economic freedom, rule justly, and make sound in- vestments in people.\u2019 USAID, \u2018Summary of FY 2007 Budget and Program Overview\u2019, document available at: http://www.usaid. gov/policy/budget/cbj2007/ summary.html.

        "3 ship, not in paternalism.\u2019 The political context in which develop- ment aid intervenes must be rigorously analysed and, in particu- lar, structural causes of potential instability of a country (ethnic hatreds; problems of non-renewal of elites; etc.) should be identi- fied so that they can be addressed. It should be noted that this attention paid to the political context and to governance as condi- tions for effective aid follows the lines drawn by multilateral insti- tutions, in particular by the World Bank, starting in the mid- to late 1990s. A recent and concrete example of this approach can be found in Nepal. In 2005, the American approach (Department of State and USAID) was to support King Gyanendra both politically and materially. Then, as the country sunk into crisis, analysis of the cir- cumstances led to the formulation of the view that the king was in fact part of the problem; and all of the in-country programmes \u2013 political support and development aid \u2013 were subsequently re-ori- ented so as to put pressure on him. Finally, Washington redistrib- uted funds from its development assistance budgets (health, edu- cation) to support the peace process. More generally, transformational diplomacy logically brings about a redeploy- ment of expenditures from straight-up development to more political concerns (border security, strengthening of police and justice, etc.). But to do so \u2013 and therein lies the second aspect of the question \u2013 American foreign assistance tools would need to be used in a coordinated fashion so that they can fulfil more political objec- tives. Condoleezza Rice\u2019s ambition is to bring an end to the crisis in American development aid described earlier, and that crisis can be summed up by one word: incoherence. The Secretary of State therefore created a new coordination position, that of Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA), who has both the responsibilities of USAID Director and development assistance \u2018czar\u2019, with authority over all State Department and USAID programmes and guidance power over the MCA and the Office of the Global AIDS Coordina- tor. This Director of Foreign Assistance, whose hierarchical status is equivalent to that of a Deputy Secretary of State, has been tasked with creating order in the highly chaotic American development aid world. His main working tool to do so is the Foreign Assistance Framework (see Annex 4), 72 a grid that must be followed by all. More specifically, his mission is to find a way to clarify the United States\u2019 assistance policy for each country, including by the 36 Transformational diplomacy 72.

        "3 creation of an extensive indicator for all expenditures and all American programmes (which currently does not exist), a crucial condition to elaborate a global strategy with respect to each coun- try. This strategy, instead of being developed through its own bureaucratic prism, as is currently the case, will adapt itself to the nature of the country at hand. To do this, six country categories have been created: 1. \u2018Rebuilding countries\u2019, i.e., countries in post-conflict recon- struction 2. \u2018Developing countries\u2019, i.e., low-income developing countries, not yet eligible for the MCA 3. \u2018Transforming countries\u2019, i.e., countries undergoing transfor- mation and fulfilling MCA criteria 4. \u2018Sustaining partner countries\u2019, i.e., pivotal countries with aver- age or high-average income, for which American support aims to bolster peace and progress (counter- terrorism, drugs, etc.) 5. \u2018Restrictive countries\u2019, i.e., countries that restrict access and where serious governance problems exist 6. \u2018Global or regional\u2019 is a sixth category making it possible to envi- sion regional or global initiatives, going beyond borders. The country-by-country strategy will be broken down into five year plans and yearly operational plans. The objective clearly is to get rid of programme duplication and increase the effectiveness of the initiatives that had, until now, been chaotically carried out by Washington. These initiatives must also be organised according to a five-category grid, taken directly from the MCC: 1. Peace and security 2. Governing justly and democratically 3. Investing in people 4. Economic growth 5. Humanitarian assistance. Announced on 19 January 2006, the position of DFA was filled quickly, and Randall Tobias was confirmed by the Senate on 29 March 2006 (he had to resign abruptly on 27 April 2007). But it should be emphasised that this is only stage one in the Secretary of State\u2019s plans. If this position was created without going before Congress, it is due to a long-term three-step strategy, put together by Condoleezza Rice\u2019s advisers, with regard to Congress: (cid:90) Step One: create the DFA position and appoint Randall Tobias. 37 Development aid \u2013 the second component of transformational diplomacy CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 37 ",
        "3 USAID did not take this reform well, seeing it as another step towards putting it under the control of the State Department, or even another attempt to make the agency fully disappear. In fact, Condoleezza Rice took the initiative to organise an unusual townhall meeting with USAID employees to reassure them, on the very day the creation of the DFA position was announced. She emphasised the fact that the USAID administrator has his offices in the State Department is not new and, on the contrary, his higher hierarchical position will provide the agency with increased importance. Nevertheless: this reform does amount to a \u2018semi-fusion\u2019. 73 (cid:90) Step Two: internal rationalisation of programmes, implemen- tation of the new grid, shared by the State Department and USAID, organised by type of action and by country (see earlier and Annex 4) to obtain the desired all-encompassing indica- tor. (cid:90) Step Three: in the autumn of 2006, after the midterm elections, intensify discussions with Congress, and present the first results, with the goal of having the following project endorsed at the start of 2007 for fiscal year 2008: a reform of development assistance procedures, with a country by country presentation and the option of making it easier to define adapted strategies. The long-term vision clearly appears to not only serve the pur- pose of bringing more internal coherence and making develop- ment aid programmes better coordinated and more \u2018political\u2019, but also to increase \u2018external\u2019 coherence, to loosen the Congres- sional earmarking stranglehold by using the assistance indica- tor for each country. It will, for instance, become difficult for a senator to justify a high subsidy granted to a cultural organisa- tion in his state to act in a given country if the official priority for that country is strengthening the rule of law or improving agri- cultural productivity. Or, to put it in the very diplomatic terms used in DFA office fact sheet: \u2018The budgeting practices we are establishing with this reform will provide Congress with more detailed, timely and accurate information. In doing so, Congress will be better positioned to make informed decisions about how their budgeting priorities fit into a comprehensive picture of U.S. government foreign assistance.\u2019 74 38 Transformational diplomacy 73. \u2018Transforming Foreign Aid for the 21st Century: New Recom- mendations from the Brookings- CSIS Task Force \u2013 A Brookings- CSIS-Center for U.S. Global Engagement Briefing\u2019, op. cit. 74. in \u2018Frequently Asked Ques- tions About US Foreign Assistance Reform\u2019,15 June 2006, http:// www.state.gov/f/releases/fact- sheets2006/67947.htm.

        "3 What have been the results of the reforms brought to American development aid through transformational diplomacy? As far as the bureaucratic issue is concerned, although there is no disagree- ment about the diagnosis of the chaos described earlier, or about the inability of American assistance to serve strategic objectives, and although many observers are delighted with the new DFA position, criticism, and more specifically expressions of scepti- cism, are in no short supply. The biggest unknown is Congress: many observers doubt members of Congress are really willing to endorse the reform, even if the new November 2006 Democratic majority is less hostile to development aid than the Republican majority was. The cold and sometimes hostile reaction to the pres- entation of the FY 2008 budget by Randall Tobias before Congress on 8 March 2007, is not very encouraging in this regard. Represen- tative Tom Lantos, the chairman of the House Committee on For- eign Affairs, said Congress was disappointed with the results, and blamed Tobias for \u2018making drastic changes under a shroud of secrecy and announcing them only after they were done. (\u2026) Con- gress has been provided with nothing more than a cursory overview of the fundamental foreign aid restructuring process \u2013 mere notification of steps already taken, decisions already made. We are not a potted plant watching the Administration function. We are part of the decision-making process.\u2019 75 (The reaction to Mr. Tobias\u2019s presentation of reforms underway was more positive the same day in the afternoon, before the House Appropriations Sub- committee on Foreign Operations). 76 Tobias\u2019s resignation a few weeks later was another setback for the reform. Few representatives and senators really care about these issues, and many benefit from the current earmark system, which allows them to please some of their constituencies. From a political standpoint, conservative elected officials still dislike development aid, in any way, shape, or form, while some liberal politicians are asking if the reform is not in fact trying to make all development aid disappear and replace it with exclusively political objectives. In short, it is not certain that Capitol Hill has a majority of congress- men and senators willing to defend and support the reform wanted by Condoleezza Rice \u2013 even if certain senators are known for their nonpartisan support. In a way, it could be said that the American foreign aid system is indeed broken, but not broken enough for a law of the scope of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 to be adopted.

        "3 standard for bureaucratic reorganisation \u2013 had significantly less- ened the inter-military rivalry that had led to disasters in Vietnam, or in Iran in1980, by changing the structure of the military com- mand, especially in a situation of \u2018divided government\u2019, i.e. of cohabitation between a Republican executive branch and a Demo- cratic legislative branch. Other critical or sceptical observers of the ongoing bureau- cratic reorganisation highlight its shortcomings: the DFA may have power to \u2018set the course\u2019 for the MCA and AIDS and malaria funds, but it does not have \u2018authority\u2019 over them. It does not have authority over the Pentagon\u2019s own aid budgets either. And there is no way it could contest the political distribution of \u2018foreign aid\u2019 funds to partner countries in the war on terror such as Pak- istan and Indonesia, and no way it could challenge the funds appropriated for Israel or Egypt. In short, increased coordina- tion is welcome, but it only applies to a small part of American foreign aid \u2013 a part which, when compared to the expenditures for Iraq, is very low. But even this coordination function is criti- cised. First internally, by employees who feel that, under the cover of unification, the five categories of objectives taken from the MCA have created new \u2018stovepipes\u2019, lacking the finesse to adapt to specific situations. Then externally: coordination with other contributors and multilateral organisations remains weak, and that constitutes an obstacle for the overall effective- ness of foreign aid. One last set of criticisms focuses on the increased politicisa- tion of aid. Transformational development, by putting the focus on governance and politics, raises a host of problems: risk of los- ing sight of the objectives of \u2018pure\u2019 development (agriculture, healthcare, education, poverty etc); risk of a nationalist reaction against a perceived political interference masquerading as devel- opment aid (see above); increased loss of neutrality for NGOs working with USAID; etc. More generally, although it is not all that difficult to dig wells and change agricultural methods, focusing on areas related to governance (the justice system, for instance), at the heart of states\u2019 sovereignty, raises far more for- midable political and concrete problems. But this is an objection that can be made to the concept of transformational diplomacy as a whole. 40 Transformational diplomacy CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 40 ",
        "3 Democracy promotion programmes: another pillar of transformational diplomacy Democracy promotion programmes are of course included in the perimeter of the ongoing reforms at the State Department and USAID. Democratisation, as we have seen, is at the core of the con- cept of \u2018transformation\u2019, even if it goes further than that concept. And Condoleezza Rice systematically mentions democracy and good governance support programmes when she brings up trans- formational diplomacy. The same mix of ideological evolution over the past few years (elections are not enough) and of the imper- ative for bureaucratic reforms that exists in the area of develop- ment aid can be found here. Closely tied to the foreign aid pro- grammes, democracy-support initiatives therefore will naturally undergo the same alignment initiated by Randall Tobias, the same efforts at creating political coherence \u2013 starting with the imple- mentation of the five objectives categories and five countries cate- gories (plus the 6 th regional category) grid. Yet here, once again, the diversity of programmes and institutions is such that the ongoing reforms may end up having a limited impact. It is estimated that the American government currently spends between $1.4 and 2 billion a year on democratisation support, which represents a significant increase compared with previous years \u2013 even if, as we have noted, the Clinton administration had also gone down this road, coming at the end of the second term to conclusions surprisingly similar to those the Bush administration is drawing now (i.e., need for nation building and post-conflict reconstruction, the importance of democracy support, see Chap- ter One). 77 But these expenditures are very fragmented, and mul- tiple institutions are working on \u2018democratic transformation\u2019 of other countries. At the Department of State, under the leadership of the Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs, Paula Dobri- ansky (Condoleezza Rice added \u2018Democracy\u2019 to her title), the main agency in charge of democratisation efforts is the Office of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (or DRL), headed by Assis- tant Secretary Barry Lowenkron \u2013 who also covers religious free- dom issues. Beyond the public reports it produces (such as the yearly Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and Supporting Human Rights and Democracy: The US Record 78 ), this Office, which has no personnel in the field, acts through financing short-term 41 Development aid \u2013 the second component of transformational diplomacy 77.

        "3 democracy promotion programmes (monitoring elections, sup- porting parliaments, etc.) and in crisis situations. To do so, it has significant sums at its disposal: $86 million a year, half of it com- ing from the Human Rights and Democracy Fund , established by Con- gress in 1998, and manages up to $120 million coming from other budgetary sources. Beyond its budget, the DRL has important assets that should not be overlooked. Its credit lines are flexible: for instance, it released funds for Nepal in only six weeks, and almost immedi- ately for Lebanon. As a result, it appears as the showcase of trans- formational diplomacy. Its budget, it should noted, is not overly burdened by earmarks; and when it is, the earmarks are for coun- tries as a whole, not for specific NGOs or objectives. That being said, one of its problems still remains the obligation of spending \u2018for\u2019 countries such as China, Iran, Syria, and Cuba, where Ameri- can aid is not authorised; it must therefore work indirectly or in the periphery, on the longer term (support for dissident NGOs, welcoming visitors from that country to the United States, confer- ences, etc.) The fact remains that the DRL budgets will have to fit into the \u2018Tobias reform\u2019 (grid with 5 or 6 types of countries / 5 objectives, see Annex 4), to increase the global transformative effect of American policies. 79 But the State Department has other democratisation support programmes that would be difficult to redirect in a flexible man- ner. This is the case for the SEED (Support for East European Democracy) funds, which support democratic transition in East- ern Europe, and of those tied to the Freedom Support Act (FSA), of transition support for former USSR countries. SEED and FSA are co-managed by the State Department and USAID and represented $865 million in 2006 (715 requested for 2007). The Special Coor- dinator for Assistance to Europe and Eurasia, working from the Bureau for European and Eurasian Affairs, has a central role to play here. Looking at the Middle East, the MEPI (Middle East Part- nership Initiative) programme, launched in 2002 (approxima- tively $75 million a year) and the BMENA (Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative) programme, a multilateral G8 pro- gramme launched in June 2004 at Sea Island, all cover the democ- ratisation field. This plethora of programmes naturally goes beyond the Department of State. USAID, through its Office of Democracy and Governance, its Office of Transition Initiatives, and its 42 Transformational diplomacy 79. On occasion, the DRL will also work for S/CRS, the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization described ear- lier, by investigating human rights in countries undergoing recon- struction.

        "3 regional offices, has imposed itself in recent years as the most important actor in the area of democratisation, with a total budget of $1.3 billion \u2013 and claims its precedence and dominant position loud and clear, if only to bring in the funds that go with the new American foreign policy directions. \u2018Transformational diplomacy incorporates the goals of the President\u2019s Freedom Agenda, seeking to build and sustain dem- ocratic, well-governed states. (\u2026) USAID is the world\u2019s largest democracy promotion donor and the primary U.S. Government implementer of the Freedom Agenda. In most transformational development situations, some democratic progress has been made.\u2019 80 USAID organises its \u2018transformational\u2019 programmes into four objectives: strengthening the rule of law and respect for human rights; promoting elections and more honest and competitive electoral processes; speeding up development of a politically active civil society; and, finally, promoting more transparent gov- ernance. All these actions will easily find their place in categories 1, 2, and 3 of the \u2018Tobias Reform\u2019 (see Annex 4). But, although all the programmes mentioned earlier, both State Department and USAID, will bear the impact of transformational diplomacy, other programmes and other democracy promotion actors will elude the ongoing reforms, much like the situation in the development aid field. This will be the case, of course, for the Millennium Challenge Account governance and democracy programmes, over which the Director of Foreign Assistance only has, as previously mentioned, supervisory powers. It will also be the case for the National Endow- ment for Democracy (NED), a non-governmental agency created by Ronald Reagan in 1983 and which acts through its four branches managed by the Republican and the Democratic parties, unions and business leaders. 81 Although independent, NED draws most of its funds from Congress, to the tune of $74 million in 2006. While its budget is increasing significantly, some elected officials want to cut it altogether, believing that it would be better spent by governmental agencies directly \u2026 and could thereby also be rationalised into the transformational diplomacy framework. Within the federal administration itself, other cabinet depart- ments and other agencies have their own democratisation pro- 43 Development aid \u2013 the second component of transformational diplomacy 80.

        "3 grammes which will elude the \u2018Tobias Reform\u2019, starting with the Pentagon (in particular the IMET training programme \u2013 Interna- tional Military Education and Training), but also the Department of Justice, the Labor Department (international programmes on the rights of workers), etc. Finally, numerous NGOs and some consulting firms or private companies (Freedom House, Carter Center, Research Triangle Institute, Chemonics, university cen- tres, etc.) receive American government funds for democracy sup- port, either through the aforementioned agencies or through other institutions: their undertakings will not always be coordi- nated within the transformational diplomacy framework. Democratic governance support projects Around the Policy Planning Staff of Stephen Krasner, who, as men- tioned earlier, was one of Condoleezza Rice\u2019s main advisors on these issues until March 2007, the idea of a kind of mechanism or interna- tional set-up of governance support, possibly located in one of the major existing international organisations, emerged in 2006. Since this project has still not come to fruition, we are only mentioning it for what it can teach us about transformational diplomacy. This project organises the convergence of development aid and democracy promotion in the way that, to a certain degree, the Mil- lennium Challenge Account (see above) did, and for which Stephen Krasner was a sort of godfather. To deal with the prob- lems arising out of failed states, democracy in the shape of organ- ising elections is vital, but it is only a starting point, as discussed earlier. In the long term, \u2018effective\u2019 democracies rest upon solid institutions, the rule of law, separation of powers, recognised and protected property rights, a free and independent press, civil soci- ety organisations, etc. Beyond even these checks and balances, it is essential that the State provide the population with the essential services it needs (security, justice, education, healthcare, etc.). Therefore, to establish and consolidate sustainable democracies, it is necessary to help weak states improve their governance and provide these services. Or, to quote Condoleezza Rice in her address before the House Appropriations subcommittee on 21 March 2007: \u2018Democracy is not just the next election; democracy is the development of institutions and it is the ability of democratic countries to deliver for their people.\u2019 82 44 Transformational diplomacy 82.

        "3 Hence the idea to bring together a group of countries ready to provide other states \u2013 via this international set-up whose exact parameters still need to be defined \u2013 with governance services and advice such as training civil servants, identifying good practices, audits, centres of excellence, etc., and perhaps more directly with governance services by public or private entities, as is already the case on an informal basis in many countries. All of this of course while respecting the Secretary of State\u2019s guiding rule: \u2018transforma- tional diplomacy is rooted in partnership; not in paternalism. In doing things with people, not for them\u2019 (see Annex 1). It remains to be seen whether it is indeed possible to escape this substitution effect and help with good governance while avoiding sovereignty and interference problems that, beyond the stated respect for the wishes of recipient countries, could be raised (the failure of the agreement between the World Bank and Chad on the distribution of oil resources is there to remind us of it). In other words, this project, if it does come to fruition, risks reflecting the larger problem of transformational diplomacy, that of the scope of the international community, and especially of the West, to act on other countries by going beyond foreign policy to focus on the very structure of these countries. 45 Development aid \u2013 the second component of transformational diplomacy CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 45 ",

        "Rebuilding a stabilisation and reconstruction tool \u2013 the third component of transformational diplomacy Although geographic redeployment, development aid reform, and the creation of the Director of Foreign Assistance position were announced when the concept of transformational diplomacy was formulated in January 2006, the reform of the stabilisation and reconstruction tool predates that concept. But that does not make it any less closely tied to it: what could be more transformational than the capability to rebuild a war-torn country, and also to democratise a dictatorship that has just been overthrown (Afghanistan, Iraq)? Here we reach the very heart of the Bush doc- trine continuum (regime change \u2013 democratisation \u2013 requirements of nation building \u2013 support for good governance and responsible sovereignty). The revamping of stabilisation and reconstruction efforts, started in 2004 with the creation of the S/CRS position (Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilisation under the direct authority of the Secretary of State 83 ) thereby naturally found its place under the \u2018transformational diplomacy\u2019 label in the Secre- tary of State\u2019s speeches and initiatives. The shock of April 2003: from the illusion of spontaneous democracy to the creation of S/CRS The origin of this reform is perfectly clear: it lies in the resounding failure of \u2018Phase IV\u2019 of the intervention in Iraq, i.e., the civilian occu- pation and reconstruction phase. Countless soldiers have testified along those lines: they were convinced that as the fighting came to an end, teams of civilians would progressively come to help them and then gradually replace them to gently facilitate the transition of Iraqi society from tyranny to democracy. Among so many others, we can quote the testimony of Colonel Chris Conlin from the Marine Corps in Najaf: 47 Transformational diplomacy 83. The \u2018S/\u2019 means that the Coor- dinator works directly for the Sec- retary of State. 4 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 47 ",

I looked at myself in the mirror one day and realized I\u2019ve never been trained to do this. We were out there with 3,500 troops, and if we had had 5-20 civilians with us to give us these capabilities and under- stand how to approach these different issues, it would have not only given us a better capacity for a more effective response, it would have allowed us to also focus our attention on things that we in the military knew how to do.\u2019 84 It was only on 20 January 2003, two months before the invasion started, that President Bush signed Presidential Directive NSPD- 24, establishing the framework for the reconstruction of Iraq after the conflict. A very late comer to the planning process, this direc- tive was immediately controversial since, unlike what had become the norm in the 1990s, it tasked the Department of Defense with planning for stabilisation and reconstruction instead of calling on the Department of State \u2013 despite the fact that the latter had been working on that issue for close to a year under the auspices of the Future of Iraq Project . Today, there is a consensus that the Pentagon was not ready to undertake this complex assignment, and that it went about it with disconcerting amateurism. 85 President Bush\u2019s decision can be explained by his impatience with Colin Powell, whom he had entrusted with the diplomatic management of the Iraqi issue, but who had disappointed him with his lack of results. More generally speaking, the directive reflected two viewpoints specific to the Bush administration: (cid:90) on the one hand, the contempt Republicans continued to have for nation building, equating it with typically Democratic and liberal welfare programmes; (cid:90) on the other, the illusion that democracy was the norm, the default regime that would naturally implant itself throughout the world provided tyrants were overthrown (see the statements by Dick Cheney or Paul Wolfowitz about the welcome American soldiers would receive, about Iraq\u2019s capacity for paying for its own reconstruction, etc.) Paradoxically, the modern aspects of the Iraqi State \u2013 a satisfying degree of education, a competent ruling class, a solid administrative structure, etc. \u2013 that the Iraqi 48 Transformational diplomacy 84.

To be fair, shocking though President Bush\u2019s attitude of dis- carding the experience acquired under Clinton in the 1990s (Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo) may be, that same Clinton administration only became competent in this area late in the game: each nation-building operation had its share of problems, but each operation was better organised than the previous one, and, slowly, institutional amnesia \u2013 the main scourge in this area \u2013 had subsided. In May 1997, Presidential Directive PDD/NSC-56 on Complex Contigency Operations had specified the interagency and civilian-military coordination mechanisms: the National Security Council (NSC) Deputies Committee 86 was responsible for setting up an ad hoc executive committee in charge of putting together an integrated political-military plan and doing the follow-through on each operation. The considerable loss of experience and effectiveness due to the refusal of the Bush administration to take advantage of this legacy led several Senators (notably, Joe Biden, Richard Lugar and John Warner), by mid 2003, after several months of muddled opera- tions in Iraq, to start thinking about an interagency structure for managing stabilisation and reconstruction operations. Since America embarks on a new nation-building venture every 18 months, why not create a permanent coordination structure able to conduct these operations in good conditions? But it was finally the Bush administration itself, faced with the huge scope of prob- lems, that forestalled legislation. On 5 August 2004, following an April 2004 NSC decision, Colin Powell announced the official creation of the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS), entrusted to ambassador Carlos Pascual \u2013 an office placed within the State Department, right alongside the Secretary of State. Congress endorsed this new office in December 2004 through its finance bill for fiscal year 2005. 87 Over the course of the following year, President Bush increasingly showed his support for S/CRS. For instance, in May 2005, in front of the International Republican Institute (one of the branches of the NED, see earlier), he spoke of S/CRS as one of the cornerstones of his democratisation policy, thereby implicitly recognising that such a position was sorely lack- 49 Rebuilding a stabilisation and reconstruction tool 86. i.e. the Committee bringing together the \u2018Number 2\u2019 of the State Department, the Pentagon, the CIA, etc. The Committee is chaired by the NSC \u2018Number 2\u2019. 87. 2005 Appropriations Law: P.L. 108-447, Sec. 408, available no- tably at http://clinton.senate. gov/features/darfur/docu- ments/2004.12.08_Consoli- dated_Approps_Act_2005.pdf#s e a r c h = % 2 2 P L % 2 0 1 0 8 - 447%2C%20FY05%20Appropria- tion%2C%20Sec.%20408%22.

Democratic change can arrive suddenly \u2013 and that means our government must be able to move quickly to provide needed assistance\u2019 88 ). More importantly, at the end of 2005, George W. Bush took two far-reaching decisions. (cid:90) On 28 November 2005, he launched the \u2018DoD 3000.05\u2019 initia- tive (Annex 7), which raises stabilisation missions (and more specifically Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction or SSTR operations) to a priority rank equivalent to that of combat operations for the Pentagon (see Chapter Five), committing the Department of Defense to transform both administratively and culturally - and giving it in particular the mission to coordinate with S/CRS. (cid:90) A few days later, on 7 December 2005, President Bush signed directive NSPD-44 (Annex 8), which cancelled and replaced Clinton\u2019s PDD/NSC-56 (see above), set the general framework in which the State Department, and not the Pentagon or the NSC, is the lead agency, 89 and in which S/CRS\u2019s authority and jurisdiction are asserted. \u2018The United States has a significant stake in enhancing the capacity to assist in stabilizing and reconstructing countries or regions, especially those at risk of, in, or in transition from con- flict or civil strife, and to help them establish a sustainable path toward peaceful societies, democracies, and market economies. \u2026 To achieve maximum effect, a focal point is needed \u2026 The Sec- retary of State shall coordinate and lead integrated United States Government efforts, involving all U.S. Departments and Agencies with relevant capabilities, to prepare, plan for, and conduct stabilization and reconstruction activities.\u2019 (see full text in Annex 8). Finally, in her 18 January 2006 speech (Annex 1), the Secretary of State clearly placed the Office of the Coordinator for Recon- struction and Stabilisation within the framework of transforma- tional diplomacy. Mentioning the challenges of civilian action in operations in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo, she highlighted \u2018the need to enhance our ability to work more effectively at the crit- ical intersections of diplomacy, democracy promotion, economic 50 Transformational diplomacy 88. \u2018We must also improve the re- sponsiveness of our government to help nations emerging from tyranny and war. Democratic change can arrive suddenly \u2013 and that means our government must be able to move quickly to provide needed assistance. So last sum- mer, my administration estab- lished a new Office of Reconstruc- tion and Stabilization in the State Department, led by Ambassador Carlos Pascual. This new office is charged with coordinating our government\u2019s civilian efforts to meet an essential mission: helping the world\u2019s newest democracies make the transition to peace and freedom and a market economy.\u2019 See: http://www.whitehouse. gov/news/releases/2005/05/ 20050518-2.html. 89. The directive also sets up an in- teragency Policy Coordination Com- mittee , chaired by the Coordinator but in close conjunction with the NSC, to work on implementing the directive.

        "4 reconstruction and military security. That is why President Bush created within the State Department the Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization.\u2019 S/CRS as the ultimate transformational tool: operational principles To open shop in 2005-2006, S/CRS had to deal with two major challenges. First a timeline contradiction: the office was born out of the sudden realisation that long-term stabilisation and recon- struction capabilities were sorely lacking in the Iraqi context. In other words, it was caught between, on the one hand, the rush to use the new capabilities to remedy the crisis situation as quickly as possible and, on the other, the patient effort needed for institu- tional construction, the only guarantee for solidity and sustain- ability. To add to this time paradox, the high hopes and favourable winds that buoyed up S/CRS at its beginnings, in Congress and public opinion \u2013 at a time when everyone agreed on the need to strengthen American capabilities in this area \u2013 quickly faded as the situation in Iraq deteriorated, to the point that even before it was able to reach its full scope, the value and relevance of such an office was, if not contested, at the very least minimised, the appetite for interventions abroad having considerably receded. Despite sup- port from the President and the Secretary of State in their speeches, S/CRS did not benefit from any meaningful lobbying of Congress (other than that of the military, as we shall see) where the focus, starting in 2004, was not on figuring out how to better conduct sta- bilisation operations, but on how to avoid doing any. As a consequence of these two paradoxes, S/CRS was not involved in the major crises (Iraq and Afghanistan) that started just before it was created and were much too large in scale to be handled exclusively by it- which made sense, but deprived it of an opportunity to impose its authority naturally, by showing its use- fulness. As a result, its first steps have been very modest, and of a largely consultative nature. In 2005-2006, S/CRS sent a team to Sudan to evaluate the effectiveness of aid programmes for the Abuja process; it helped organise and monitor elections in Haiti; it undertook an audit of the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) in Afghanistan; it helped the embassy in Chad with post-conflict 51 Rebuilding a stabilisation and reconstruction tool CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 51 ",
        "4 planning; and it sent teams to Lebanon to coordinate mine removal and police support operations, after being denied the right to coordinate the crisis management operations during the July-August 2006 crisis. The second existential issue S/CRS had to deal with was that of what model it should adopt. Essentially, this office could operate along the lines of one of three models: (cid:90) According to a first model, S/CRS could become a vast agency, with several hundred or thousand employees, that would take on responsibility for stabilisation and reconstruction efforts, develop capabilities for all of those missions, and impose itself as a sort of civilian Pentagon, as a colonial office. This model seems to have been in the minds of some decision-makers in 2004. (cid:90) According to a second model, S/CRS could become a sort of pas- sive repository for knowledge, experience and skills in nation building, a storehouse for institutional experience acquired in this domain, in short a large resource database that other actors could call upon when they had to conduct reconstruction and stabilisation operations. (cid:90) According to a third model, representing the middle way that was finally chosen, S/CRS could become a coordination agency at the centre of the efforts of all the other actors, without taking their places. The role of S/CRS is not only to lead thinking and planning but also to integrate and make all the necessary ele- ments for complex peacekeeping and reconstruction opera- tions, both in Washington and in the field, work together. This setup creates other problems (including authority and influ- ence, and attracting talent) as we will see. \u2018Our job,\u2019 explains Marcia Wong of S/CRS, \u2018is not to duplicate the work of other agencies nor take their place. Our job is to serve as a force multiplier so that all agencies involved can do their jobs better. In other words, we aim to improve the way our government organizes itself to address the full spectrum of con- flict \u2013 from prevention to response\u2019. 90 This choice explains that S/CRS is currently made up of more or less 75 employees (15 permanent positions, 48 contractors, 12 seconded) coming from the State Department, but also from USAID, the Pentagon, the Army, the Army Corps of Engineers, the 52 Transformational diplomacy 90.

        "4 Department of Justice, the Treasury Department, the Department of Labor, and the CIA (15 additional permanent positions were requested for 2007). S/CRS has four main tasks: watchfulness and early alert; planning; lessons learned and best practices; and, finally, crisis response strategy and integrated resource manage- ment. The S/CRS leadership emphasises the importance of the sec- ond mission: although planning is a common practice for the mil- itary, it is insufficiently developed on the civilian side 91 \u2013 and plan- ning is useful for crisis management, and made easier when the crisis is foreseeable (S/CRS has, for instance, led an exercise on post-Castro Cuba). A great deal of thought about this planning work has led to putting together a concise matrix of all the tasks that may need to be taken up: this is the Post-Conflict Reconstruction Essential Tasks Matrix , reproduced in Annex 5. This matrix is inter- esting not only as an abstract exercise, but also because it offers a shared planning framework for all military and civilian efforts, as well as a way to acquire a \u2018common language\u2019 that was previously non-existent. Since S/CRS is still in its development phase two years after it was created, it is difficult to describe its modus operandi . Some proj- ects have been abandoned, others altered along the way. But we can briefly mention on the one hand the three pillars that should ultimately be the backbone of the \u2018operational\u2019 functions of the Office (functions which, it should be noted, only represent part of its sphere of activities), and, on the other, the longer-term con- cepts about which S/CRS is thinking. (cid:90) First pillar: an Active Response Corps that would be made up of State Department personnel with crisis management training and able to bring their expertise into the field as \u2018first respon- ders\u2019 alongside embassy personnel (provided there is an embassy) and especially alongside the troops on the ground. This corps already exists within S/CRS; it is made up of a dozen agents (several are on assignment in Darfur), and the goal is to bring that number up to a hundred or so. The corps would, in a way, be the State Department counterpart of USAID\u2019s DART teams, that are preformed and can be deployed immediately. (cid:90) Second pillar: Advance Civilian Teams (ACTs), drawn from the ranks of all federal agencies \u2013 and no longer from the sole Department of State \u2013 and who could be sent into the field to implement the first stages of the plan, in conjunction with the 53 Rebuilding a stabilisation and reconstruction tool 91.

        "4 military. These ACTS are in the process of being set up. (cid:90) Third, far more ambitious pillar: the Civilian Reserve Corps , a kind of non-military National Guard, made up private sector experts \u2013 engineers, technicians, doctors, judges, etc. \u2013 trained in the way the Reserves\u2019 \u2018weekend warriors\u2019 are, and who could be called up to run the technical aspects of nation-building operations. 92 The idea would be to have a civilian reserve of about 3,000 peo- ple. But so far, this corps has not seen the light of day \u2013 $25 mil- lion have been requested to create it in 2007. In the interim, a large database is being put together, the \u2018Global Skills Network\u2019, which catalogues and identifies all existing reconstruction and stabilisation contracts, and therefore all purveyors with skills and/or capabilities in this area. In addition, S/CRS is thinking about other organisational models for the longer term, in particular to improve coordination between governmental agencies. For instance, the Country Recon- struction and Stabilisation Group would organize interagency meet- ings around a Deputy Secretary to focus on a country and guaran- tee coordination between all relevant actors. At the operational level, the concept of Civilian-Military Planning Teams would inte- grate civilian interagency teams into a regional command (CENT- COM, EUCOM, PACOM, etc.) to work on integrated planning from the very beginning of military preparations for possible action. Whatever the final organisation of its operational teams may be, S/CRS has emphasised the need to act in a flexible, and more importantly, a fast manner. It is in this hope that it has been asking Congress, for two years now, to fund a Conflict Response Fund ($75 million requested for 2007) that would allow it to intervene at the beginning of a crisis, or even before it happens. To end this brief description of S/CRS\u2019s activities, let us high- light the careful way in which it seeks to improve coordination in multinational (or even multilateral) operations, that have become the rule rather than the exception. S/CRS is a very active partici- pant in Multinational Experiments (MNE), under the leadership of the Joint Forces Command (JFCOM), which aim to build and sug- gest new coordination mechanisms for peacekeeping, stabilisa- tion, and reconstruction operations undertaken with multiple partners (in a concentric circles pattern: several parts of the armed forces, several agencies, several countries, several multilateral 54 Transformational diplomacy 92. Once deployed, these private individuals become \u2018government officials\u2019 for the duration of their service. CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 54 ",
        "4 organisations). The fourth experimentation cycle, MNE4, took place in spring 2006. Eight countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, Australia, Finland, and Sweden) took part, along with an observer, NATO. As for the EU and NATO, they were also involved as observers, but only of unclassified efforts. In addition, S/CRS says it is getting ready to work with the new UN Peace Consolidation Commission, to offer it its services \u2026 if American political decision-makers ask it to do so. Problems, obstacles and criticism: why S/CRS is having a hard time getting off the ground Beyond the short-term difficulties encountered during its creation (short-term/long-term paradox, ambiguity as to the model it should follow \u2013 see above), S/CRS has encountered several political obstacles since it was created, to the point that it has not experi- enced the fast rise that could have been expected, given the blatant need for its existence. The two most obvious symptoms of this dif- ficult birth are, on the one hand, the somewhat premature depar- ture of its first director, ambassador Carlos Pascual, who only stayed a year and a half in the job (from summer 2004 to January 2006) and was only replaced in May 2006 by another ambassador, John Herbst, who has wide personal experience but who is some- times described as less well connected with decision-makers, and, on the other hand, very inadequate funding. It is clear that if there had been a desire to create a real stabilisation and reconstruction agency (model 1 in the typology described earlier), a multi-billion dollar budget should have been appropriated. But, even without going that far, the low level of the sums made available for S/CRS denotes a persistent scepticism from Congress (and possibly even from the Secretary of State). (cid:90) For fiscal year 2005 \u2013 that of its effective creation \u2013 S/CRS worked with a total budget of $12.8 million. (cid:90) For fiscal year 2006, the Bush administration asked Congress for $121.4 million to support reconstruction and stabilisation operations ($21 million for the operational budget, including personnel, and $100 million for the aforementioned Conflict Response Fund ). It only obtained $16.6 million. (cid:90) For fiscal year 2007, the administration is once again asking for 55 Rebuilding a stabilisation and reconstruction tool CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 55 ",
        "4 $20 million for the operational budget and $75 million for the Conflict Response Fund . 93 As a result, it is paradoxically the Pentagon that has kept S/CRS afloat, showing the American military\u2019s desire to be helped with, if not relieved of, stabilisation and reconstruction tasks in future operations. In her speech of 18 January 2006, Condoleezza Rice announced the authorisation Congress had given the Secretary of Defense to retrocede up to $100 million to S/CRS over fiscal years 2006 and 2007 in order to support reconstruction and stabilisa- tion operations. 94 This shortage of funds can be explained by the preferences of Congress \u2013 that will be described below \u2013 but also by the Secretary of State\u2019s lukewarm commitment. \u2018 We have an expansive vision for this new office ,\u2019 she claimed in her speech on transformational diplomacy (Annex 1), \u2018 and let there be no doubt, we are committed to realizing it .\u2019 Yet when Congress refused the requested funds for fis- cal year 2006 operations ($24 million requested), indicating it meant for this money to come out of the State Department\u2019s over- all budget, the Secretary of State found only $6.2 million for the S/CRS\u2019s efforts. 95 More generally, we can consider that Con- doleezza Rice has invested more political capital, especially in Congress, in the \u2018development aid reform\u2019 component than into the \u2018reconstruction and stabilisation\u2019 component of transforma- tional diplomacy. Nevertheless, responsibility for appropriating specific funds for each part of the executive, for each executive agency, still lies with Congress, and Congress could have provided S/CRS with a more solid starting base. Congress\u2019 reticence to fund the new Office can be explained by several factors. First, especially as far as the Conflict Response Fund is concerned, those who hold the purse strings never like financing projects without knowing exactly where the money is going. This reticence can also be explained by a general prejudice towards the Depart- ment of State: Congressmen are (almost) always ready to fund the Pentagon\u2019s activities, and are instinctively suspicious of requests coming from the Department of State, which is systematically sus- pected \u2013 especially by Republicans \u2013 of ineffectiveness, if not insubordination, when it receives the president\u2019s directives. As a result, Carlos Pascual, and now John Herbst, have to lobby Con- gress accompanied by senior military commanders, who are a 56 Transformational diplomacy 93.

As a matter of fact, today the best advocates for an increase in the power of S/CRS are Iraq veterans, who are the best placed to convince Representa- tives and Senators of the inanity of the tasks they have to under- take on the ground. The Pentagon is not competing with S/CRS on this, but instead wants to see civilian reconstruction capabili- ties improve: the greater those capabilities are, the less it will have to do in this area. However, given the limitations of S/CRS, the military has had to take its own measures by speeding up the adap- tation and development of their own resources (see Chapter Five). Beyond the structural preference to fund the Pentagon, another reason explains Congress\u2019s lack of eagerness to support S/CRS. If part of the right has had to come around to the need for nation building, the deterioration of the situation in Iraq has made the efforts to adapt stabilisation and reconstruction tools suspect: if the adventurous policies advocated by the neoconserv- atives are now ruled out, then there is no longer any reason to encourage the creation of a kind of \u2018colonial office\u2019 that would make it easier to envision future interventions. On the left, the same reasoning is going on: the United States\u2019 \u2018imperial\u2019 or even \u2018colonial\u2019 behaviour should not be given a bureaucratic foothold. Nonetheless, the change of majority in Congress is still rela- tively good news for S/CRS: unless the decision to simply get rid of it \u2013 on the basis that it does not work as planned \u2013 is made, a hypothesis that cannot be completely ruled out, it is likely that Democrats will want to succeed where George Bush has so spec- tacularly failed, and provide the country with the stabilisation and reconstruction tool it lacks. John Herbst may therefore find more attentive ears on Capitol Hill in the coming years, and the new Democratic control of the Appropriations Committee \u2013 the main sticking point for S/CRS \u2013 will in all likelihood make things easier. In addition to its funding problems, several observers have noted another structural obstacle to S/CRS\u2019s effectiveness: its institutional weakness. The logical place for this office, given its strong interagency makeup, would have been the NSC, which would have given it the authority of the White House. In the report written by a group of experts put together by the Council on Foreign Relations on this issue in 2005, Ivo Daalder and Susan Rice sug- gested making the reconstruction and stabilisation coordinator a Deputy National Security Advisor, rather than a mere special advi- sor to the Office of the Secretary of State. 96 But it is true also that 57 Rebuilding a stabilisation and reconstruction tool 96. \u2018In the Wake of War: Improv- ing Post-Conflict Capabilities\u2019, Report of an Independent Task Force , op. cit. note 85.

        "4 the NSC is not meant to be an \u2018executing\u2019 agency, and S/CRS does a bit more than just coordination. The fact remains that NSPD-44 (see above), by designating the State Department, and more specifically S/CRS, as the focal point for stabilisation and reconstruction coordination, ignores a well- established reality: other agencies do not like following the State Department\u2019s lead, especially when it comes from a small office. In fact, even the geographic desks at the State Department overlap with its field of operations, for instance in Africa. 97 Despite the interest of the Pentagon in S/CRS\u2019s success, an effect of bureau- cratic inertia and loss of effectiveness is to be feared. When it comes down to it, George Bush and Condoleezza Rice were trying to make headlines with NSPD-44, without being really ready to support S/CRS with all their hierarchical muscle. Instead of being spontaneously accepted as the centre of the reconstruction and stabilisation system, S/CRS is now forced to take a much less ambitious approach and to try to be accepted on its own terms. One last critique comes from specialists of reconstruction and stabilisation operations, and in particular James Dobbins. 98 This respected nation-building expert, currently working at RAND, has denounced the inability to acknowledge and appreciate the valuable contribution made by the UN in this field. According to Dobbins, the UN is the only organisation to have so much experi- ence and success in this area, and for a cost that is generally lower than that of NATO or EU operations. The reluctance to look at the contributions of the multilateral organisation constitutes a hand- icap for S/CRS, one that risks having repercussions on its ability to work with the newly created UN Peacebuilding Commission. However, through its participation in multinational experiments such as the MNE cycle, S/CRS is familiarising itself and develop- ing ties and working relationships with its multinational partners and UN agencies, and this may lead it to change its own approaches and tools. Should this slow start of S/CRS lead us to conclude that recon- struction and stabilisation operations are not a priority for trans- formational diplomacy, even though they are the missing link \u2013 both ideological and practical \u2013 between regime change and good governance support? Probably not, and for two reasons. First, put- ting such a coordination structure in place is a lengthy process \u2013 and considerable energy is currently being expended by the opera- tions in Afghanistan and Iraq. It seems likely that S/CRS will even- 58 Transformational diplomacy 97. Interview with Derek Chollet, CSIS. 98. Interview with James Dobbins, RAND. CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 58 ",
        "4 tually find its place in the long term, not as a reconstruction agency but as a facilitator and coordinator of other agencies\u2019 efforts. Second, the efforts coming from the Pentagon should be taken into account, efforts which enjoy considerably higher means than S/CRS does: this will be the focus of Chapter Five. And the Secretary of State knows that, when it comes down to it, it is always the military that will be called upon to keep the promises of transformational diplomacy in post-conflict situations. At worst, if S/CRS were to be eliminated by the next Secretary of State or ear- lier, by decision of Congress, a new structure would probably be created at the Pentagon. To conclude, it should be noted that S/CRS is not an isolated case: countries such as Canada (with its Stabilisation and Recon- struction Task Force, or START) and the United Kingdom (with its Post-Conflict Reconstruction Unit or PCRU) have equipped themselves with similar interagency civilian-military coordina- tion structures. At the international level, this concern is also at the heart of not only the creation of the UN Peacebuilding Com- mission but also of the EU\u2019s development of its ESDP tools and of the ongoing debates about the role and possible evolution of NATO. All this highlights the fact that, once again, \u2018transforma- tional diplomacy\u2019 is merely a framework and a way of rationalising a pragmatic need, which, in the new geopolitical context, affects all developed countries. 59 Rebuilding a stabilisation and reconstruction tool CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 59 ",

        "The Pentagon: where the real transformation is taking place? Strictly speaking, the Pentagon is only indirectly affected by trans- formational diplomacy, through the increased coordination that is being put in place for stabilisation and reconstruction operations. This is why this chapter will be limited to a brief assessment of some ongoing reforms at the Department of Defense, with two specific objectives. On the one hand, to show that the political impetuses for transformational diplomacy (ideological evolution of the administration and upheavals in the geopolitical context) have also had a notable, and in many ways similar, impact on the Penta- gon. On the other hand, to formulate the hypothesis that this impact on the American military could end up being more durable and more significant, in the long term, than the ongoing reforms at the State Department. It may very well be that, ultimately, it will be the armed forces which will deliver on the promises of transforma- tional diplomacy, or at least some of them. In Pentagon terminology, the concept of \u2018transformation\u2019 is not tied to the evolution of the nature of political regimes but to the modernisation of the armed forces towards greater flexibility and greater technological intensity, as mentioned in Chapter One. Following the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), developed in the 1990s, the idea of transformation was advocated by Donald Rumsfeld as soon as he arrived at the Pentagon. He created an Office of Force Transformation to follow through on this idea. The promoters of \u2018transformation\u2019 are often frustrated by the frequent reduction of this concept to a shorthand for just more technolog- ically advanced weapons. They emphasise that it is in fact a con- tinuous adaptation effort not only of weaponry but also of the use of forces, of their structure, of the means and types of cooperation with other forces, of military culture, etc. that is conceived in order to more efficiently answer the challenges posed by the new strate- gic environment. 99 The fact remains, however, that the heart of \u2018transformation\u2019 is technological intensification (missile defence, long-range strike capabilities, C4I, network-centric warfare, space 61 Transformational diplomacy 99. In April 2003, the Transforma- tion Planning Guidance document described transformation as \u2018a process that shapes the changing nature of military competition and cooperation through new combinations of concepts, capa- bilities, people, and organizations that exploit out nation\u2019s advan- tages and protect against our asymmetric vulnerabilities to sus- tain our strategic position, which helps underpin peace and stability in the world.\u2019 5 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 61 ",
        "5 capacities, etc.) and the implemention of new tactics to make the American military \u2018leaner and meaner.\u2019 From this perspective, operations Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Iraqi Freedom in Iraq, implemented in an innovative fashion (less air preparation, fewer men, more speed and accuracy, greater use of special forces) were real-scale tests of Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s theories. Yet, in fact, the \u2018transformational\u2019 \u2013 in Department of State parlance \u2013 inability of American forces in Iraq after the successful invasion of March-April 2003 was a major blow to the force \u2018trans- formation\u2019 launched by Donald Rumsfeld. How could the United States continue on the track of high technology and keep invest- ing in new sophisticated weapons systems, for the Navy and espe- cially for the Air Force, when Army infantrymen did not have suf- ficient armour for their humvees and dozens died each month at the hands of a traditional guerrilla, while at the same time trying to rebuild schools and an electricity network? If, therefore, the growing Iraqi quagmire did not deal it a fatal blow, it at least sub- stantially altered the nature of the \u2018transformation\u2019 sought by the former Secretary of Defense, by redirecting part of the budget meant for futuristic innovations towards the Army, and focusing more on adapting to counter-insurrection, fighting terrorist net- works \u2026 and nation building. 100 In the same way, the Air Force has had to downscale its \u2018high tech\u2019 dreams to return to more urgent missions: air-ground operations, strike capacity in urban areas, and more generally improving coordination with the Army. It was the Army, as well as the Marines, that suffered the brunt of the consequences for the lack of preparation for \u2018Phase IV\u2019 of the occupation (see Chapter Four). As we saw earlier, the privates were convinced that civilian forces would come and relieve them to rebuild a wealthy and stable Iraq. They ended having to lead, on their own, and with a blatant lack of manpower 101 the security- building, stabilisation, and nation-building efforts that became more and more difficult and dangerous. Sudden turnarounds took place in the situation in Iraq. For instance, in the space of a few months, the military police, which used to be one of the least appreciated corps in the military, took on vital importance for the future of the country. In the same way, units responsible for civil- military affairs \u2013 generally made up of reservists, with little train- ing \u2013 saw their role grow in importance and recognition as did, after some time, the trainers of the Iraqi security forces. This situ- ation has deeply impacted on many soldiers and officers. Coming 62 Transformational diplomacy 100. The Army, in order to avoid being on the losing side of ongo- ing reforms, had jumped onboard the 'transformation' train by modifying its structure to be more easily deployable, by turning its di- vision-based organisation into a flexible brigade-based organisa- tion. 101. One of the consequences of Donald Rumsfeld's theories was bringing the number of men sent into Iraq for the invasion to the lowest number possible. As for the occupation, the Pentagon leader- ship - and in particular Paul Wol- fowitz - had said it could not an- ticipate requiring more men than had been required for the invasion phase. See James Dobbins, op. cit.; see also Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, op. cit. CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 62 ",
        "5 after Afghanistan, they did not understand why this mission was not being conducted by civilians and why they had not received the necessary training for the tasks they were being asked to perform: ordinary soldiers and tank drivers have had to act as mediators, legal experts, police superintendents, technicians, election super- visors, etc. and familiarise themselves with the cultural context on- the-job, through a costly trial and error process \u2013 for instance, in terms of their checkpoint methods. Adapting the Department of Defense to this new reality took some time; but by 2005, and even more so in 2006 when the Qua- drennial Defense Review (QDR, see above) was adopted, the need to act \u2018upon\u2019 the regimes of post-conflict countries and the need for nation building had been accepted and processed. To a certain extent, it could be said that the Pentagon underwent the same ide- ological and pragmatic adjustment that the State Department did with transformational diplomacy. The latter went from focusing on relations between states to considering governance and the \u2018fundamental character of regimes\u2019 because of the shortcomings of the president\u2019s \u2018Freedom Agenda\u2019 (holding elections is not enough). The former went from a \u2018high-tech\u2019 war between states to a focus on adapting to the grassroots realities of nation building, because of the shortcomings of Rumsfeld\u2019s \u2018transformation\u2019 (win- ning the war is not enough). One of the most significant end results of the Pentagon\u2019s change of attitude is, undoubtedly, directive DOD 3000.05 (known as \u2018DOD 3000\u2019) of 28 November 2005, on \u2018Stability, Secu- rity, Transition, and Reconstruction Operations.\u2019 It officially takes into account on-the-ground developments in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003. \u20184.1. Stability operations are a core U.S. military mission that the Department of Defense shall be prepared to conduct and sup- port. They shall be given priority comparable to combat opera- tions and be explicitly addressed and integrated across all DoD activities including doctrine, organisations, training, educa- tion, exercises, materiel, leadership, personnel, facilities, and planning. 4.2. Stability operations are conducted to help establish order that advances U.S. interests and values. The immediate goal often is to provide the local populace with security, restore essential services, and meet humanitarian needs.

        "5 goal is to help develop indigenous capacity for securing essen- tial services, a viable market economy, rule of law, democratic institutions, and a robust civil society. (\u2026) 4.4 Integrated civilian and military efforts are key to successful stability operations.\u2019 This short excerpt includes the three \u2018revolutions\u2019 brought about by directive DOD 3000. The first revolution: giving stabili- sation missions the same level of priority as combat missions, which is a major change. Since the end of the Vietnam War, the Pentagon had been tasked with preparing for war (to be precise: two and a half simultaneous conflicts, since the breakup of the Soviet Union), with destroying as effectively and efficiently as pos- sible, but not with winning the peace and rebuilding countries. Second revolution: the Pentagon must not only prepare to sta- bilise entire regions and provide emergency humanitarian aid, it must also be able to achieve in-depth nation building and to strengthen all aspects of a country\u2019s governance \u2013 transforma- tional diplomacy is not far off. Finally, the third revolution, needed to ensure that the first two are successful: setting up net- works with civilian agencies, the first of which is S/CRS (Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization, see Chap- ter 4) in the Department of State. One should not forget that, a few days after directive 3000 was released, George W. Bush signed presidential directive NSPD-44, making the State Department, and more specifically S/CRS, the central instrument of the American government reconstruction and stabilisation efforts (Annex 8). Along the same lines, the process of writing the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review \u2013 an official public document submitted to Congress every four years and in which the Pentagon must outline its strategic priorities \u2013 was also tinged with the desire to decisively improve the integration with civilian crisis management capabilities (see excerpts of QDR 2006 in Annex 9). If the time period prior to the intervention in Iraq was a low point in terms of cooperation with the State Department, this should never happen again, and it will even be the Pentagon\u2019s responsibility to support S/CRS if it is not sufficiently powerful: \u2018Interagency and international combined operations truly are the new Joint operations.

        "5 capacity of partners are indispensable elements of the Depart- ment\u2019s new missions. (\u2026) [The Department will] support substantially increased resources for the Department of State\u2019s Coordinator for Recon- struction and Stability [sic 102 ] and State\u2019s associated proposal to establish a deployable Civilian Reserve Corps and a Conflict Response Fund.\u2019 As we saw in Chapter Four, these are not just utopian aspira- tions: senior military officers have regularly supported S/CRS before Congress, in an attempt to increase its budget, and the Pen- tagon secured the power to allocate some of its own funds to S/CRS \u2013 both through the $100 million retroceded in 2006 and 2007 and through \u2018section 1206\u2019 (of the defence finance bill) that allows it to spend funds on State Department-defined priorities. Nonetheless, in a way, this situation means that a giant, the Penta- gon, is carrying a dwarf supposed to be its leader, S/CRS. But this does not seem to bother the Pentagon, which absolutely insists on strengthening civilian crisis management capabilities, and trying to infuse them with the planning culture they lack, etc. A long- term in-depth effort is in fact being undertaken, within the Department of Defense, to find ways to integrate the new dimen- sions of cooperation: intermilitary, international, and multilat- eral \u2013 without forgetting NGOs and other private actors. All this is time- and capital- consuming for the Pentagon, but it reveals the depth of the new awareness among the top brass: in the new geopolitical environment, nation building seems inescapable. In fact, nation building seems so inescapable that the Pentagon is not limiting itself to improving civilian capabilities. Knowing that it regularly finds itself alone, having to handle crisis situa- tions, and that it is also the only agency with truly substantial means at its disposal, it is very actively strengthening its own capa- bilities so that it will never again be confronted with the situation it faced in Iraq after the invasion \u2013 stabilisation and reconstruc- tion with no civilian support and no training, personnel, plan- ning, or procedures. This dynamic seems so powerful that we may wonder if, in the medium term, and given the formidable means available to the Department of Defense, we are not going to wit- ness the emergence of truly \u2018colonial\u2019 capabilities hitherto lacking in the United States (since the military had rejected counter-insur- rection and nation-building operations after the Vietnam fiasco). 65 The Pentagon: where the real transformation is taking place? 102. In fact, as seen earlier, it is the Coordinator for Reconstruction and \u2018Stabilisation\u2019. CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 65 ",
        "5 Even if the Pentagon\u2019s collective culture is averse to it, nation building, requested by the political authorities \u2013 even those most opposed to the very premise of nation building \u2013 has been increas- ingly put on the agenda since the end of the Cold War. If such oper- ations are forced upon them, the military will not shirk them; but they feel that they then have the right to appropriate training and resources. There is a strong bottom-up interest in this type of change, and it reinforces the top-down adaptation that has been decided, leading to the conclusion that the trends apparent since 2005 could have far-reaching ramifications. The Department of Defense is an enormous organisation and it takes time for it to adapt in a new direction but, once change has been injected, it ineluctably achieves results. The most frequently quoted example is that of the Goldwater-Nichols Act, that ambitious reorganisa- tion of the Pentagon in 1986 that aimed to make inter-military rivalry disappear and thus develop a spirit of \u2018jointness\u2019 (inter-mil- itary coordination) by changing the structure of the military com- mand (see Chapter Three). All is not perfect, but the Goldwater- Nichols Act, two decades later, has largely reached its goals. One of the effective mechanisms that brought about this reform is the change in career requirements for officers: since 1986, they must have at least one joint command experience if they want to keep getting promoted. This setup has somewhat reduced the importance of the Corps culture, making better coor- dinated efforts possible. The implementation of DoD Directive 3000 is based upon the same principle and hopes to attain the same results, including in cultural terms, in the areas of \u2018inte- grated operations\u2019 (joint, interagency, multinational, etc.) and of stabilisation and reconstruction. Troops \u2013 including sailors and pilots \u2013 will therefore need to speak at least one foreign language, have taken part in one \u2018integrated operation,\u2019 have received nation-building training with meaningful field experience, etc if they want to move up in the ranks. Training programmes are start- ing to be modified in military academies to include courses related to \u2018integrated operations\u2019, civilian-military work, stabilisation and reconstruction. In short, an army with \u2018colonial\u2019 capabilities is being potentially prepared for tomorrow \u2013 in a way, this is a late- coming victory for the neoconservatives over Rumsfeld\u2019s vision, and more generally over the vision of much of the military. Before we try to evaluate the reach and possible limitations of these changes, another aspect of the thinking going on at the Pen- 66 Transformational diplomacy CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 66 ",
        "5 tagon should be mentioned, an aspect that has striking connec- tions with transformational diplomacy. The great lesson from Iraq is that the military\u2019s strategic objectives (vanquishing an enemy) do not coincide with the United States\u2019 political objectives in general (putting a stable and democratic regime in place). Fire- power, the quality of conventional capabilities and success in the combat phases (namely I, II and III 103 ) are now well established, and the focus is now more on two other phases of the political -mil- itary strategy (and no longer just military), \u2018phase 0\u2019 and phase IV. The phase known as \u2018zero\u2019, in a way prior to the problems, is that of shaping the international context and the choices of other powers in the future. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasises the need for \u2018shaping\u2019, a concept that has already been around for some time and that refers to the ambition of influencing the strategic environment, the perception and therefore the positions of other powers. 104 Among other things, it means encouraging countries such as China to choose peaceful ways of asserting their power by creating a non-threatening environment, deepening relations with India and other key allies, or, more generally, ensur- ing security in different parts of the world to keep arms races from developing there. While developing the concept of \u2018Phase 0\u2019, the Pentagon has been led to look closely at weak and failed states, in short at all parts of the world that may serve as havens for terrorist networks and weapons trafficking and could therefore cause problems. To prevent the multiplication of such grey areas, these regimes must be strengthened and good governance must be promoted \u2013 in other words transformational diplomacy must take place. The political planning organ of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has thought further about these \u2018ungoverned and exploitable areas\u2019 where governance needs to be strengthened, and its independent conclusions are remarkably similar to those of the Policy Planning Staff team, with its projects for reinforcing gover- nance. The only differences are in the priorities being laid out (especially in areas touching on sovereignty and security for the Pentagon, even if it has a broad outlook) and the choice of coun- tries to help. The Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative is an example of what has come out of this process: among other things, the focus is on strengthening the capacity of the affected countries to control their territory and borders and to restate their sover- eignty in the grey areas. Beyond that, it is their regime as a whole 67 The Pentagon: where the real transformation is taking place? 103. Phase I: preparation for com- bat. Phase II: early operations, in- cluding air strikes. Phase III: the of- fensive. Phase IV: post-conflict. 104. This is one of this QDR\u2019s four priorities, the other three being to vanquish terrorist networks, to defend the homeland, and to keep hostile states and non-state ac- tors from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 67 ",
        "5 that must be consolidated. Or, to cite the words of the 2006 QDR (see Annex 9): \u2018Assistance in today\u2019s environment relies on the ability to improve states\u2019 governance, administration, internal security and the rule of law in order to build partner governments\u2019 legit- imacy in the eyes of their own people and thereby inoculate soci- eties against terrorism, insurgency and non-state threats.\u2019 Of course, some observers are sceptical about the true breadth of reforms undertaken at the Pentagon to adapt to the new geopo- litical environment \u2013 and to draw lessons from the fiasco in Iraq. Improving nation-building capabilities and supporting gover- nance in grey areas will certainly encounter significant obstacles. There is, first of all, a nagging doubt over the operations in Afghanistan and especially in Iraq, intensified by the Democratic victory in the midterm elections: will American troops stay for long more? If they leave, even gradually, the reforms to improve stabilisation and reconstruction capabilities will no doubt be affected, possibly leading to a violent rejection by the military institution of these kinds of operations \u2013 as we saw, mutatis mutan- dis , after Vietnam. Even if troops remain, some doubt the Pentagon\u2019s capacity to take its new missions seriously: high-technology weapons and tra- ditional combat platforms will continue, over the next decades, to be at the centre of the military\u2019s concerns, and to absorb most of the attention and rivalries within the military. According to some specialists, antiterrorist, counter-insurrection and stabilisation operations will remain minor and secondary. Finally, even if Amer- ican troops remain in Iraq and the political will is there, the Penta- gon\u2019s capacity to turn itself into a \u2018colonial office\u2019 may be ques- tioned. Here, once again, is a problem already encountered by transformational diplomacy: to know a country, and even more to have the ambition to rebuild it or transform its governance, not only are quality human and professional resources necessary (and yet the recruitment standards for privates remains low, and has even been lowered in recent years) but so is time. What American officer is ready to give up 5 or 10 years of their life rebuilding Somalia? Even if they were passionately committed to such a mis- sion, would the military be ready to recognise their merits? 68 Transformational diplomacy CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 68 ",
        "Conclusion: is transformational diplomacy already outdated? These closing remarks will not focus on the bureaucratic changes linked to transformational diplomacy at the State Department and, to a lesser degree, at the Department of Defense, but rather on the overall validity of the concept of transformational diplomacy and on the limitations affecting its area of implementation and its future. First, the effort of American diplomacy to adapt to a new geopolitical context should be commended. It is a well-established attitude in Europe and elsewhere to criticise the United States in a schizophrenic fashion \u2013 to blame Americans for their lack of coherence in foreign policy when no overarching principle has been defined, and to castigate the naive simplicity of their slogans compared with the complexity of the world when they dare put for- ward a coherent vision of contemporary international problems. For the Americans it amounts to a case of \u2018damned if we do, damned if we don\u2019t\u2019. In this context, with transformational diplomacy, Con- doleezza Rice can, at the very least, be praised for trying a new read- ing of international reality, rooted in a clear theoretical position, with an overall strategy for American diplomacy. American diplo- macy should be reformed to be able to act not only in the inter- state arena to preserve order between nations, but also on the nature of the units making up the international system in order to guarantee order within nations \u2013 since current security challenges come from inside states. The best way to acknowledge the interest and contribution of transformational diplomacy is to discuss its hypotheses and validity. It seems, at the conclusion of this study, that three main problems exist. 1. The political and theoretical vision underpinning transfor- mational diplomacy has not aged well since the spring of 2003. The first problem comes from Condoleezza Rice\u2019s theoretical understanding of current international relations. Is the \u2018funda- 69 Transformational diplomacy 6 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 69 ",
        "6 mental character of regimes\u2019 really \u2018as\u2019 or even \u2018more\u2019 important than the international distribution of power and the relations that exist between those regimes, as she claims? (18 January 2006 speech, and 2006 National Security Strategy ). Can the current inter- national system be described as \u2018a balance of powers that favors freedom\u2019? (2002 NSS ) The Secretary of State describes a world that has discarded power rivalry, where the only security challenges come from failed states, badly governed areas, and terrorist net- works. From a certain angle, this perspective might have seemed valid after the invasion of Iraq, at the moment when American power seemed at its peak. But, since then, Iraq and the Middle East have sunk into vio- lence, North Korea has openly violated its commitments and threatens stability in North-East Asia, and the states benefiting from the increase in oil prices have reasserted their refusal to com- ply with American wishes \u2013 Iran is asserting its power on all fronts; Russia is leading a containment policy vis-\u00e0-vis colour revolutions; Venezuela loses no opportunity to challenge the United States, etc. Faced with the shortcomings and failures of the President\u2019s \u2018Freedom Agenda\u2019, Washington must put its insistence on democ- racy on the backburner and return to a more fundamental prior- ity, that of order (this is best seen in countries such as Egypt, Jor- dan, Syria, etc.) \u2013 which tends to prove that the realist paradigm, rather than the alternative offered by Condoleezza Rice, remains the most apt to describe the current international system. To put things in a more picturesque way, Snyder and Mansfield, or maybe Ian Bremmer, must have taken Sharansky\u2019s place on the Presi- dent\u2019s and Secretary of State\u2019s respective bedside tables. 105 With the rise in power of Iran and the increasing connections between the Middle Eastern crises in the summer of 2006, Condoleezza Rice must dream of a world where the only geopolitical problem would be that of failed states. From a bureaucratic point of view, diplomats and American soldiers probably consider that transfor- mational diplomacy will have to be put on hold for the duration of several rounds of negotiations and several wars; before having time to indulge in this leisurely pursuit, they will have to deal with the inherent emergencies of the current disorders. 2. Internal politics and the external context cannot be sepa- rated. By suggesting that the United States should intervene on the character of regimes to make them stronger, better governed and more democratic, Condoleezza Rice is undoubtedly offering a 70 Transformational diplomacy 105. Edward Mansfield and Jack Snyder have challenged the demo- cratic peace theory with the theory that \u2018young\u2019 democracies are prone to war. See Edward Mans- field and Jack Snyder, \u2018Democrati- zation and War\u2019, Foreign Affairs , May-June 1995, and \u2018Prone to Vi- olence: The Paradox of the Demo- cratic Peace\u2019, The National Interest , Winter 2005-2006. Working on a similar theme, Ian Bremmer devel- oped the idea that the most unsta- ble regimes are not the most auto- cratic and the most closed off (those were, instead, rather sta- ble) nor of course well-established democracies, but all countries in transition. See Ian Bremmer, The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall (New York: Si- mon & Schuster, 2006). Regard- ing Natan Sharansky, see Chapter One.

        "6 recipe for ideal long-term stability \u2013 but she is ignoring short-term imperatives, including lessons learned from the efforts to democ- ratise the Middle East over the past few years. The realist paradigm is back here also, in the shape of a reluctance to clearly oppose badly governed and undemocratic regimes if they are crucial allies in the war on terror (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan, etc.). In an ideal world, the United States could work only with regimes certi- fied as democratic and \u2018healthy\u2019, those of the Millennium Chal- lenge Account programme, for instance (see Chapter Three) \u2013 but then how could it claim to tackle the most pressing challenges of the international system, like terrorism and proliferation? In short, \u2018transformative\u2019 actions cannot be separated from foreign policy considerations; democracy and better governance cannot be imposed on a country that is also being asked for geopolitical and police assistance. 3. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, interference from outside forces is less welcome than ever. Beyond the issue of strategic objectives, the concept of transformational diplomacy suffers from its somewhat \u2018fairytale\u2019 character. Everything is hap- pening as though the Secretary of State had found a new magic formula for the international system: the nature of regimes. But once the theory is spelled out (democratic peace, the virtues of sov- ereignty and absence of terrorism or grey areas in well-governed countries, etc.), putting it into actual practice is much harder, and it is not certain that much further progress can be made beyond what is already being done \u2013 which by the way should not be dis- missed. When it comes down to it, the ideal model for transforma- tional diplomacy is Europe\u2019s enlargement process and the way new member countries have integrated European laws and cus- toms, the famous acquis communautaire . But this \u2018transformation\u2019 of the affected regimes took place in unique conditions (relative economic and social proximity, cultural proximity, strong appeal of Europe, clear economic benefits, etc.) that cannot be replicated. Transformational diplomacy ignores the complexity of social engineering, and especially the degree of sensitivity of populations around the world to foreign interference: in short, it does not take account of the intensity with which people react in terms of nationalism, antiamericanism, rejection of imperialism, etc. To really act upon the governance of a country, and no longer just upon its agricultural achievements or its educational system, means touching upon essential areas of sovereignty, which can set 71 Conclusion: is transformational diplomacy already outdated?

        "6 off violent reactions in the population concerned. More than half a century after the major anticolonial conflicts, anything that might resemble an overbearing interference from the West, what- ever its good intentions may be, is viewed with suspicion. From a certain angle, transformational diplomacy is a step up from the \u2018democratising\u2019 agenda, going from a mechanical vision to an organic vision of foreign societies \u2013 but that is exactly where the dilemmas of political action start. In that case, what is the future of transformational diplomacy, in particular in the new context created by the 2006 midterm elec- tions, which saw American voters clearly denounce the Bush administration\u2019s foreign policy? The answer depends in part upon what will happen in Iraq over the next few years. If the situation on the ground does not improve and the prospect of a withdrawal materialises, then we may see, within the American political sys- tem, a backlash against interventionism, similar to the neo-isola- tionist movement that followed the withdrawal from Vietnam in the 1970s. The hypothesis of a strong isolationist trend does not seem credible, given the interpenetrations between America and the world today. But there might, however, be a rejection, both in public opinion and the armed forces, of military interventions abroad in general, and the Powell doctrine might make a come- back. 106 In this context, the different components of transforma- tional diplomacy could be affected, in particular the Office for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS), which would be seen \u2013 partly in error \u2013 as belonging lock, stock and barrel to outdated neoconservative utopias. More importantly, in the new climate, the term \u2018transformation\u2019 itself would become anathema, show- ing too clearly its close ties with the dangerous dreams of George Bush\u2019s \u2018freedom agenda.\u2019 In short, transformational diplomacy would no longer be the reference for the reform of the American foreign action tools. The alternative hypothesis, which this author finds more likely, is that of a survival of transformational diplomacy, and even more of the individual reforms that it covers, no longer fuelled by a creative optimism (acting on the international system and reshaping it, bit by bit) but by the strict geopolitical need whereby the United States finds itself obliged to fill the black holes of the international system. After all, with or without the Iraqi fiasco, the challenges posed by failed states, the failures in sovereignty and the consequences of bad governance remain, and Condoleezza 72 Transformational diplomacy 106. The Powell Doctrine (named after Colin Powell, who developed it), which is somewhat similar to the Weinberger Doctrine, lays out a number of conditions that must be fulfilled before American troops can be sent abroad: Amer- ican interests must clearly be at stake, political objectives must be well-defined, sufficient means must be made available to attain those objectives (\u2018decisive over- whelming\u2019 force), an exit strategy must be prepared before the inter- vention, and support from Con- gress and public opinion are indis- pensable.

        "6 Rice has brought a number of interesting answers to these prob- lems. Democrats, as seen in Chapter One, share a number of the premises of transformational diplomacy, and, if the next phases of the Iraqi undertaking are not too catastrophic, there is no reason for them to automatically reject all of the measures put forward by the Secretary of State. 107 What would change, of course, is the con- nection with the unrealistic optimism of President Bush in 2002- 2004, and the general tone of relations between America and the world. In the final analysis, for all of its shortcomings, its illusions, and weaknesses, transformational diplomacy tries to fill in the blind angle of the realist approach, that of the multiple failings of sovereignty and the challenges that this entails for an interna- tional system that, on a daily basis, reveals itself as being more complex than a simple \u2018game\u2019 between states. Even if, with the weakening of the United States after the Iraqi interlude, the realist paradigm becomes once again dominant for both the observer and the political decision-maker, the questions raised by transfor- mational diplomacy will remain topical for America, as they will for other great powers, including Europe. 73 Conclusion: is transformational diplomacy already outdated? 107. Putting aside some ideologi- cal aspects and the reference to the UN, there is, for instance, no fundamental incompatibility be- tween transformational diplo- macy and the ideas put forward by Anatol Lieven in his Policy Analysis Brief, \u2018Failing States and US Strategy\u2019, The Stanley Foun- dation, September 2006, avail- able at http://www.stanleyfoun- dation.org/reports/pab06failing states.pdf.

        "a 1 Transformational Diplomacy (\u2026) Thank you very much. Thank you President DeGioia for that wonderful introduction. Thank you. Happy for that great start to this session. I\u2019d like to thank the Board of Trustees and say how pleased I am to be here at Georgetown University\u2019s distinguished School of Foreign Service. I just have to recognize my friend, Andrew Natsios, who\u2019s sitting in the front row, even if he did leave us to come to Georgetown. He said he was doing it because this is an institution that he loves dearly. You\u2019ve got a fine man and you\u2019re going to have a fine professor in Andrew Natsios. Thank you for your service to the country. (Applause.) I want to thank members of the diplomatic corps who are here and several members of the Administration. I also want you to know that I do know a good deal about Georgetown and it is because this is a fine school of foreign service for which we all owe a debt of gratitude for the people that you have trained, for the people who have come to us in government, for the people from whom I have learned as an academic. This is also a fine university in general, a university that is well known for its dedica- tion to learning, but also its dedication to values and to social justice. And it\u2019s also a university that is recovering its heritage in basketball and I look very much forward to this year. (Applause.) Almost a year ago today in his second Inaugural Address, President Bush laid out a vision that now leads America into the world. \u2018It is the pol- icy of the United States,\u2019 the President said, \u2018to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\u2019 To achieve this bold mission, America needs equally bold diplomacy, a diplomacy that not only reports about the world as it is, but seeks to change the world itself. I and others have called this mission \u2018transformational diplomacy.\u2019 And today I want to explain what it is in principle and how we are advancing it in practice. We are living in an extraordinary time, one in which centuries of inter- national precedent are being overturned. The prospect of violent conflict among great powers is more remote than ever. States are increasingly 75 annexes Speech by Condoleezza Rice at Georgetown University (Washington, DC) on 18 January 2006 (extracts) CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 75 ",
        "a 1 competing and cooperating in peace, not preparing for war. Peoples in China and India, in South Africa and Indonesia and Brazil are lifting their countries into new prominence. Reform \u2013 democratic reform \u2013 has begun and is spreading in the Middle East. And the United States is work- ing with our many partners, particularly our partners who share our val- ues in Europe and in Asia and in other parts of the world to build a true form of global stability, a balance of power that favors freedom. At the same time, other challenges have assumed a new urgency. Since its creation more than 350 years ago, the modern state system has rested on the concept of sovereignty. It was always assumed that every state could control and direct the threats emerging from its territory. It was also assumed that weak and poorly governed states were merely a burden to their people, or at most, an international humanitarian concern but never a true security threat. Today, however, these old assumptions no longer hold. Technology is collapsing the distance that once clearly separated right here from over there. And the greatest threats now emerge more within states than between them. The fundamental character of regimes now matters more than the international distribution of power. In this world it is impossi- ble to draw neat, clear lines between our security interests, our develop- ment efforts and our democratic ideals. American diplomacy must inte- grate and advance all of these goals together. So, I would define the objective of transformational diplomacy this way: to work with our many partners around the world, to build and sus- tain democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system. Let me be clear, transformational diplomacy is rooted in partner- ship; not in paternalism. In doing things with people, not for them; we seek to use America\u2019s diplomatic power to help foreign citizens better their own lives and to build their own nations and to transform their own futures. In extraordinary times like those of today, when the very terrain of history is shifting beneath our feet, we must transform old diplomatic institutions to serve new diplomatic purposes. This kind of challenge is sweeping and difficult but it is not unprecedented; America has done this kind of work before. In the aftermath of World War II, as the Cold War hardened into place, we turned our diplomatic focus to Europe and parts of Asia. We hired new people. We taught them new languages, we gave them new training. We partnered with old adversaries in Germany and 76 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 76 ",
        "a 1 Japan and helped them to rebuild their countries. Our diplomacy was instrumental in transforming devastated countries into thriving demo- cratic allies, allies who joined with us for decades in the struggle to defend freedom from communism. With the end of the Cold War, America again rose to new challenges. We opened 14 new embassies in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and we repositioned over 100 of our diplomats to staff them. Our efforts helped newly liberated peoples to transform the character of their countries and now many of them, too, have become partners in liberty and freedom, members of NATO, members of the European Union, something unthought of just a few years ago. And during the last decade, we finally realized a historic dream of the 20th century therefore, a vision of a Europe whole and free and at peace. In the past five years, it was my friend and predecessor Colin Powell who led the men and women of American diplomacy into the 21st cen- tury. He modernized the State Department\u2019s technology and trans- formed dozens of our facilities abroad. Most importantly, Secretary Pow- ell invested in our people. He created over 2,000 new positions and hired thousands of new employees and trained them all to be diplomatic lead- ers of tomorrow. Now, today, to advance transformational diplomacy all around the world, we in the State Department must again answer a new calling of our time. We must begin to lay the diplomatic foundations to secure a future of freedom for all people. Like the great changes of the past, the new efforts we undertake today will not be completed quickly. Trans- forming our diplomacy and transforming the State Department is the work of a generation, but it is urgent work that must begin. To advance transformational diplomacy, we are and we must change our diplomatic posture. In the 21st century, emerging nations like India and China and Brazil and Egypt and Indonesia and South Africa are increasingly shaping the course of history. At the same time, the new front lines of our diplomacy are appearing more clearly, in transitional countries of Africa and of Latin America and of the Middle East. Our cur- rent global posture does not really reflect that fact. For instance, we have nearly the same number of State Department personnel in Germany, a country of 82 million people that we have in India, a country of one bil- lion people. It is clear today that America must begin to reposition our diplomatic forces around the world, so over the next few years the United 77 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 77 ",
        "a 1 States will begin to shift several hundred of our diplomatic positions to new critical posts for the 21st century. We will begin this year with a down payment of moving 100 positions from Europe and, yes, from here in Washington, D.C., to countries like China and India and Nigeria and Lebanon, where additional staffing will make an essential difference. We are making these changes by shifting existing resources to meet our new priorities, but we are also eager to work more closely with Con- gress to enhance our global strategy with new resources and new posi- tions. We will also put new emphasis on our regional and transnational strategies. In the 21st century, geographic regions are growing ever more integrated economically, politically and culturally. This creates new opportunities but it also presents new challenges, especially from transnational threats like terrorism and weapons proliferation and drug smuggling and trafficking in persons and disease. Building regional partnerships is one foundation today of our coun- terterrorism strategy. We are empowering countries that have the will to fight terror but need help with the means. And we are joining with key regional countries like Indonesia and Nigeria and Morocco and Pak- istan, working together not only to take the fight to the enemy but also to combat the ideology of hatred that uses terror as a weapon. We will use a regional approach to tackle disease as well. Rather than station many experts in every embassy, we will now deploy small, agile transnational networks of our diplomats. These rapid response teams will monitor and combat the spread of pandemics across entire conti- nents. We are adopting a more regional strategy in our public diplomacy as well. In the Middle East, for example, as you well know, a vast majority of people get their news from a regional media network like Al Jazeera, not from a local newspaper. So our diplomats must tell America\u2019s story not just in translated op-eds, but live on TV in Arabic for a regional audience. To make this happen, we are creating a regional public diplomacy center. We are forward deploying our best Arabic-speaking diplomats and we are broadly coordinating our public diplomacy strategy both for the region and from the region. Our third goal is to localize our diplomatic posture. Transforma- tional diplomacy requires us to move our diplomatic presence out of for- eign capitals and to spread it more widely across countries. We must 78 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 78 ",
        "a 1 work on the front lines of domestic reform as well as in the back rooms of foreign ministries. There are nearly 200 cities worldwide with over one million people in which the United States has no formal diplomatic pres- ence. This is where the action is today and this is where we must be. To reach citizens in bustling new population centers, we cannot always build new consulates beyond a nation\u2019s capital. A newer, more economical idea is what we call an American Presence Post. This idea is simple. One of our best diplomats moves outside the embassy to live and work and represent America in an emerging commu- nity of change. We currently operate American Presence Posts in places like Egypt and Indonesia and we are eager to expand both the size and the scope of this new approach. Perhaps the newest and most cost effective way to adopt a more local posture is through a Virtual Presence Post. Here one or more of our young officers creates and manages an internet site that is focused on key population centers. This digital meeting room enables foreign citizens, young people most of all, to engage online with American diplomats who could be hundreds of miles away. This is a great way to connect with mil- lions of new people across Europe and Asia and Latin America. In today\u2019s world, our diplomats will not only work in different places, they will work in different communities and they will serve in different kinds of conditions, like reconstruction and stabilization missions, where they must partner more directly with the military. So to advance transformational diplomacy we are empowering our diplomats to work more jointly with our men and women in uniform. Over the past 15 years, as violent state failure has become a greater global threat, our military has borne a disproportionate share of post- conflict responsibilities because we have not had the standing civilian capability to play our part fully. This was true in Somalia and Haiti, in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and it is still partially true in Iraq and Afghanistan. These experiences have shown us the need to enhance our ability to work more effectively at the critical intersections of diplomacy, democ- racy promotion, economic reconstruction and military security. That is why President Bush created within the State Department the Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization. Recently, President Bush broadened the authority and mandate for this office and Congress authorized the Pentagon to transfer up to $100 million to State in the event of a post- conflict operation, funds that would empower our reconstruction and 79 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 79 ",
        "a 1 stabilization efforts. We have an expansive vision for this new office, and let there be no doubt, we are committed to realizing it. Should a state fail in the future, we want the men and the women of this office to be able to spring into action quickly. We will look to them to partner immediately with our military, with other federal agencies and with our international allies, and eventually we envision this office assembling and deploying the kinds of civilians who are essential in post-conflict operations: police officers and judges and electricians and engineers, bankers and econo- mists and legal experts and election monitors. Our Reconstruction and Stabilization Office must be able to help a failed state to exercise responsible sovereignty and to prevent its territory from becoming a source of global instability, as Afghanistan was in 2001. The diplomacy of the 21st century requires better \u2018jointness\u2019 too between our soldiers and our civilians, and we are taking additional steps to achieve it. We for decades have positions in our Foreign Service called Political Advisors to Military Forces, affectionately called POLADS, in our business. We station these diplomats where the world of diplomacy intersects the world of military force, but increasingly this intersection is seen in the dusty streets of Fallujah or the tsunami-wrecked coasts of Indonesia. I want American diplomats to eagerly seek our assignments working side-by-side with our men and women in uniform, whether it is in disaster relief in Pakistan or in stabilization missions in Liberia or fighting the illegal drug trade in Latin America. Finally, to advance transformational diplomacy, we are preparing our people with new expertise and challenging them with new expectations. I\u2019ve been Secretary of State for almost exactly one year now, and in that time I have become more convinced than ever that we have the finest diplomatic service in the world. I\u2019ve seen the noble spirit of that service, a service that defines the men and women of our Foreign Service and Civil Service and our Foreign Service Nationals, many of whom are serving in dangerous places far away from their families. I see in them the desire and the ability to adapt to a changing world and to our changing diplomatic mission. More and more often, over the course of this new century, we will ask the men and women of the State Department to be active in the field. We will need them to engage with pri- vate citizens in emerging regional centers, not just with government offi- cials in their nations\u2019 capitals. We must train record numbers of people to master difficult languages like Arabic and Chinese and Farsi and Urdu. 80 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 80 ",
        "a 1 In addition, to advance in their careers, our Foreign Service Officers must now serve in what we call hardship posts. These are challenging jobs in critical countries like Iraq and Afghanistan and Sudan and Angola, countries where we are working with foreign citizens in difficult condi- tions to maintain security and fight poverty and make democratic reforms. To succeed in these kinds of posts, we will train our diplomats not only as expert analysts of policy but as first-rate administrators of programs, capable of helping foreign citizens to strengthen the rule of law, to start businesses, to improve health and to reform education. Ladies and gentlemen, President Bush has outlined the historic call- ing of our time. We on the right side of freedom\u2019s divide have a responsi- bility to help all people who find themselves on the wrong side of that divide. The men and women of American diplomacy are being sum- moned to advance an exciting new mission. But there is one other great asset that America will bring to this challenge. No, in a day and a time when difference is still a license to kill, America stands as a tremendous example of what can happen with people of diverse backgrounds, ethnic groups, religions all call themselves American. Because it does not matter whether you are Italian American or African American or Korean Ameri- can. It does not matter whether you are Muslim or Presbyterian or Jewish or Catholic. What matters is that you are American and you are devoted to an ideal and to a set of beliefs that unites us. (\u2026) 81 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 81 ",
        "a 2 Remarks At the U.S. Agency for International Development On Foreign Assistance (\u2026) Thank you very much. Well, first of all, thanks very much for coming out and I hope we can have a good discussion about the changes that are underway and about how we are going to work together to make American foreign assistance even more effective in changing people\u2019s lives, in allevi- ating poverty, in creating the conditions for stable and well-governed states around the world, and in doing so in enhances America\u2019s security and America\u2019s compassion. And I look forward to that discussion. I\u2019ve had an opportunity to thank Andrew Natsios for his fine leader- ship of this organization. As a matter of fact, I was at Georgetown yester- day sitting right in the front row and he\u2019s now a professor. It\u2019s quite clear. He told me he\u2019s taught his first course. But I want to also thank Fred Schieck. This gentleman has been a core part of my team since I\u2019ve been here. I see him pretty often at staff meetings. But I want you to know that he has provided excellent leadership and that he has been just a really important part of my core team. And would you just join me in thanking him for his leadership. (Applause.) As I stand here in this historic building, the building in which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created and signed in 1949, I am reminded of how well America has done when it has mobilized all of its resources, all of its assets, in support of its values and its interests. This indeed is where NATO was \u2013 where the NATO treaty was signed. And if you look back on those historic times at the end of World War II, they were times of great challenge with a rising Soviet Union, a rising communist China, with a Europe that was still weak and prostrate from World War II, and from just enormous challenges to our values and to our security. And if you fast-forward to today and you \u2013 as I have had the opportu- nity to do \u2013 you sit in the councils of NATO and you look around that table \u2013 and it\u2019s not just France and Germany and the fact that they will never fight again, something I think that was clearly not to be anticipated in 1949 \u2013 but you also look around that table and you have Estonia and Lithuania and Poland and Hungary and you think what a remarkable transition there was in Europe to a Europe whole, free and at peace and 82 annexes Speech by Condoleezza Rice at USAID (Washington, DC) on 19 January 2006 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 82 ",
        "a 2 based on democratic values. You just know that despite the fact that we have new challenges in the promotion of those values that we can indeed meet them and that we can make a difference in helping to create a world of well-governed states that will be committed to their people, commit- ted to democracy, committed to bettering the lives of their people. And that\u2019s what we want to do with our foreign assistance. I want to just say that I want to thank each and every one of you for the crucial role that you have played over this last five years of challenge. When we came here in 2001, I doubt that any of us who joined the Bush Administration really thought that we were going to be trying to build democracy in Afghanistan, for instance. We didn\u2019t know that the Twin Towers were going to be attacked and the Pentagon. We didn\u2019t know the world that we were going to be facing. But the wonderful thing about this organization, about USAID and about its people, is that you have responded and you have in your own way transformed, and we\u2019re now taking another step in making the institution stronger, in aligning it with the State Department. I want to just empha- size a couple things that Fred mentioned. First of all, that USAID is going to remain an independent organization. Anyone who tells you that I once considered that we were going to somehow dissolve this organization, they\u2019re just not telling you the truth. It was simply never a consideration for me. I always started from the premise that USAID would stay intact and it will indeed stay intact as an independent organization. I think that the changes that we announced today will greatly strengthen the role of the Administrator and in dual-hatting that person at State I hope that we will be able to see the best of both worlds. There are many things that State does very well, there are many things that USAID does very well, and I hope that the interchange between those organiza- tions will make us much stronger, make us both much stronger. I think we will have an opportunity to have strategic country plans that will guarantee that resources will be available for long-term development. I want to be very clear. I consider development to be one of America\u2019s most important priorities because our goal ought to be to use our assistance to help people to better their lives, but also to help their governments to be better able to deliver for them. We don\u2019t want to create permanent depend- encies. We want governments that can actually deliver. And I know you\u2019re very involved in capacity building and we need to do more of that. And we\u2019re going to work to closer align our budgets and priorities. 83 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 83 ",
        "a 2 The United States is best when it leads both from power and princi- ple. Everybody has concentrated a lot on our power. They very often don\u2019t look at what we do in terms of compassion around the world. I want you to know that many Americans do know how gifted and capable you\u2019ve been as first responders to disasters, to humanitarian situations around the world. But perhaps not enough people know that you\u2019ve been equally impressive in your grit and determination to apply the hard work that you do to successful development transitions in countries around the world, and I want to applaud that work and see it extended. Finally, I think that if we keep in mind three very key words we will do our job well. First of all, we do need to align our priorities and to make certain that we are pulling in the right direction to get the job done. Secondly, we need to be more effective in the ability to bring all of our assets together and to deliver. And we need to be good stewards of the American people\u2019s money. We\u2019ve had very major increases in development assistance in this Admin- istration, in fact major increases unseen since the Marshall Plan. We have created the Millennium Challenge Corporation. We have had the PEP- FAR program, the U.S. program for AIDS and HIV. We have doubled our official development assistance around the world, tripled our assistance in Africa. We\u2019ve made trade preferences possible for the developing world. We\u2019ve relieved debt for some of the most heavily indebted coun- tries. We have believed in using America\u2019s resources to make the world better and safer. But I want to assure you that it\u2019s going to get tougher to get those resources because there are a lot of competing priorities. And what we have to be able to do is to go to the American people \u2013 and I want to make a commitment to you, I will go to the American people through the Con- gress and publicly \u2013 and say that we must continue to devote resources to development. We must continue to devote resources to democracy pro- motion. We must continue to devote resources to poverty alleviation, because, yes, it is consistent with our values and our compassion, but it is also essential to our security. And if we can show that we are good stew- ards of the American taxpayer\u2019s dollar, I believe that we can sustain a course of economic assistance around the world that will serve our inter- ests and our security as well as make life better for people around the world. 84 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 84 ",

        "a 6 Extract 1 1. Transformational Diplomacy and Effective Democracy Transformational diplomacy means working with our many interna- tional partners to build and sustain democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their citizens and conduct themselves respon- sibly in the international system. Long-term development must include encouraging governments to make wise choices and assisting them in implementing those choices. We will encourage and reward good behav- ior rather than reinforce negative behavior. Ultimately it is the countries themselves that must decide to take the necessary steps toward develop- ment, yet we will help advance this process by creating external incentives for governments to reform themselves. Effective economic development advances our national security by helping promote responsible sovereignty, not permanent dependency. Weak and impoverished states and ungoverned areas are not only a threat to their people and a burden on regional economies, but are also susceptible to exploitation by terrorists, tyrants, and international crim- inals. We will work to bolster threatened states, provide relief in times of crisis, and build capacity in developing states to increase their progress. 2. Making Foreign Assistance More Effective The Administration has created the new position of Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA) in the State Department. The DFA will serve concur- rently as Administrator of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a position that will continue to be at the level of Deputy Secre- tary, and will have, consistent with existing legal requirements, authority over all State Department and USAID foreign assistance. This reorgani- zation will create a more unified and rational structure that will more fully align assistance programs in State and USAID, increase the effective- ness of these programs for recipient countries, and ensure that we are being the best possible stewards of taxpayer dollars. And it will focus our foreign assistance on promoting greater ownership and responsibility on the part of host nations and their citizens. With this new authority, the DFA/Administrator will develop a coor- dinated foreign assistance strategy, including 5-year, country-specific 92 annexes 2006 National Security Strategy (16 March 2006 \u2013 extracts) CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 92 ",
        "a 6 assistance strategies and annual country-specific assistance operational plans. The DFA/Administrator also will provide guidance for the assis- tance delivered through other entities of the United States Government, including the MCC and the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator. To ensure the best stewardship of our foreign assistance, the United States will: (cid:90) Distinguish among the different challenges facing different nations and address those challenges with tools appropriate for each country\u2019s stage of development; (cid:90) Encourage and reward good government and economic reform, both bilaterally and through the multilateral institutions such as interna- tional financial institutions, the G 8, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC); (cid:90) Engage the private sector to help solve development problems; (cid:90) Promote graduation from economic aid dependency with the ulti- mate goal of ending assistance; (cid:90) Build trade capacity to enable the poorest countries to enter into the global trade system; and (cid:90) Empower local leaders to take responsibility for their country\u2019s devel- opment. Our assistance efforts will also highlight and build on the lessons learned from successful examples of wise development and economic policy choices, such as the ROK, Taiwan, Ireland, Poland, Slovakia, Chile, and Botswana. Extract 2 At home, we will pursue three priorities: (cid:90) Sustaining the transformation already under way in the Depart- ments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the Intelligence Community. (cid:90) Continuing to reorient the Department of State towards trans- formational diplomacy , which promotes effective democracy and responsible sovereignty. Our diplomats must be able to step outside their traditional role to become more involved with the challenges within other societies, helping them directly, channeling assistance, 93 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 93 ",
        "a 6 and learning from their experience. This effort will include: (cid:92) Promoting the efforts of the new Director for Foreign Assis- tance/Administrator to ensure that foreign assistance is used as effectively as possible to meet our broad foreign policy objectives. This new office will align more fully the foreign assistance activi- ties carried out by the Department of State and USAID, demon- strating that we are responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.

Policy It is DoD policy that: 4.1. Stability operations are a core U.S. military mission that the Department of Defense shall be prepared to conduct and sup- port. They shall be given priority comparable to combat opera- tions and be explicitly addressed and integrated across all DoD activities including doctrine, organizations, training, educa- tion, exercises, materiel, leadership, personnel, facilities, and planning. 4.2. Stability operations are conducted to help establish order that advances U.S. interests and values. The immediate goal often is to provide the local populace with security, restore essential services, and meet humanitarian needs. The long-term goal is to help develop indigenous capacity for securing essential services, a viable market economy, rule of law, democratic institutions, and a robust civil society. 4.3. Many stability operations tasks are best performed by indigenous, foreign, or U.S. civilian professionals. Nonetheless, U.S. military forces shall be prepared to perform all tasks necessary to establish or maintain order when civilians cannot do so. Successfully perform- ing such tasks can help secure a lasting peace and facilitate the timely withdrawal of U.S. and foreign forces. Stability operations tasks include helping: 4.3.1. Rebuild indigenous institutions including various types of security forces, correctional facilities, and judicial systems necessary to secure and stabilize the environment; 4.3.2. Revive or build the private sector, including encouraging citizen-driven, bottom-up economic activity and constructing nec- essary infrastructure; and 4.3.3. Develop representative governmental institutions. 97 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 97 ",
        "a 7 4.4. Integrated civilian and military efforts are key to successful stability operations. Whether conducting or supporting stability operations, the Department of Defense shall be prepared to work closely with relevant U.S. Departments and Agencies, foreign governments and security forces, global and regional international organizations (hereafter referred to as \u2018International Organizations\u2019), U.S. and for- eign nongovernmental organizations (hereafter referred to as \u2018NGOs\u2019), and private sector individuals and for-profit companies (hereafter referred to as \u2018Private Sector\u2019). 4.5. Military-civilian teams are a critical U.S. Government stability opera- tions tool. The Department of Defense shall continue to lead and support the development of military-civilian teams. 4.5.1. Their functions shall include ensuring security, developing local governance structures, promoting bottom-up economic activ- ity, rebuilding infrastructure, and building indigenous capacity for such tasks. 4.5.2. Participation in such teams shall be open to representatives from other U.S. Departments and Agencies, foreign governments and security forces, International Organizations, NGOs, and mem- bers of the Private Sector with relevant skills and expertise. 4.6. Assistance and advice shall be provided to and sought from the Department of State and other U.S. Departments and Agencies, as appropriate, for developing stability operations capabilities. 4.7. The Department of Defense shall develop greater means to help build other countries\u2019 security capacity quickly to ensure security in their own lands or to contribute forces to stability operations else- where. 4.8. Military plans shall address stability operations requirements throughout all phases of an operation or plan as appropriate. Sta- bility operations dimensions of military plans shall be: 4.8.1.

The Department of Defense shall support indigenous persons or groups \u2013 political, religious, educational, and media \u2013 promoting freedom, the rule of law, and an entrepreneurial economy, who oppose extremism and the murder of civilians. 4.10. DoD intelligence efforts shall be designed to provide the optimal mix of capabilities to meet stability operations requirements, taking into account other priorities. 4.11. Stability operations skills, such as foreign language capabilities, regional area expertise, and experience with foreign governments and International Organizations, shall be developed and incorpo- rated into Professional Military Education at all levels. 4.12. Information shall be shared with U.S. Departments and Agencies, foreign governments and forces, International Organizations, NGOs, and the members of the Private Sector supporting stability operations, consistent with legal requirements. 5. Responsibilities 5.1. The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, in coordination with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall: 5.1.1.

SUBJECT: Mananagement of Interagency Efforts Concerning Recon- struction and Stabilization Introduction The purpose of this Directive is to promote the security of the United States through improved coordination, planning, and implementation for reconstruction and stabilization assistance for foreign states and regions at risk of, in, or in transition from conflict or civil strife. Policy The United States has a significant stake in enhancing the capacity to assist in stabilizing and reconstructing countries or regions, especially those at risk of, in, or in transition from conflict or civil strife, and to help them establish a sustainable path toward peaceful societies, democracies, and market economies. The United States should work with other coun- tries and organizations to anticipate state failure, avoid it whenever possi- ble, and respond quickly and effectively when necessary and appropriate to promote peace, security, development, democratic practices, market economies, and the rule of law. Such work should aim to enable govern- ments abroad to exercise sovereignty over their own territories and to pre- vent those territories from being used as a base of operations or safe haven for extremists, terrorists, organized crime groups, or others who pose a threat to U.S. foreign policy, security, or economic interests. Responsibilities of the Department of State Need for Coordinated U.S. Efforts. To achieve maximum effect, a focal point is needed (i) to coordinate and strengthen efforts of the United States Government to prepare, plan for, and conduct reconstruction and stabilization assistance and related activities in a range of situations that require the response capabilities of multiple United States Government entities and (ii) to harmonize such efforts with U.S. military plans and operations. The relevant situations include complex emergencies and transitions, failing states, failed states, and environments across the spec- trum of conflict, particularly those involving transitions from peacekeep- ing and other military interventions. The reponse to these crises will include among others, activities relating to internal security, governance 103 annexes NSPD-44 Directive (7 December 2005) CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 103 ",
        "a 8 and participation, social and economic well-being, and justice and recon- ciliation. Coordination. The Secretary of State shall coordinate and lead integrated United States Government efforts, involving all U.S. Departments and Agencies with relevant capabilities, to prepare, plan for, and conduct sta- bilization and reconstruction activities. The Secretary of State shall coor- dinate such efforts with the Secretary of Defense to ensure harmonization with any planned or ongoing U.S. military operations across the spectrum of conflict. Support relationships among elements of the United States Government will depend on the particular situation being addressed. To achieve the objectives of this Directive, the Secretary of State shall be responsible for the following functions and may direct the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (\u2018Coordinator\u2019) to assist the Secre- tary to: 1. Develop and approve strategies, with respect to U.S. foreign assis- tance and foreign economic cooperation, for reconstruction and stabilization activities directed towards foreign states at risk of, in, or in transition from conflict or civil strife; 2. Ensure program and policy coordination among Departments and Agencies of the United States Government in carrying out the policies set forth in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export Control Act, and other relevant assistance laws, as well as section 408 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and related Agencies and Appropriations Act, 2005, with respect to such states; 3. Coordinate interagency processes to identify states at risk of insta- bility, lead interagency planning to prevent or mitigate conflict, and develop detailed contingency plans for integrated United States Government reconstruction and stabilization efforts for those states and regions and for widely applicable scenarios, which are integrated with military contingency plans, where appropriate; 4. Provide United States Government decision makers with detailed options for an integrated United States Government response in connection with specific reconstruction and stabilization opera- tions including to recommend when to establish a limited-time PCC-level group to focus on a country or region facing major reconstruction and stabilization challenges; 104 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 104 ",
        "a 8 5. Coordinate United States Government responses for reconstruc- tion and stabilization with the Secretary of Defense to ensure har- monization with any planned or ongoing U.S. military operations, including peacekeeping missions, at the planning and implementa- tion phases; develop guiding precepts and implementation proce- dures for reconstruction and stabilization which, where appropri- ate, may be integrated with military contingency plans and doctrine; 6. Coordinate reconstruction and stabilization activities and preven- tative strategies with foreign countries, international and regional organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and private sec- tor entities with capabilities that can contribute to such efforts provided that the Secretary of the Treasury shall lead coordination with the international financial institutions and multilateral financing bodies and shall facilitate the Secretary of State\u2019s stabi- lization and reconstruction work with respect to these institutions and bodies; 7. As appropriate, work with people and organizations, including in expatriate and foreign communities, with relevant ties, expertise, or knowledge related to countries in which the United States may conduct stabilization and reconstruction activities; 8. Develop strategies to build partnership security capacity abroad and seek to maximize nongovernmental and international resources for reconstruction and stabilization activities; 9. Lead United States Government development of a strong civilian response capability including necessary surge capabilities; ana- lyze, formulate, and recommend additional authorities, mecha- nisms, and resources needed to ensure that the United States has the civilian reserve and response capabilities necessary for stabi- lization and reconstruction activities to respond quickly and effectively; 10. Identify lessons learned and integrate them into operations; 11. Resolve relevant policy, program, and funding disputes among United States Government Departments and Agencies with respect to U.S. foreign assistance and foreign economic coopera- tion, related to reconstruction and stabilization consistent with the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s budget and policy coordi- nation functions; and 12. When necessary, identify appropriate issues for resolution or action through the NSC interagency process in accordance with 105 CP103-Text.qxp 18/07/2007 12:32 Page 105 ",

        "a 8 Coordination between the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense The Secretaries of State and Defense will integrate stabilization and reconstruction contingency plans with military contingency plans when relevant and appropriate. The Secretaries of State and Defense will develop a general framework for fully coordinating stabilization and reconstruction activities and military operations at all levels where appro- priate. Within the scope of this NSPD, and in order to maintain clear accounta- bility and responsibility for any given contingency response or stabiliza- tion and reconstruction mission, lead and supporting responsiblities for agencies and departments will be designated using the mechanism out- lined in NSPD-1. These lead and supporting relationships will be re-des- ignated as transitions are required. Policy Coordination Committee I hereby establish a Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) for Recon- struction and Stabilization Operations. The PCC will be chaired by the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization and a designated member of the NSC staff. The PCC shall include representatives in accor- dance with NSPD-1. Nothing in this directive shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the authority of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals. In addition, this Directive is not intended to, and does not: (1) affect the authority of the Secretary of Defense or the command relationships established for the Armed Forces of the United States; (2) affect the DNI\u2019s and D/CIA\u2019s authorities under title 50 of US Code; (3) affect the authority of the Presi- dent\u2019s Special Coordinator for International Disaster Assistance under Section 493 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended; and , (4) create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by a party against the United States, its departments, agencies, entities, instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

Today the emphasis has shifted from focusing on relations between states to acting directly on states themselves, so as to pre-empt the growth of terrorism, arms proliferation, genocide, civil wars etc. After the concept of the \u2018global war on terror\u2019, President George W. Bush put forward his \u2018freedom agenda\u2019 aiming to pro- mote democracy as a response to the security challenges facing the world, in particular in the Middle East. But overthrowing tyrants and holding elections is not enough to create a stable and well-governed democracy and can even, in some cases, complicate matters, as events between 2003 and 2005 in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt have shown. This is where \u2018transformational diplomacy\u2019, the concept inaug- urated by Condoleezza Rice in early 2006, comes in. Basically this consists in working with the partners of the United States with a view to \u2018build and sustain democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system.\u2019 To enable this to happen, it is first of all American diplomacy which must transform itself, so as to become less \u2018analytical\u2019 and more operational, characterised by direct involvement in foreign societies rather than just being restricted to the realm of foreign policy. This Chaillot Paper explores the scope and limits of this \u2018transformative\u2019 action: is the realist paradigm, that of interpower rivalries, really no longer relevant? Can diplomats transform themselves into active promoters of good governance? Are other countries ready to accept them in this role, or will they accuse them of interference? Can transformational diplomacy really change the world? CP103-Cover.qxp 18/07/2007 15:10 Page 4 "
