        "Prof. F. Grimaccia \u2013 JRC ISPRA ATC 2017 In all applications where the parameters voltage and current must be adapted we need converters. In PV systems we have the following situation: \uf0a7 The photovoltaic generator produce DC quantities dependent on irradiation and temperature of PV cells. \uf0a7 The grid operates AC (with fixed Voltage and frequency), single-phase or three- phase. \uf0a7 The storage systems, typically batteries, are DC systems that require accurate control of energy exchanges. \uf0a7 Electrical loads are typically designed to be connected to AC power, but there are loads directly plug-in DC. The converters that perform DC - AC power conditioning are called INVERTER. The converters that perform DC-DC power conditioning are called CHOPPER. In particular, the BUCK reduces the voltage, while the BOOST increases the voltage. PV Converter ",
        "Prof. F.

        "Prof. F. Grimaccia \u2013 JRC ISPRA ATC 2017 Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a technique that grid connected inverters use to get the maximum possible power from one or more photovoltaic devices. Two different types: Indirect MPPT : MPP tracker estimates the MPP voltage by means of simple assumptions and measurements. \u2022 The operating voltage of the solar generator can be adjusted seasonally. \u2022 The operating voltage can be adjusted according to the module temperature. \u2022 The operating voltage can be derived from the instantaneous open-circuit voltage by multiplication with a constant factor, for example, 0.8 for crystalline silicon solar cells. Direct MPPT : the optimum operating voltage is derived from measured currents, voltages or the power of the PV generator. Therefore, they are able to react to changes in the generator\u2019s performance. Some examples include the following: \u2022 Periodic scanning of a part of the I \u2013 V curve.

        "Qualification tests \u2022 Qualification tests are a set of well-defined accelerated stress tests developed out of a reliability program. \u2022 They utilize stress tests to duplicate failure modes observed in the field. \u2022 They incorporate strict pass/fail criteria . \u2022 The stress levels and durations are limited so the tests can be completed within a reasonable amount of time and cost. \u2022 The goal for Qualification testing is that a significant number of commercial modules will pass. ) \u2022 Qualifies the design and helps to eliminate infant mortality and early failures IEC 61215 Crystalline silicon terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) modules \u2013 Design qualification and type approval ",
        "What does passing IEC 61215 mean? \u2022 Passing the qualification test means the product has met a specific set of requirements. \u2022 Those that have passed the qualification test are much more likely to survive in the field and not have design flaws that lead to infant mortality and early failures. \u2022 Most of today\u2019s commercial modules pass the qualification sequence with minimum change, meaning that they suffer almost no degradation in power output from the test sequence. \u2022 This means that qualification tests do not provide a means of ranking modules which have passed the requirements. ",
