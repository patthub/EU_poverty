        "EN 1 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal On 15 September 2021, President von der Leyen announced in her State of the Union Address that the European Commission will propose to make 2022 the European Year of Youth, \u201ca year dedicated to empowering those who have dedicated so much to others\". Highlighting the confidence that she draws for Europe\u2019s future from the inspiration provided by Europe's young people, President von der Leyen added that \u201c if we are to shape our Union in their mould, young people must be able to shape Europe's future.\u201d To be successful in inspiring our collective Union project with the actions, dreams, hopes and insights of the new generations, the European Year of Youth must be resolutely inclusive. In the words of the President von der Leyen: \u201c Europe needs all of its youth \u201d. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented \u2013 and uneven \u2013 impact on education, employment, social inclusion and mental health of the young people. The pandemic and related measures have resulted in interruptions in their education and transition to employment, and many youngsters have experienced feelings of isolation, anxiety and depression. Children, adolescents and young adults have been extremely affected by disruptions of family and social ties, and the economic crisis provoked by lockdowns has hit young Europeans in particular. 1 At the same time, young people have shown intergenerational solidarity and support, while sacrificing valuable \u201c youthful moments \u201d of their daily lives. And yet, young people, who are among the most diverse cohorts of our European society, have also managed to show great resilience and have been involved in the mitigation of the pandemic\u2019s impact. In this light, the European Year of Youth 2022 would further stimulate Europe\u2019s young people to come forward with contributions and insights to give shape to the Union\u2019s development and society at large. It would also be an occasion to raise awareness on the opportunities ahead for young people. The overall objective of the European Year of Youth shall be to boost the efforts of the Union, the Member States, regional and local authorities to honour, support and engage with youth in a post-pandemic perspective , by: (1) highlighting how the green and digital transitions offer a renewed perspective for the future and opportunities to counter the negative impact of the pandemic on young people and on the society at large, drawing inspiration from the actions, vision and insights of young people to further strengthen and invigorate the common European Union project and listening to young people, taking into account their concerns and supporting them in developing concrete, inclusive opportunities, while making an optimal use of Union instruments, (2) encouraging all young people, especially young people with fewer opportunities, from disadvantaged backgrounds or belonging to vulnerable groups, to become active and engaged citizens as well as actors of change, inspired by a European sense of belonging. This includes additional efforts at building capacity for youth participation and civic engagement among young people and among all stakeholders, 1 OECD, 2020. Youth and Covid-19.

        "EN 2 EN who work to represent their interests. This involves the contribution of young people from diverse backgrounds and also belonging to vulnerable groups in key consultation processes, such as the Conference on the Future of Europe, (3) promoting opportunities for young people arising from the public policies at EU, national, regional level and local level in order to support their personal, social and professional development in a greener, more digital and more inclusive Union. In its broader sense, the European Year of Youth will go hand in hand with the successful implementation of NextGenerationEU , which ensures a fast-forwarding of the twin transitions, provides the possibility to collectively emerge stronger from the pandemic and re- opens perspectives full of opportunities for young people, including quality jobs and education and training opportunities for the Europe of the future, and supports young people\u2019s participation in society. The Commission aims to enhance the role of youth in turning the recovery into a driving force for future-oriented well-being and welfare. \u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area The EU Youth Strategy is the framework for EU youth policy cooperation for 2019-2027, based on the Council Resolution of 26 November 2018 2 . EU youth cooperation shall make the most of youth policy's potential. It fosters youth participation in democratic life, in line with Article 165(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It also supports social and civic engagement and aims to ensure that all young people have the necessary resources to take part in society. The European Youth Goals 3 , that are an integral part of the EU Youth Strategy, have been developed by young people for young people under the EU Youth dialogue process, and represent the areas where change still needs to happen, in order for young people to live to their full potential. At the same time, the European Year of Youth 2022 will give a unique impetus to the creation of a European Education Area by creating a genuine European space of learning by 2025 in which inclusive and high quality education and training for all is not hampered by borders. It will contribute to the European Climate Pact , the updated Digital Education Action Plan and the HealthyLifestyle4all initiative. It will be supported by the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan in the area of employment, skills and poverty reduction. The European Year of Youth will emphasise the Union\u2019s efforts to expanding employment opportunities for youth in the post-pandemic recovery through the reinforced Youth Guarantee 4 , and the relaunch of the European Alliance for Apprenticeships and the European Apprentices Network, the European Child Guarantee, the implementation of the European Skills Agenda 5 , the Commission Recommendation on an Effective Active Support to Employment following the COVID-19 crisis 6 (EASE) , as well as the launch of the new initiative ALMA (Aim, Learn, Master, Achieve). ALMA will be a cross-border youth mobility scheme for disadvantaged young people aged 18-30 who are not in employment, education or training. Although \u201cdigital natives\u201d, young people, particularly minors, deserve support and empowerment for a life where the distinction between online and offline is more and more 2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2018:456:FULL 3 https://europa.eu/youth/strategy/european-youth-goals_en 4 https://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=22829&langId=en 5 https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1223&langId=en 6 https://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=23699&langId=en ",
        "EN 3 EN blurred. In 2022, the updated Better internet for children Strategy will put at its core youth participation, digital skills, inclusion and the promotion of well-being of children. The EU Comprehensive Strategy on the Rights of the Child and the European Child Guarantee 7 set a new standard for child and teen participation as they have been developed together with children. Many of these opportunities are underpinned by significant EU investment, in particular through programmes such as Erasmus+, the European Solidarity Corps, the European Social Fund Plus, Creative Europe, Horizon Europe, the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, the Justice Programme, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund and the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development. These funding programmes make a significant EU contribution towards enabling youth to pursue their personal, social and professional fulfilment. The EU programmes specifically dedicated to youth will have a key role during the European Year of Youth. The year 2022 will mark the 35 years of the Erasmus+ programme and the Year will be a great opportunity to celebrate the ten million young people who took part in that adventure since 1987, and to promote the new generation of this programme in all its dimensions, covering education, training, youth and sport. The European Solidarity Corps will also enter into its fifth year in 2022. The 9 th May will be a symbolic date to organise activities or events around that day. Activities organised in the course of the European Year of Youth should be relevant for all Member States. Member States would therefore be requested to appoint a national coordinator responsible for organising their participation in the European Year of Youth. The Commission shall convene meetings of the national coordinators in order to coordinate the running of the European Year of Youth and to exchange information regarding its implementation at national and Union level. \u2022 Consistency with other Union policies The European Year of Youth 2022 will be cross-sectoral, building on all EU policies and programmes that strive to improve the lives of all young people and empower them . It should build on the European Green Deal \u2013 the EU sustainable growth strategy \u2013 and other existing initiatives and policies such as the Digital Decade, the European Single Market (which will soon celebrate its 30 th anniversary), the New European Bauhaus, the Horizon Europe missions, the Conference on the Future of Europe, the European Pillar of Social Rights, the EU Strategy on the rights of the child, the Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the EU Roma Strategic Framework for equality, inclusion and participation, the LGBTIQ Equality Strategy, the EU Anti-racism Action Plan, EU Strategy on Combating Antisemitism and Fostering Jewish Life, the Action Plan on Integration and Inclusion 2021-2027, the Gender Equality Strategy, the European Democracy Action Plan, Europe\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan and the Long Term Vision for EU\u2019s Rural Areas. The European Year of Youth has links with many Union policy areas beyond youth policy itself, such as education and training, employment, social inclusion, culture and the media, sports, health, research and innovation, environment and climate, transport, non-discrimination and anti-racism, cohesion and urban policy, rural development, migration as well as with Union\u2019s ties with its neighbourhood and international partnerships. 7 https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/rights-child/eu-strategy-rights-child- and-european-child-guarantee_en ",
        "EN 4 EN The European Year of Youth will be implemented using existing EU programmes and delivery mechanisms already in place and the drive provided by NextGenerationEU. Youth relevant investment is currently eligible for significant EU funding under several EU programmes and instruments, in particular with Erasmus+, the European Solidarity Corps, Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs, Creative Europe, the European Social Fund Plus, the Youth Employment Initiative, the European Regional and Development Fund, the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme, Digital Europe and Horizon Europe. The external dimension of these programmes and sharing its valuable lessons, as well as dedicated external instruments such as NDICI-Global Europe, will be an integral part of the EU\u2019s youth engagement with our international partners. The upcoming Youth Action Plan will provide a core focus for the external dimension of the European Year of Youth. The European Year of Youth 2022 will be aligned with the Commission\u2019s priorities for 2019- 2024. 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Legal basis In accordance with Article 6(e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in the field of youth the Union has the competence to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States. Article 165(2) TFEU provides that the Union's action shall be aimed at \u2018 encouraging the development of youth exchanges and of exchanges of socio-educational instructors, and encouraging the participation of young people in democratic life in Europe '. This Article further provides to encourage mobility of students and the European dimension in education and sport. In addition, Article 166(2) TFEU provides that the Union's action shall aim to \u2018 facilitate access to vocational training and encourage mobility of instructors and trainees and particularly young people \u2019 and to \u2018 develop exchanges of information and experience on issues common to the training systems of the Member States \u2019. The legal basis of the proposal is twofold: (1) Article 165(4) TFEU, which states that, in order to contribute to the achievement of these objectives referred to in this Article, \u201c the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, shall adopt incentive measures, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States \u201d. (2) Article 166(4) TFEU, which states that \u2018The European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, shall adopt measures to contribute to the achievement of the objectives referred to in this Article, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States, and the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt recommendations.\u2019 \u2022 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The present proposal is in conformity with the principle of subsidiarity as provided for in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The objectives of the proposal cannot be achieved to a sufficient extent solely by action undertaken by the Member States. This is because the action specifically aims at strengthening the voice of the young people at the ",
        "EN 5 EN European level to enrich the common Union project and because action at national level alone would not benefit from the European dimension of exchanges of experience and good practices between Member States. The Union shall pursue its objectives by appropriate means commensurate with the competences which are conferred upon it by the Treaties. In addition, Member States' action would benefit from the awareness and visibility created within and beyond the EU. \u2022 Proportionality The present proposal is in conformity with the principle of proportionality as provided for in Article 5(4) TEU. The proposed course of action is simple. It relies on existing programmes and on refocusing communication activities on the themes of the European Year of Youth 2022. It imposes no disproportionate management constraints on administrations implementing the proposal. The Union action will support and complement the efforts of Member States. This action will firstly improve the effectiveness of the Union\u2019s own instruments. Secondly, it will act as an enabler by encouraging synergies and cooperation among Member States, organisations and foundations, and private and public enterprises. The Union action will not go beyond what is necessary to address the identified problems. \u2022 Choice of the instrument A decision of the European Parliament and of the Council is the most appropriate instrument to ensure the full involvement of the legislative authority in designating 2022 as the European Year of Youth. 3.

The European Year of Youth 2022 can be implemented within existing budget limits by using those programmes that provide for setting funding priorities on an annual or multiannual basis. The proposed initiative would not have any significant social, economic or environmental impact beyond that of the existing instruments. \u2022 Regulatory fitness and simplification N/A ",
        "EN 6 EN \u2022 Fundamental rights N/A 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The flexibility for setting priorities on an annual or multiannual basis in the relevant programmes, such as the Erasmus+ programme and the European Solidarity Corps, is sufficient to envisage an awareness-raising campaign on a scale similar to previous European Years. At least EUR 8 million will be devoted to such coordination activities. Most of the actions will be supported through Union programmes and instruments, with actions directly benefiting Europe\u2019s young people. 5. OTHER ELEMENTS \u2022 Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements National coordinators, in cooperation with representatives of organisations or bodies in the field of youth, including young people themselves where possible, should actively engage young people in preparing and implementing the activities of the European Year of Youth 2022. The proposal includes an obligation for the Commission to report by 31 December 2023 on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the initiatives covered by the European Year of Youth. Following the European Year of Youth, the Commission, under the implementation of the European Youth Strategy 2019-2027, will strive to keep alive, promote and further analyse and implement the outcomes and legacy of the year through the various EU youth programmes. \u2022 Explanatory documents (for directives) N/A \u2022 Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal ",

(2) In the Bratislava Roadmap of 16 September 2016 10 , the 27 Heads of State or Government committed to \"provide better opportunities for youth\", notably through \"EU support for Member States in fighting youth unemployment and on enhanced EU programmes dedicated to youth\".

(4) The European Union Youth Strategy 2019-2027 recognises that young people are architects of their own lives, contribute to positive change in society and enrich the EU\u2019s ambitions, and that youth policy can contribute to create a space where young people can seize opportunities and relate to European values. Previous European Years, such as the European Year of Rail 2021, the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018, or the European Year of Citizens 2013-2014 offer valuable experience which should inform future efforts to engage youth in shaping their future and the future of Europe. 8 OJ C , , p. . 9 OJ C , , p. . 10 Bratislava Declaration and Roadmap - Consilium (europa.eu) 11 The Rome Declaration (europa.eu) ",

Highlighting the confidence that she draws for Europe\u2019s future from the inspiration provided by Europe's young people, President von der Leyen added that \u201c if we are to shape our Union in their mould, young people must be able to shape Europe's future\u201d. Europe needs the vision, engagement and participation of all young people to build a better future, and Europe needs to give young people opportunities for the future, a future that is greener, more digital and more inclusive. This is why the President proposed \" a year dedicated to empowering those who have dedicated so much to others\". (7) The active participation of young people in democratic processes is crucial for the future of Europe and its democratic societies. In line with the European Democracy Action Plan 13 , the European Year of Youth therefore aims to give a boost to the active involvement of young people in Europe\u2019s democratic life, including by supporting participation activities for young people from diverse backgrounds in processes such as the Conference on the Future of Europe, promoting civic engagement and volunteering initiatives, thereby raising awareness of European common values and fundamental rights, as well as European history and culture, bringing together young people and decision-makers at local, national and Union levels and contributing to the process of European integration. (8) The essential role of young people is also recognised and must be supported \u201cto channel their infinite capacities for activism into the creation of a better world\u201d. The European Year of Youth is a concrete contribution to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (\u20182030 Agenda\u2019) 14 , which highlights that \u201cchildren and young women and men are critical agents of change\u201d, and should give a further impetus to the implementation of that Agenda, the road to sustainable development, and the capacity of young people to shape the future, not only of the Union, but also EU partner countries and of our planet as a whole. (9) The European Year should contribute to strengthen youth participation in EU external action across all policies, create new opportunities for education and exchanges, partnerships and dialogue between youth from the EU and partner countries and to increase the role of youth engagement in strategic communication and public diplomacy action (10) The European Youth Goals, which are an integral part of the EU Youth Strategy, and which have been developed by young people for young people under the EU Youth dialogue process, are a testimony to the eagerness of many young Europeans to participate in defining the direction in which the development of the European Union should go. 12 soteu_2021_address_en_0.pdf (europa.eu) 13 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0790&from=EN 14 21252030 Agenda for Sustainable Development web.pdf (un.org) ",

(12) The European Year of Youth should support Union\u2019s efforts to expanding employment opportunities for youth in the post-pandemic recovery as stated in the European Parliament Resolution on the Youth Guarantee (2020/2764(RSP)) 16 which underlines that lockdown measures have caused a sudden disruption to young people\u2019s formal and informal education, traineeships, internships and apprenticeships, as well as jobs, affecting their income, earning potential and well-being, including their health, and in particular their mental health. (13) The European Year of Youth should give further impetus to the creation of quality youth employment opportunities under the Youth Employment Support (YES) initiative, including the reinforced Youth Guarantee 17 and under the ALMA initiative (Aim, Learn, Master, Achieve) to be implemented under the European Social Fund +. ALMA should be a cross-border youth mobility scheme for disadvantaged people not in employment, education or training to gain professional experience abroad accompanied by social services with the aim to provide these young people, including from rural, peripheral and less developed regions, with education, training or quality employment. (14) The European Parliament resolution on the impact of COVID-19 on youth and on sport (2020/2864(RSP)) 18 underlines the particularly acute impact the current pandemic has had on young people not in education, employment, or training (NEETs) and highlights the need to tackle the problems faced by young people from vulnerable groups; notes that youth unemployment and poverty have risen steadily since the outbreak of the pandemic and urges the Commission and the Member States to take all the necessary measures to counter the disastrous effects on youth employment. The Resolution recalls the role of volunteering in developing life and work skills for young people and considers that the European Solidarity Corps can help young Europeans to broaden their opportunities beyond their local realities.

(17) The European Year of Youth should give further impetus to the European Parliament Resolution on Effective measures to \u2018green\u2019 Erasmus+, Creative Europe and the European Solidarity Corps (2019/2195(INI)) 26 which underlines that Erasmus+, through its support for formal and non-formal education and training and for youth participation activities, is crucial for awareness-raising among Europeans, in particular young generations, to encourage them to have an active and informed position on sustainability and relevant policies and to become engaged and conscious future citizens; highlights, in this respect, the major role played by youth and civil society organisations in sharing best practices and implementing projects raising younger generations\u2019 awareness about sustainability. (18) In her State of the European Union Address, President von der Leyen highlighted that \u201cEurope needs all its youth\u201d. In fulfilling its objectives, the European Year should be fully inclusive and actively promoting the participation of people with fewer opportunities.

In particular, in its actions and activities, the European Year of Youth seeks to ensure full respect for the right to equality between women and men and the right to non-discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, and to promote the Charter's application. The EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child 28 and the European Child Guarantee 29 set a new standard for child and teen representation and recognise children and young people as active citizens and agents of change.

(21) By creating an environment for promoting those objectives simultaneously at Union, national, regional and local levels, a greater synergy and a better use of resources can be achieved. In that regard, the Commission should provide timely information to and closely cooperate with the European Parliament, the Council and the Member States, the Committee of the Regions, European Economic and Social Committee and the bodies and associations active in the field of youth at Union level. In order to ensure that activities developed for the European Year of Youth have a European dimension, Member States are also encouraged to collaborate with each other. (22) The European Year of Youth should also focus on actions and activities which present a potential European added value. The notion of European added value is to be understood broadly and to be demonstrated in different ways, such as where actions or activities have a transnational character, particularly with regard to cooperation aimed at achieving a sustainable systemic impact or contribute to young people's European identity, awareness and ownership of European common values and fundamental rights, and ability to take part in the Union's representative and participative democracy.

Without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority, the aim should be to provide funding for the implementation of this Decision of at least EUR 8 million. Subject to the availability of funding, co-financing from the Union budget of activities in support of the European Year of Youth shall be in accordance with the rules, applicable to the relevant programmes, including in particular Erasmus+ and the European Solidarity Corps and, where appropriate, other Union programmes.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
