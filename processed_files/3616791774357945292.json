The Committee noted that the strategy for growth and jobs relaunched in 2005 by the spring European Council has not succeeded in involving, to the necessary extent the institutional players with a key role to play in its implementation. It pointed out a \u2018 Lisbon paradox \u2019 : local and regional authorities play a major role in the growth and jobs strategy, but do not perceive this to be part of the Lisbon strategy. This deficit is at the root of the failure to convert the Lisbon objectives into integrated policies at all levels of government. The Committee stressed the need for a better coordination of growth and jobs policies at different levels of governance. Moreover, it called on the Commission and the institutions at all levels to step up communication endeavours to inform local and regional authorities about policies and programmes developed. Finally, the Committee called for a broad reflection on the priorities of the strategy, the most effective and efficient procedures and the strategy \u2019 s costs. Bull. EU 11-2008 11 ",

Furthermore, Parliament called for support for the activities of the working group on the death penalty of the African Commission on Human and Peoples \u2019 Rights in drafting a protocol to the African Charter banning the death penalty and making its reinstatement impossible.

European Parliament resolution on the EMU@10: the first 10 years of economic and monetary union and future challenges.

Parliament welcomed the fact that the euro has brought stability and fostered economic integration in the euro area. It also welcomed the stabilising effects of the euro on world currency markets, especially in times of crisis. Nevertheless, it noted that internal economic divergences had not yet diminished as expected and productivity had not developed satisfactorily in all parts of the euro area. It therefore underlined that there is more to be done to reap the full benefits of the EMU and proposed elements and concrete measures for an EMU roadmap. Concerning economic diver- gence, structural reforms and public finances, Parliament believes that streamlined and more coherent, multi-supportive economic reforms, coordinated on the basis of the integrated guidelines for growth and jobs and a policy-mix approach of the Lisbon strategy could decrease economic divergences and be a great help towards economic recovery. As far as monetary policy is concerned, Parliament recalled its support for the independence of the ECB. It is of the view that the ECB should move towards a direct inflation targeting regime. On integration and supervision of financial markets, Parliament considers that much remains to be done in the area of the clearing and settlement of cross-border securities transactions, where no real integration exists to date. More integration is also needed with regard to retail services. Concerning the enlargement of the euro area, Parliament stressed the need for equal treatment between euro Member States and those seeking to join. It also insisted that joining the euro requires full adherence to all the Maastricht criteria. Finally, on the international role of the euro and external representation, Parliament regretted that in spite of the growing global role of the euro, attempts to improve the external representation of the euro area on financial and monetary matters had not made much progress. It also recalled that the most effective way for the euro area to align its influence with its economic weight is by developing common positions and consolidating its representation, ultimately obtaining a single seat in the relevant international financial institutions and forums. Coordination of economic policies Medium-term financial assistance for balance of payments 1.7.2. Council decision providing EU medium- term financial assistance for Hungary. Reference: Council Regulation (EC) No 332/ 2002 establishing a single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States \u2019 balances of payments: OJ L 53, 23.2.2002; Bull. 1/2-2002, point 1.3.24 Commission proposal: COM(2008) 716; Bull. 10-2008, point 1.7.3 Adopted by the Council on 4 November. This decision granted a EUR 6.5 billion loan to Hungary to enable it to deal with the financial crisis which it is currently facing. The EU support for Hungary will be part of a bigger financing package in which the IMF provides a loan of EUR 12.5 billion and the World Bank a loan of EUR 1 billion, in order to support Hungary \u2019 s balance of payments in the medium term. In return, the Hungarian authorities promised to apply a programme of accom- panying measures which will be included in an 14 Bull. EU 11-2008 ",
        "update of Hungary \u2019 s convergence programme. Authorities also pledged to accelerate the consolidation of the national budget this year and in 2009 and to reform budgetary governance. In addition, measures have been taken, with support from the ECB, to improve liquidity on the markets and strengthen financial stability. 1.7.3. Proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States \u2019 balances of payments. Regulation to be amended: Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002: OJ L 53, 23.2.2002; Bull. 1/2- 2002, point 1.3.24 Commission proposal: COM(2008) 717; Bull. 10-2008, point 1.7.4 Endorsed by the European Parliament on 20 November, subject to certain amendments. Parliament insisted on its role, that of Member States within the Council and the Commission \u2019 s to act speedily and ensure that market confidence is not undermined in the event of exceptional situations. It also asked that the Council examine, every two years, whether the financial assistance facility established is still suitable. International economic, monetary and financial matters International financial crisis 1.7.4. Informal meeting of Heads of State or Government. Meeting held in Brussels on 7 November. The Heads of State or Government of the EU met ahead of the international summit on the financial crisis held on 15 November in Washington. They once again expressed the unity of Member States as they confront the crisis and agreed on a number of specific principles and approaches: \u00a8 no financial institution, market sector or jurisdiction should escape proportionate and adequate regulation or at least supervision; \u00a8 the new international financial system must be based on principles of accountability and transparency; \u00a8 this new system must be capable of measuring risks in order to prevent crises; \u00a8 give the IMF a central role in a more efficient financial architecture. 1.7.5. Meeting of G20 Heads of State or Government. Meeting held in Washington on 14 and 15 November. The G20 countries, joined by Spain and the Netherlands, in the presence of Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, pledged to do all they could to fight the global economic slowdown. They agreed on a joint declaration setting out general principles and a detailed action plan to reform the financial markets in the short to medium term. Strongly rejecting protectionism, they called for the resumption of multilateral trade talks, wanting developing countries and emerging economies to suffer as little as possible from a crisis caused by the rich countries. According to the G20, reform of the financial markets will take a four-pronged approach: \u00a8 strengthening transparency and account- ability; \u00a8 enhancing sound regulation; \u00a8 strengthening international cooperation; \u00a8 reforming the international financial institu- tions. 1.7.6.

The Commission set up a European economic recovery plan to respond to the current economic situation. Given the scale of the crisis, the EU needs a coordinated approach, big and ambitious enough to restore consumer and business confidence. This plan must bring together all the policy levers available at EU and national levels. According to the Commission, all Member States will need to take action to deal with the crisis. Indeed, properly coordinated national efforts can target different goals in parallel and cushion the blow of recession in the short term. They can also promote the structural reforms needed to help Bull. EU 11-2008 15 Economic and monetary policy ",
        "the EU emerge stronger from the crisis, without undermining longer term fiscal sustainability. The strategic aims of the recovery plan are to: \u00a8 swiftly stimulate demand and boost consumer confidence; \u00a8 lessen the human cost of the economic downturn and its impact on the most vulnerable; \u00a8 help Europe prepare to take advantage for when growth returns so that the European economy is in tune with the demands of competitiveness and the needs of the future, as outlined in the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs. That means pursuing the necessary structural reforms, supporting innovation, and building a knowledge-based economy; \u00a8 speed up the shift towards a low carbon economy in order for the EU to be able to apply its strategy for limiting climate change and promoting energy security. In pursuing these aims, the European economic recovery plan is designed to exploit synergies and avoid negative spill-over effects through coordinated action; draw on all available policy levers; ensure full coherence between immediate actions and medium- to longer-term objectives; take full account of the global nature of the problem and shape the EU \u2019 s contribution to international responses. This plan, anchored in the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs consists of an immediate budgetary stimulus amounting to EUR 200 billion (1.5 % EU GDP), made up of a budgetary expansion by Member States of EUR 170 billion and EU funding in support of immediate actions in the order of EUR 30 billion. The plan also comprises a number of priority actions, grounded in the Lisbon strategy, designed to adapt the European economies to long-term challenges, whilst continuing to implement structural reforms aimed at raising potential growth.

The Council adopted conclusions on the following: \u00a8 2008 Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) report: the Council endorsed the 2008 EFC status report on information requirements in the EMU. It welcomed the progress achieved on the principal European economic indicators (PEEIs) and the consolidation of the results in term of timeliness and coverage, matching most of the targets fixed by the 2002 communication; \u00a8 reduction of statistical burden: the Council welcomed the report on the implementation of the communication on reduction of response burden, simplification, and priority-setting providing an update of the commitments given and the ongoing actions since 2007. It stressed the need to continue the efforts in these areas without jeopardising the quality and availability of essential data for policymaking in the EU; \u00a8 statistical governance: the Council welcomed the report on the implementation of the code of practice. It noted that concerning impartial dissemination of statistics, limited, controlled and publicised ministerial pre-release access to statistical releases is warranted. It looked forward to the swift establishment of the European statistical governance advisory board (ESGAB). The Council took note of the ECB recommendation for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 concerning the collection of statistical informa- tion by the ECB. In particular the sub- committee looks forward to the amended regulation that will appropriately mirror the compromise proposal of the regulation on European statistics. 1.8.3.

Parliament urged Member States to make more progress in balancing social expenditure and social activation and further- more, to attract and retain more people in quality, secure and mandatory social insurance employment. It called on the Commission to carry out more detailed research and studies concerning the impact of the individualisation of social rights on the equal treatment of women and men. Concerning the workforce, Parliament believed that a decreasing workforce will lead to a decrease in the total number of hours worked. It recalled that higher employment rates are heavily dependent on the need to keep all groups active and to put into place active policies on the employment of women, young people and the elderly. Concerning pensions, Parliament recognised the fact that public pension systems strengthen social solidarity and that safeguarding them should be a political priority. It called on Member States to take serious account of the need to redesign traditional pension systems. Concerning financial sustainability, Parliament stressed the need for Member States to preserve adequate levels of funding for social security and pensions systems. It stressed the need to consider a phased transition from joint contribution-based to fund-based insurance-type pension schemes. Concerning healthcare and long-term care, Parliament pointed out that special attention should be placed on persons needing expensive or long-term healthcare. Moreover, it called on Member States to avoid a purely financial approach when adopting reform policies of their respective national healthcare systems. According to it, the starting point for any reform should be a careful analysis of the existing health financing system. Freedom of movement for workers 1.9.6.

This communication follows the Commission \u2019 s undertaking, as set out in the communication \u2018 Improving quality and productivity at work: Community strategy 2007 \u2013 12 on health and safety at work \u2019 , to assess the implementation of the regulatory framework with a view to improving it. The assessment covers the transposition and implementation of two directives in the EU-15 countries only. In the Commission opinion, this evaluation will also be a source of precious information for the 12 new Member States in order to apply these two directives. The assessment of the implementa- tion of Directive 92/57/EEC shows that, while the incidence rate and number of accidents at work was down, the figures are still unacceptable and construction is the sector where workers are exposed to the greatest risks. According to the Commission, non-binding instruments are needed at European and/or national level to facilitate the practical application of Directive 92/57/EEC. It will develop a practical non-binding guide to help all players to meet their obligations effectively, and to clarify certain key concepts in the directive. The assessment of Directive 92/58/EEC indicates a very positive impact in terms of protecting the health and safety of workers and of third parties. It has enabled risk situations to be clearly identified, and has contributed decisively to implementing the free movement of workers. COM(2008) 698 1.9.8.

Parliament requested the Commis- sion to submit a legislative proposal on the revision of the existing legislation relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women, by 31 December 2009. Moreover, Parliament was convinced that it is essential to ensure better and earlier implementation of the provisions of Directive 2006/54/EC, relating to equality organisations and social dialogue with a view to redressing differences in pay. It pointed out that collective negotiation and bargaining have an important role to play in combating discrimination and called on the European institutions to organise a European equal pay day. Finally, it called on workers and employers organisations to jointly develop objective job evaluation instruments, in order to reduce the pay gap between men and women. 1.10.2.

The Council adopted a common position on a proposal for a directive improving the system of units of measurement within the EU. The common position proposes to amend Directive 80/181/EEC which is based on the international system of units (SI). The new provisions of the directive are intended to: \u00a8 enable the UK and Ireland to continue to use the limited local exemptions concerning the pint, the mile and the troy ounce where they are still applied; \u00a8 extend its scope to consumer and environmental protection; \u00a8 extend the use of supplementary indications for an unlimited period. The importance of the use of supplementary indications lies, for 24 Bull. EU 11-2008 ",

This proposal lays down conditions for the issuance of credit ratings which are needed to restore market confidence and increase investor protection. It introduces a registration procedure for credit rating agencies in order to enable European supervisors to control the activities of rating agencies whose ratings are used by credit institutions, investment firms, insurance, assurance and reinsurance undertakings, collec- tive investment schemes and pension funds within the Community. The proposal also includes an effective surveillance regime whereby European regula- tors will supervise credit rating agencies. New rules include the following: \u00a8 credit rating agencies may not provide advisory services; \u00a8 they will not be allowed to rate financial instruments if they do not have sufficient quality information to base their ratings on; \u00a8 they must disclose the models, methodolo- gies and key assumptions on which they base their ratings; \u00a8 they will be obliged to publish an annual transparency report; \u00a8 they will have to create an internal function to review the quality of their ratings; \u00a8 they should have at least three independent directors on their boards whose remuneration cannot depend on the business performance of the rating agency. They will be appointed for a single term of office which can be no longer than five years. They can only be dismissed in case of professional misconduct.

Parliament welcomed the Commis- sion initiatives in the field of financial education of consumers, in particular the recent setting-up of the expert group on financial education, and its intention to publish an online database of financial education schemes and research in the EU. Parliament highlighted that the objective of educating and raising the awareness of Bull. EU 11-2008 25 The internal market ",
        "consumers as regards finance and credit must be to improve their understanding of economic commitments and to avoid unnecessary risk, excessive debt and financial exclusion. Training and provision of information should allow consumers to take an independent approach, based on their own judgement, to the financial products that are offered to them or that they are considering using. Parliament recommended that financial education schemes focus on important life-planning aspects such as basic saving, debt, insurance and pensions. It stressed the need for an ongoing two-way educational process for both sides, that is to say financial advisors and consumers, so as to ensure the provision of accurate information.

This action plan is one of the actions announced in the single market review. The rationale behind this action is the need to enhance cross- border access to online services offered by public authorities. Governments across Europe have started to offer public services by electronic means ( \u2018 e-services \u2019 ), but implementa- tion has been focusing too much on national needs and means. According to the Commis- sion, this approach creates new \u2018 e-barriers \u2019 to cross-border markets, by restricting access to those public services for enterprises and individuals from other Member States and by hampering the functioning of the single market. The action plan seeks an EU-wide solution to cross-border use of online public services, proposing a comprehensive approach and committing to quick delivery dates. The Commission notes that the achievement of interoperable e-signatures and e-identification will simplify access for enterprises and citizens to cross-border electronic public services.

On the basis of the conclusions of the report submitted by the Commission in September, this proposal for a Council directive aims at amending Council Directive 2003/48/EC. The most important amendments proposed are designed to close loopholes in the current system and to clarify administrative obligations for paying agents. They relate to: \u00a8 the definition of interest payment for the purpose of the directive; \u00a8 the coverage, under certain conditions, of interest payments transited by some entities and legal arrangements established outside the EU, when the paying agent in the EU has evidence that the beneficial owner of any of these entities or arrangements is an individual resident in the EU; \u00a8 a clearer definition of those entities and arrangements inside the EU which are given paying agent responsibilities upon receipt of an interest payment; \u00a8 a number of other technical improvements whose need became evident following the consultations led by Commission services with EU economic operators (represented in an expert group) and with the tax administrations of Member States. New annexes are added to the directive in order to make these amendments operational. COM(2008) 727 Indirect taxation 1.11.10.

Waiting for Parliament opinion, the Council reached agreement in principle on a general approach on proposals for a directive and a regulation to strengthen the fight against VAT fraud. According to the Council, the fight against VAT fraud represents a major challenge both for the EU and for national budgets. Every year, this type of fraud costs Member States billions of euro. It most often takes the form of fraud circuits known as \u2018 VAT carousels \u2019 , which target cross-border transactions. These proposals provide for a reduction in the statutory time limits imposed on operators for the declaration of transactions for VAT purposes, together with a reduction in the time limits for transmission of such information between Member States, while avoiding any increase in the administrative burden on undertakings, especially SMEs. 1.11.11. Sixth report under Article 12 of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89 on VAT collection and control procedures. Previous report: OJ C 55, 4.3.2005; COM(2004) 855; Bull. 1/2-2005, point 1.3.68 Reference: Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89 on the definitive uniform arrange- ments for the collection of own resources accruing from value added tax: OJ L 155, 7.6.1989 Adopted by the Commission on 11 November. The Commission considers that the Article 12 reports should be a driver for change. This change might be achieved by precipitating debate in Parliament and in the Council or by Bull. EU 11-2008 27 The internal market ",
        "triggering change in Member States as a result of a recommendation made in the reports. This report summarises the findings of how successful the reporting process has been when measured against these two yardsticks. According to the Commission, the results are not encouraging. A survey of all Member States asking about the activity they had initiated under Article 12 reports did not provide extensive or convincing evidence that any specific action had been made as a result of these reports. The absence of reaction from the budgetary authority puts into question whether there is any continuing requirement for the report beyond simply fulfilling a regulatory obligation and the Commission has numerous other opportunities to enhance VAT collection and to contribute to reducing VAT fraud. Nonetheless, the Commission considers it important that the debate on VAT control, collection and management continue at all relevant levels. The Commission will therefore continue to use the Article 12 arrangements to provide an impetus for reflection and change in Member States by providing a platform for discussions, exchange of ideas and for pooling experiences in the VAT field among Member States and between Member States and the Commission.

Finally, a new recital states that further efforts should be made to come to a gradual harmonisation of excise duty within the EU, while taking into account matters such as public health, protection of the environment and budgetary considerations.

This communication presents the key findings and messages from the Commission \u2019 s 2008 European competitiveness report. The report underlines the need for Europe to further enhance its adaptation capacity to external shocks by keeping momentum in the growth and jobs strategy and to boost competitiveness. The report analyses different factors that have an impact on competitiveness, such as the openness in trade and foreign direct investment and corporate social responsibility as well as the sustainable industrial policy. The key conclusion of the report is that well-designed and implemented policies in some specific areas such as trade, innovation and entrepreneurship or energy can contribute to the strengthening of the competitiveness of the EU economy. Concerning the external dimension of competi- tiveness, trade policies should target the reduction of behind-the-border costs.

Globally, the Commission concludes that the financial instruments under MAP have helped to address some gaps and failures in capital markets for start-up companies and SMEs. In general, MAP financial instruments reached the objective of improving the financial environment for European business, especially for SMEs. They were implemented in an appropriate and effective way, via the high leverage effect and they leveraged a significant amount of additional money. COM(2008) 708 32 Bull. EU 11-2008 ",

The Committee highlighted the importance of the regional and local authorities 36 Bull. EU 11-2008 ",
        "in promoting joint research programmes as they are more in touch with the specific local situation in terms of science, technology and the economy, and therefore know when cooperation on areas of strategic importance is required. In fact some regions in Europe are already successfully leading or are involved in coordination and collaboration instruments for research programmes, as in the case of the ERA-NET projects. The Committee stressed that regional authorities as well as Member States should be involved in promoting cooperation agreements in the framework of joint programming. It stated, however, that implementing this programme ought not to impose any additional burden on Member States and the regions and therefore suggested that it be supported by the Commission, both in terms of facilitating agreements and through the commitment of financial resources. The Committee suggested that the Commission set up a separate fund to support this initiative. It suggested that, before launching new programmes, both the EU and Member States should try all possible ways of achieving synergies between existing transnational policies and cooperation instruments and establishing the mechanisms which will ensure that existing coordination programmes are used to the full. It recognised the importance of setting up initiatives focused on achieving coordination and cooperation between the stakeholders involved in European research, development and innovation, in order to achieve the objective set out in the Lisbon strategy of turning Europe into the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world. The Committee suggested, however, that the process of coordination should be organised from the bottom up, taking into account the principles of variable geometry and subsidiarity. Bull.

This draft proposal will allow for the adoption of a more flexible regulatory approach to the use of the 900 MHz band (890-915 and 935- 960 MHz), currently limited to GSM, to meet current needs of the Community internal market and to contribute to the objectives of the i2010 initiative. In view of technological develop- ments since the adoption of the GSM directive 20 years ago, the aim of this proposal is to allow a wider choice from among the services and technologies that have now become available, and thereby maximise competition in the use of the bands so far covered by the directive, while ensuring that services remain coordinated and safeguarding the continued operation of GSM. To this end, the Commission considers that the use of this spectrum should also be allowed for pan-European electronic communication services other than GSM. As a first step, this would include the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). The amendment of the GSM directive offers important opportunities for the entire wireless communications industry, which together with national regulatory authorities is pushing for the opening of the 900 MHz bands. Furthermore, the draft proposal responds to the concerns raised by Parliament, which is against the repeal of the GSM directive, as initially proposed by the Commission in July 2007. Consequently an amending directive is now proposed by the Commission, while the previous one is withdrawn. COM(2008) 762 Development and stability of the Internet 1.15.5.

The Council underlined that the deployment of high- speed fixed and mobile networks has a strategic importance; European competitiveness, a strong innovation capacity and the development of next generation services depend on it. It added that a proper balance between stimulation of competition and innovation and encouragement of private investment, taking into account the costs of civil engineering works, will also contribute to this goal. The Council recalled that, when it comes to mobile very high-speed networks, Europe \u2019 s position is currently strong with respect to equipment and terminal manufacturers and first-tier operators, and that in such a context, the development of mobile very high-speed broadband is a European growth vector. With respect to the Internet of the future, it invited Member States and the Commission to initiate ambitious research programmes that will allow Europe to take an active part in the Internet \u2019 s transformation and breakthrough changes. The Council also invited Member States to increase their cooperation, within the high-level group devoted to Internet governance, in order to improve their mutual understanding of issues of safety, privacy, resilience and governance. Furthermore, it encouraged all stakeholders to participate in coordination efforts by public and private sector stakeholders in order to achieve the level of security and trust in the Internet that is indispensable to its development and to enhancing measures to limit the risks linked to critical infrastructures.

The Committee believes that energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy must be a key element of European energy policy. According to it, stepping up investment in information and communication Bull. EU 11-2008 41 Information society and the media ",
        "technologies (ICT) that boost energy efficiency enables local and regional authorities to manage climate change, to increase distributed energy generation and to reduce energy consumption and offers new business opportunities for local companies. The Committee added that as part of their joint responsibility for the environment, local and regional authorities could, with the support of the EU and Member States, act as a pioneer and set examples for others by using ICTs to improve energy efficiency. It considers that this pioneering role would include establishing a new partnership with ICT companies and energy producers, making public buildings energy-smart, introducing smart lighting in public places and increasing energy efficiency in administration and service provision. Furthermore, the Committee attached great importance to the Commission \u2019 s plans to draw on the experience of urban communities in validating and testing ideas and to work together with them and existing networks of local and regional authorities. According to it, because of their many roles (such as regulator, consumer, service provider, energy user and supplier, initiator, expert and provider of guidelines), local and regional authorities have many reasons to wholeheartedly support the full exploitation of ICT in efforts to increase energy efficiency. The Committee will endeavour to use all the means at its disposal to raise awareness of these opportunities among urban communities and networks of local and regional authorities and will encourage them to take part in the partnership process.

Article 12 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/ 2002 provides that the Commission presents a report on the activity of the Fund in the previous year to the Parliament and to the Council. This report presented the activities of the Fund in 2007 covering the treatment of new applications, the monitoring of the ongoing implementation of grants, and the assessment of the implementation reports with a view to preparing these for closure. In 2007 the Commission finalised the assessment of the three applications received during the preceding year and received a total of 19 new applications, the highest number of applications in one year since the Fund was set up. Nine of these applications (relating to forest fires in different Italian regions) had to be declared inadmissible as they were presented outside the 10-week application period laid down in the regulation. Four \u2018 regional disaster \u2019 applications for forest fires and flooding in Spain and Cyprus were rejected as they were found not to meet the criteria. Four other applications from Greece, France, Slovenia and the UK were pending at the end of 2007. The final reports received tended to confirm the significant impact and added value that the assistance from the Fund has had in the countries concerned. This relates both to the physical operations carried out on the ground and to the political benefits of solidarity among Member States in cases of real need. COM(2008) 722 1.16.3.

        "European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund concerning certain provisions relating to financial management. Regulation to be amended: Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund: OJ L 210, 31.7.2006; Bull. 7/8-2006, point 1.15.6, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1989/ 2006: OJ L 411, 30.12.2006; Bull 12-2006, point 1.15.2 Adopted by the Commission on 26 November. In light of the current financial crisis the Commission has examined together with Member States, the possibility of accelerating investment projects and payments to Member States. An accelerated implementation of programmes would represent an effective contribution towards a quicker return to normal economic conditions as and when the crisis begins to recede. The proposed amendments are concentrated on four principal areas: \u00a8 a clarification of Article 44 relating to financial engineering instruments concerning the intervention of the EIB and EIF in support of Member States for the preparation and implementation of operational programmes; \u00a8 an amendment to Article 56 relating to the eligibility of expenditure by extending the possibility of payment of general expenses on the basis of lump-sum rates to Structural Funds and to introduce the possibility of benefits-in- kind being considered as eligible expenditure at the time of establishing \u2014 or contributing to \u2014 funds; \u00a8 a modification of the dispositions relating to expenditure declarations: for major projects on the removal of the prohibition against including incurred expenditures for such projects on interim payment requests before approval by the Commission; for State aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty through the removal of the 35 % limit hitherto attached to advances paid to beneficiaries by the body granting the aid, thus permitting advance payments of up to 100 %, other conditions remaining unchanged; \u00a8 an increase in the third pre-financing instalment (2009) of 2 % for the Structural Funds for those Member States that acceded to the EU on or after 1 May 2004; the creation of a third instalment (2009) of 2.5 % for all Funds for all those Member States which had acceded to the EU as constituted before 1 May 2004. COM(2008) 803 Other regional operations 1.16.4. Committee of the Regions opinion on the fifth progress report on economic and social cohesion, growing regions, growing Europe. Report: COM(2008) 371, Bull. 6-2008, point 1.16.2 Adopted by the Committee of the Regions on 27 November. The Committee maintained that the EU must acknowledge and boost the territorial dimension of cohesion policy in order to make possible economic and social development that is not only balanced and sustainable between the various regions, but also polycentric and harmonious in the regions themselves. It stressed that cohesion remains an important challenge, since the large discrepancies in economic and social development between the various regions and within them remain and, indeed, have been exacerbated by the EU \u2019 s latest enlargement. The Committee also highlighted the fact that if the desire is for cohesion policy to play an important role in buttressing a new economic and social balance, it must have the appropriate resources and means, whereas the current level of funding is no more than the minimum needed to carry out this function. It noted that cohesion must maintain a European dimension and rebuff any attempt to renationalise the Community effort, whose added value lies not least in being a wide-ranging common policy with clear strategic objectives that can respond to the continental and global challenges and adapt itself to regional and local needs. The Committee called for new financial instruments to be applied which could contribute in a more simple and effective way to investment, especially in regions which need restructuring and innovation and particularly to sustain the role and development of SMEs. Finally the Committee noted that, in keeping with the subsidiarity principle, local and regional authorities need to be involved at all stages, from planning to evaluation, because they are the tier of government nearest to the end recipients as well as those primarily responsible for implementation of cohesion policy. 1.16.5.

This proposal aims to add a further, simpler method of spending the EFS, so that its contribution to addressing the economic and social challenges facing Europe can be faster and more effective. The simplification would be achieved by amending Regulation (EC) No 1081/2006. In parallel to this proposal, the Commission is proposing amendments to the global rules governing cohesion policy. Changes in Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 would further strengthen the contribution cohesion policy can bring to the real economy. COM(2008) 813 Convergence (ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund) 1.16.6.

The number is less than 1 % lower than in 2005 which has to be read in conjunction with the 10 % decrease in the overall number of active EU vessels; \u00a8 the most frequent \u2018 serious infringements \u2019 relate to (i) storing, processing, placing for sale and transporting fishery products not meeting the marketing standards in force, and (ii) unauthorised fishing; \u00a8 different procedures, criminal or adminis- trative, are applied across the EU to sanction infringements. In the majority of cases, an administrative procedure was launched; \u00a8 the financial sanction imposed for the same type of \u2018 serious infringement \u2019 varies signifi- cantly across Member States.

        "Adopted by the Commission on 7 November. In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, the CFP shall ensure exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustain- able economic, environmental and social conditions. An important tool to achieve these objectives is the annual fixing of the fisheries opportunities in the form of TACs, quotas and fishing effort limits. In this regard the Commission submitted a detailed proposal to the Council relating to the application of the process for 2009. COM(2008) 709 1.20.3.

Despite some progress, the control system continues to suffer from substantial short- comings identified by both the Commission and the Court of Auditors. Accordingly, the Commission proposed a substantial reform of the control system underpinning the CFP. This communication accompanies the proposal establishing a Community system for inspection, monitoring, control, surveillance and enforce- ment with a global and integrated approach so as to ensure compliance with all rules of the CFP in order to provide for the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources by covering all aspects of the policy. The current problems arising from non-compliance, the damage it has caused to fish stocks and the lack of economic and social stability have been recognised by both Member States and by the fishing sector itself, who both broadly favour a reform of the current system.

As part of the political agreement concluded in the Fisheries Council on 27 October 2008 on the fishing possibilities for 2009 in the Black Sea it was agreed to apply the flexibility included for 2009 to the current year as well. This flexibility means that Member States may request to exceed their annual turbot quota by up to 10 %. The excess quantity will be deducted from their quota in the following year. In practical terms, this allows the Member State having made this request, Bulgaria, to exceed its 2008 turbot quota of 50 tonnes by up to five tonnes. This quantity must be deducted from the 2009 quota which will be fixed definitively in mid-2009. COM(2008) 806 1.20.8.

The Council adopted a regulation extending until 2011 the period allowed to the outermost regions of the EU countries to add extra fleet capacity using public funds.

This communication outlines the present state of affairs with regard to maritime spatial planning in the EU, identifies common approaches including at the international level, and makes the case for the development of maritime spatial planning in the EU. According to the Commission, maritime spatial planning tools and a common approach to their development provide benefits for the EU \u2019 s maritime economy, and ongoing work on the protection of the marine environment and to combat climate change and its impacts. This communication thus links the work on maritime spatial planning to overarching EU policy, notably the European strategy for growth and jobs (Lisbon strategy) and the sustainable development strategy (Gothenburg strategy). This communication also points out the benefits of developing integrated administrative approaches for the management of maritime spaces, in line with the proposals made by the Commission for integrated maritime governance in June of this year. Furthermore, it proceeds to derive common principles that could form the basis for a common approach to maritime spatial planning. It proposes to launch a debate on these principles to take place during 2009. COM(2008) 791 Bull. EU 11-2008 55 Fisheries and maritime affairs ",

Parliament endorsed the conclusions of the Ombudsman, namely that: \u00a8 the Council is, in the first instance, itself responsible for the websites of its presidency and the languages used thereon; \u00a8 the practices followed in the Council cannot be pursued in a way which is completely isolated from uniform implementation by the institutions and their formations; \u00a8 the information on these websites should ideally be made available in good time in all official languages of the Community; \u00a8 if the number of languages is to be limited, the choice of the languages to be used must be based on criteria of objectivity, reasonableness, transparency and manageability; \u00a8 the Council \u2019 s refusal to address the substance of the complainant \u2019 s request constitutes an instance of maladministration. Parliament regretted that the Council, unlike other institutions, has so far completely avoided addressing in a substantive way the question of the language options of the websites of its presidencies. It welcomed the fact that, in contrast to the practice of past presidencies, the French Council Presidency publishes its official website in the most widely spoken official languages of the EU. Finally, it invited the Council to conduct a comprehensive review of the question of expanding the language options of the websites of its presidencies so as to ensure that as large a section as possible of the population of the EU has easy and direct access to information on its activities.

        "policy, being particularly affected by the difficulties of illegal immigration, and also responsible for providing immigrants with a range of services as part of the local integration process. It considers respect for human rights, the principles of the rule of law, and the promotion of democracy to be key aspects of any immigration policy. Concerning prosperity and immigration, the Committee pointed to the high priority given to legal migration under the future immigration policy as a contribution to the socioeconomic development of the EU. It considers clear and transparent rules to be urgently needed for reasons of legal certainty and the fair treatment of third-country nationals. Concerning integration, the Committee noted the importance of local and regional authorities playing an active role in the integration of immigrants. Concerning solidarity, the Committee stressed the relationship between illegal and legal immigration and that combating illegal immigration is of key importance for framing a policy on legal migration. Concerning an efficient and coherent use of available resources, the Committee called for comprehensive information to be provided about the relevant EU funds and assistance programmes so that all local and regional stakeholders can make use of existing funds and programmes. Concerning partnership with third countries, the Committee pointed out that under the future EU immigration policy the key importance of promoting dialogue and cooperating with countries of origin and transit countries must be borne in mind. Concerning security, the Committee believes that the focus must be on the need for practicable, coordinated measures to combat people trafficking and criminal organisations. Finally, concerning illegal immigration and human trafficking, the Committee urgently backed EU measures to prevent illegal immigration, which often encourages exploita- tion, especially of women and children. 1.21.15.

The Council reaffirmed that the global approach remains wholly relevant and that the guidelines identified in the European Council conclusions remain valid, particularly as regards the three components of the approach and the need for their balanced implementation: good organisation of legal migration; the effective prevention of and fight against illegal immigration; the strengthening of the relation- ship between migration and development. It underlined the importance of coordination in the implementation of the tools of the global approach \u2014 mobility partnerships, EU migration missions, cooperation platforms, migration profiles, bilateral agreements \u2014 so as to promote synergies between them. The Council also recalled the importance of the three components of the global approach: \u00a8 organising legal migration and promoting mobility; \u00a8 fighting illegal immigration, including through the effective return of illegal immigrants and readmission agreements; \u00a8 enhancing synergies between migration and development, including the transfer of remittances. Finally, the Council believes that for the above guidelines to be implemented effectively, support for administrative capacity-building in third countries and regional organisations is a priority. 1.21.16.

The Council underlined that it is in the interest of ESDP civilian missions to have access to relevant personal information held by Europol and of Member States to have access via Europol to any information which civilian missions could make available to them. It considers that such exchanges of information, which ensure continuity in the fight against organised crime, can help to reinforce security and stability, both in the areas where ESDP missions are deployed and in the EU. The Council called on Member States to implement an information exchange mechanism for the EULEX Kosovo Mission without delay via the national units in accordance with the proposals by Europol and the General Secretariat of the Council (GSC). It invited the GSC and Europol to conduct a joint evaluation of the implementation of the mechanism before June 2009.

It makes the case for a strengthened role for Eurojust in facilitating cooperation at judicial level and promoting mutual recognition in confiscation matters, as well as facilitating the interaction between asset recovery offices and judicial authorities. The communication calls for the development of a common EU training programme for financial investigators to be implemented as a priority, and for comparable statistics on assets frozen, confiscated and recovered to be developed within an EU framework.

This action plan aims to structure work in the field of e-justice by entrusting realisation of a European \u2018 e-justice \u2019 portal and the management of horizontal questions (such as technical standards and safety) and by fixing realisation priorities to the Commission. The portal will facilitate access to information and to the European procedures. In addition, several concrete initiatives will be carried out in the medium term to set up electronic communica- 64 Bull. EU 11-2008 Area of freedom, security and justice ",

Proposal for a Council framework decision on the use of passenger name records (PNRs) for law enforcement purposes. Reference: Commission communication \u2014 \u2018 Transfer of air passenger name record (PNR) data: a global EU approach \u2019 : OJ C 122, 30.4.2004; COM(2003) 826; Bull. 12-2003, point 1.3.59 Commission proposal: OJ C 55, 28.2.2008; COM(2007) 654; Bull. 11-2007, point 1.20.33 European Data Protection Supervisor opinion: OJ C 110, 1.5.2008 Resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 20 November. Concerning procedural aspects, Parliament took the view that law enforcement authorities should be provided with all the tools they need to adequately carry out their tasks, including access to data. However, it emphasised that since such measures have a considerable impact on the personal life of EU citizens, their justification in terms of necessity, proportionality and usefulness in achieving their stated objectives needs to be convincingly substantiated. It therefore regretted the formulation, justification and lack of legal certainty of the proposal. Concerning subsidiarity, Parliament noted with concern that the need for Community action has not yet been sufficiently demonstrated. It questioned the Commission \u2019 s claim that the aim of the proposal is harmonisation of national schemes, when only a few Member States have a system for the use of PNR data. Parliament considered that the proposal does not harmonise national systems (as they are non-existent), but merely creates the obligation for all Member States to set up such a system. Concerning proportionality, Parliament recalled that Article 8 of the ECHR and Article 52 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights require that such an infringement of the right to the protection of personal data be legitimate and proportionate to the end pursued. Accordingly, it deplored the fact that the proposal is not limited to issues such as combating terrorism and organised crime. Concerning purpose limitation, Parliament deplored the lack of precise purpose limitation which is an essential safeguard in the imposition of restrictive measures. Concerning protection of personal data, Parliament stressed that the adoption of an adequate data protection framework under the third pillar is an absolute precondition for any EU PNR scheme. 1.21.36.

The purpose of the framework decision is to include three new offences in EU legislation, namely: \u00a8 public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; \u00a8 recruitment for terrorism; \u00a8 training for terrorism. Including these offences will provide a more integrated institutional framework at EU level. Thus there will be rules on the type and level of criminal penalties, and on the mandatory rules Bull.

The Council invited Member States to pursue ongoing work in the field of radicalisation and implement the EU \u2019 s action plan to counter radicalisation and recruitment, in particular through the \u2018 Check the web \u2019 project. It invited Member States to consider the need for the early detection of individuals suspected of terrorist activities or organised crime during the visa application procedure. The Council advised Member States to continue to implement the European action plan on enhancing the security of explosives, and keep Europol and Eurojust supplied with information on investigations and proceedings concerning terrorism in accordance with the arrangements laid down in Decision 2005/671/JHA. It invited the Commission to continue to play its role, in particular by encouraging the exchange of good practice continuing work and support for new research on the financing of terrorism, and developing its package of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) measures, the adoption of which is scheduled for June 2009. Likewise and finally, the Council invited Europol to continue its work, especially concerning explosives including CBRN, de- mining and the \u2018 Check the web \u2019 project. 1.21.39.

The Council stressed that measures to combat the NRBC terrorist threat should be consolidated by facilitating exchange of information in the NRBC field. Accordingly, it considers that in the interests of convergence, the relevant agencies should be encouraged to engage in closer operational cooperation, thereby increasing the sharing of experience and simple, secure exchange of information on NRBC matters. It invited Europol with the support of the Commission, to develop and to host the European NRBC database in the European bomb data system. The NRBC database will gather and centralise technical information on NRBC terrorism-related events and NRBC products and materials which may 66 Bull.

The Council concluded that there is a need for Member States to consider putting in place an early-warning mechanism for suspects linked to terrorism and organised crime in order to facilitate their early detection by consulting the SIS for every visa application. In the event of an alert, the Sirene bureau of the Member State which issued that alert shall be informed. The Council noted that it is necessary to assess whether amendments to existing legal instruments are needed in order to make the application of this mechanism legally binding. This evaluation, taking as a base the principle of proportionality and the need for the protection of fundamental rights, should cover the legal, technical as well as financial impact of the mechanism. 1.21.42.

This is a fundamental right for EU citizens and is accompanied by responsibilities, amongst which figures respect for the law of the state in which one is resident. The Council considers that strong and proportioned efforts have to be taken against citizens who transgress the law in a criminal manner. The Council noted in this respect the relevant provisions of Directive 2004/38/EC, in particular those in Chapter VI. It is pleased that the Commission intends to submit an evaluation report on the application of Directive 2004/38/EC between now and the mid-December. Finally, the Council called on the Commission to publish guidelines for the interpretation of this directive at the beginning of 2009 and to consider all other proposals as well as suitable and necessary actions. 1.21.47.

The Council emphasised the importance of close cooperation between Member States \u2019 departments specialising in combating the illicit trafficking of cultural goods, as well as the value of exchanging good practice and experience, for instance, through the designation of contact points in all Member States. It called upon the Commission to compile and report on an inventory of legislative, normative and operational instru- ments relating to the handling of cultural goods stolen in the EU by 31 December 2010.

The Council considers that it is important to combat the various elements of cybercrime and to invite Member States and the Commission to determine a joint working strategy, taking into account the content of the Council of Europe Convention on cybercrime. The purpose of this strategy should be to make it possible to cope even more effectively with the multiple crimes committed by means of electronic networks. It underlined the need for horizontal measure such as: \u00a8 strengthening the partnership between public authorities and the private sector; \u00a8 improving knowledge and training among stakeholders; \u00a8 reinforcing technical and international cooperation with third countries. The Council invited Member States and the Commission to: \u00a8 in the short term: set up a European platform aimed at reporting criminal acts committed on the Internet; draft, in consultation with private operators, a European agreement model for cooperation between law enforcement agencies and private operators; find a description of what is meant by identity fraud on the Internet, in compliance with domestic laws; set up national frameworks and exchange best practice regarding \u2018 cyberpatrols \u2019 ; set up joint investigation and enquiry teams; find a solution to the problems caused by electronic networks roaming and by the anonymous character of prepaid telecommu- nication products. \u00a8 in the medium term: exchange mechanisms for blocking and/or closing down child pornography sites in Member States; facilitate remote searches; develop temporary definitions of categories of offences and statistical indicators to encourage the collection of comparable statistics on the various forms of cybercrime.

The purpose of framework decision is to ensure a high level of protection for the basic rights and freedoms, and in particular the privacy, of individuals, while guaranteeing a high level of public safety when exchanging personal data. Under the framework decision the exchange of personal data in the context of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters will be underpinned by clear binding rules enhancing mutual trust between the competent authorities. The relevant information will be protected so as to prevent any obstruction to Member States \u2019 cooperation, while fully respecting the fundamental rights of individuals, in particular their right to privacy and to the protection of their personal data. Common standards on the confidentiality and security of the processing, on liability and on the obligation to lay down penalties for unlawful use will contribute to achieving both those aims. The framework decision defines, among other things, the right of access to data, the right to rectification, erasure or blocking, the right to compensation and the right to seek judicial remedies. It does not preclude Member States from providing higher-level safeguards for protecting personal data than those established in the framework decision. Member States will have two years from the date of adoption in which to comply with the framework decision \u2019 s provisions. OJ L 350, 30.12.2008 70 Bull.

The Council and representatives of the governments of the Member States recalled that vocational education and training (VET) is an essential part of lifelong learning which covers all relevant levels of qualification and which should be closely linked to general education and higher education. It noticed that priorities and guidelines established under the Copenhagen process since 2002 remain valid. The Council stated it is necessary to pursue their implementation, and to address the following four priority areas for the period 2008 \u2013 10: \u00a8 implementing the tools and schemes for promoting cooperation in the field of vocational education and training at national and European level; \u00a8 heightening the quality and attractiveness of vocational education and training systems; \u00a8 improving the links between vocational education and training and the labour market; \u00a8 strengthening European cooperation arrange- ments. 1.22.3.

The Council welcomed the Commission communica- tion on European cooperation on schools programme. It reaffirmed that free compulsory education is a fundamental right for all citizens, that must be guaranteed by public authorities and that its organisation must remain the responsibility of Member States. It stated that schools have a duty to provide their pupils an education which will enable them to adapt to an increasingly globalised, competitive, diversified and complex environment, in which creativity, the ability to innovate, a sense of initiative, entrepreneurship and a commitment to continue learning are just as important as the specific knowledge of a given subject. It recalled that on average there is still insufficient progress towards the three European benchmarks adopted by the Council for 2010, which relate directly to school education: early school leavers, reading literacy and the completion of upper secondary education. In this regard, the Council set three priorities for European cooperation on schools: \u00a8 guarantee and improve the acquisition of key competences, in particular literacy and numeracy; \u00a8 enhance the essential role which schools play in promoting inclusive societies and strength- ening social cohesion, by ensuring high-quality education for all pupils in accordance with the principle of equity; \u00a8 promote teaching as a profession and to improve initial and in-service training for teaching staff and school leaders. 1.22.4. Committee of the Regions opinion on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions \u2014 \u2018 Improving competences for the 21st century: an agenda for European cooperation on schools \u2019 . Commission communication: COM(2008) 425; Bull. 7/8-2008, point 1.22.2 Adopted by the Committee of the Regions on 26 November. The Committee welcomed this communication. However, it lamented the Commission \u2019 s failure to mention the contribu- tion that local and regional authorities can make given \u2014 their diverse responsibilities in the education sector and their detailed knowledge of the local and regional circumstances, to better tackle the questions raised: \u00a8 concerning competences: the Committee considers it important that schools have a coherent concept of education so that pupils understand how the education they receive is 72 Bull. EU 11-2008 Education and culture ",
        "structured and what is expected of them. It considers that promoting reading skills is one of the school \u2019 s core tasks; \u00a8 concerning high-quality learning for every student: the Committee recalled that pre-school facilities were important foundations for subsequent successful learning throughout the school career. It is aware that in many instances pupils from migrant backgrounds face very complex problems and therefore require particular attention. In addition, the Committee felt that fixing overall measures concerning education provision for pupils with special educational needs is inappropriate; \u00a8 concerning teachers and school staff: the Committee noted that teachers are crucial to achieving the Lisbon goals. It considers that priority must be given to high-quality pedagogical and technical initial teacher-training that includes periods of teaching practice. \u2018 Education \u2019 programmes 1.22.5.

The Council invited Member States and the Commission, within their respective spheres of competence to promote: \u00a8 multilingualism with a view to strengthening social cohesion, intercultural dialogue and European construction; \u00a8 lifelong language learning; \u00a8 multilingualism as a factor in the European economy \u2019 s competitiveness and people \u2019 s mobility and employability; \u00a8 linguistic diversity and intercultural dialogue by stepping up assistance for translation, in order to encourage the circulation of works and the dissemination of ideas and knowledge in Europe and across the world.

The Council recalled that cross-border voluntary activities are characterised as follows: open to all young people, undertaken by their own free will in the general interest, for a sustained period, within a clear framework and in a country other than the country of residence, unpaid or with token payment and/or coverage of expenses. It stated that cross-border mobility in Europe can be an important tool to promote education, employ- ment and regional and social cohesion, and to help improve mutual understanding and active participation in society. This is particularly the case for young people in a labour market which increasingly values adaptability and flexibility. The Council mainly recommended Member States to: \u00a8 raise awareness on voluntary activities within their national territories; \u00a8 make information available to all the relevant actors on the rights and opportunities that arise from existing provisions at European and national level on cross-border voluntary activities; \u00a8 increase awareness on the importance of intercultural competences and language learning among young people in order to reduce barriers to their cross-border mobility. 1.22.9.

The Council recalled that although the health of young people in Europe is globally satisfactory, certain fields are of particular concern such as nutrition, physical activity, alcohol abuse, sexual and mental health. It noted that the health and 74 Bull. EU 11-2008 Education and culture ",
        "well-being of young people should be addressed by a comprehensive and cross-sectoral approach encompassing all appropriate areas, in particular the public health system, formal and informal learning, employment and social inclusion, childhood and family, sport, cultural activities, research, the environment, the media and consumer protection. The Council highlighted that special attention should be paid to young people \u2019 s mental health, particularly promoting good mental health especially through schools and youth work, and to the prevention of self- harm and suicide. Finally, it specified that health policy in its youth dimension should involve the local, regional, national and European levels of public policy and be based on a broad partnership between those involved in formal, non-formal and informal learning, healthcare professionals, economic and social partners, especially youth associations, and the media. The Council invited Member States and the Commission to act in this direction. 1.22.10. Committee of the Regions opinion on the proposal for a Council recommendation on mobility of young volunteers across Europe. Reference: point 1.22.8 of this Bulletin Adopted by the Committee of the Regions on 26 November. The Committee appreciates the Commission \u2019 s creativity in its search for a way to facilitate youth volunteering in another Member State. It called upon the Commission to support the promotion of cooperation between voluntary organisations by developing not only a European youth volunteer portal, but also a database of best practices, projects, opportunities and detailed information. The Committee emphasised the role of local and regional authorities with regard to volunteering and in particular the involvement of young people with fewer opportunities. It deplored the fact that there are still socioeconomic and administrative obstacles which hinder young volunteer \u2019 s mobility. It therefore proposed to take the lead by drawing up a list of these obstacles in the context of a broad review of volunteering. The Committee stressed the importance of reducing linguistic barriers in Europe by encouraging language learning by volunteers. Finally, it emphasised the impor- tance of recognising skills acquired by the volunteer, so that they may be used later in his or her career (work or study). \u2018 Youth \u2019 programme 1.22.11.

The Council and the representa- tives of the governments of Member States called on Member States and on the Commission to pursue the following policy objectives: \u00a8 strengthening the place and the role of culture in the policies and programmes conducted within the framework of external relations and promoting cooperation with third countries and international organisations with responsibility in the field of culture, in particular Unesco and the Council of Europe, in order to improve the quality and diversity of the cultural activities carried out, and, more generally, contribute to the attainment of external policy objectives and to sustainable development; \u00a8 promoting the Unesco Convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions; \u00a8 promoting intercultural dialogue through the pursuit of specific projects, awareness-raising activities and exchanges of good practice carried out successfully in Member States and outside the EU in the framework of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008), in particular in the light of the stock-taking exercise on that year that will be carried out by the Commission; \u00a8 define comprehensive and consistent approaches to drawing up a European strategy for incorporating culture consistently and systematically in the external relations of the EU and contributing to the complementarity of the EU \u2019 s activities with those of its Member States. 1.22.16.

The Council welcomed the work of the European architectural policy forum on issues of architectural quality and sustainable development. It underlined that Europe \u2019 s towns and cities today face major challenges: demographic change and its implications for urbanisation, environmental issues and climate change mitigation, maintaining social cohesion, particularly against a background of economic and cultural change, and the protection and development of architectural and cultural heritage. The Council stated that the way to respond to those challenges is by means of sustainable urban development, a creative, integrated approach under which culture, economics, social affairs and the environment each play an equally important part. Moreover, it recalled that architecture can play an integrating and innovative role in implementing sustainable urban development, in particular by reconciling the sometimes differing require- ments of building and landscape conservation and contemporary creation or of inhabitants \u2019 legitimate aspirations and controlling urbanisa- tion. The Council noted with interest the initiatives by many European towns and cities, 76 Bull. EU 11-2008 Education and culture ",
        "in particular as European cultural capitals, to use culture and especially architecture as a major means of regeneration. Finally, it observed that the emergence of creative towns and cities, whose sustainable urban development is based on new competitive factors, including urban infrastructure quality and interaction between culture and industry. 1.22.17.

The Council considers that the creation of a European heritage label by the EU, which would aim to emphasise Europe \u2019 s common history in a concrete way by enhancing the European dimension of its cultural heritage, could contribute to: \u00a8 enhancing the value and raising the profile of Member States \u2019 heritage as well as the shared cultural heritage; \u00a8 increasing knowledge and appreciation among citizens of their history and their shared and diverse cultural heritage. Finally, the Council considers that the EU \u2019 s European heritage label should be awarded on the basis of common, clear and transparent criteria. 1.22.18. Committee of the Regions opinion on integration policy and intercultural dialogue.

The Committee \u2019 s opinion focuses on: \u00a8 the principle of multicultural dialogue: the Committee believes that the basic principle underlying the process of European integration is respect for, and the promotion of, cultural diversity. In this sense, intercultural dialogue is a key instrument in promoting understanding of cultural diversity and strengthening and uniting people in a multilingual, multicultural Europe. It is convinced that dialogue between different religions and world views is one of the prime instruments for sustainable intercultural dialogue; \u00a8 the role of local and regional authorities in intercultural dialogue: the Committee believes that local and regional authorities could use their position to raise awareness of the present complex situation and the co-existence of various cultural identities and belief systems; \u00a8 intercultural dialogue as a key condition for integration policy: the Committee called for adequate resources to be provided for integration measures at local and regional level while existing programmes are explored. It suggested that local and regional authorities make efforts to improve access for immigrants to work and to fight discrimination in the labour market. The Committee also called for greater attention to be paid to the cultural, linguistic and intellectual potential of immigrants, which are of great importance to the EU in the globalising world. It encouraged local and regional authorities to make use of existing EU funding possibilities to helping migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees to gain access to social, health and housing services; \u00a8 strengthening cooperation with the media: the Committee considers that local media have an important role to play in informing people as objectively as possible about the situation and reality of Europe \u2019 s multi-cultural societies.

Directive to be amended: Council Directive 86/ 609/EEC on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes \u2014 OJ L 358, 18.12.1986, as amended by Directive 2003/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \u2014 OJ L 230, 16.9.2003; Bull. 7/8-2003, point 1.4.72 Reference: Commission communication on a Community action plan on the protection and welfare of animals 2006 \u2013 10: OJ C 49, 28.2.2006; COM(2006) 13; Bull. 1/2-2006, point 1.23.2 Adopted by the Commission on 5 November . This proposal aims at harmonising and levelling the practices for the breeding, keeping and use of animals in scientific procedures in the EU. According to the Commission, the disparity of measures between Member States, due to issues not being adequately covered by Directive 86/ 609/EEC, must be rectified. This directive shall apply where animals are used or intended to be used in procedures, or where they are bred specifically so that their organs or tissues may be used for scientific purposes. It provides a solid basis for a full implementation of the principles of the \u2018 three Rs \u2019 ; replacement, reduction and refinement of the use animals in scientific procedures. Having regard to the fact that with current scientific knowledge, a complete phase-out of animal use is unfortunately not yet achievable, the Commis- sion believes that the most pragmatic approach to reducing the number of animals in scientific procedures is through the introduction of alternative methods. The proposed directive lays down rules on the following: \u00a8 the replacement and reduction of the use of animals in procedures and the refinement of the breeding, accommodation, care and use of animals in procedures; \u00a8 the origin, breeding, marking, care and accommodation of animals; \u00a8 the functioning of breeding, supplying or user establishments; \u00a8 the evaluation and authorisation of projects involving the use of animals in procedures.

Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions \u2014 \u2018 An EU strategy for better ship dismantling \u2019 . References: Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on shipments of waste: OJ L 190, 12.7.2006; Bull. 5-2006, point 1.21.5 Green Paper on better ship dismantling: OJ C 191, 17.8.2007; COM(2007) 269; Bull. 5-2007, point 1.23.15 European Parliament resolution on the Green Paper on better ship dismantling: Bull. 5-2008, point 1.24.8 Adopted by the Commission on 19 November. Following the Green Paper and the consultation linked to it on ship dismantling, this communication proposes to adopt an EU strategy on ship dismantling. The general objective of this strategy is to ensure that ships with a strong link to the EU, in terms of flag or ownership, are dismantled only in safe and environmentally sound facilities worldwide. It also includes a specific objective: to prevent, in line with the waste shipment regulation, the export of hazardous end-of-life ships from the EU to developing countries. It aims at reducing significantly and in a sustainable way the negative impacts of ship dismantling on human health and the environment without creating unnecessary economic burdens, especially in south Asia. In order to reach these aims, the following operational objectives are proposed: \u00a8 provide the necessary encouragement and guidance for the implementation of EC waste shipment law with regard to end-of-life ships; \u00a8 work toward effective and early transposition of the forthcoming international ship recycling convention in the EU; \u00a8 assess the need to supplement the ship recycling convention with the necessary measures to address negative impacts of ship dismantling that are not covered by the convention and to promote its practical effectiveness.

The Committee recalled that local action is a key determinant of individual changes in behaviour which is crucial to meeting the 20 % energy efficiency targets. According to it, regions, like towns and cities, are key players in the field of energy having responsibilities in numerous activities which deal with planning, permitting, investment, procurement, production and consumption. The Committee was of the view that there should be a direct link between national energy action plans and those of the regions. It reiterated its support for the objectives of the covenant of mayors and the scope of its activities, including reducing energy demand and consumption, developing a sustainable and secure energy supply through the promotion of renewable energy sources and improving the energy efficiency of products. The Committee welcomed the positive start to the covenant and the high level of political commitment from European municipalities who have signed up to achieving more than 20 % energy savings. As Bull. EU 11-2008 81 Environment ",
        "further suggestions for the covenant, it called for clear guidance on how emissions data is going to be reported and measured. Finally, the Committee called for EU funding and financing to be adapted in order to prioritise actions to promote the use of sustainable energy.

Proposal for a Council decision concerning the placing on the market, in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of a carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) genetically modified for flower colour. Reference: Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms: OJ L 106, 17.4.2001; Bull. 3-2001, point 1.4.28, as amended by Directive 2008/27/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council: OJ L 81, 20.3.2008; Bull. 3-2008, point 1.26.11 Adopted by the Commission on 18 November. A notification concerning the placing on the market of a carnation genetically modified for flower colour was submitted by Florigene Ltd, Melbourne, Australia, to the competent authority of the Netherlands in October 2006. In February 2007 the latter forwarded its assessment report of the notification to the Commission, who forwarded it to Member States. The report concluded that the genetically modified carnation may be placed on the market for its intended uses. However, the competent authorities of some Member States raised and maintained objections to the placing on the market of the products, referring to the monitoring plan, allergenicity and toxicity, and detection of the product. In the light of these objections, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was consulted and issued a favourable opinion in March 2008 concluding, from all evidence provided, that cut flowers of these genetically modified carnations are unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed ornamental use. EFSA also found that the scope of the monitoring plan provided by the consent holder is in line with the intended use of the carnation. Consequently, the Commission proposes that genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) may be placed on the market under certain conditions. In addition, the product may be put to ornamental use only and cultivation is not allowed. COM(2008) 754 Global environment and international dimension General 1.23.13.

The Council affirmed the need to create the conditions required for a genuine European coordination of police action to make the roads safer. It stressed that this coordination must involve officers, equipment and techniques, as well as joint actions. The Council confirmed its determination to launch the necessary initiatives to improve strategic and operational cooperation to improve road safety, particularly by: \u00a8 including road safety in the police cooperation handbook currently under revision; \u00a8 regularly gathering representatives of the competent authorities to devise concerted strategic guidelines with regard to road safety; \u00a8 promoting exchanges between national contact points in charge of preventing and controlling traffic offences, for the purpose of sharing views and good practice, coordinating methods of action and seeking interoperability of procedures and equipment; \u00a8 combating trans-national illegal races of motor vehicles on European public roads on the basis of gathered intelligence and improved mechanisms for operational police coordination in this field. 86 Bull.

This communication aims to evaluate the implementation of Directive 2004/67/EC, to examine which elements of the directive could be further developed and to propose ways for the EU to address more efficiently the question of security of gas supply, now and in the future. The communication focuses principally on short-term security of supply. Currently there is no defined EU emergency plan to deal with short-term supply shortages or disruptions beyond the level at which market mechanisms, industry and national emergency measures are insufficient. Furthermore, the implementation of Directive 2004/67/EC in Member States has led to substantial inconsistencies in the general level of security of gas supply. The communication intends to open a period of public debate in view of the review of Directive 2004/67/EC. Thus, it puts forward a number of options for each element which needs improvement. These options concern: 90 Bull. EU 11-2008 ",

This proposal aims at improving the present legislation that imposes an obligation on Member States to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products in order to compensate or at least decrease the negative effects of potential supply shortages. The analysis of the current system reveals flaws which might prevent it from functioning suitably in the event of an actual supply disruption. Its revision aims to further strengthen the system while at the same time optimise the administrative obligations on Member States. Initially, the Commission wished to impose on the Member States to hold an obligatory portion of emergency stocks in the form of government- or agency-owned stocks ( \u2018 dedicated \u2019 stocks). However, for the moment, the constitution of dedicated stocks remains to be decided by Member States. The proposed legislation will also create more flexibility for Member States in choosing the specific arrangements for complying with the stock- holding obligations. COM(2008) 775 1.25.6.

This communication presents an update of the 2007 nuclear illustrative programme. The Commission proposes particularly that future Bull. EU 11-2008 91 Energy ",
        "nuclear constructions use the most recent technologies, to ensure the highest standards of nuclear safety as well as to simplify and harmonise the currently differing licensing requirements and procedures in Member States. In addition, the update addresses the following issues: \u00a8 the link between nuclear energy and security of supply, with a special focus on the investment needs (replacement/life extension of ageing power plants) and security of supply for nuclear fuels; \u00a8 the role of public authorities with emphasis in the EU on nuclear safety and waste management (outside the EU on security/non- proliferation); \u00a8 the importance of public acceptance of nuclear energy and factors influencing it. According to the Commission, nuclear energy plays an important role in the transition to a low carbon economy and reduces the EU \u2019 s dependency towards external supply. If strategic investment decisions on power generation capacities concerning nuclear and renewable energy are taken rapidly, nearly two thirds of the EU \u2019 s electricity generation could be low carbon in the early 2020s. Nevertheless, it remains for each Member State to decide whether or not to include nuclear energy in the energy mix remains. COM(2008) 776; MEMO/08/702 1.25.7. Green Paper \u2014 \u2018 Towards a secure, sustainable and competitive European energy network \u2019 . Reference: Second strategic energy review: point 1.25.1 of this Bulletin Adopted by the Commission on 13 November. This Green Paper seeks views on how the EU can better promote the new energy networks which Europe needs, using all the instruments at its disposal, notably but not only TEN-E. In order to strengthen solidarity and security of supply it suggests a strategy which is based on three pillars: first to make sure that energy networks help rather than hinder the switch to more renewable, efficient and low carbon energy; second to promote a fully inter- connected network, including cross-border and regional links and integrating decentralised generation into the wider picture; third to make the best possible use of the EU funding which is available. The Green Paper presents six examples of major initiatives which would involve clustering many individual network projects involving several countries. These are: \u00a8 a Baltic interconnection plan to fully interlink EU countries around the Baltic and North Seas; \u00a8 a North Sea offshore grid for wind energy; \u00a8 a Mediterranean energy network or \u2018 ring \u2019 to develop and share the renewable energy resources and gas reserves in north Africa; \u00a8 a southern corridor to bring gas from the Caspian area into the EU; \u00a8 the integration of gas and electricity systems in central and south-eastern Europe; \u00a8 a strategy for liquefied natural gas. In practice, these projects would bring together and give a new push to initiatives and projects which could help reform and modernise Europe \u2019 s energy network.

In this second strategic energy review, the Commission observes that the full implementa- tion of the EU \u2019 s new energy and environment policy agreed by the European Council in March 2007 is the first essential element of any energy security policy for Europe. The \u2018 20-20- 20 \u2019 measures alone will however not be sufficient to meet the EU \u2019 s energy security needs. Accordingly, the EU needs to identify infrastructure of major importance to its energy security and then ensure its construction, intensify its efforts in developing an effective external energy policy, speak with one voice, and act coherently to deepen its partnerships with key energy suppliers, transit countries and consumers. It also needs to pursue the efforts in matter of energy efficiency and tap the full potential of renewable energy sources, including the potential offered by oceans and seas for energy generation. Furthermore, while each Member State is responsible for its own security, the EU must reinforce the solidarity between Member States as well as strategies to share and spread risk. In order to reach this objective, the Commission proposes a five-point EU energy security and solidarity action plan, focusing on: \u00a8 infrastructure needs and the diversification of energy supplies; \u00a8 external energy relations; \u00a8 oil and gas stocks and crisis response mechanisms; \u00a8 energy efficiency; \u00a8 making the best use of the EU \u2019 s indigenous energy resources. Furthermore, this strategic energy review takes the first steps towards the next stage of a European energy policy, considering the challenges likely to be faced between 2020 and 2050 and beginning the process of defining an EU response to these longer-term challenges.

This explanatory communication complements the pack of measures relating to energy efficiency proposed by the Commission, within the framework of the second strategic energy review. European leaders committed themselves to reduce 20 % of the EU \u2019 s primary energy consumption by 2020 compared to projections for that year. In order to meet this target, Community legislation aims to considerably improve energy efficiency in key energy- consuming sectors. However, current energy efficiency legislation alone will not deliver sufficient energy savings to meet the 20 % saving objective. The main obstacles to energy efficiency improvements are the poor imple- mentation of existing legislation, the lack of consumer awareness and the absence of adequate structures to trigger essential invest- ments in energy efficient buildings, products and services. Consequently, the Commission announces a number of flanking policy actions and proposes to reinforce the key energy efficiency legislation on buildings, energy-using products and cogeneration with: \u00a8 a proposal for the recast of the directive on the energy performance of buildings; \u00a8 a proposal on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consump- tion of energy and other resources by energy- related products; Bull.

This communication reports on the current status of the combined heat and power generation (CHP or cogeneration), and presents possibilities for its development. In doing so, the Commission also meets the reporting obligations of Directive 2004/8/EC on cogeneration, notably on cogeneration potential and progress in Member States. The report presents the CHP directive as a significant tool in contributing to Europe \u2019 s answers to the energy challenges. Cogeneration is a proven tool to increase energy efficiency, achieve savings and reduce CO 2 emissions and network losses. Furthermore, CHP can enhance competitiveness through development of high efficiency cogeneration technologies with export potential and contribute to economic develop- ment, creating growth and jobs. As monitoring of the implementation continues, the Commis- sion acknowledges the administrative and non- administrative barriers hampering the develop- ment of cogeneration. Some of these barriers have been addressed by the Commission, such as the set-up of harmonised efficiency reference values and the adoption of Community detailed guidelines for the calculation of electricity produced from cogeneration. However, Member States could also enhance their efforts to ensure development of cogeneration. The Commission will continue to monitor the process and will present further proposals if appropriate to foster cogeneration. COM(2008) 771 1.25.11. Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products (recast).

The aim of the recast of Council Directive 92/ 75/EEC is to extend its scope, currently restricted to household appliances, to allow for the labelling of all energy-related products including the household, commercial and industrial sectors and some non-energy-using products such as windows which have a significant potential to save energy once in use or installed (means of transport are excluded). The resulting framework directive on labelling which also includes provisions relating to public procurement and incentives will be an essential building block for an integrated sustainable environmental product policy, promoting and stimulating the demand for better products and helping consumers to make better choices.

With as much as 23 % of total CO 2 emissions coming from road transport, reducing vehicles \u2019 energy intensity and emissions is a major challenge for the EU. Tyres can play a significant role since they account for 20 \u2013 30 % of vehicles \u2019 total fuel consumption, due to rolling resistance. New technologies may reduce this resistance, making it possible to reach a difference of up to 10 % in fuel consumption between the worst- and the best-performing tyre set. The objective of the proposal is to promote the market transformation towards fuel-efficient tyres, also called low rolling resistance tyres. Accordingly, it proposes to create a labelling scheme for tyre parameters including fuel efficiency, wet grip and external rolling noise. The proposal addresses tyres fitted on passenger cars, light- and heavy-duty vehicles. This system will provide harmonised and easy-to- understand information to consumers, compa- nies and retailers by grading tyre performance characteristics. The information shall be made available to end-users via different media (e.g. electronic, catalogues, stickers). COM(2008) 779 1.25.13.

Parliament underlined the importance of the early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels. It endorsed the view that the construction of at least 12 demonstration facilities within the EU is necessary in order to achieve the desired use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies in power stations and to secure CO 2 storage from 2020. Parliament noted that the demonstration of CCS processes in the CO 2 capture, transport, and storage phases needs to establish whether CCS technologies can be used safely and whether they are a cost-effective solution to the problem of climate change. It took the view that the measures unveiled by the Commission are not sufficient to provide the desired incentives for constructing at least 12 demonstration facilities by 2015.

The Council approved a regulation on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods, following agreement reached with the Parliament. The new legislative act provides for a Community list of flavourings to be drawn up, lays down the conditions for the use of flavouring and food ingredients and contains maximum levels for undesirable substances in food. The conditions for the use of the term \u2018 natural \u2019 in describing flavourings are made stricter. The use of flavourings must not mislead the consumer, particularly as regards the nature, freshness, quality of ingredients used, the naturalness of a product or of the production process, or the nutritional quality of the product. 1.26.5.

The Council underlined the importance of reasserting that the global aim of the Community plant health regime is to protect plant resources, food security, sustainable production, the environ- ment and to contribute to the protection of human health, taking into account trade concerns. It stressed the importance of defining priorities and of categorising phytosanitary risks, by choosing management measures in accordance with defined priorities and adapting the level of control to phytosanitary risks. Finally, the Council highlighted the importance of considering, in the implementation of the Community plant health regime, the roles and responsibilities of Member States and of the EC and its institutions and bodies, such as the Commission (Directorate-General for Health and Consumers, Food and Veterinary Office), the Standing Committee on Plant Health, EFSA and how they connect to and interact with non- Community organisations.

The objective of EU action in the field of rare diseases is to put together the necessary elements for an efficient overall strategy addressing the important issue of rare diseases in Europe. The strategic objective of EC intervention in this field is aimed at improving the chance for patients to get appropriate and timely diagnosis, information and care through European action that can act more effectively than Member States on their own. This requires: \u00a8 making rare diseases more visible through developing proper identification and coding of rare diseases, many of which currently go unrecognised leading to inappropriate treatment for individuals and a lack of appropriate resources overall; \u00a8 encouraging all Member States in developing national plans for rare diseases in their health policies to ensure equal access and availability of prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation for people with rare diseases. More initiatives in terms of public awareness- raising are needed in Member States. In addition to targeting public opinion, these efforts should also be directed at professionals in healthcare and social services, decision-makers, managers of health and social services and media; \u00a8 providing European support and cooperation, such as ensuring that common policy guidelines are developed and shared everywhere in Europe: specific actions in areas such as research, centres of expertise, access to information, incentives for the development of orphan drugs and screening. Cooperation between existing European programmes focused around this issue also needs to be improved. COM(2008) 679 1.26.13.

The Commission proposed that the Council recommend Member States establish national plans for rare diseases in order to ensure to patients with rare diseases universal access to high-quality care, including diagnostics, treat- ments and orphan drugs throughout their national territory on the basis of equity and solidarity throughout the EU, and in particular: \u00a8 elaborate and adopt a comprehensive and integrated strategy, by the end of 2011, aimed at guiding and structuring all relevant actions in the field of rare diseases in the form of a national plan for rare diseases; \u00a8 implement an EU common definition of rare diseases as those diseases affecting no more than five per 10 000 persons and ensure that rare diseases are adequately coded and traceable Bull.

Parliament stressed the importance of enabling citizens to benefit fully from the benefits of the internal market, and sees the consumer markets scoreboard as an important tool to this end. It welcomed the five main indicators in the scoreboard in relation to complaints, price levels, satisfaction, switching and safety. It highlights a certain number of objectives: \u00a8 developing the indicators: Parliament took the view that the total number of indicators should be limited to ensure a focused scoreboard. It believes that an indicator related to complaints is essential to understand consumer satisfaction and called on the 102 Bull. EU 11-2008 Health and consumer protection ",
        "Commission and Member States to work towards a harmonisation of the complaint classification systems in Member States and at Community level and to establish an EU-wide database of consumer complaints; \u00a8 improving the information base: Parliament underlined the importance of close cooperation between the statistical offices of Member States, Eurostat and other Commission services in ensuring the quality and completeness of figures and called on Member States to take steps to facilitate such cooperation; \u00a8 increased awareness: Parliament called on the Commission and Member States to raise awareness of the scoreboard, inter alia by ensuring that it is easily accessible and visible on relevant websites, and to increase efforts to promote the scoreboard to the media, public authorities and consumer organisations; \u00a8 relationship to the internal market score- board: Parliament holds the view that the internal market scoreboard and the consumer markets scoreboard both serve to promote an improved internal market for the benefit of citizens and consumers. Furthermore, it believes that a review of the indicators used as well as the relationship between the two scoreboards should be carried out on a regular basis in order to adapt them to developments in the internal market.

Consumers \u2019 economic and legal inter- ests 1.26.20.

Reference: Directive 98/27/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council: OJ L 166, 11.6.1998; Bull. 5-1998, point 1.2.199 Adopted by the Commission on 18 November. This report gives an overview of the transposition and the application of Directive 98/27/EC in Member States. It examines the three issues specifically identified in Article 6(2) of the directive, namely: if the scope of the directive shall be extended to include injunctions proceedings in the collective interests of companies; if new EU legislations shall be added to the annex of the directive; and if the prior consultation procedure between the party seeking an injunction and the trader shall be made mandatory. The report also points out the problems encountered by the entities using the injunctions procedure set by the directive, namely the cost of proceedings, the complexity and length of proceedings and the limited impact of the ruling. The report concludes that the main positive outcome of the directive was the introduction in Member States of a procedure for bringing injunctions in the collective interest of consumers. It also concludes that while it is necessary to continue examining the application of the directive, there is no reason to extend its scope to include injunctions in the collective interests of business or to generalise the requirement of prior consultation between the party seeking an injunction and the trader.

This communication describes the current enlargement agenda focusing on the western Balkans and Turkey. It follows up on the December 2006 European Council, which is based on the principles of consolidation of commitments, fair and rigorous conditionality and better communication with the public, combined with the EU \u2019 s capacity to integrate new members. The communication reviews the progress made in each of the candidate and potential candidate countries but it also points out that continued commitment is required if they are to overcome the major challenges that this year \u2019 s economic climate poses. The European perspective has contributed to peace and stability in the region and provides strong encouragement for political and economic reform.

Commission communication: OJ C 202, 8.8.2008; COM(2008)127; Bull. 3-2008, point 1.27.9 Adopted by the Committee of the Regions on 27 November. The Committee welcomed the progress made by the countries of the western Balkans in moving towards the EU. It considers that the signature of a stabilisation and association agreement between the EU and Serbia as well as between the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina is absolutely essential if the whole region is to have a future within the EU. The real prospect of Montenegro and Albania acquiring candidate status as well as the progress made in accession discussions with Croatia clearly demonstrate progress. The Committee recommended that the Commission does more to capitalise on the experience of the new Member States in both the process of accession and transformation. The views of the new Member States should be an added benefit when it comes to drafting EU policies, especially regarding the accession ambitions of the western Balkan countries. The Committee urged the western Balkan countries to lose no time in meeting the EU \u2019 s conditions for relaxing its visa policy. It underlined the importance of the processes launched in the western Balkan countries to decentralise and distribute State power. It pointed out that ethnicity must not be the sole or main factor in these processes, and considers it important to bolster central institutions that are crucial if the State is to function, while at the same time accepting the autonomy of regional and local institutions and authorities. The Committee also pointed out that recognition and protection of national minorities is one of the Copenhagen criteria. Finally, the Committee urged countries in the region to take measures to enhance women \u2019 s participation in political, social and economic life and to promote gender equality. Bull.

Council conclusions on the western Balkans. Reference: stabilisation and association agreement between the European Communities and its Member States and Bosnia and Herzegovina: Bull. 6-2008, point 1.27.2 Adopted by the Council on 10 November. The Council expressed its support for the high representative of the EU in Bosnia, Mr Laj \u010d \u00e1k, and his efforts to ensure compliance with the Dayton/Paris agreements and progress with reform. The Council stated that the signing in June of the stabilisation and association agreement constituted an important milestone in the relationship between Bosnia and Herzego- vina and the EU. However, it voiced its deep concern at recent developments in the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particu- larly the use of nationalist rhetoric and the implementation of unilateral decisions by some leaders, thereby jeopardising power sharing and the foundations of the State. According to the Council, such words and deeds compromise the reforms required for the country \u2019 s future. While reaffirming Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2019 s European prospects, the Council called on the Bosnian authorities to shoulder their responsibilities, and to renew their efforts to push through the necessary reforms for Bosnia and Herzegovina to progress on the path towards the EU. The Council also noted with satisfaction the agreement along these lines between three of the main Bosnian parties. It called for these proposals to be rapidly put into concrete form and invited the Bosnian political forces to unite around this project. 1.27.5.

Supplying poor and developing countries with medicines at sustainable low prices is one of the key objectives in the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. In order to achieve this, the Commission has consistently advocated a policy of \u2018 tiered pricing \u2019 for medicines; COMbined with market segmentation between rich and poor countries. The advantage of such a policy is that it encourages manufacturers to distribute the drugs in question in the target countries at the lowest possible ( \u2018 tiered \u2019 ) price, while at the same time recouping their research and development expenditure with the higher prices charged in developed (OECD) countries. According to the Commission, this approach is designed to promote sustainable supplies and continuous distribution of life-saving medicines. This report covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2007. It contains the following information: \u00a8 the volumes exported under tiered prices for each product registered in Annex I of the regulation; \u00a8 the sub-regions benefiting from these exports at tiered prices; \u00a8 the diseases treated with the products at question; \u00a8 an assessment of the application of the price formulae in Article 3 of the regulation in relation to each of the products concerned.

Reference: Commission communication \u2014 \u2018 Local authorities: actors for development \u2019 : COM (2008) 626; Bull. 10-2008, point 1.31.1 Adopted by the Council on 10 November. The Council stressed the importance of the contribution made by local authorities to democratic local governance, to inclusive and equitable local development and to the provision of the basic services needed by the population, particularly by the poorest section of the population. With their local knowledge and closeness to citizens, local authorities can facilitate dialogue and partnerships between different types of development cooperation actors. The Council also welcomed the participatory process, which brought together various platforms of local authorities, NGOs, Member States, the Commission and the Committee of the Regions and culminated in the drawing up of a draft European charter on cooperation in support of local governance. The Council wished to see the partners follow-up this document by contributing to better harmonisation of development action in the field of local governance, linked as far as possible to other existing international initiatives.

The Committee is concerned to note that the volume of European development aid has decreased for the second year running and that only a few countries (e.g. Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden) are fulfilling the international commitment in relation to the amount of aid given. Recognising the importance of budgetary and sectoral aid, in particular for the poorest countries, it urged that a mechanism be created in relations between central government and civil society players whereby a new culture can be developed in the use of aid. In fact, it highlighted that many of the EU \u2019 s local and regional authorities have development-based links with their counterparts in the developing world, and thus acquired expertise, especially in such spheres as: education; municipal services (water and waste management); infrastructure; transport; commu- nications; regional economic development; supporting the development of local bodies. Furthermore, the Committee is pleased about its fruitful cooperation with the Commission, which demonstrates that its role and the one of local and regional authorities in development policy is receiving increasing recognition.

        "countries must be strengthened in two areas: addressing the shortage of health workers and ensuring the long-term financing of health systems. Aware of the special role that the EU can and must play in this respect, the Council urged Member States and the Commission to focus their efforts more specifically on these areas. 1.31.4.

Furthermore, it asked Member States: \u00a8 to enact provisions which effectively outlaw discrimination against people living with HIV/ AIDS, including restrictions that impact on their freedom of movement within their jurisdictions; \u00a8 to step up information and education campaigns on the prevention, testing and treatment of HIV/AIDS. Finally, Parliament called on the Council and the Commission to formulate a strategy on HIV to: promote early diagnosis and reduction of barriers to testing; ensure early care and communication of the benefits of earlier care.

EuroMed foreign ministers adopted a declaration specifying the organisation of the institutional structure of the process and establishing a work programme for 2009. It was therefore decided that Barcelona will be the seat of the general secretariat of the UfM. The institutional structure is composed of a co-presidency, senior officials, a joint permanent committee, a secretariat and a parliamentary assembly. The institutions will implement the major principles adopted at the Paris summit for a more shared, balanced and lasting cooperation around the Mediterranean. Moreover, ministers reached unanimous agree- ment on the participation of the Arab League at all meetings and at all levels. The work programme for 2009 was also adopted. Meetings on various subjects were planned and fields of cooperation were identified (political and security dialogue; maritime safety; economic and financial partnership; social, human and cultural cooperation). In addition, ministers reviewed the progress made in implementing the priority projects selected in the declaration adopted during the Paris Euro- Mediterranean summit in July 2008. On the political front, an ambitious text was adopted. The ministers reaffirmed the will shared by all for the UfM to contribute to peace, stability and development in the region. They affirmed the importance of the Arab peace initiative and reiterated their support for the Annapolis process and for the indirect dialogue between Israel and Syria. Finally, they welcomed the establishment of diplomatic relations between Syria and Lebanon. 1.35.2. Euro-Mediterranean meeting of ministers for industry.

After the eviction of the al-Kurd family from their home and the recent destruction of the houses of Palestinian families by the Israeli authorities, in several areas of East Jerusalem on the basis of an order issued by the Israeli Supreme Court, Parliament expressed its deep concern at the possible serious consequences of these measures. It pointed out that these operations, which seriously affect the lives of the residents of these areas, contravene international law, and called on the Israeli authorities to put an end to them as soon as possible. Whilst acknowledging the indepen- dence of the Israeli judiciary within the internationally recognised borders of the State of Israel, Parliament underlined that, under international law, East Jerusalem is not subject to the jurisdiction of Israeli courts. It therefore called on the Council, the Commission and the international community, to make all possible efforts to protect Palestinian residents in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood and other areas of East Jerusalem. Parliament reiterated its call to the Israeli authorities to immediately halt any expansion of settlements and the building of the security fence beyond Israel \u2019 s 1967 borders. It affirmed that such actions are contrary to international law and can only damage the chances of reaching a peace agreement between Palestinians and Israelis. Jordan 1.35.9.

During this meeting, the EU welcomed Jordan \u2019 s political announcements for greater openness and the guarantee of freedom to exercise rights, calling on the country to move to the phase of implementation, particularly regarding the press, political parties, local elections and public meetings. It also welcomed the fact that Jordan had completed the stages laid down in the EU \u2013 Jordan action plan and structured its cooperation. However the EU expressed its concerns regarding the law on civil society and stressed the need to reinforce the independence of the country \u2019 s legal apparatus. The situation in the Middle East was also on the agenda, as were relations with Iran and Iraq and the fight against terrorism. The EU welcomed the fact that Jordan has decided to appoint an ambassador to Baghdad and congratulated the country on the constructive role it plays in the process involving the neighbouring countries of Iraq and other players. Economically, Jordan has obtained excellent results and is continuing its reforms in fields such as taxation and the management of public finances. The EU supports Jordan in these difficult reforms, which are vital to guarantee economic growth. However, it called upon Jordan to ensure that these economic advantages are more evenly spread through the Jordanian population. Lebanon 1.35.10. Council conclusions on Lebanon. Bull.

The Council welcomed the return to normal functioning of the Lebanese institutions following the Doha agreement of 21 May and reaffirmed its full support for the Lebanese authorities. It encouraged all parties to engage in dialogue, in a spirit of consensus and compromise, in order to make progress on the question of the national defence strategy, in the interests of all Lebanese people. The Council welcomed the announcement of the establish- ment of diplomatic relations between Lebanon and Syria. It encouraged both parties to implement the other commitments referred to in the communiqu\u00e9 agreed upon last August by Presidents Assad and Sleiman, and in particular the demarcation and monitoring of the common border and the issue of prisoners and disappeared persons. According to the Council, the EU and its Member States are willing to lend their support, where necessary, to the development and implementation of the Lebanese national border management strategy. In addition, the EU is fully prepared to support the preparation, organisation of and the follow- up to the 2009 legislative elections, in order to ensure that they take place under transparent and fair conditions in accordance with international standards. It is also willing to envisage the deployment of an election observation mission, if requested to do so by the Lebanese authorities. The Council underlined the essential role played by the Lebanese State and its law enforcement authorities and in particular its armed forces, in combating terrorism. It solemnly reiterated its commitment to the principle of State monopoly on the legitimate use of force. In addition, the Council underlined the importance of implementing the economic, financial and commercial aspects of the EU \u2013 Lebanon action plan and of pursuing the reforms necessary for reviving the country \u2019 s economic activity.

The Council reaffirmed its desire for a secure, stable, democratic, prosperous and unified Iraq in which human rights are respected. It welcomed both the progress achieved in improving the security situation and the steps taken towards national reconciliation. The Council hoped that elections will be held at the beginning of 2009 as planned. It noted with satisfaction that a number of neighbours and partners in the region have honoured the commitments undertaken in the final commu- niqu\u00e9 of the Conference of the Neighbouring Countries of Iraq in Kuwait in April 2008 and have strengthened their representation in Baghdad. Constructive engagement of Iraq \u2019 s neighbours and partners remains essential to peace and stability. The Council emphasised the importance of a renewed commitment by the EU on the rule of law, via Community assistance, the ESPD mission and Member States \u2019 own programmes. It welcomed the substantial progress achieved in negotiations on the trade and cooperation agreement and stated its determination to conclude the negotiations as speedily as possible. Finally, the EU remains committed to developing its partnership with Iraq in accordance with the principles of the International Compact with Iraq. 1.35.16.

The Council took note of the Commission \u2019 s mission to Jordan and Syria between 1 and 6 November in order to assess the situation of the most vulnerable Iraqi refugees in those countries, and to examine the possibilities for resettlement in Member States willing to receive them. It stressed that the principal objective is to create the conditions for the safe return of displaced persons in Iraq and of those displaced in neighbouring countries, while taking care to protect and defend human rights for all Iraqis. The Council recalled the financial and humanitarian aid delivered by the EU and Member States to the Iraqi refugees. Likewise, it was pleased that certain Member States already welcome Iraqi refugees, in particular under their resettlement programmes. Accordingly, the Council invited Member States to receive those Iraqi refugees in particularly vulnerable situations such as persons having specific medical needs, those traumatised or tortured, those from religious minorities or single women with children.

The Council discussed EU \u2013 Russia relations, with a view to the summit meeting in Nice on 14 November. On the conclusion of the discussion, the Presidency made the following statement: \u2018 1. The conflict in Georgia has affected the trust which is necessary for the partnership between the European Union and Russia. All points regarding the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia and the implementation of the agreements of 12 August and 8 September, as set out in the European Council conclusions of 1 September and 15 and 16 October, remain valid and relevant, including those concerning access to certain areas. Russia must continue to implement its commitments and enter constructively into the international discussions which have opened in Geneva. We continue fully to support the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia. 2. The Commission and the Council Secretariat have carried out an in-depth examination of relations between the EU and Russia, as requested by the European Council in its 1 September conclusions. That process will continue, in particular in the light of Russia \u2019 s actions. It will be taken into account in the further negotiations on the new agreement with Russia and in other aspects of EU \u2013 Russia relations; it forms part of a regular process which will be continued by the Council and the Commission after the Nice summit. 3. For the Union, dialogue and negotiation are the best means of pursuing its aims, furthering its principles and values, and resolutely defending its interests with a united front, in accordance with the negotiating mandate, which was adopted unan- imously. Negotiation and dialogue on bases such as these in no way legitimise the status quo in Georgia, or Russian action contrary to our values and principles. 4. In accordance with the European Council conclusions of 1 September which reiterate what is at stake in relations between the European Union and Russia, we expect Russia to behave in a responsible manner, honouring all its commitments, in a way which will restore the necessary confidence; we will remain vigilant, in particular on common neighbour- hood issues that are covered by the Union \u2019 s negotiating mandate. \u2019 1.35.26.

The Council considers that establishing a trilateral dialogue, following on from the initiatives taken since the 2006 EU \u2013 China summit, will strengthen the EU \u2019 s bilateral partnerships with both China and Africa, including the AU, by enabling common interests and areas for cooperation to be identified. According to it, this trilateral dialogue will support the efforts undertaken by Africa and by the international community to promote democratisation, political and economic integration, good governance and respect for human rights. The Council also considers that this cooperation should be developed within the framework of a joint approach and implemented by initiatives in the sectors of peace, security and sustainable economic and social development in Africa. Furthermore, it believes that particular attention should be given to cooperation in the area of peace and security, where the EU and China can Bull.

Adopted by the Council on 10 November. The Council firmly condemned the continuing unacceptable violations of human rights in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), in particular the numerous cases of sexual violence and the recruitment and use of child soldiers by the armed groups. It highlighted once more the urgency of finding a political solution, which is the only way to restore long-term stability to the region. Furthermore, it pointed out that the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a source of funding for the rebel groups and, therefore, of instability in the region. It reiterated the importance of combating such illegal exploitation and of the role played by the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in association with the UN Sanctions Committee for the DRC, and it is prepared to consider all means of stepping up such action. Moreover, the Council stressed the importance of the forthcoming discussions on renewing the mandate of the MONUC and on strengthening its operational capacities. In this context it calls for enhanced cooperation between the EU, its Member States and the MONUC. Finally, the Council welcomed the initiative taken by President Mwai Kibaki, acting Chairman of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, and President Jakaya Kikwete, President-in-Office of the AU, in organising the summit on the crisis in the east of the DRC on 7 November 2008 in Nairobi. The Council noted with interest the appointment of a team of facilitators including the former President of the Republic of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, as the special envoy of the Secretary-General of the UN and the former President of the United Republic of Tanzania, Mr Mkapa. 1.35.55.

Parliament was extremely concerned at the increase in clashes in North Kivu and the consequences for the population of the east of the DRC and the region as a whole. It reaffirmed its support for a UN mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in the present dramatic circumstances in which, despite its shortcomings, its presence remains indispensable, and called for every effort to be made to allow it to carry out its mandate in full and to use the force of arms to protect those under threat. Accordingly Parliament asked the Council, in particular, Belgium, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, to play a leading role in ensuring that the UN Security Council and the Department for Peacekeeping Operations supports MONUC by strengthening its operational capacities in terms of appropriate equipment and manpower. Finally, Parliament called on the Council and the Commission to draw up, together with the Government of the DRC, the UN and other major donors, a new plan for large-scale disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) in the DRC and an ambitious security sector reform strategy for the country. According to the Parliament, those two initiatives could be financed by both Community and CFSP funding. Nigeria 1.35.56.

Article 6(2) provides for a simplified procedure whereby such protocols are to be concluded by the Council of the EU, acting unanimously on behalf of Member States, and the third country concerned. This procedure is without prejudice to the Community \u2019 s own competences.

After preliminary draft amending budget No 8/ 2008 was cancelled, it is important to note that preliminary draft amending budget (PDAB) No 9/2008 became draft amending budget (DAB) No 8/2008. This DAB concerns only the European Economic and Social Committee and relates to two technical adjustments concerning salaries and pensions, resulting in: \u00a8 a reduction in expenditure on remuneration and pensions of approximately 0.8 %, due to the difference between the 2.2 % estimated increase and the 1.4 % actual increase; \u00a8 an increase in expenditure on remuneration and pensions of approximately 0.2 %, due to the one-off backdated payment of 0.4 % for the last six months of 2007. The impact of these adjustments on the budget will be EUR 318 262 in expenditure (approximately 0.6 % reduction in commitment appropriations and payment appropriations for remuneration) and EUR 48 265 in revenue (corresponding reduction in the contribution to the pension scheme), resulting in a net reduction of EUR 269 997 in the Committee \u2019 s budget for 2008. Declared adopted by the European Parliament on 20 November. Parliament took note of the PDAB No 9/2008 and approved the DAB No 8/ 2008 unamended.

These amendments aimed at improving the protection of fundamental rights of persons concerned by OLAF investigations, particularly when providing information, and strengthening cooperation between Member States. It therefore suggested providing a legal basis for the adoption of a procedural code for OLAF investigations. Parliament also requested the setting up of a review adviser in order to strengthen respect for procedural guarantees. In addition, Parliament considers that any person who is under investigation by OLAF should be able to lodge a complaint with the supervisory committee. These complaints would be dealt with by a review adviser acting in complete independence. Bull. EU 11-2008 145 Protection of the Communities \u2019 financial interests and the fight against fraud ",

In 2007, in its communication on \u2018 A Europe of results \u2014 Applying Community law \u2019 , the Commission announced it would give the annual report a new, forward-looking focus on strategic issues, including its evaluation of the current state of the law in different sectors and its priorities and programming of future work. This report consists of: \u00a8 a report providing a strategic evaluation, prioritisation and work programming in the control of the application of Community law; \u00a8 a document of the services of the Commission containing a sector-by-sector analysis; \u00a8 a document of the services of the Commission containing a list of all the infringement proceedings concerning treaties, regulations and decisions, with indication of the Member States concerned, the sector and the step in the procedure, and a similar list for the directives. This report identifies three key areas for improvement: actions to prevent problems arising; proactive partnership with Member States on problem-solving for citizens; and priorities in complaints and infringements work. The report constitutes a new strategy statement by the Commission on a key aspect of better regulation in which the European Parliament is showing increased interest.

Article 87(1) EC is to be interpreted as meaning that, for the purpose of assessing whether a measure is selective, account is to be taken of the institutional, procedural and economic autonomy enjoyed by the authority adopting that measure. It is for the national court, which alone has jurisdiction to identify the national law applicable and to interpret it, as well as to apply Community law to the cases before it, to determine whether the Historical Territories and the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country have such autonomy, which, if so, would have the result that the laws adopted within the limits of the areas of competence granted to those infra-State bodies by the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the other provisions of Spanish law are not of a selective nature within the meaning of the concept of State aid as referred to in Article 87(1) EC.

Article 82 EC must be interpreted as meaning that an undertaking occupying a dominant position on the relevant market for medicinal products which, in order to put a stop to parallel exports carried out by certain wholesalers from one Member State to other Member States, refuses to meet ordinary orders from those wholesalers, is abusing its dominant position. It is for the national court to ascertain whether the orders are ordinary in the light of both the size of those orders in relation to the requirements of the market in the first Member State and the previous business relations between that undertaking and the wholesalers concerned.

(2) The expression \u2018 would lead to \u2019 is, for the purposes of the second subparagraph of Article 4(5) of sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC, to be interpreted as encompassing not only actual competition, but also potential competition, provided that the possibility of a private operator entering the relevant market is real, and not purely hypothetical. (3) The word \u2018 significant \u2019 is, for the purposes of the second subparagraph of Article 4(5) of sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC, to be understood as meaning that the actual or potential distortions of competition must be more than negligible.

Proposal for a Council regulation amending the conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities. Regulation to be amended: Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 laying down the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities: OJ L 56, 4.3.1968, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 723/2004: OJ L 124, 27.4.2004; Bull. 3-2004, point 1.9.14 References: Statute of Members of the European Parliament: OJ L 262, 7.10.2005 European Parliament, Plenary session: Bull. 5- 2008, point 1.38.2 Adopted by the Commission on 12 November. The current system of engaging of assistants to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), which is based entirely on private law contractual arrangements, seems to be no longer compatible with the size and complexity of a Parliament composed of MEPs from 27 Member States. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to introduce in the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants provisions that create a new category of staff which is specific to the European Parliament. It covers the assistants to MEPs based in one of the European Parliaments \u2019 places of work (Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg), with the exception of those assistants working in MEP offices in the country of election, e.g constituency offices, and aims to clarify and improve their current situation while fully respecting the particularity of their tasks in the Parliament. COM(2008) 786 Plenary session in Strasbourg, 17 \u2013 20 November 1.38.2. In a formal sitting and in the framework of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, Parliament was addressed by Sir Jonathan Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth. He placed special emphasis on the positive aspects of continuous dialogue between Jews, Christians and Muslims. As far as the key debates are concerned, a significant share of the plenary session was devoted to a joint discussion of the financial crisis and the Commission \u2019 s work and legislative programme for 2009. It should be noted that the Commission \u2019 s speedy reaction was broadly welcomed by the political groups in Parliament, with the Greens-EFA and GUE- NGL striking the only critical note. On behalf of the Council, Mr Jouyet, French Secretary of State for European Affairs, brought to the fore the current financial crisis, the worst since 1929, which would result in economic recession with likely dramatic social side- effects. However, he underlined that the European Union had succeeded in providing a coordinated response in order to guarantee interbank flow and securing savings. He added that efficient joint action by the European institutions and national governments had underpinned the success of the G20 meeting in Washington, which had resulted in enhanced transparency and responsibility as regards the functioning of the international financial system and a commitment to mobilise macroeconomic tools. He recalled that Parliament would have a role to play in the development of the relevant legislative package. He wound up by underscoring the Union \u2019 s determination to take the reins of its own fate and play a major role on the global scene. On behalf of the Commission, President Barroso first recalled that the Commission \u2019 s work and legislative programme 2009 assured both Bull. EU 11-2008 153 ",
        "continuity and indispensable action at the current junction. Taking stock of the recent G20 meeting, the President placed emphasis on the fact that it had been an initiative of the European Union, in line with the conclusions of the European Council held on 7 November. He deemed this meeting to represent a new era, namely the joint steering of the world economy, which had laid down the new guidelines for market reform and the new world economic governance by undertaking concerted action to stimulate the economy and fight the negative consequences of the crisis on employment and rejecting protectionism. At the same time, the clear signal had also been sent out that all these targets could not be attained to the detriment of the millennium goals, namely energy security of supply, climate change, food supply security and the rule of law. He stressed that the Union should play a catalyst role with a view to transforming all these targets into tangible proposals. Moving on to outline the main elements of the Commission \u2019 s work and legislative programme for 2009, President Barroso commented on the package of measures to be adopted on 26 November 2008, which aimed at adapting and renewing the Lisbon strategy. He noted that the social agenda should also be looked into in the context of growing unemployment. He concluded by calling for Parliament \u2019 s cooperation to deal with all the forthcoming legislative measures to be presented. At this point of the debate, Mr P\u00f6ttering, President of the European Parliament, intervened to pay tribute to the Commission \u2019 s speedy action at the first signs of the financial turmoil. As far as the debate in Parliament is concerned, the major political groups welcomed the concerted action taken by the Union to face the financial crisis, specially as regards the organisation of the G20 meeting. Only the Greens-EFA and GUE-NGL groups struck a critical note, the former criticising the Commission for having favoured deregulation in the past and the latter rejecting the mere reform of capitalism. By way of conclusion Vice-President Wallstr\u00f6m pointed to the speedy reaction by the Commission to the financial crisis beyond sheer \u2018 business as usual \u2019 . She also took note of Parliament \u2019 s request that the right balance ought to be struck between the economic, social and environmental dimensions, as well as between free market and regulation. As regards the Commission \u2019 s work and legislative programme for 2009, she underlined the fact that, for the first time ever, it would contain communication priorities, four of them agreed upon with other institutions, including the forthcoming European elections. She concluded by recalling the exceptional nature of the year 2009, which represents the end of both Parliament \u2019 s and the Commission \u2019 s mandate. In the context of the financial crisis, Parliament also held an extraordinary debate on the crisis in the automotive sector, with MEPs calling on the Commission for the adoption of an integrated approach and a protective framework of targeted and temporary measures that would sustain European competitiveness in such a sensitive sector. The ALDE group called for lower interest rates to facilitate easier loans for the industry and the introduction of a wide premium for scrapping old cars. GUE-NGL and the Greens-EFA levelled strong criticism against the Commission. Mr Jouyet, on behalf of the French Presidency, acknowledged the significant reduction in car sales in all major countries, with an estimated drop of 5 % across the EU in 2008 (the highest since 1993). He agreed that temporary measures to support the EU car industry would be useful as long as they would not jeopardise other policy goals such as an undistorted market and attaining climate change targets. Yet he deemed the overall financial situation of the sector to be healthy. Vice- President Verheugen reassured Parliament that the Commission was ready to establish the appropriate framework conditions for an increase in competitiveness. An integrated approach would be applied with a view to reducing emissions given that setting ambitious environmental objectives would strengthen the global competitiveness of the European car industry. Moreover the Community trade policy would support market access for the European automotive industry to ensure that European producers were able to operate on a level playing field overseas. It should also be noted that at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents held in the margin of the plenary, President Barroso confirmed this line, restating that the Commission was preparing specific measures for the sector in order to support a more competitive and greener car industry in Europe. In the institutional field, the presentation of the annual report 2007 of the Court of Auditors by its President, Mr Caldeira, was followed by a debate. Most members taking the floor welcomed the progress accomplished by the Commission regarding the legal and regular character of expenditure, with some criticism as regards the alleged lack of commitment vis-\u00e0- vis national declarations. Mr Kallas, Member of the Commission, welcomed the positive note of 154 Bull. EU 11-2008 European Parliament ",
        "the report, especially as regards reliability and improvement of control systems and expendi- ture. As far as the internal policies are concerned, Parliament adopted by an overwhelming majority a resolution on the first 10 years on the economic and monetary union (EMU), with detailed recommendations taking stock of the results obtained. The preceding debate showed a clear divide between the three major groups and the rest of the political spectrum. Whereas the smaller groups challenged the achievements attributed to the euro and depicted a gloomy picture of European economy, with losses in employment and sluggish growth, the PPE-DE, PSE and, to a lesser extent ALDE, underlined that both the euro and EMU had proved to be a great success and Europe \u2019 s \u2018 best investment \u2019 , which had shown its strength even in the current difficult context of the financial crisis. Most Members taking the floor called for reinforced coordination of economic policies touching upon both monetary and fiscal aspects, whilst disagreeing on whether more coordina- tion or a genuine system of economic governance should be sought. Mr Juncker, President of the Eurogroup, called on Parliament to send out a strong signal to Member States, urging them for action. He recalled that establishing a global currency would result in some costs to be reckoned with, further noting that the introduction of the euro did not aim at doing away with economic divergences. Mr Almunia, Member of the Commission, welcomed the overall consensus attained in Parliament in support of the single currency, adding that the Commission agreed on the need to reinforce coordination, whilst allowing sufficient flexibility, and the necessity to speak with a single voice at international level. Parliament adopted a resolution on European space policy, following an oral question to the Council and the Commission, which received widespread support. It underscores the fact that space is a strategic asset of fundamental importance for Europe \u2019 s independence, security and prosperity, and formulates a number of recommendations to the Council and the Commission. Mr Verheugen stressed that some problems such as financing, independent access to space and a European vision needed further reflection if Europe wanted to build on its competitive edge. He recalled that in 2009 the Commission would organise a high-level conference to discuss Europe \u2019 s role in this area in a global context. In the framework of the \u2018 short presentations \u2019 Parliament also discussed and adopted a number of own-initiative reports. The report on carbon capture and storage: supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels was adopted with broad support. On behalf of the Commission, Ms H\u00fcbner underlined the integrated approach of the climate change and renewable energy package. In relation to the issue of financing she recalled that the Commission had submitted to the legislator a policy option paper in order to help build consensus to ensure sufficient financing for low carbon emission technologies. Parliament also adopted by an overwhelming majority the report on \u2018 improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance \u2019 . Mrs H\u00fcbner, Member of the Commission, stressed that the national level was the most appropriate, effective and efficient one for the delivery of consumer information programmes with the Commission promoting financial education, coordinating national efforts and demonstrating best practice. Finally, Parliament adopted by a very large majority the report on the consumer markets scoreboard. Mrs H\u00fcbner underlined the importance of the scoreboard, inviting Parlia- ment to see the results of the Commission \u2019 s efforts for improvement, notably by making it more accessible to the public. Furthermore, Parliament adopted additional non- legislative resolutions on equal pay for men and women, the beekeeping sector, AIDS early diagnosis and care, social security system and pensions, environmental inspection in the Member States, the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Fund and \u2018 EU and PNR (passenger name record) data \u2019 . Mr Jouyet made an extraordinary intervention on this latter issue, noting the exceptionally broad consultation carried out by the Presidency and reassuring Parliament that it would be closely involved irrespective of the legal base to be applied. Parliament also discussed the demographic trends and their socioeconomic impact and the Solidarity Fund. On this latter issue, Parliament deplored the fact that the Council had not yet taken any decision following Parliament \u2019 s first reading two years ago. As regards the external policies , Parliament adopted a resolution on the response of the European Union to the critical situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Bull.

        "Congo, which calls on the international community and the UN Security Council to strengthen MONUC and to increase pressure on all parties in order to press forward with its diplomatic efforts in the peace process. Both the Presidency and the Commission voiced their concern about the appalling humanitarian situation in the area, further stressing that a political rather than military solution was the answer. Mr Jouyet, on behalf of the French Presidency, highlighted the diplomatic efforts which had been made by the Commission and the African Union to encourage dialogue between Congo and Rwanda. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner explained that the Commission had reacted immediately by releasing EUR 6.3 million of emergency aid and a further EUR 43 million had been agreed upon by the Member States. She pointed out that the creation of humanitarian corridors for enabling access to the local population represented the biggest obstacle. Parliament also adopted resolutions on the Convention on cluster munitions, the situation in Somalia, the death penalty in Nigeria and the case of the Al-Kurd family. As far as legislative issues are concerned, the following items merit being highlighted. Under the assent procedure Parliament endorsed the report on the convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters. In the second reading under co-decision, Parliament endorsed without amendments the common position of the Council on Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work. In the first reading under co-decision, Parliament adopted a legislative resolution related to the publication and translation obligations of certain types of companies. It is noteworthy that Mr McCreevy, Member of the Commission, stressed that the amendments carried in plenary undermined the objectives of the Commission \u2019 s proposal whose rationale was that the current traditional publication methods (in newspapers) be superseded by the envisaged electronic platform, thereby substantially reducing the administrative burden on companies. He regretted the fact that, according to Parliament \u2019 s views, Member States could not only continue to impose the current adminis- trative burdens on companies but also add new ones. He said that the adoption of the directive in the form proposed by Parliament would jeopardise the credibility of the entire administrative burden reduction exercise. Parliament adopted by an overwhelming majority the report on European statistics, endorsing the compromise amendments and thereby paving the way for agreement at first reading. Mr Almunia placed emphasis on the benefits which the revised regulation would bring about. He drew particular attention to the enhanced professional independence and impartiality of statistical bodies, as laid down in the European statistics code of practice enshrined in the regulation, which he deemed to represent an important step to strengthen the trust in statistical data of citizens and businesses alike. Parliament also carried by a large majority the report on the investigations conducted by the OLAF. Vice-President Kallas pointed to the specific nature of OLAF, being part of the Commission structure but acting independently to launch inquiries, on which grounds he rejected several amendments tabled by Parliament aiming at the modification of OLAF \u2019 s current status. Under consultation, in the wake of a largely consensual debate, Parliament adopted the report on establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance to Member States \u2019 balances of payments. The revision of the regulation gathered widespread endorsement in order to increase the ceiling of financial support from EUR 12 billion to EUR 25 billion. A separate resolution was also adopted on the issue of financial assistance to Member States, which makes the case for the euro as a protective shield in the current financial turmoil. It also underlines that a coherent and swift framework for providing financial assistance to countries in urgent need should be established, calling on Member States to first seek assistance within the EU before contacting the IMF or other international organisations, in order to avoid the recent example of Hungary. Mr Almunia pledged to study Parliament \u2019 s ideas and recommendations carefully and to report back to both Parliament and the High-Level Group led by Mr de Larosi\u00e8re. Also under consultation Parliament adopted in a very tight vote (support coming from the PSE, ALDE and Greens-EFA ranks) the report on the general arrangements for excise duty, with the rapporteur calling for a vote against her own report which she deemed to have been excessively altered by the amendments carried. 156 Bull. EU 11-2008 European Parliament ",
        "It should be noted that Parliament \u2019 s views ran counter to the Commission \u2019 s proposal on such important issues as maintaining guidance levels, the legal base for tax-free shops at country borders and the reimbursement of excise duty. Mr Kovacs, Member of the Commission, defended the Commission \u2019 s standpoint on the aforementioned controversial issues. Following a long debate, Parliament also carried by a large majority the reports on four proposals touching upon the CAP \u2018 health check \u2019 . The debate was full of political slogans making reference to such issues as agricultural sovereignty, new challenges, balanced approach and simplifica- tion. Fairness also proved to be a recurrent theme, with many EU-12 MEPs complaining about the current disparities under the CAP between the new and the old Member States. Mr Barnier, on behalf of the French Presidency, said that any further changes to modulation would have an impact on project co-financing by the Member States as well as on fund allocation. He acknowledged that intervention should represent nothing but a \u2018 safety net \u2019 and that equality was a real problem for the new Member States. Ms Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission, rejected the claim that more modulation would be tantamount to less money for farmers, adding that the sooner milk quotas were relaxed, the earlier superlevy payments would stop. In the field of justice, freedom and security, Parliament took an important step forward by adopting by a comfortable majority the reports on the conditions of entry and residence for migrants for highly-qualified jobs and the single application procedure for residence and work (blue card). Mr Jouyet, for the French Presidency, pointed out that the transitional restrictions applicable to the new Member States \u2019 migrants would all have expired before this package came into force. He recommended a case-by-case approach to avoid possible \u2018 brain-drain \u2019 problems. He agreed that this package comprised a first set of measures, to which Vice-President Barrot agreed. Also under consultation, Parliament adopted reports on the school fruit scheme, the protocol to the EC \u2013 Kazakhstan partnership and cooperation agreement, the joint undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR), the Guarantee Fund for External Actions (codified version) and the amendment to the single Common Market Organisation to include the reform of the wine sector. This latter proposal provoked some hostile reactions from a number of Members who simply considered that the single text was too complex and unintelligible. Finally it should be noted that in the margin of the session the Conference of Presidents of political groups held two important exchanges of views. On the one hand, in the course of a closed-doors breakfast, the Conference discussed with President Barroso the European economic recovery plan which was due to be adopted by the Commission on 26 November in the framework of the Lisbon strategy. The aim of the discussion was to listen to Parliament \u2019 s views with a view to building on them. On the other hand, the Conference of Presidents held an exchange of views with Vice-President Wallstr\u00f6m on various interinstitutional issues, with Ms Roth-Behrendt, Chair of the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, in attendance. The discussion focused on issues related to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the communication policy and the reform of the European Parliament. Council 2901st meeting 1.38.3.

Council: Mr Solana, Secretary-General/High Representative for the CFSP. The Council renewed the embargo on EU arms against Uzbekistan, while deciding not to renew the travel restrictions applying to certain members of the Uzbek regime. This follows on from the conclusions of its meeting on 13 October 2008, in which it welcomed the progress achieved by Uzbekistan with regard to respect for the rule of law and in the protection of human rights, while remaining concerned by the situation in certain areas. The Council also decided not to apply, for a renewable six-month period, the travel restrictions on certain leading figures in Belarus, following the conclusions of its meeting of last October. The aim of the decision, following the recent elections in Belarus, is to encourage dialogue with the Belarusian authorities and the adoption of measures to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights. The Council approved the granting of more than EUR 215 million to Somalia from the European Development Fund, to support institution- building and economic and social development there, taking account of the needs of the poorest sections of the population. The Council deplored the lack of progress towards a transition to democracy in Myanmar (Burma). The 2010 elections will have no credibility unless the authorities unconditionally release all political prisoners and initiate a political process with the full participation of the opposition and ethnic groups. The Council also welcomed the return to normal functioning of the Lebanese institutions and encouraged all the parties to engage in dialogue in a spirit of compromise and consensus, in the interests of all the Lebanese people.

The Council also discussed recent events in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It expressed utmost concern at the increase in clashes in North Kivu and the consequences for the population and for the whole region.

This should be done on a voluntary basis and in the light of the reception capacities of the Member States and the overall efforts they have already made to accommodate refugees. The objective could be to accept up to around 10 000 refugees. The Council also reached agreement on a framework decision on legal supervision of pre- trial procedures between the Member States of the EU, as well as reaching agreement on the modernisation of the legal cooperation network in civil and commercial matters.

The Commission has adopted its legislative and work programme for 2009. It maintains its focus on delivering results within the overall strategic objectives set out at the start of its mandate: prosperity; solidarity; security and freedom, and a stronger Europe in the world. Priorities for 2009 are: \u00a8 growth and jobs: the Lisbon strategy remains the major vehicle for promoting a more prosperous, environmentally responsible and socially inclusive EU, and during 2009, the Commission will be working on how the Lisbon strategy might be adapted for the period post- 2010; \u00a8 climate change and sustainable Europe: 2009 will be a critical year for efforts to combat climate change. The UN Climate Change Convention in Copenhagen will be of central importance in testing the global resolve to deliver historic change: the culmination of efforts to agree a quantum leap in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 2012; \u00a8 a Europe close to citizens: this Commission has put the European citizen at the heart of the European project, through policies in areas close to citizens such as fundamental rights and citizenship, migration, justice, security and safety, consumer protection, and health. In 2009, the Commission will set out its proposals for the further development of the EU as an area of freedom, security and justice. These will form the basis for discussion with Member States, in view of adopting a follow-up to the current Hague programme; \u00a8 Europe as a world partner: In 2009, the Commission will continue to build its long-term relationship with key partners. The past year has shown the importance of a common vision with the US in times of intense pressure. It has also shown the mutual importance of good relations with Russia and the development of effective policies in areas such as energy, migration, trade and investment. The financial crisis has again underlined the need to deepen Europe \u2019 s relationship with key partners in Asia such as China, India and Japan, as well as with other emerging economies such as Brazil. According to the Commission, promoting a simpler and better regulatory environment without unnecessary administrative burdens should remain a key component of the Commission \u2019 s legislative work in 2009. The emphasis will be on improving the quality of new proposals, simplifying existing legislation and reducing administrative burdens. The Commission will also step up its efforts to communicate with European citizens and to explain the value of the European project. COM(2008) 712 Community Courts 1.38.13.

Committee of the Regions 77th plenary session 1.38.20. The Committee of the Regions held its 77th session on 26 and 27 November. This session was marked by the presence of Mr Barroso, President of the Commission. In his speech, Mr Barroso pointed out that local regions and communities have been the first to suffer the consequences of the financial crisis and for this reason regional and local authorities are in the frontline for facing the repercussions of the crisis on real economy. The capacity of Europe to succeed in its reforms and to get out of this crisis depends largely on the local and regional communities \u2019 contribution. Mr Barroso underlined that, during the crisis, Europe has proved its capacity to act determinedly by creating a framework of action and common principles. At the same time, on the international level, Europe is playing a significant role, with its views having been approved by the Washington summit. Regarding the Commissions work programme for 2009, Mr Barroso explained that the programme is built on concrete initiatives aiming at bringing tangible benefits for European citizens, based on new priorities. The main policy highlights are structured around four pillars: \u00a8 growth and jobs; Bull. EU 11-2008 165 Committee of the Regions ",
        "\u00a8 climate change and sustainable development; \u00a8 Europe for citizens; \u00a8 Europe as a world partner. The President of the Commission closed his speech by expressing his will for strengthening mutual cooperation between the Commission and the Committee and to better consider the regional dimension in the preparation of Commission proposals. The presence of Mr Barroso allowed the members to be informed on various subjects within the Commission. Concerning the 20th anniversary of democratic change in central and eastern Europe and of the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall and of the 2004 enlargement, the Commission has prepared a draft communication plan that foresees festive actions organised at central level; others will be implemented at local and regional level with the help of the Committee. Regarding the Commission \u2019 s plans for the adjustment or the continuation of the Lisbon strategy, which expires in 2009, Mr Barroso first noted that the European economic recovery plan published by the Commission on November 26, was rooted in the Lisbon strategy. The Commission will submit its plans for the new strategy at the end of 2009, with decisions to be taken at the 2010 spring European Council. According to the President of the Commission, regarding the burdens of reductions imposed on small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), some measures, already proposed for 2007 and 2008, would bring a substantial reduction in two areas identified as imposing the highest burdens: company law and VAT. Concerning the effects of the financial crisis on rural areas and the agricultural market, the President of the Commission refered to two pillars of the common agricultural policy (market support and direct payments), through which various types of support are already provided to farmers and rural areas. Moreover, the European economic recovery plan includes a number of measures dealing with the impact of the financial crisis on real economy. Concerning the implementation of the Small Business Act (SBA), Mr Barroso stressed the role of the French Presidency in this respect and mentioned that the Competitiveness Council of December would adopt conclusions on this subject. Furthermore, he noted that the European economic recovery plan aimed at enhancing access to financing for SMEs. The Commission will put in place a simplification package, notably to speed up its State aid decision-making. Access to financing will also be facilitated by raising the current safe harbour treshold for risk capital to EUR 2.5 and by allowing aid for certain loans or investments in the manufacture of products complying with Community environmental standards. On the issue of cooperation between the Commission and the future Czech presidency, who are very ambiguous on the Lisbon Treaty, Mr Barroso reiterated that the Commission fully respects the national sovereignty of Member States and expressed his confidence that the Czech Republic will preside over the Union in the interest of all. On a common immigration policy for Europe, Mr Barroso reaffirmed that the full involvement of regional and local authorities is a crucial factor for success in both immigration and integration policies and thus in all recent Commission documents in relation to these areas, the principle of subsidiarity and the relevance of the local level were underlined. Regarding the resources local and regional authorities require to effectively implement integration measures, he noted that the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals provides financial support to the efforts undertaken by Member States. Regarding the role of the President of the Commission in the mechanisms of enhanced cooperation under Title IV in the new Treaty, which allow some countries to move ahead together, Mr Barroso considered that the Commission should try to avoid isolating Member States or dividing them in different groups. On the additional resources under cohesion in order to support the local and regional authorities in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, Mr Barroso pointed out that not only the activities directly related to the fight against climate change, but also activities indirectly connected to this issue, receive EU funding. Moreover, he explained that it is not simply a matter for the Commission but also for national and regional management authorities. He also mentioned that the Commission was finalising its reflections on how the EU could best fight climate change and its effects and that it would submit a new document in 2009. Finally, he pointed out that, in its recovery plan for growth and jobs, the Commission proposed to boost the development of clean technologies. 166 Bull. EU 11-2008 Committee of the Regions ",
        "On the subsidiarity principle and the mechanisms provided for in the Lisbon Treaty for the association of the regional authorities to the decision-making process of the European Union, Mr Barroso underlined that, under the terms of this treaty, regional Parliaments would be required to play an even more significant role in the subsidiarity check, in view of the fact that it will be for each chamber of a national Parliament to consult, where appropriate, regional parliaments with legislative powers. In reply to a question about specific recognition, by the Commission \u2019 s work programme, of the skills and talents of women across Europe, particularly in the current financial and economic crisis, Mr Barroso agreed that women \u2019 s entrepreneurial potential constitutes an underdeveloped source of economic growth and of new jobs. He added that the competitiveness and innovation framework programme pays attention to the specific characteristics of female entrepreneurs as one of several specific target groups. The Commission is also working towards promoting women entrepreneurs and eliminating any gender-based discrimination and obstacles, it collaborates with Member States in the areas where the needs for these women are not yet met. He finally reaffirmed the position that equality between women and men is not only a goal in itself, but also a necessary condition for fulfilling the overall EU objectives for growth, employment and social cohesion. During the meeting, a resolution covering the financial crisis was adopted. Several political groups introduced amendments aiming at taking account of the repercussions of the crisis on citizens and the loss of their up-and-coming prospects. It was the same for the resolution on the Commission work programme for 2009, the amendments added answering rather regional characteristics and interests. Mr de Decker, perpetual Secretary of the Royal Language Academy and French Literature in Belgium, introduced a debate on intercultural dialogue by recalling that the history of culture is above all the history of cities and especially of ports, genuine crucibles for the mixing of cultures. Regions, for their part, ignore political borders and we see that the partnerships between cross-border regions paint a different Europe. Mr de Decker, who is a member of the Commission group of intellectuals on linguistic diversity, also decided that everyone has the possibility of spending their lives speaking their maternal language and called for the respect of all languages, even if the citizen has to be a polyglot (three languages at least). He concluded by saying that sacrificing language was to lose an interpretation of the world. During the meeting, several members of the Committee expressed opinions on this subject. According to certain members, the new borders of the citizenship of cities must be redefined and reinvest in the seas, around the Mediterranean in particular. For his part, the author of the report on the integration policy and intercultural dialogue stressed the fact that this dialogue brought an added value to economic and social cohesion. Lastly, the President of the region of Tuscany warned against the dangers of the supremacy of culture or of a religion and stated his preference that diversities be included in a united vision. The draft opinion on the integration policy and intercultural dialogue did not give rise to a debate. The amendments included particularly aimed at the implementation programmes. The presentation of the opinion covering \u2018 a common policy of migration for Europe \u2019 did not give rise to debate either. However, the number of amendments included and their content made it possible to note cleavage between the two sides of the hemicycle. The meeting followed the rapporteur \u2019 s recommendations, in particular regarding the alignment of the terminology on the conclusions adopted by the Council on the matter in October. By approving the forward study opinion on the \u2018 mayors \u2019 pact \u2019 , the Committee wanted to revive the initiative by widening it to regional communities. A strong consensus emerged around this opinion which aims at the involvement of citizens in a collective and positive action of fighting against climate change. Whilst welcoming the Commission \u2019 s initiative, the opinion points however to a certain nervousness from the Commission on the time to adapt and implement the 2006 action plan for energy efficiency. In the field of enlargement and foreign affairs, the opinions on the \u2018 Western Balkans: strengthening the European prospect \u2019 and \u2018 The value added of the participation of local authorities in the enlargement process \u2019 were adopted. The first welcomes the stabilising effect for the region of the association agreements and the progress of the integration process. The second welcomes the setting up of the instrument of aid for pre-accession and wants to determine the communities \u2019 potential and to avoid any practical stumbling blocks. Bull. EU 11-2008 167 Committee of the Regions ",
        "The opinion also calls for the establishment of a political framework of reference associating the local authorities with the enlargement process and with the conclusion of an agreement on this subject between the Committee and the Commission, in a spirit of effectiveness. The report on a programme of European cooperation in school matters is brought into line with the approach of the Commission, while stressing the need to take into account consequences of a financial nature of the measures proposed for local and regional authorities and to recognise the competences of these on the matter. At the time of the vote, the draft text achieved unanimity between the members present. The draft opinion on the proposal for a Council recommendation concerning the mobility of young volunteers through Europe and the opinion concerning the response to the challenge of energy efficiency through information and communication technologies were adopted. Moreover, members deplored that the draft opinion on \u2018 The EU as a global partner for development: speeding up progress towards the millennium development goals \u2019 does not mention the problems faced by the majority of the world population and that it does not really address the issue. Other members expressed their disagreement with this opinion and shared the point of view of the rapporteur that the Commission \u2019 s communication constitutes the recognition of the work that the Committee has done so far and it can help in the direction of better European cooperation on the issue. The draft opinion was adopted after almost all the proposed amendments were carried. The opinion on the \u2018 Fifth progress report on economic and social cohesion \u2019 was also adopted. Nevertheless, it gave rise to the addition of many amendments. The opinion on \u2018 A Community legal framework applicable to infrastructures \u2019 was the subject of several amendments. A close vote led to the adoption of an amendment which asks that the European research infrastructures be distributed in a balanced way between the Member States and so that that they are not concentrated in the western part of the EU. On the other hand, the opinion on the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs was the subject of an at times lively discussion on the 34 submitted amendments. A rather political amendment was accepted: it covers immigration and shows that the external contributions of labour force have to be done \u2018 according to requirements of Member States or of the local and territorial authorities \u2019 . Other important amendments covered the importance of mobilising local authorities on the Lisbon strategy from the beginning until the end of the final phase, on the competitiveness of SMEs, on the principle of subsidiarity and on the reduction of accidents at work. The results of the working party and of the \u2018 toolbox \u2019 on the communication were presented. The group, which bases itself on the experiences of its members, will continue its work, according to the wish of the President of the Committee. 168 Bull. EU 11-2008 Committee of the Regions ",
