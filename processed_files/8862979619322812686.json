        "02 \u2013 03 Foreword This year marks the 10th anniversary of the European Enterprise Promotion Awards (EEPA). The Awards pay tribute to projects that are sure to inspire all of us who care about enterprises, entrepreneurs and jobs. Because this is what Europe needs: examples that can inspire the creation of an ecosystem that helps entrepreneurial spirits, nurtures enterprises and helps them grow. All these projects have tangible results: they help to create new companies and new jobs. They make entrepreneurs stronger by providing them with the right skills to set up their business or go international. They are schemes that can make that vital difference for someone hesitating on the threshold of entrepreneurship. Since 2006 the European Enterprise Promotion Awards (EEPA) have been recognising these efforts. Over that time more than 3,400 projects have participated in national competitions for the chance to compete in the EEPA. The entries this year again represent the best of what has been achieved nationally. They were sent in from a total of 31 countries, including 28 EU Member States as well as Iceland, Serbia and Turkey. Before we present the 2016 winners to you, I would like to personally thank all participants and in particular the National Coordinators who helped to accomplish this important task of managing the competitions in their own country. You play an essential role in making the EEPA possible and in spreading the word about how public bodies and public/private sector partnerships support small business and enterprise throughout Europe. From the 57 projects selected to compete at European level, seven winners, twelve runners-up and three special mentions have emerged and are presented to you in this brochure. Each one is a testimony to the passion and innovation that puts ideas into practice, creates real businesses and turns people into entrepreneurs. I hope they will be an inspiration to authorities, organisations and individuals across Europe to do more for entrepreneurs and small businesses. El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs and EU SME Envoy ",
        "Small businesses driving European growth Helping Europe\u2019s entrepreneurs reach new heights SMEs are independent companies with fewer than 250 employees. They provide two out of three private sector jobs and are responsible for 85% of new jobs created. SMEs account for 67% of total employment and 58% of gross value added (GVA). Latest research shows that SMEs continue to form the bedrock of the European economy, with some 22.2 million companies employing 90 million people; and accounting for more than 99.8% of all enterprises. The biggest share of enterprise is represented by micro companies with fewer than ten employees \u2013 93%. The Small Business Act for Europe Adopted in June 2008, the Small Business Act for Europe (SBA) reflects the Commission\u2019s recognition of the central role that SMEs play in the EU economy. It sets out a comprehensive SME policy framework for the EU and its Member States. The aim of the Act is to improve the overall approach to entrepreneurship and permanently embed the \u2018Think Small First\u2019 principle in policy-making \u2013 from regulation to public service. The Act promotes SME growth by helping them tackle problems which hamper their development, particularly focusing on initiatives that help small businesses by: \u2022 Cutting red tape \u2022 Providing access to finance \u2022 Increasing access to markets Finally, the Act aims to deliver a longer-term shift in attitudes \u2013 creating a greater awareness of the role entrepreneurs play in society and encouraging and inspiring potential new entrepreneurs. These four key areas of the SBA continue to be priorities for the coming years. In addition, the need to address the shortage of skilled workers has become a fifth priority. A spin-off: The European Enterprise Promotion Awards The European Enterprise Promotion Awards support the aims of the Small Business Act by recognising innovation and rewarding the success of public bodies and public-private partnerships in promoting enterprise & entrepreneurship at a national, regional and local level. SME Envoys As part of the review of the SBA, the Commission invited Member States to nominate a national SME Envoy to complement the role of the European Commission\u2019s SME Envoy. The current EU SME Envoy is Ms El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, Member of the European Commission for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, who chairs the network. The group of SME Envoys makes up an advisory group that promotes SME friendly regulation and policy making in all EU countries.

        "Ten glorious years of celebrating European enterprise\u2026 Winning a European Enterprise Promotion Award is just the beginning of an organisation\u2019s or project\u2019s journey from national star to European glory. Th ese former EEPA winners explain the impact of being recognised at the European level and what winning an award means to them. \u201c It was a great experience to participate in the awards.\u201d When I started this project, not many people believed that a one-person small business in Hungary could achieve the kind of change that my company has achieved. Winning the EEPA had a huge impact on us. We received lots of press coverage in Hungary and in other European countries. The number of participants in our free monthly presentations has doubled and all of our courses are running to full houses. Previously, people were sceptical about starting their own business, but now they\u2019re more open to the topic, and trust us more. We have more connections in Hungary and throughout Europe, and are working on more new projects with other organisations. It was a great experience to participate in the awards. Agnes Vida, Gazdagmami Kft , Hungary. Winner: Grand Jury Prize, 2014. Winning the award showed us that we\u2019re doing important work in the fi eld of entrepreneurship. It was the fi rst time that a Finnish learning concept had got this far and it gave us the confi dence that we can succeed in Finland as well as internationally. It increased our visibility in Europe and we got more attention and enquiries from across the world. Two months aft er winning the EEPA, we won \u201cthe Best Learning Innovation in the World\u201d at the World Innovation Summit for Education competition in Qatar. Currently, 70% of Finland\u2019s 6th graders benefi t from the Me & MyCity learning concept. Tomi Alakoski, Me & MyCity, Economic Information Offi ce, Finland. Winner: Promoting the Entrepreneurial Spirit, 2013. \u201c It\u2019s been a great honour to have been selected as a winner.\u201d The Biodiversity Foundation is very proud to have won the EEPA, especially when we consider the other six projects in the winners list. We were very surprised when we received the award because, although we believed that our project was very good, the projects vying for the award in our category were also of a very high quality. Winning the award had a very positive impact and has resulted in a lot of positive media coverage. It motivated us to continue working towards a more sustainable society and a greener economy. Silvia Fern\u00e1ndez-Campa de Luis, Biodiversity Foundation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and the Environment, Spain. Winner: Supporting the Development of Green Markets and Resource Effi ciency, 2015. It was wonderful to be called out as the winner of the award. I was completely emotional, as I had wanted Going for Growth to win so much for the terrifi c third party endorsement it would mean and the spotlight it would put on our mission to encourage more women to be more ambitious for their businesses and to support them to achieve their growth aspirations. Winning the EEPA means that we\u2019re now recognised across Europe. This is in line with our objective of having the initiative introduced in other European countries as a means of connecting ambitious female entrepreneurs to network, learn from each other and do business together.
