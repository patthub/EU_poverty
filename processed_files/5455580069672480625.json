        "EN 3 EN 1. I NTRODUCTION The EU Drugs Strategy 2005-2012 sets out the basic principles for a European model of drugs policy based on the balanced approach to reducing the supply of and the demand for drugs. It aims to protect and improve the well-being of society and the individual, to protect public health, to offer a high level of security for the general public. The EU Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012, adopted by the European Council in December 2008, is the last of two Action Plans that aim to implement the objectives of the EU Drugs Strategy. The Action Plans help coordinate government interventions in the field of illegal drugs covering public health, law enforcement, customs, criminal justice and international cooperation. The EU Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012 has five priorities: to strengthen coordination among all drugs policy actors, to reduce drug use and its adverse health and social consequences, to reduce drugs availability, to strengthen international cooperation and to improve our understanding of the drugs problem. It consists of 24 objectives and 72 actions in total. Its implementation is mainly the responsibility of the Member States with support from the European Commission and technical assistance from the EU agencies, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), Europol and Eurojust. For each action, the responsible parties and a suggested deadline for its completion have been provided for. Furthermore, for each action an objectively verifiable indicator to monitor progress as well as the main documents in which such progress can be assessed, have been identified. In the following sections, a mid-term review of the state of play regarding the current EU Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012 is presented. For each action the available information on progress has been summarised. The output for each action that has reached its implementation deadline has been analysed. Ongoing actions are also monitored. For five actions 1 the deadline for completion was not yet indicated or no relevant information was available to date. In this mid-term review the Commission was assisted by the Member States, the EMCDDA, and Europol. This assessment covers 2009 and the first half of 2010 and follows the structure of the Action Plan. 1 Actions 16, 28, 32, 55 and 66. ",

C OORDINATION ( OBJECTIVES 1-4) Priority defined in the Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012: Coordination and cooperation in the drug field can be strengthened at both European and national level so that drug policies are relevant to professionals and civil society, while at the same time enabling these structures to provide feedback to inform policy. COORDINATION Objective / Action Responsible party State of play Objective 1. Ensure that a balanced and integrated approach is reflected in national policies and in the EU approach towards third countries and in international fora 1. Member States and EU institutions to effectively coordinate drugs policy to reflect the objectives of the EU Drugs Strategy 2005-2012 and this Action Plan MS COM Council The EU Drugs Strategy 2005-2012 and the EU Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012 are considered to be the main policy documents providing guidance for the drugs policy of the Member States and EU institutions. A survey conducted by the Commission in preparation of this annual assessment showed that 12 of the 24 Member States responding considered that the current Action Plan had provided guidance for the development of new national drugs policies. Eight of these had acceded to the EU in 2004. Ten Member States indicated that the Action Plan had been discussed and assessed against the background of their existing national policy. The extent to which the objectives of the EU Drugs Strategy and current EU Drugs Action Plan are actually reflected in national actions on drugs needs to be further assessed. Objective 2. Ensure effective coordination at EU level 2. The Council\u2019s Horizontal Drugs Group (HDG), as the working group with leading and steering responsibility for drugs in the Council, should pro- actively coordinate EU drugs policy. The HDG should identify specific Council Even though the Horizontal Drugs Group (HDG) continues to be the main coordinating structure in the Council dealing with drugs policy, some concerns have been raised about the involvement of the HDG in initiatives addressed in the Multi-Disciplinary Group on Organised Crime (MDG) and in the newly established Standing Committee on Internal Security (COSI). The European Pact against international drug trafficking, for instance, which was adopted in June 2010, was presented directly at political level and ",

The coordination with the HDG was not always considered adequate. The three Presidencies 2 in 2009 and the first half of 2010 each presented a specific list of priorities to be addressed. The Czech Presidency placed emphasis on Migration, Integration and Drugs ; Production, Trafficking and Use of Methamphetamine ; and Evaluation of Supply Reduction Interventions . The Swedish Presidency focused on initiatives to prevent or delay the use of drugs among young people, a more effective fight against crime at EU level to reduce drug supply, and a more extensive knowledge base for drugs policy and international cooperation. Spain\u2019s priorities included the expansion of information and data in the field of drugs, cooperation between the EU and the LAC countries, and law enforcement cooperation in particular on the use of non-commercial aviation by criminal organisations for drug trafficking. During the Czech Presidency, the Council adopted Conclusions on the development and implementation of indicators in the field of drug supply (9634/09; CORDROGUE 26; 8.5.2009), under Action 67 of the EU Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012. During the Swedish Presidency, the Council adopted Conclusions on the promotion of universal prevention programmes (11818/2/09; CORDROGUE 48, 4.9.2009), on strengthening the fight against drug trafficking in Western Africa (15248/09; CORDROGUE 69; 4.11.2009) and on strengthening EU research capacity on illicit drugs (15594/1/09 Rev1; CORDDROGUE 78; 26.11.2009). During the Spanish Presidency the Council adopted Conclusions on information systems on drugs (5876/10Rev1; CORDROGUE 21; 29.1.2010) and on t he threat assessment of airfields and medium, small-size and light aircrafts that can be used for drug trafficking (10328/10; CORDROGUE 53; 28.5.2010). The Presidencies regularly ensured feedback to the Horizontal Drugs Group on the drug-related activities of other working groups, notably the Multi-Disciplinary Group on Organised Crime (MDG) , the Customs Cooperation Working Group (dealing with drug precursors) and the Standing Committee on Internal Security (COSI) . 3. The Commission and Council to ensure coherence between internal and external drugs policy COM Council Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), the preparation of a Commission Communication on coherence between internal and external drugs policy has been postponed to 2012. 4. The Council to examine the state of the drug problem once a year, on the basis of the Commission\u2019s annual progress review, relevant reports from Council COM Presenting together the different strands of information from the Commission, EMCDDA, Europol and other agencies such as Eurojust enables the Council to obtain coherent and coordinated insight into the main developments and challenges in the field of drugs each year. 2 2009/1: Czech Republic; 2009/2: Sweden; 2010/1: Spain.

Presidency to convene meetings of the national drugs coordinators or their equivalents on a regular basis to advance coordination on specific and urgent issues requiring action. The coordinators to be invited to contribute to the Council\u2019s annual examination of the state of the drugs problem (see action 4 above) PRES MS During the Czech, Swedish and Spanish Presidencies, meetings were organised between the national drug coordinators (NDC). The Czech Presidency focused on two topics during the NDC meeting in April 2009: Drugs Policy Coordination and Migration, Integration and Drugs . The coordinators concluded that the exchange of experience and good practices in the field of drugs policy coordination needs to be encouraged and that action plans should include a cost-benefit analysis and have a proper financial basis. Moreover, they pointed out that migration requires special attention as in several countries specific migrant groups and national minority groups run a particular risk of developing drug problems. The Swedish Presidency devoted the NDC meeting in November 2009 to the prevention or delay of first use of illicit drugs among young people . The Spanish Presidency addressed poly-drug use in the EU , with an emphasis on alcohol use . The coordinators concluded that the EU should examine whether a more holistic policy dealing with all psychoactive substances could be developed, taking into account the important links between illicit and licit drug use and the related problems related. Objective 3. Ensure effective coordination at national level 6. Taking into account the work on Drugs coordination mechanisms in all EU Member States made by EMCDDA, Member States to examine inter-departmental coordination on drugs to ensure that coordinated positions are presented at EU level and that the objectives of the EU Action Plan are relayed to the most effective implementing level MS All EU Member States have a drug coordination mechanism and most of these have three main components: \u2013 A strategic inter-ministerial board, commission, committee, council or coordination group on drugs, which defines the general framework for drugs policy and adopts the national drug strategies and action plans. Usually this body includes all or most ministries and government departments concerned with drug-related matters. Experts and regional authorities are in some cases also members of these coordination bodies. \u2013 An operative body, which can be the secretariat of the inter-ministerial body, a national drug coordinator, a national drugs agency or drug strategy team and/or a department in a given ministry (mostly the Ministry of Health).

        "EN 7 EN implementation of drug-related interventions. At EU level, there are several Council working parties and management boards of agencies dealing with illicit drugs policies where Member States are represented. In addition, Member States are represented in several international structures and platforms (UNODC, CND, UNAIDS) that deal with different aspects of the drug phenomenon. For this annual assessment, the Commission asked Member States to report on how their positions on drugs policy in international organisations and in EU structures are coordinated at national level. A large number of Member States 3 indicated that their positions in different Council Working Parties and in UN organisations are coordinated through inter-ministerial structures. Seven Member States 4 indicated that one specific department may be responsible for the coordination of national drugs policy and that positions at EU and international level are coordinated on an ad-hoc basis. In some cases, working groups dealing with EU affairs have been set up within such coordinating departments. In Finland, a specific EU interdepartmental drug working group has been set up, while the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs may set up a specific working group on EU affairs in the field of drugs. In France and Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the leading role in coordinating positions on drugs in the various bodies. In Latvia and Lithuania, specific mechanisms have been set up to coordinate positions in the EU, but not specifically related to drugs. Regarding coordination in international organisations such as the Council of Europe\u2019s Pompidou Group and UN bodies, in most Member States, the national drug coordination mechanisms are in charge of preparing positions, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is often also structurally part of these mechanisms. For the coordination of positions in e.g. WHO and UNAIDS, the picture is more fragmented, as these organisations address a variety of issues other than drugs. In countries such as France, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs takes the lead, but coordinates positions with the inter-ministerial drug coordination structure. In Germany and Hungary, the coordination of international positions involves government agencies and civil society organisations. Objective 4. Ensure the participation of civil society in drugs policy 7. The Commission to seek at least once a year feedback on drugs policy COM The third meeting of the EU Civil Society Forum on Drugs (CSF) was held in Brussels 3-4 March 2009. A number of issues were addressed at this meeting, including the EU Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012, 3 Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. 4 Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Poland and Sweden.

It was agreed that the CSF members would actively participate in establishing the agenda on drugs policy, with the help of a core group of its members, which is to meet in between the official gatherings of the Forum. The next meeting of the CSF will be held by the end of 2010 and will discuss a possible input to the drafting of the new EU Drugs Strategy. An open call for applications to renew membership of the Forum will be launched in the second half of 2010. 8. The Commission to launch an initiative, 'The European Alliance on Drugs', inviting civil society organisations across the EU (including e.g. schools, commercial enterprises, public bodies and NGOs) to participate in a common framework designed to create public commitment about and to take action on drug problems in society. COM The title \u2018European Alliance on Drugs\u2019 was changed into the \u2018European Action on Drugs\u2019 (EAD) to better reflect its mission: to engage civil society in concrete action to address illicit drugs and their potential risks. The awareness-raising campaign aims to involve individuals and groups, whose commitment to action may then have a multiplier effect among other groups in society. The actors involved include municipalities, media, clubs, schools, parent and youth associations, and companies. The campaign provides a platform 6 and networking opportunities for civil-society bodies in the Member States. In addition, several events bringing together campaign participants are organised each year in the Member States and in Brussels. The EAD was launched by Jacques Barrot, Vice-President in charge of Justice, Freedom and Security at a high-profile event on 26 June 2009 (World Drugs Day) and national events were held subsequently in Rome (2009), Berlin (2010) and London (2010). The 2010 annual EAD event took place on 25 June in Brussels, focusing on the prevention of drug-related crime among young people and bringing together personalities from the worlds of sports and entertainment to share their experiences on drugs. Viviane Reding, Commission Vice-President in charge of justice, opened the event via a pre-recorded speech. To date, around 700 individuals and organisations from civil society have engaged in the EAD campaign. An independent evaluation of the campaign will be launched towards the end of 2010. 9. Member States to involve civil society at all appropriate levels of drugs policy, in accordance with COM MS The ongoing reporting in this area seems to suggest an increasing involvement of civil society in drugs policy within the Member States in recent years.

D RUG DEMAND REDUCTION ( OBJECTIVES 5-10) Priority defined in the Drugs Action Plan 2009-2012: We need to further improve the effectiveness of measures to reduce drug use and its consequences by improving the coverage, quality and effectiveness of demand reduction interventions, i.e. prevention, treatment and harm reduction. This includes particular attention to vulnerable groups and the prevention of poly-drug use (combined use of illicit and licit substances, including alcohol, volatile substances and tobacco). DRUG DEMAND REDUCTION Objective Responsible party State of play Objective 5. Prevent the use of drugs and the risks associated with it 10. To promote innovation in and systematically make available evidence-based and evaluated universal prevention programmes and interventions in different settings (e.g. towards young people in youth centres, and schools and towards adults in workplace and prison), aiming to prevent or delay first use of drugs. Prevention should also cover poly-drug use (combined use of illicit and licit substances, in particular alcohol) as well as drugs and driving MS The EMCDDA has recently reviewed current evidence regarding universal prevention in school settings 11 . School-based programmes working with social influence principles have been found to have positive effects on young people\u2019s drug use. Life skills-focused programmes also have beneficial effects on both mediating variables (e.g. self-esteem, peer pressure resistance) and substance use. However, some reviews have raised concerns regarding the existing evaluations and concluded that effectiveness may be overstated. The effects of knowledge-focused programmes on behaviour change are very limited. The research evidence for the effectiveness of school-based programmes through the involvement of peers is inconclusive. Programmes that include booster sessions appear more effective. Interactive programmes have preventive effects on consumption behaviour (for tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and other illegal drugs) and are \u2018statistically superior\u2019 to non-interactive interventions in preventing drug use. In 2007, EU Member States provided qualitative data on universal prevention in their country with expert ratings of the level of provision and the policy importance of different types of intervention. Follow-up data will be collected in 2010. According to the 2007 data, a wide variety of prevention interventions were implemented in European schools with very different levels of provision. Overall, these data showed that most pupils took part in programmes without evidence-based content (information provision and effective 11 http://emcdda.europa.eu/themes/best-practice/evidence/universal-prevention.

Information provided by the National Focal Points in 2008 and 2009 mentioned mainly one-off and isolated prevention interventions, with few evidence-based and evaluated programmes. In conclusion, there seems to be no indication that evidence-based and evaluated programmes and strategies, including those targeting first use, are used more often in Member States. Objective 6. Prevent high risk behaviour of drug users \u2014 including injecting drug users \u2014 through targeted prevention 11. To further develop early detection and intervention techniques and implement effective, evaluated selective prevention for vulnerable groups at high risk of developing drug problems, including injecting drug use MS In 2007, EU Member States provided qualitative data on selective prevention with expert ratings of the level of provision and the policy importance of different types of interventions. Follow-up data will be collected in 2010. According to the 2007 data, there is limited provision of selective prevention in Europe, with most interventions targeting young offenders, vulnerable families and ethnic groups. The data indicate that the coverage of selective prevention has not increased in recent years. Information provided by the National Focal Points in 2008 and 2009 highlighted recently implemented selective prevention interventions for ethnic groups in Belgium, Luxembourg and Hungary. FRED 12 , a systematic intervention protocol for young offenders in Germany, is being implemented with EU support in 15 other Member States 13 . Interventions based on the Strengthening Families model \u2014 an evidence-based parenting intervention for vulnerable families \u2014 have been implemented and evaluated in Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden. Overall trends in drug use are unlikely to reflect directly the impact of selective prevention interventions in Europe, as many other factors influence the numbers and characteristics of (problem) drug users. Information on the time lag between the age at which drug users enter drug treatment for the first time and the age at which they first used drugs might be an indicator of early intervention needs, a measure to assess whether early intervention programmes are achieving the objective of bringing (problem) drug users into services earlier. For clients who entered treatment for the first time in 2008, around 42 % started to use their main drug between the ages of 15 and 19, and 17 % before the age of 15 \u2014 regardless of the type of drug. For clients with cannabis as their primary drug, 39 % started to use the drug before the age of 15. Currently, for new outpatient clients, the average time lag between first use of primary drug and first treatment request is around 9 years 14 . This differs by main drug of use and gender. A multiannual dataset, making longer- term trends visible for this indicator, is not yet available. 12 http://www.lwl.org/LWL/Jugend/lwl_ks/Projekte_KS1/Fgn-english/?lang=en. 13 Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, United Kingdom. 14 The \u2018primary drug\u2019 means the drug for which treatment is requested.

Overall, the number of reported interventions is low but they are more often evaluated and evidence-based than is the case in other areas of prevention. In 2008, the EMCDDA commissioned a study on indicated prevention 17 , including a literature review that identified six programmes (four of which are being assessed as \u2018best practice\u2019), and a data collection exercise in Member States that identified 23 programmes (three of which were \u2018best practice\u2019, i.e. compatible with EDDRA 18 criteria). Another survey on internet-based counselling and treatment interventions 19 found several internet-based drug treatment interventions, designed for cannabis, cocaine and \u2018club drug\u2019 (e.g. ecstasy) users. Four targeted young adults and adolescents, three were counsellor- guided and one was a fully automated self-help programme. Only one programme, \u2018Quit the shit\u2019 (QTS) in Germany, was evaluated for effectiveness. In the first half of 2010, an EU-led project targeting recreational drug use in nightlife settings, \u2018Healthy Nightlife Toolbox\u2019 20 , was completed. As part of this project, a website provides information on a range of prevention programmes and projects targeting recreational drug use, which have been critically reviewed and classified according to strength of evidence information.

Among all studies, only naltrexone was associated with a significant benefit in terms of use reduction. In a clinical study, the addition of contingency management improved the results compared to treatment alone. Few studies have assessed the effectiveness of interventions for cannabis users, despite the increase in the demand for treatment. According to estimates using information from different sources, at least one million people received drug- related treatment in Europe in 2007, most receiving opioid substitution treatment. Opioid substitution treatment was provided to around 670 000 opioid users in 2008. Availability of this type of treatment has risen tenfold since 1993 in the EU, an increase which has been facilitated in several countries by involving general practitioners, alongside specialist facilities, in delivery. As part of the survey conducted in preparation of this annual assessment, the Commission asked the Member States what action had been taken to monitor and/ or evaluate the effectiveness of drug treatment in the past two to three years. Of the 23 countries that provided information, three 21 indicated that no such action had been undertaken recently. Four 22 reported that ad-hoc evaluations were being carried out (on individual programmes), but not structurally at national level.

Five Member States 27 reported that the implementation of evidence-based programmes was an ongoing process, but not necessarily based on scientific grounds alone (Austria) and also involved the need to convince professionals to pursue an evaluation culture in their work (Italy). Seven Member States 28 reported that they had undertaken specific action to implement evidence-based treatment, mostly by developing and implementing treatment guidelines. Finally, the survey also asked whether Member States had made the application of evidence-based guidelines for drug treatment a precondition for public funding of treatment services. Of the 20 Member States that answered this question, 13 29 indicated that this was not a precondition as such. For Germany, this was because services are often not publicly funded but are financed by e.g. insurance companies. However, Germany did report an increased use of evidence-based guidelines. In Sweden, local authorities that purchase drug treatment services will most likely include quality criteria in their orders. In Denmark and the UK, evidence-based drug treatment is not a direct precondition, but often part of broader good practice guidelines and rules for medical services. Finally, in five Member States 30 , the delivery of evidence-based treatment is a precondition for public funding. 14. To deliver existing and develop innovative rehabilitation and social re- integration programmes that have measurable outcomes MS One way to identify both the need for and impact of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes is to follow changes in the demographic profile of clients entering treatment. Treatment clients are characterised by disadvantaged social conditions. Data on clients entering outpatient drug treatment in the EU in 2008 found: \u2013 low levels of education (only 38 % had completed primary education and 2 % had not completed obligatory schooling); \u2013 precarious living situations (9 % were living in unstable accommodation, most being homeless); \u2013 high levels of unemployment (35 % were unemployed and 12 % economically inactive). Social reintegration programmes may include vocational counselling, work placements and housing support. Prison-based interventions, which have an impact on relapse and re-offending, may link inmates to community-based housing and social support services in preparation for their release. Information is scarce on the availability and coverage of social reintegration interventions in the Member States, the target groups they address and their outcomes.

To publicise, where appropriate the existence of treatment and rehabilitation services and the variety of options these services offer at national, regional and local level for potential target audiences MS In 2010, the EMCDDA conducted a survey among National Focal Points in order to assess the availability of public registers (e.g. internet portals) informing the public of the existence of treatment and rehabilitation services and the options these services offer at national, regional and local level. The survey found that public registers were available in all 25 responding EU Member States. In most countries, they provide national coverage of available treatment facilities and programmes, with a regional breakdown. In some cases they allow the public to search for specific treatment programmes by drug, target group (e.g. gender-specific, age-related), type of programme (e.g. outpatient or residential), costs, etc. In all reporting countries, these registers are accessible via the internet and in most cases on the website of the national treatment agencies or another relevant national health agency. In some cases, the list of facilities can be downloaded. Almost half of the countries also provide maps to facilitate geographical searching of available treatment and rehabilitation programmes. These public registers are also available to the public in the EMCDDA\u2019s national drug treatment profiles for each respective country. These are available online and are among the first hits in all popular search engines (only available in English). (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/responses/treatment-overviews). As part of the survey conducted among Member States in preparation of this annual assessment report, the Commission asked Member States about the \u2018channels\u2019 through which potential users of drug treatment services are made aware of the existence and availability of such services, apart from the internet. Nineteen out of 24 responding countries mention family doctors while 21 countries point to outreach services and government information services. In 22 countries, telephone help lines as well as family and friends play an important role. In 17 countries, drug treatment service providers advertise their services directly, while in 14 Member States public awareness campaigns draw attention to the availability of services. In Cyprus, potential clients are also referred to services by schools or the army. In Denmark and Germany, social welfare services play a role, while in Germany and Spain hospital (emergency) departments refer clients to services as well.

To develop, implement and exchange good practice guidelines/quality standards for prevention, treatment, harm reduction and rehabilitation interventions and services MS COM EMCDDA The development, implementation and exchange of good practice guidelines and quality standards in the field of drug demand reduction is primarily a task of national authorities and service providers in this area. However, such guidelines and quality standards are not common practice in most Member States. A study commissioned by the EMCDDA, aiming to identify existing guidelines in Member States in the field of drug treatment , found out that 72 sets of guidelines existed in the 27 reporting countries. Most common were guidelines covering psychosocial interventions (n=29); substitution treatment (n=28), and detoxification (n=22). Countries with higher rates of patients in oral substitution treatment were more likely to have treatment guidelines. Many guidelines targeted professionals (58), service providers (52) and health-care planners (25) as end users. Seventeen countries involved relevant professionals in expert groups to develop the guidelines, nine countries involved a researcher, four countries involved \u2018other\u2019 unspecified professionals, three countries involved politicians and one country involved clients. The study also found that guidelines were usually mandatory for opioid substitution treatment, and in approximately half of the responding countries guidelines are required in order to obtain authorisation to operate a treatment centre. 18. Member States to survey the availability and effectiveness of prevention, treatment, harm reduction and rehabilitation services, in responding to specific needs, on the basis of a methodological framework to be developed by the Commission - with the support of the EMCDDA - and that is compatible with existing methodologies MS COM EMCDDA Although the provision of drug demand reduction services is the responsibility of the Member States, EMCDDA reports as well as the final evaluation report on the EU Drugs Action Plan 2005-2008 show that the link is often unclear between the availability, accessibility and delivery of drug demand reduction services and actual needs in society. In preparation of this annual assessment, the Commission asked the Member States to indicate whether they had conducted a national survey to assess the availability, coverage and effectiveness of demand reduction services in the past three years. Of the 24 countries responding, eight 32 indicated that no such survey had been carried out recently. Malta indicated that a survey was underway, while Denmark pointed out that the delivery of demand reduction services is decentralised to local social services. Some specific areas were surveyed nationally though, e.g. hepatitis C provision. Finland indicated that surveys had been carried out to map available services, but this did not necessarily include coverage or the link with potential needs.

In addition, with Structural Fund support, a pilot project had been launched in four regions to assess the need for and corresponding availability of demand reduction services with the aim of improving provision. In Ireland, an inventory for needle and syringe exchange was conducted, while in Lithuania an assessment of needs and matching availability was conducted structurally on the basis of the number of users applying for services. In Luxembourg a dedicated working group had been set up to assess demand-reduction needs, while in Portugal a gap analysis had been conducted in 2007. In Sweden, needs assessments primarily covered the field of prevention, while in the UK such assessments were the task of local services, supported by the National Treatment Agency. In the UK, specific attention was devoted to matching the treatment needs of young people and available services. The Member States were also asked how the planning authorities in their countries allocated resources to the various drug treatment and harm reduction services, if surveys of coverage and availability were not conducted on a regular basis. Many of the 19 Member States 34 that responded to this question indicated that national indicators were used, such as the EMCDDA Key Indicators (e.g. Treatment Demand, Problem Drug Use). In Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Spain and the UK, statistical data are often supplemented by expert estimations and needs assessments at local level. In Germany and Poland, services are mostly provided by private drug services and/or NGOs who estimate the needs and apply for funding. 19.

The project aims to produce a set of evidence-based drug prevention standards for use in the EU. In 2010, the Commission made funding available for the study \u2018EU Consensus on minimum quality standards and benchmarks in drug demand reduction 36 , as preparatory work for a Commission proposal for a Council Recommendation in this field by 2012.

To develop, as appropriate, services for minorities, including, for example, migrants MS In 2007, EU Member States provided qualitative data on selective prevention with expert ratings of the level of provision and the policy importance of different types of interventions, including those targeting specific minority groups in society. Follow-up data will be collected in 2011. According to the 2007 data, three countries reported the provision of prevention interventions for immigrants, in locations with sufficient numbers of the target population, while 11 countries reported no or rare provision or did not have information. Four countries reported provision for ethnic groups, while ten countries reported no or rare provision or did not have information. More recent information provided by the National Focal Points in 2008 and 2009 mentioned interventions for ethnic groups in Belgium, Luxembourg, Hungary, Romania (low coverage) and Italy. No evaluated interventions for ethnic groups have been recorded in the EMCDDA\u2019s EDDRA database since 2008. In 2008, eight countries 37 reported specific drug treatment programmes for minorities and ethnic groups, with different levels of provision. Only Greece reported that specialised programmes were available to nearly all drug-using members of ethnic groups who actively seek treatment. In three countries, national experts estimated that specialist treatment for these groups is available to less than half of users seeking it, while in four countries only a few could obtain treatment. National experts from 17 Member States 37 Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, Italy, Slovenia, Finland and UK. ",

Denmark and Ireland had no information and two countries 38 did not respond to the survey. Only Italy and Greece reported that treatment programmes were available for undocumented migrants. In 2008 gender-specific treatment programmes were reported in 16 EU Member States, and in four countries such programmes specifically targeted addicted pregnant women and their children. However, national experts rated the availability of these programmes as \u2018limited to rare\u2019 in most countries, i.e. only a minority of women in need would actually obtain treatment. Nine countries had no gender-specific treatment programmes. Children and adolescents are the most common target groups addressed by specialised treatment programmes in Europe. In 24 EU Member States, a variety of interventions are being implemented at both outpatient and inpatient level. National experts in six countries considered the provision of these programmes as extensive to full, i.e. the majority of children or adolescents in need would obtain treatment. In the remaining 18 countries, however, only a minority of the target group have access to treatment. Only one country reported no specific treatment programmes for children/adolescents. Objective 9. Provide access to health care for drug users in prison to prevent and reduce health-related harm associated with drug abuse 21. To develop and implement prevention, treatment, harm reduction and rehabilitation services for people in prison, equivalent to services available outside prison. Particular emphasis to be placed on follow-up care after release from prison. MS The general principle of equivalence of care for prisoners compared to services for people outside prison is widely recognised by EU Member States. Objectives for drug-related services in prison are part of an increasing number of national drug strategies and drug action plans, targeting among other things the improvement of the quality and continuity of prison treatment and care. Some Member States have specific health and drug strategies for the prison system 39 . Information about the availability and level of provision of specific health measures, based on expert sources, shows that services for inmates with drug problems are provided in all Member States in at least some prisons, but they generally reach few prisoners. On the basis of data available to the EMCDDA, commonly available interventions include infectious- disease risk counselling (in all EU prison systems), and hepatitis C testing, which is routinely offered upon prison entry in at least 22 countries. Thirteen countries report that prison staff receive drug-specific training, twelve countries provide hepatitis B vaccination programmes and seven countries have developed 38 Malta and Sweden. 39 Spain and Luxembourg.

The provision of information material on drugs and health issues and the treatment of drug dependence, including detoxification, drug-free treatment as well as opioid substitution treatment, are widespread across the EU. Since 2006, opioid substitution treatment has been introduced in prison in another six European countries 40 . In most countries, official regulations allow both the continuation in prison of opioid substitution treatment started in the community and the initiation of treatment inside prison. In five EU countries, substitution treatment is currently not available to prisoners. The level of provision of opioid substitution treatment is variable and often depends on local conditions, but a link seems to exist between coverage in prisons and the scaling up of treatment in the community. Drug use continues to be more prevalent among prisoners than among the general population. Drug use and regular drug use in the month before imprisonment was reported by small proportions of respondents (1 % and 3 %, respectively) in some countries and by a clear majority in others (58 % and 77 %). Studies also indicate that the most harmful forms of drug use may be more frequent among prisoners, with between 6 % and 38 % of those surveyed reported having injected drugs at some time. On admission to prison, most users reduce or stop consuming drugs, mainly due to problems in acquiring the substances. However, experts and policymakers in the EU admit that illicit drugs find their way into most prisons, despite all the measures taken to reduce their supply. Studies carried out since 2003 show that drug use in prison is reported by 1 % to 56 % of inmates. Injecting drug users in custody appear to share their equipment more often than users not in prison. This raises questions about the potential spread of infectious diseases among the prison population. 22. Member States to endorse and implement in prison settings indicators to monitor drug use, drug-related health problems and drug services delivery on the basis of a methodological framework developed by the Commission \u2013 with the support MS COM EMCDDA In many European countries the number of prisoners has dramatically increased over the past two decades. More than 600 000 people are incarcerated 41 in the 27 EU Member States on a given day. At the same time, only limited information is available on drug use, drug-related health problems and drug services delivery in the EU Member States. Over the years, the EMCDDA has developed a number of instruments to provide information on drug use in prison. These include specific sections in the National Reports, but also standard tables and structured questionnaires to collect data on prevalence of drug use and drug use patterns among prisoners, data on 40 In 2006 in prisons in Poland, Sweden and the Czech Republic, and in 2008 in Bulgaria, Estonia and Romania. 41 European Commission (EUROSTAT) \u2014 Statistics in Focus \u2014 Crime and Criminal Justice, 36/2009; total prison population in the EU27 in 2006.

Despite this broad range of data sources, the reported information is often still scarce and fragmented, among other things due to a lack of uniform monitoring mechanisms in prison settings within Member States and at EU level. As part of this Drugs Action Plan, the EMCDDA will work on the definition and implementation of a prison monitoring strategy with the aim of filling information gaps, harmonising the existing data collection tools, and improving data and information comparability.

Among the main interventions with proven effectiveness in preventing drug-related harm are opioid substitution treatment and needle and syringe exchange programmes. Responses to the spread of infectious diseases among drug users include: drug treatment, particularly opioid substitution treatment; the provision of sterile injection equipment; community-based activities that provide information and safer-use education; condom promotion among injecting drug users; infectious disease testing and counselling; antiretroviral treatment; and vaccination against viral hepatitis. Around 40 million syringes per year are distributed through specialised programmes. This is equivalent to an average of 80 syringes per injecting drug user in the 25 countries reporting syringe data.

In general, harm reduction policies and interventions in the EU have progressed, but major differences exist between countries in the level of implementation of specific measures, reflecting their individual drug situation as well as policy priorities. HIV infection rates are generally falling in the EU, following a peak in 2001-2002. HIV prevalence monitoring data in samples of injecting drug users are available from 23 countries over the period 2003\u2013 2008. In 16 countries, HIV prevalence remained unchanged, while in six countries it decreased. HCV prevalence is reported to be declining in nine countries and increasing in three others. During the period 1995\u20132007, between 6 400 and 8 500 drug-induced deaths were reported each year in Europe. Among Europeans aged 15\u201339 years, drug overdoses accounted for 4 % of all deaths. Areas with a higher prevalence of problem drug use can be disproportionally affected. Between 2000 and 2003, most EU Member States reported a decrease in drug-induced deaths \u2014 the total number declined by 23 %. In subsequent years, the number stabilised at 6 500 to 7 000 per year. Preliminary data available for 2008 suggest an overall figure at least equal to that for the previous year and possibly a rise of as much as 5 %, with increases reported by 12 out of 19 countries where a comparison was possible. Indications seem to suggest that more overdose deaths are occurring because of cocaine use. Mortality rates for drug users are roughly 10 to 20 times higher than those of same age group in the general population. Generally, the main cause of death among problem drug users is drug overdose, accounting for up to 50\u201360 % of deaths among injectors in countries with a low prevalence of HIV/AIDS.

To target criminal organisations and emerging threats, using an intelligence-led approach (based on the European Criminal Intelligence Model (ECIM) methodology) that prioritises the criminal networks and markets that pose the most serious threats MS Europol Eurojust Council Every year, the Council adopts Conclusions regarding the priorities for the fight against organised crime. These priorities are largely based on the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA) published by Europol. According to the European Criminal Intelligence Model (ECIM), the OCTA findings should inform the Intelligence Requirement (IR) for the next OCTA. The IR directs intelligence data collection in the Member States. Apart from the OCTA findings, the IR should also take into consideration emerging threats that are based on criminal environment scans. The data collected through the IR are submitted to Europol, which acts as the central analysis capability in the EU, enabling it to produce more specific, regional or commodity-oriented Threat Assessments, and identify top-level criminal networks in the EU, in line with the priorities set by the Council. These top-level criminal networks are then targeted with EU-level resources such as COSPOL 45 , Joint Investigation Teams (JITs), Joint Customs Operations (JCOs), with the support of Eurojust where necessary. Information from investigations and operations should be submitted to Europol to feed into the next OCTA and for other 45 Comprehensive Operational Strategic Planning for the Police ; the objective of COSPOL projects is to facilitate best use of information at EU level, to identify opportunities for operational projects and to solve barriers in day-to-day cooperation by making use of existing tools, in particular Europol\u2019s analytical capacities.

In future, the aim is for the priorities to be set by the Council on the basis of the OCTA, which will influence more directly the planning of operational cooperation in the area of justice, freedom and home affairs in the EU. The establishment of COSI may help achieve this objective, as COSI will set the priorities for COSPOL, which is to become an operational arm of COSI. The OCTA priorities and Europol\u2019s identification of top-level criminal networks based on these priorities should in the future inform COSI\u2019s planning of operational cooperation. 25. Multidisciplinary law enforcement operations, involving Europol and Eurojust, as well as police, customs and border control services, will be used to a greater extent through bilateral and multilateral cooperation initiatives, joint investigation teams (JIT) and joint customs operations (JCO). Member States will examine which measures are possible to facilitate and speed up the process and encourage greater use of these instruments in drugs cases MS Europol Eurojust Europol, in cooperation with Eurojust, has continued to support the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) experts network. In 2009 the experts network focused, among other things, on updating the JIT model agreement 46 , which was approved by the Council in early 2010. The new model agreement now includes a JIT model arrangement for cooperation with Europol and a new operational action plan. The 2010 meeting of the experts network will focus on funding possibilities for EU Member States to set up JITs and exchange best practices on how to reduce the costs of JITs. Europol has continued to provide training for its staff and for Member State liaison officers involved in setting up and running JITs. Eurojust was invited to the training to present its support functionalities for JITs. Europol has continued to provide support for JIT courses based on CEPOL learning tools. In addition to practical support (analysis, expertise and on-the-spot support for Member States) Europol also provides support, via its legal service, in the drafting of JIT agreements and assesses JIT arrangements. JITs are supposed to provide a suitable tool to combat serious international crime at Member State level. Europol encourages Member States to set up JITs at awareness events and in its day-to-day dealings with national experts. However, the final decision to set up a JIT remains the responsibility of the Member States. Member States work together in multidisciplinary law enforcement operations. They contribute to Europol\u2019s activities in the field of drugs, among other things by contributing to Analysis Work Files (AWFs).

The Manual supplements the existing Eurojust/Europol document \u2018Guide to EU Member States Legislation on Joint Investigation Teams\u2019 . The main goal of the manual is to inform practitioners about the legal basis and requirements for setting up a JIT and to provide advice on when a JIT can be usefully employed. Member States increasingly use Europol as a facilitator/coordinator in ongoing intelligence projects for combating drug/heroin trafficking and its illegal production. AWF Heroin was not involved in any JCO or JIT during the reporting period, although the project has supported a number of live investigations run by Member States\u2019 law enforcement teams, such as the West African anti-drugs trafficking network initiative, operations against trafficking in acetic anhydride (a key precursor for the manufacturing of heroin), and the COSPOL Project on heroin trafficking (high-value targets). Overall, the quantity and quality of contributions has improved notably since the Opening Order was amended in December 2008. However, there is still room for improvement in the area of cooperation with Europol: in particular, the Member States need to be more pro-active in initiating new sub-projects, sharing live intelligence and involving Europol in JITs. Synthetic drug investigations are supported by Europol\u2019s Project SYNERGY. In 2009 and 2010, no JITs or JCOs were supported by SYNERGY. In general, the involvement of Member States in the project varies. While several key partners participate in most large-scale multilateral cases, the involvement of other countries is limited to a few specific cases. 27.

Furthermore, some lead Member States have failed to devote resources or planning to the COSPOL Cocaine project, hampering the development of key intelligence lines and the targeting of upstream traffickers. In addition, many of the forerunner Member States have indicated that prosecutors in their countries refuse to share information collected during investigations. In order for AWF COLA to function properly, the data provided to it need to be up-to-date and include information on ongoing investigations, otherwise the AWF is at risk of becoming obsolete. Finally, awareness needs to be raised that major drug seizure locations in the EU should be considered as normal crime scenes and made subject to forensic examination. The COSPOL project on heroin trafficking aims to identify and dismantle transnational criminal organisations involved in international heroin trafficking from Afghanistan to the EU, in particular Turkish organisations and associated groups, using existing instruments, e.g. Europol analytical support for Project Heroin. COSPOL was initially set up to encourage support for the AWFs. Participation in the COSPOL project on heroin should be aligned with Member States\u2019 participation in Europol AWFs that support developing investigations. In 2010 there was an increase in the number of contributions under the COSPOL umbrella to AWF Heroin, offering the possibility of meaningful intelligence developments. HVTs engaged in trafficking heroin to the European illegal drugs market have been identified in the AWF. Details of more than 80 HVTs have been submitted to AWF Heroin by five COSPOL Member States.

A barrier model is under development in which Member States and Europol work together to create so-called barriers in the drug-supply logistic chain targeting the acquisition of precursors and other chemicals, hardware and production or storage places, along with the production of drugs, the dumping of waste, and retail sales. The third objective is ongoing and has already achieved significant operational results. On the basis of the information submitted by the Member States, Europol has introduced a methodology and ranked 64 HVTs. Based on the Europol ranking and ongoing inquiries in several Member States, one HVT was selected for joint investigation and subsequently arrested with six other associates. Four other HVTs were selected for potential targeting. While the overall intelligence contributions by COSPOL members to AWF Synergy need to be improved, particularly from crucial key partners (e.g. LT, PL and UK), in the case of specific operations, Europol appreciates the high-level commitment from concerned MS (e.g. BE, DE and NL). Project Cannabis was established in March 2010. In parallel, the European Expert Group on Cannabis has been created to provide expertise to the Project. The experts have therefore concluded that no COSPOL project is necessary to support this drug-related project. 29. To make more systematic use of Member State liaison officers and liaison magistrates, where appropriate, in third countries for the exchange of information and intelligence between MS law enforcement agencies and Europol taking into account the Council Decision 2003/170/JHA of the 27th February 2003 on the common use of liaison officers posted abroad by the law enforcement agencies of the Member States in the version of 24th July 2006, Council Decision 2006/560/JHA MS Europol Eurojust Specific liaison officer meetings took place in 2009 and in the first half of 2010, some of which also concerned cooperation in the field of drugs. In March 2009 a bilateral liaison officers meeting in Russia focused on the outcomes of work conducted by three working groups, namely on drugs, on cybercrime and on counterfeit goods. These groups aim to enhance cooperation with the Russian authorities, share technical or operational information and exchange plans for strategic cooperation. In November 2009, at another bilateral liaison officers meeting in Russia, the Russian delegates made several positive comments on the improved cooperation with Europol via EU Member States with regard to money counterfeiting cases and drugs investigations. The limitations of a pending operational agreement with Europol were also discussed. Europol praised the good cooperation with Russia under the existing strategic agreement (limited to training, awareness and exchange of non-personal information). In March 2010, a liaison officers meeting took place in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. EU liaison officers participated and discussed the enhancement of cooperation with Colombia, with reference to the upcoming signature of an operational cooperation agreement and the possibility of using Colombia as a gateway for the exchange of information with Latin America via Ameripol. 30.

EDPS, as a law enforcement-led project, is expected to provide an extra tool for strengthening drug enforcement abilities to curb drug trafficking in Europe. With an initial focus on amphetamines profiling, which was the main focus of the forerunner projects CHAIN and SYNERGY, EDPS has the ambition to expand its range to the profiling of other synthetic drugs. Furthermore, EDPS countries have started working on a feasibility study to profile heroin and cocaine, which they expect to conclude in March 2011. In order to make good use of the EDPS, it is essential for the amphetamine profiling standards acquired within the CHAIN and SYNERGY projects to be applied to other drugs at EU level. The Western Australian Chemistry Centre owns the copyright on the profiling database, which is to be hosted by Europol according to the Council Conclusions on a European system for forensic drug profiling adopted in 2009 50 . The project has a budget of \u20ac 3.2 million for a duration of 36 months. Annual assessments are to provide a clear vision of the state of the project. Objective 12. Enhance effective judicial cooperation in the area of combating drug trafficking and law enforcement as regards production, trafficking of drugs and/or precursors, and money laundering related to this traffic 31. To encourage the full use of the existing EU instruments on mutual assistance requests in criminal matters, of European arrest warrants, and of sanctions issued by MS jurisdictions MS COM Eurojust In 2009, the Commission published its report on the implementation of Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking. Eurojust contributed to the Commission\u2019s report as regards judicial cooperation in the field of drugs. Eurojust\u2019s input was based on data from 2004 to 2008. During that period, 771 drug trafficking cases were submitted to Eurojust, rising from 77 in 2004 to 207 in 2007. As a consequence, the conclusion seems to be justified that judicial cooperation through Eurojust in the field of drug trafficking has improved. 33. To strengthen the cooperation among EU Member States in order to achieve the full application of the legal MS COM At EU level, there are two legal instruments to which the principle of mutual recognition of confiscation orders seems to apply. These instruments concern a) the freezing orders issued by a judicial authority for the purpose of securing evidence or subsequent confiscation of property 51 and b) confiscation orders issued 49 Sweden, Finland, Belgium, France, UK and Switzerland. 50 17024/09 CO EUR-PREP 3 JAI 896 POLGEN 229. 51 Council Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA of 22 July 2003 on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing property or evidence.

Both Council Framework Decisions provide for the Commission to produce a written report on the measures taken by Member States to comply with their provisions. The Commission adopted the implementation report on the first Framework Decision in December 2008 53 and the implementation report on the second Framework Decision is due in 2010. Both reports show that the implementation of these Framework Decisions adopted under the former \u2018third pillar\u2019 is not satisfactory. In regard to the Framework Decision on freezing orders, four Member States are yet to transpose it into national law while regarding the Framework Decision on confiscation orders, only 13 Member States have notified the Commission on implementation. 34. To support the establishment of effective Asset Recovery Offices in the Member States in accordance with the Council Decision 2007/845/JHA and to further support the Member States involved through the CARIN network. To support investigations through Europol and related Europol AWFs COM MS Europol Eurojust Since January 2009 the Commission has organised five meetings of an informal EU Asset Recovery Offices (ARO) Platform in order to enhance their cooperation and coordination at EU level. So far 23 Member States have established or designated Asset Recovery Offices 54 . While there are differences in the AROs\u2019 structure, mandate and access to information, asset tracing requests from Member States seem to have generally increased and response times seem to have shortened. Progress has also been made in the deployment of a secure channel of communication for the exchange of information between AROs. Twelve AROs have agreed to participate in a pilot project using Europol\u2019s Siena system. The pilot will end in September 2010. The Commission will adopt a report on the implementation of Council Decision 2007/845/JHA 55 by the end of 2010. Extensive use has been made of Commission funding programmes in this area, in particular the Specific Programme \u2018Prevention of and Fight against Crime 56 . The Commission has co-financed the activities of the CARIN Network in 2010 as well as the development of investigation methods and techniques in the field of asset recovery. Furthermore, a high-level pan-European conference on Asset Recovery Offices in the EU Member States will take place in December 2010. 52 Council Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA of 6 October 2006 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders. 53 COM(2008) 885 final. 54 The Commission has received 20 official notifications. 55 Council Decision 2007/845/JHA of 6 December 2007 concerning cooperation between Asset Recovery Offices of the Member States in the field of tracing and identification of proceeds from, or other property related to, crime. 56 Council Decision of 12 February 2007 establishing for the period 2007 to 2013, as part of the General Programme on Security and Safeguarding Liberties, the Specific Programme \u2018Prevention of and Fight against Crime\u2019.

        "EN 30 EN One problem identified in the implementation of this action concerns the lack of statistical information. For the years 2009 and 2009, no statistical data are available on investigations supported by the Europol Criminal Asset Bureau on drug-related criminal activities. Furthermore, not all Member States have statistics on the value of assets confiscated and recovered in connection with drug-related criminal activities, information which is crucial for assessing the added value of these cooperation instruments. Objective 13. Respond rapidly and effectively at operational, policy and political levels to emerging threats (e.g. emerging drugs, new routes) 35. To set up, where necessary, regional security platforms (e.g. MAOC-N, Baltic Sea TF) to counter emerging threats by means of coordinated operational responses. Such action to be compatible with existing legal and operational arrangements at EU level and based on specific threat assessments (see also action 42). New platforms should be set up without overlapping and be compatible with existing structures. MS Council Europol COM Following the model of MAOC-N and seeking to replicate its success in interdicting drugs in the Atlantic Ocean, ten Mediterranean Member States (including five EU Member States) have launched the Centre de Coordination pour la lutte anti-drogue en M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e (CeCLAD-M), which focuses on interdiction in the Mediterranean Sea. Based in Toulon, CeCLAD-M has been active in the Western Mediterranean mainly by targeting the smuggling of cannabis resin from Morocco. At the end of 2009, MAOC-N became a legal entity after its founding treaty was ratified by three contracting parties (Ireland, Portugal and France). An independent evaluation, presented in October 2009, concluded that over the past two years MAOC has had considerable success. Its achievements, in particular the coordination of drugs interdiction operations in the Atlantic, which led to the seizure of more than 43 tonnes of cocaine, illustrate the added value of sharing information and pooling assets to prevent drugs from reaching Europe. However, the evaluation pointed out that the sharing of information with Europol had to be improved. During the period under review for this annual assessment, MAOC-N has continued to hamper the shipment of cocaine from Latin America to Europe. However, seizures of illicit drugs in operations coordinated by MAOC-N and CeCLAD-M have declined over the past months. The main reason seems to be the high versatility of criminal networks, which have already established new trafficking routes to circumvent the law enforcement platforms. MAOC-N is now seeking to become active in West Africa, in order to gather more and better intelligence about traffickers\u2019 activities in this transit zone for Latin American cocaine bound for Europe. In 2010, under the Spanish Presidency, the JHA Council adopted two initiatives to improve the coordination of actions undertaken by Member States, the Commission, international organisations and third countries to fight illegal drug trafficking. In April, the JHA Council adopted the Action Oriented ",
        "EN 31 EN Paper: Strategic and concerted action to improve cooperation in combating organised crime, especially drug trafficking, originating in West Africa 57 and in June 2010 it endorsed the European Pact to combat international drug trafficking \u2014 disrupting cocaine and heroin routes 58 . The pact proposes a pragmatic division of tasks between Member States, as each can make a different contribution depending on what it is best equipped for. The pact has three parts, focusing on cocaine (in particular trafficking through WA), heroin (Western Balkans) and countering the proceeds of crime. Similar pacts covering synthetic drugs and cannabis are planned over the coming years. The practical implementation of the pact will follow a methodology based on the \u2018project-based approach\u2019 proposed by the Belgian Presidency. Under this approach, groups of volunteer countries should coordinate the implementation of the three parts of the pact. These groups will inform COSI about their work at least twice during each presidency and will inform the HDG as appropriate. COSI will report to the JHA Council once per presidency. While this approach is likely to enable flexible and speedy action to facilitate the implementation of the pact, it does pose challenges. From a political point of view, the risk of fragmentation should be avoided by carefully drafting the mandate of these project groups, which should not be able to pre-empt EU decisions. In addition, there is a coordination challenge that must be addressed, in order to ensure coherence between the work of these groups and that of Council working parties dealing with drugs matters. 36. The EU to focus on coordinated and joint efforts between the Member States and regions most highly exposed to particular drug production/trafficking phenomena, in cooperation with Europol as appropriate MS Europol Eurojust Council EU Member States have stepped up their efforts to coordinate anti-trafficking actions within and outside Europe. The setting up of MAOC-N in 2007 and then CeCLAD-M, which aim to stop drugs shipments before they reach European shores, marked a turning point in these efforts. In addition, groups of Member States set up in 2009 two intelligence-led cooperation platforms in Ghana (UK-led) and Senegal (led by France). These bring together law enforcement officers posted in the region by EU Member States, who share intelligence and/or coordinate operational and capacity-building activities. Under French leadership, Member States have created the Fontanot Group, which is an informal group gathering the heads of Police services in charge of technical cooperation, to coordinate non-operational cooperation (capacity building and training) in West Africa. A similar development is envisaged for the Western Balkan region. Europol is associated with these developments.

Optimal use to be made of Europol\u2019s Analytical Work File SYNERGY, its components 59 and the associated EJUP and COSPOL initiatives MS Europol Eurojust Project Synergy includes the Europol Illicit Laboratory Comparison System (EILCS) and the Europol Ecstasy Logo System (EELS), the latter incorporated within the general Europol Synthetic Drug System (ESDS). The EILCS collates detailed photographic and technical information on synthetic drug production, storage and dump sites, enabling the identification of matches between seized equipment, materials and chemicals, and the initiation of information exchange, backtracking investigations and forensic examination for the targeting of facilitators and criminal groups. The ESDS collates modus operandi, photographic information and basic forensic information on significant seizures, enabling the identification of matches between seizures or seized punches, and the initiation of information exchange, further investigations and forensic profiling for the targeting of criminal groups. Related criminal data arising from the findings of the ESDS and EILCS may be analysed within the AWF component. In 2009, 130 contributions were submitted by Member States to the EILCS (2008: 128 contributions). To date in 2010, 46 contributions have been received. This generated five Synergy technical/operational reports in 2009 and seven reports in 2010. Member States dismantled 96 illicit synthetic drug production sites in 2009. In previous years these numbers were relatively stable (2005: 90; 2006: 75; 2007: 91; 2008: 83). In 2010, Member States have so far reported the dismantling of 11 illicit synthetic drug production sites, but there may be a delay in reporting. In 2009, Project Synergy supported 244 bilateral and/or multilateral court cases, while in 2010 it has so far supported 120 cases. In 2009, 136 Synergy operational reports were delivered to support Member States, and 41 reports have so far been delivered in 2010.

The operational cooperation among the investigation authorities within the EU is to be supported by the EJUP cooperation framework and the Europol-AWF co-operation framework. This cooperation COM MS The EU strongly supports and actively participates in international operational cooperation, i.e. the INCB- led projects Cohesion and Prism. It is an active member of the Task Forces for both projects (DG TAXUD and OLAF). It has taken part in the voluntary international time-bound operations launched within these projects, i.e. Operations \u2018Crystal Flow\u2019 and \u2018PILA\u2019 under Project Prism, and Operation \u2018DICE\u2019 under Project Cohesion. These operations provide a strong and flexible approach to counter the ever-changing use of substitute/non-controlled substances and modus operandi of diversion techniques. During operations there has been an intense exchange of information between the INCB and the members of the Task Force. This has helped to identify a substantial number of diversion attempts, prevent deliveries and/or enable seizures of drug precursors.

Since 2009, however, EJUP\u2019s activities have significantly decreased and Project Synergy support has been requested on few occasions. Only seven EJUP contributions by two Member States were submitted to AWF Synergy in 2009 and one so far in 2010. Project Synergy focuses on criminal networks involved in precursor trafficking. This is implemented via two ongoing Sub-Projects (BMK trafficking from the Russian Federation and precursor trafficking from Asia incl. China). The first project strongly depends on the involvement of crucial Member States 61 . However, submissions from Lithuania and Poland decreased in the second half of 2009 and in 2010. The European Commission now participates in EJUP meetings. Furthermore, there has been a regular exchange of information between Europol and OLAF. Exchange visits have been arranged between OLAF and Europol and initial steps have been taken to prepare an operational working arrangement. This will facilitate a more in-depth exchange of data. 42. To evaluate EU drug precursor control legislation and its implementation COM MS The Commission has completed its evaluation of the European drug precursors legislation. The European legislation (Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 and Council Regulation (EC) No 111/2005) establishes harmonised rules for the control and monitoring of the trade in drug precursors, which have licit uses in a broad range of products (e.g. chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics) but are also frequently used for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, with a view to preventing their diversion from the legal trade. The results of the Commission\u2019s evaluation are summarised in a report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation and functioning of the European legislation on drug precursors 62 , which was published on 7 January 2010.

In 2008, the fifth phase of the Central Asia Drug Programme (CADAP 5 ) with a budget of \u20ac 5 million was approved under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) . This consolidates the previous phases and supports new areas in the field of drug demand reduction. On the law enforcement side, capacity-building measures in Central Asian countries continue to be supported under the Border Management Programme in Central Asia (BOMCA), whose eighth phase was approved in 2009. With regard to projects along the cocaine trafficking routes at bilateral level the Commission approved in 2008 a \u20ac 3.3 million project under the DCI to support the Venezuelan anti-drug agency, in addition to bilateral anti-drug actions financed by the Commission in the three cocaine-producing countries (Colombia, Peru and Bolivia).

Finland also reports a long-term alternative development project with Peru (\u20ac 750 000), but this will end in 2010. The Commission has acquired experience with alternative development in Latin America and Afghanistan, by mainstreaming the EU approach to alternative development in its development agenda \u2014 no (forced) eradication, no conditionality, respect for human rights, and market access. Projects are based on the notion of correct sequencing, with eradication possible only when alternative livelihoods are in place. The ultimate goal is to address poverty.

Regarding Afghanistan , the European Commission\u2019s strategy associates the rural economy and the creation of alternative livelihoods with production and productivity gains in the rural economy and improved sustainable management of natural resources. This PAL Strategy (programme for alternative development) in Afghanistan has two major functions: investment, by channelling resources to communities in the three provinces (Nangarhar, Laghman and Kunar) where it is being implemented, and a laboratory function (for identifying best practices in the development of alternative livelihood options and channelling lessons learned to appropriate partners). The Commission has invested in a number of strategic rural development sub-sectors such as irrigation and water resources management, horticulture, or livestock to stimulate the rural economy and help create licit employment opportunities. In addition to the alternative development projects targeting the Andean Countries and Afghanistan, the Commission has also completed a horizontal project: Importance of mainstreaming alternative development underlined by programmes/projects . The project, which was completed in August 2008, provided a platform for debate and information on mainstreaming alternative development in ideas, programmes, communities, governments and agencies across the globe.

When relevant for this preparation and coordination, representatives from the EU Representations and the EC/EU Delegation in Vienna participate in meetings of the Horizontal Drugs Group in Brussels. In general, EU Statements during the CND are prepared and negotiated by the EU delegations in Vienna, while resolutions are either drafted (in the case of EU initiatives) or discussed in the HDG prior to the CND. At their request, the EU Presidencies are supported by other EU Member States and by the EC/EU Delegation Vienna during these proceedings. The preparation and coordination for the 52 nd Commission on Narcotic Drugs and its related High Level Segment in 2009, regarding the follow-up of the 1998 UNGASS Political Declaration 70 , showed to be a true test case for EU coordination and continuity at UN level. Subsequently, the negotiations on a new Political Declaration and Plan of Action took place between October 2008 and March 2009. The EU was strongly guided by an official EU position paper prepared in advance of these negotiations 71 . The Czech EU Presidency had a lead role in the negotiations, closely supported by the European Commission\u2019s Delegation in Vienna (as of 01/12/2009: European Union Delegation) as well as by the Commission\u2019s drugs policy coordination department. Although the EU negotiating strategy was considered solid and unified until a very late stage in the negotiation process, some difficulties were encountered in the guidance provided by the Horizontal Drugs Group on political choices and decisions that needed to be made, mainly for the preparation of unified EU statements and negotiation positions where in some cases a lack of consensus between EU Member States resulted in stalemate situations in which the EU Presidency could not take a strong stance in negotiations with third countries. This problem recurred in 2010. Another factor that may have had a detrimental impact on the EU\u2019s capability to negotiate at UN level was that in cases of disagreement, reaching consensus among the EU-27 consumed much energy and time, which had a negative impact on the active participation, support and burden-sharing of Member States in the subsequent negotiations with third countries. 57.

During the High Level Segment and 52 nd CND and during the 53 rd CND, the EU delivered common (opening) statements on the various agenda items as well as on the UNGASS review. However, due to the disagreement of one EU Member State with one of the core aspects of EU drugs policy, the process of reaching consensus has become more difficult, in particular as regards the opening statements and statements on drug demand reduction. During the 52 nd CND, the EU did not initiate any EU resolution, although one resolution was tabled during the meeting by one EU Member State and subsequently co-sponsored by the other EU Member States.

Nevertheless, during the final stage of negotiations, disagreement emerged on support for the term \u2018harm reduction\u2019 in the negotiations. As a result, the EU Presidency could not finalise the negotiations on this issue and the disagreement between some Member States was openly displayed during the High Level Segment of the CND, where a considerable number of EU Member States supported an interpretative statement on harm reduction. 59.

For example, within the United Nationals Office for Drug and Crime (UNODC), Germany currently represents the EU in the Working Group on Finance and Governance. At the same time, in the UNODC Major Donor Group, only those EU Member States that are considered major donors participate without specific representation.

To improve the dialogue on drugs with European Neighbourhood Policy countries in a bilateral or regional context, in particular through existing subcommittees MS COM The dialogue on drugs with European Neighbourhood Policy countries focused on the implementation of ENP partners\u2019 obligations under the 1988 UN Convention on Illicit Traffic in Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances as well as other international instruments. Assistance for capacity building within designated national authorities and law enforcement bodies for both repressive and preventive measures also figured prominently in the dialogue as well as support for designing or updating comprehensive and holistic national drug strategies. Emphasis was also placed on the need to improve intelligence-sharing on drugs production and trafficking routes with geographical neighbours and at regional level. Equal importance was given to improving dialogue and cooperation with civil society groups on the development and implementation of effective harm-reduction initiatives and programmes for high-risk groups and to the need for continued public investment in rehabilitation programmes and publicly accessible curative facilities. Nevertheless, some aspects of cooperation require further attention. The degree of intelligence-sharing on drugs production and trafficking supply routes at regional level is overshadowed by ongoing political tensions in the Middle East and South Caucasus. At the same time, the underinvestment in human resources within law enforcement agencies to tackle drugs issues remains a constraint for all ENP partners. A dialogue on drugs has furthermore not yet been initiated with all relevant countries. This concerns \u2014 among others \u2014 Armenia and Azerbaijan.

With TAIEX support, EMCDDA plans to hold a regional seminar on the EU Drugs monitoring system with all ENP partners in October 2010. Some difficulties need to be overcome in this area of cooperation as well. For example, low ENP partner interest is reported in using bilateral cooperation funding under the ENPI for drug-related programmes. The relevant countries have a strong preference for using these means to advance convergence and economic integration. In this regard, the possibility of incorporating drug-specific regional activities in revised ENPI Regional East and Inter-Regional Strategy Papers for 2010-13 is limited due to intense prioritisation of enhanced support for economic integration and policy convergence in the key areas of energy, the environment and SME development. Available funding opportunities for expertise under TAIEX and Twinning are also not yet fully exploited by ENP partners.

In Luxembourg, drug-related research is funded from a national fund to combat drug trafficking, in which confiscated assets from drug crimes are deposited. From the other ten responding countries, five countries said they did not have any funding programme specifically targeting drug-related research 82 , while the remaining five 83 indicated that funds for drug-related research are available from a variety of general research funding programmes. One of the recommendations in the Council Conclusions on drug-related research therefore also concerned the need to improve coordination between national representatives in drug-coordination mechanisms and those representing their Member States in programming committees, for example for the EU\u2019s 7 th RTD Framework Programme, but also in the Public Health Programme and Drug Prevention and Information Programme. In the survey, the Commission also asked Member States how they coordinated their input in these specific programmes. Of the twenty countries responding to this question, seven Member States 84 indicated that their national drug coordination mechanism played an active role in disseminating information about 80 Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain. 81 Belgium, Finland and Sweden. 82 Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta and Romania. 83 Austria, France, Portugal, Slovakia and UK. 84 Germany, Ireland, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Spain. 85 Austria, Denmark, Cyprus and Greece. 86 Belgium, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Sweden and UK. 87 http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/themes/research.

Four Member States 85 indicated they do not coordinate such input. Finland and Malta are currently examining a coordination structure for this purpose. Seven Member States 86 reported that they do coordinate their input for the EU funding programmes, either through their national research structures or through their drug coordination mechanisms. The results show that funding for drug-related research at EU level could be boosted further if more Member States ensured that information on research priorities is exchanged between their drug coordination mechanisms and government representatives in the relevant programming committees for the EU funding programmes. To provide and disseminate drug-related research information and drug-related research findings from the EMCDDA and the EU, the EMCDDA has enhanced its thematic website on research 87 to include a section on EC funding available for research, information on research at national level, and links to relevant EC, national and EMCDDA resources. 22. Ensure the exchange of accurate and policy-relevant information in the field of illicit drugs 64. Member States to provide Reitox 88 National Focal Points (NFP) with the necessary resources to meet the obligations and quality standards of EMCDDA membership. NFPs to contribute to the EMCDDA on the basis of annual agreements and with appropriate support from the EMCDDA MS EMCDDA In 2009, 26 Member States signed a grant agreement with the EMCDDA. One country (Malta) did not have an operational focal point and therefore was not in a position to fulfil the contractual obligations linked to the grant agreement. The national focal point (NFP) of another Member State was relocated to another public entity at national level and became temporarily inoperative, so the grant agreement was cancelled. Out of the 25 remaining NFPs, three countries did not request the maximum amount available per country. Two of these NFPs had to request a further reduction during the year as matching national resources were cut due to the financial crisis. Apart from the above-mentioned individual cases the REITOX co-financing system seemed to have provided sufficient resources for effective functioning of the NFPs. National reports and standardised tables are two key areas where the EMCDDA collects monitoring information from the Reitox NFPs. In 2008, NFPs adopted new guidelines for national reporting, which were used as a reference document for the first time in 2009. The new guidelines made changes primarily to the structure of the report and not so much the content. In 2009, all NFPs complied with the new reporting guidelines and delivered a national report. The exception was Malta, which has had no operational FP since 2008 and did not deliver any kind of data to the EMCDDA. Out of the 26 countries, the deadline was observed by 12 and a further 10 sent reports one month after the deadline. 88 R\u00e9seau Europ\u00e9en d\u2019Information sur les Drogues et les Toxicomanies (REITOX). ",
        "EN 54 EN In 2009, 16 mandatory and 5 voluntary standard tables were due to be delivered by the NFPs by the end of September. In total, the EMCDDA received 990 datasets, of which 136 (13.7 %) were received after the deadline. Of the 990 reported datasets, 139 (14 %) were tables without data. Depending on the country, reasons for empty submission varied significantly, e.g. new data not yet accessible at the NFPs, lack of data collection for a particular issue at national or regional level, or survey not carried out annually. The quality of the national reports and the reported datasets has been increasing over recent years, although the availability of new information varies greatly between countries and the topic addressed. With regard to quality control, the EMCDDA has identified limitations and weaknesses in data and data collection systems and is seeking options for overcoming them together with NFPs. Due to the varying situations in different NFPs, bilateral discussions have proved to be useful, and training and technical support is tailored to and focused on the needs of those countries where problems have been identified. Objective 23. Further develop instruments to monitor the drug situation and the effectiveness of responses to it 65. To further improve and fully implement the five EMCDDA key epidemiological indicators and the development of new indicators and measures in drug demand reduction MS EMCDDA COM The 5 Key Epidemiological Indicators (Prevalence and patterns of drug use, Problem drug use, Treatment demand, Drug-related deaths, and Drug-related infectious diseases) are a core task of the EMCDDA; they were politically endorsed by a Council Resolution in 2001. An assessment of the progress by Member States in implementing the Key Indicators (KI) was first performed in 2002. In 2009, a new assessment approach was developed in order to measure the level of implementation of the KIs and the progress made to date, and to identify the main obstacles to full implementation. The new implementation assessment conducted in 2009 included both a description of the activities carried out at national level to implement the KIs and an analysis of the quality of the information held in the Member States, and was delivered to the EMCDDA against a set of detailed criteria developed in close consultation with National Focal Points. Findings from the assessment reflect the stage of development of the indicators in a country. The results of the assessment indicate that the level of implementation of the indicators and the quality of the data have considerably improved in most of the countries since the KIs were implemented. However, some methodological aspects still need fine-tuning, especially with regard to the timeliness of data delivered to the EMCDDA. A limited number of countries still face structural problems preventing the implementation of several indicators and need to make a special effort to overcome these obstacles. Currently, the Treatment Demand Indicator (TDI) is undergoing revision in response to changes in the treatment field and in the profile of problem drug users. The full revision of the TDI protocol and data management issues should be concluded in 2011 and will include simplified data reporting methods. The Problem Drug Use Indicator (PDU), as it has been defined until now, has been most suitable for ",
        "EN 55 EN estimating the size of populations of heavy, chronic heroin users. However, the changing drug situation in Europe (i.e. emergence of new populations like dependent cocaine users or cannabis users in need of treatment) required rethinking of the entire area. This was also supported by demands from National Focal Points, policy makers and the EU Drug Action Plan. Elements of the PDU revision planned for the near future include: review of the conceptual basis of the current definition (e.g. operationalisation of definition elements \u2014 \u2018regular\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019, bringing the area more into line with international classifications, flexibility of the definition in changing conditions, the possibility of defining harm thresholds, etc.). A multidisciplinary approach is to be taken and the revision is intended to be a long-term process with a strong research stimulation component. The instruments used to assess drug demand reduction responses have been revised over recent years, in accordance with experiences and changes in the environment. A first overall scheme for demand reduction indicators has been developed, based on an analysis of existing instruments and the items and categories used. Future work will focus on a restructuring of data management and presentation of interventions. Core elements will include: conceptual framework, policy relevance, current availability (including accessibility, access and coverage issues), quality measures and best practice. Cost-related aspects of interventions will be integrated where possible as data become available. All Member States provided data to the EMCDDA in 2009, according to the TDI Protocol and Guidelines. In Poland the process of adapting the national reporting system on treatment demand will be finalised shortly. There remain differences between Member States with regard to data quality and coverage in respect of TDI implementation. 67. To develop key indicators for the collection of policy-relevant data on drug-related crime, illegal cultivation, drug markets and supply reduction interventions and to develop a strategy to collect them COM EMCDDA Europol MS A number of bodies are collecting data in the field of drug supply in the EU and at international level, with the EMCDDA being the main such collector. While making use of the wealth of information and expertise available the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), Europol and other bodies, the Commission also solicited external technical advice on a strategy to develop key indicators in the field of drug markets, drug-related crime and supply reduction by commissioning a study 89 in 2008 and organising two expert meetings in 2009. The meetings brought together a panel of law enforcement officers, drug-policy analysts, policy-makers and scientists. The Council reaffirmed the importance of this issue in its Conclusions of 28 May 2009 90 . 89 Tender JLS/2008/C2/001 \u2014 Study on policy-relevant information and data in the field of drug-supply reduction and drug-related crime in the EU and third countries. 90 9634/09; CORDROGUE 26, 8.5.2009. ",
        "EN 56 EN Based on these activities and inputs, the Commission considered it important for progress to be made on developing drug supply indicators during the lifetime of the current EU Drugs Strategy. In order to facilitate this, it published a Commission Staff Working Paper with the aim of \u2014 among other things \u2014 providing a framework and setting out actions for developing key indicators in the field of drug supply at EU level. The paper proposed measures for enhancing the availability of information and data on drug supply, by developing key indicators on drug markets, drug-related crime and drug-supply reduction and by improving existing data collection systems in this field. As the lead agency in developing this area of data collection in the EU, the EMCDDA in 2010 also started a number of projects concerned with the conceptualisation, development and implementation of new indicators in the field of drug supply, this in addition to the data routinely collected and analysed on supply and supply reduction. These new indicators concern \u2014 among others \u2014 the area of \u2018drug prices and purity\u2019, in which data on drug prices in the retail and wholesale market are to be collected and analysed, and different options are to be reviewed for developing purity-adjusted price series in Europe, together with an analysis of the respective data requirements. Regarding purity, in 2010 the EMCDDA intends to develop its reporting tools on drug purity. This should allow reporting countries to distinguish between different levels of the market (retail, wholesale, undifferentiated) in their submitted data. 68. To develop analytical instruments to better assess the effectiveness and impact of drug policy (e.g. model evaluation tools, policy effectiveness indices, public expenditure analysis etc.) COM EMCDDA MS The European Commission is supporting the development of new analytical instruments to better assess the effectiveness and impact of drugs policy in the EU by funding initiatives through \u2014 among others \u2014 the Specific Programmes on Drug Prevention and Information 91 and on the Prevention of and Fight Against Crime as well as through the Public Health Programme and the 7 th RTD Framework Programme. \u20ac 5 to \u20ac 7 million is allocated every year to projects under these programmes. In addition, the Commission has issued calls for studies in the field of drugs to meet specific needs for EU drugs policy 92 . 91 Decision No 1150/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 September 2007 establishing for the period 2007-2013 the Specific Programme \u2018Drug prevention and information\u2019 as part of the General Programme Fundamental Rights and Justice, OJ L 257, 03.10.2007, p. 23; Council Decision of 12 February 2007 establishing for the period 2007 to 2013, as part of General Programme on Security and Safeguarding Liberties, the Specific Programme \u2018Prevention of and Fight against Crime\u2019 (2007/125/JHA); OJ L 58, 24.2.2007, p. 7. 92 2007 : JLS/2007/C4/005 \u2014 Detailed analysis of the operation of the world market in illicit drugs and of policy measures to curtail it (\u20ac 469.958); 2008 : JLS/2007/C4/006 \u2014 A Comparative Analysis of Research into Illicit Drugs in the European Union (\u20ac 247.400); JLS/2008/C2/001 \u2014 Study on policy-relevant information and data in the field of drug supply reduction and drug-related crime in the EU and third countries (\u20ac 165.065); 2009: JLS/2010/DPIP/PR/1023 \u2014 Study on the development of an EU framework for minimum quality standards and benchmarks in drug demand reduction (\u20ac 225.700).

        "EN 57 EN In addition, the EMCDDA is supporting the development of drugs policy assessment instruments through a number of projects and tools. At the end of 2009, the Agency published a Selected Issue on \u2018Drug offences: sentencing and other outcomes\u2019, which analysed the implementation of drug control systems within the European Union \u2014 the outcome of each process, rather than a more restricted account of national laws. Individual countries have already used data on drug sentencing to inform or evaluate legal frameworks or policies, but this is the first time such data have been collected EU-wide. At the beginning of 2010, the EMCDDA released a short technical report that reviewed the methodologies used to evaluate the effects of drug-related changes to legislation. Some 36 studies that evaluated aspects of legislative changes regarding illegal use and possession, regulations permitting use and possession, and enforcement strategies were reviewed. Evaluations may highlight the intended effects of a legal change, but there can also be unintended consequences, and a full picture will describe all of these, perhaps by combining different indicator types. In mid-2010, the EMCDDA organised a Reitox Academy on the evaluation of national drug strategies and action plans. The meeting focused on reviewing current national activities regarding the design of evaluation studies, the collection and interpretation of data for such studies, and the use of their results. 69. To assess the functioning of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances, and amend, if necessary COM Council EMCDDA Europol EMEA In the Annual Report on the implementation of the Council Decision 93 , EMCDDA and Europol indicated that, during 2009, 24 new psychoactive substances were officially notified for the first time in the EU through information exchange via the Early Warning System (EWS) set up by the Decision. The number of new compounds reported in 2009 was higher than ever; all were synthetic, including two substances with medicinal properties. In the first half of 2010, the number of notified substances increased at an even faster rate. In the past five years, the Council Decision has been implemented fully on a number of occasions. Throughout the different stages of the implementation process, specific problems emerged both in terms of interpretation of specific paragraphs and regarding the timeliness of the procedure. Furthermore, the question has been raised whether the scope and procedure of the Council Decision is still fit for purpose, given the fast-changing trends in the market for new psychoactive substances. These trends include for example: - The number of \u2014 mostly synthetic \u2014 substances on sale in the market for \u2018legal\u2019 drugs seems to be increasing. Not all of these substances may have a serious risk potential for human health, but their 93 EMCDDA\u2013Europol 2009 Annual Report on the implementation of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA - in accordance with Article 10 of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk-assessment and control of new psychoactive substances. ",
        "EN 58 EN consequences are often unknown due to a lack of research. - Substances that have been brought under control at national or at EU level are often easily replaced by new substances, often by making simple changes at the molecular level. The Council Decision can address one individual substance at a time only. - Some substances are sold with the label \u2018not for human consumption \u2019. However, for user communities their use as psychoactive substances is clear (e.g. mephedrone); Many of the new, \u2018legal\u2019 psychoactive substances are sold over the internet, which makes control at national level complicated and occasionally leads to \u2018media hypes\u2019; In several Member States there are \u2018smart shops\u2019 or \u2018head shops\u2019 which may sell all kinds of products, varying from herbal teas to psychoactive plant leafs and synthetic psychoactive substances. These shops are often not regulated. Taking into account the above, by the end of 2010, the Commission will present an assessment report on the functioning of Council Decision 20058/387/JHA 94 . The assessment will \u2014 among other things \u2014 look into how Member States control new psychoactive substances, draw up an inventory of relevant EU legislation (e.g. food law) that may be of use in addressing new psychoactive substances, and assess the functioning of the Council Decision from a procedural and practical perspective.
