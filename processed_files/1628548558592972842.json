        "What does it mean to be poor in the EU? Poverty among women and men goes beyond a basic lack of resources for survival and extends to the depriva- tion of civil, social and cultural activities as well as oppor- tunities for political engagement and social mobility. Within the Europe 2020 framework, the concept of \u2018at risk of poverty or social exclusion\u2019 (AROPE) refers to living in a household which is in at least one of three situations: \u0097 Being at risk of monetary poverty; \u0097 Being severely materially deprived; \u0097 Living in households with very low work intensity. The life course perspective recognises the link- ages between different stages in a person\u2019s life and considers how life\u2019s twists and turns build on each other to influence each additional stage. Almost one in four people in the EU live at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Living conditions, poverty levels and pathways into and out of pov- erty are different for women and men and also vary across the span of a person\u2019s life. Young people (18-24) make up 10 % of all poor in the EU ( 1 ). While the risk of poverty or social exclusion does not differ much for women and men at this stage of life, women are clearly paying the price of gender inequalities at an older age. They are at a much higher risk of poverty or social exclusion than older men. ( 1 ) The source of all the data presented in the factsheet is from Eurostat surveys (EU-LFS or EU-SILC), 2014, unless referenced otherwise. Poverty and gender over the life cycle Review of the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action Tackling poverty over the life course The eradication of poverty and social exclusion is an inte- gral part of the Europe 2020 strategy. This commitment aims to lift at least 20 million people out of poverty by 2020. However, Member States face challenges in meeting this target. The number of people living in poverty has actually increased since 2010. Women in general are at a higher risk of poverty in all age groups. Over the course of their lives they receive lower income than men, are more likely to work in low paid and insecure jobs and take career breaks due to caring responsi- bilities. These lifelong inequalities eventually lead to income gaps, economic dependence and a higher risk of poverty, which become most apparent in old age. This is particularly concerning, as women make up most of the ageing popu- lation across the EU. EU policies acknowledge the impact that cumulative inequalities have on older women\u2019s risk of poverty and eco- nomic dependence. The European Commission has taken important steps to close the gender pension gap. It has also invited Member States to address women\u2019s higher prev- alence of part-time work and relatively low earnings pro- gression, as these can have a detrimental effect on pension entitlements. These policy initiatives show that integrating a life-course and gender perspective in all stages of poli- cymaking is essential for making equality between women and men a reality in the EU and beyond. Young people in the EU face the highest risk of poverty Growing up poor can have lifelong impacts. In the EU today, almost one fifth of poor people (19 %) are children below the age of 16. This is equivalent to almost 23 million children living in poor households. Young women and men have been particularly affected by the economic crisis, and consequently face the highest risk of poverty in the EU. In 2014, about a third of youth aged 18 to 24 were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, with women slightly more at risk. ",
        "Many young people are likely to experience difficulties find- ing work after completing their studies. The unemployment rate of young people (15-24) is dramatically high at around 20 % for both women and men (23 % for men and 21 % for women in 2014) compared to 10 % for the total population. Even when working, many young people remain poor. They are more likely to be in precarious jobs than other age groups, particularly if they left school early. Almost half of women and over a third of men aged 20 to 24 (excluding students) are in precarious employment ( 2 ). In 2014, the rate of people who were working and still at risk of monetary poverty (in-work poverty) was 15 % for young women and 12 % for young men aged 18 to 24. These figures represent the highest in-work poverty rate among all age groups. Young people who still live with their parents, or are finan- cially supported by them are better protected from poverty. Older women faced with lifetime inequalities The gender gap in poverty starts to increase at an older age and is highest among people aged 75 and over (22 % of women compared to 15 % of men live at risk of poverty or social exclusion). Over a lifetime, gender inequalities sys- tematically undermine women\u2019s economic independence, making them far more likely to fall into poverty later in life. Women face a variety of challenges in the labour market including but not limited to: \u0083 An average employment rate consistently below that of men; \u0083 High chance of being engaged in part-time work (32 % for women versus 8 % for men); \u0083 Over-representation in sectors that are usually less well paid and have limited career opportunities or slow increases in earnings; \u0083 Higher risk of being in precarious employment. Furthermore, women leave the job market at an earlier age than men, in especially big numbers before retirement age (the inactivity rate of women aged 55-64 is 52 %, while for men in this age group it is 36 %). Care and other family responsibilities, which are often not compensated, undervalued and unequally distributed, have a major impact on women\u2019s position in the labour market. This applies throughout their working lives, even at an older age. Nearly 10 % of women aged 50 and over indicate that because of family or care responsibilities they are out of the labour market and not seeking a job. The working life of women in the EU-28 is 5.1 years shorter than the working life of men. This is due to career breaks during the working life, but also to an earlier exit from the labour market. The gender gap in poverty starts to increase at an older age and is highest among people aged 75 and over. ( 2 ) EIGE (2017, forthcoming), Gender, skills and precarious work in the EU, Research note.

        "These working conditions and career patterns lead to lim- ited economic independence for women throughout their lives, but especially at an older age, and consequently to lower pensions. In 2014, the average gender gap in pen- sions in the EU was as high as 40 % ( 3 ). Another factor pushing older people out of the labour market is ageism \u2014 discrimination against a person on the basis of their age, which in combination with sexism creates at least a double challenge for older women. The Think, Act, Report initiative was designed to pre- vent discrimination in the workplace, including age and gender discrimination. It was put forward by the British government and is one of the good practices identified by EIGE. It encourages companies to think about gen- der equality in their workforce, particularly in relation to recruitment, retention, promotion and pay. For more information on good practices, see EIGE\u2019s website. What can be done to reduce the risk of poverty of older women? Increase economic independence of women over the life cycle Gender inequalities in the labour market, the lack of work\u2013 life balance measures and unequal sharing and undervalu- ation of unpaid care and domestic work that systematically undermine women\u2019s economic independence need to be addressed. The effect of lifelong inequalities women expe- rience throughout their lives is particularly apparent at an older age when far more women than men are exposed to the risk of poverty and social exclusion. The integration of gender and a life course perspective in policymaking is key to increasing women\u2019s economic independence and com- batting lifelong inequalities in the long run.

Adjust social protection systems in line with current challenges Social protection systems and anti-poverty policies need to tackle new challenges such as the ageing population, changing family structures, new migration flows, as well as changing forms and conditions of employment. They have to guarantee sufficient economic protection, not just for tra- ditional forms of employment over the life-course, but also consider those engaged in unpaid care work, non-standard or precarious employment, and those affected by career interruptions due to care responsibilities. The annual review of the EU\u2019s economic policies (Euro- pean Semester process) provides an opportunity to further strengthen gender equality over the life course by addressing gender inequalities in pension systems. An example could be adequately crediting care periods for both women and men and ensuring that those who are self-employed, inactive, unemployed or in atypical employment have equal access to state pension schemes. Security at an old age also requires improvement in the availability of and access to publicly pro- vided social services, including health care and long-term care. Foster synergies within and across different policy areas The causes and experiences of poverty vary greatly across different groups of women and men, such as young and old, migrant population, lone parents, Roma, or people with disabilities. Different policies can reinforce each other and therefore stronger synergies between anti-poverty strategies and economic and social policies such as gen- der equality, employment, taxation, family and housing policies could help tackle the root causes of poverty and social exclusion more effectively. For example, the provi- sion of unemployment benefits can better protect peo- ple against poverty when complemented by measures that help individuals reintegrate into the labour market. These can be further strengthened by the provision of care services, for children, older dependants, ill or disabled people.
