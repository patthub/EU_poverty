It provides important revenue, and employs directly and indirectly roughly 20 million people in the region. It is therefore a top economic priority. In 2010, the tourism industry in the Medi- terranean partner countries accounted, directly and indirectly, for 10% of GDP on average. Individual country shares varied from 6.3% in Israel to 20.4% in Jordan. Due to the region\u2019s natural and cultural resources, a desirable climate, and a location close to key mar- kets, tourism is an important growth sector for the Mediterranean partner countries. The potential for the development of tourism has been increas- ingly tapped into by governments and private sec- tor operators to meet a variety of market demands. In 2010, 50 million tourists visited the region, up from 38.5 million in 2006. For the last two decades, the countries of the South- ern and Eastern Mediterranean have recorded the highest growth rates in inbound world tourism. At the same time, domestic tourism in these countries also grew progressively. The economic performance of tourism in the region has been surprising, given the security risks, natural disasters, oil price rises and economic uncertainties in the region. About FEMIP The Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) brings together the whole range of services provided by the European Investment Bank in the Mediterranean partner countries. Operational since October 2002, it is now the key player in the financial partnership between Europe and the Southern Mediterranean countries, provid- ing almost EUR 13 billion of finance between 2002 and 2011 and mobilising roughly EUR 35 billion of ad- ditional capital. Over the period 2007-2013, FEMIP has at its disposal EUR 9.7 billion to support projects in the nine Medi- terranean partner countries. These resources are aug- mented by EUR 2 billion under the Mediterranean Partnership Facility II and by EU budget resources for technical assistance and private equity activities. Under the European Neighbourhood Policy and in the context of the Union for the Mediterranean, FEMIP en- courages the modernisation and opening-up of the economies of the Mediterranean partner countries. Activities are focused on two priority areas: devel- opment of the private sector and the creation of an investment-friendly environment.

Even the last financial crisis had no severe impact on this growth, which confirmed the resilience of tourism and the huge potential of the Mediterranean part- ner countries in this sector. While world annual average tourist arrivals for the period 2006-2010 grew by 2.9% per year, the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean region experienced 9% growth. Tourist expenditure throughout the four-year reference period almost doubled, reach- ing EUR 35 billion in 2010. However, the tourism industry is faced with pressing challenges, such as the regional instability that may affect the attractiveness of the Southern and East- ern Mediterranean, as well as long-term issues, such as climate change and envi- ronmental degradation. At the same time, the current trends in the tourism sector are undergoing sig- nificant changes. Traditional mass tour- ism has reached a stage of steady growth, while ecotourism, and nature, heritage and cultural tourism, are taking the lead and are expected to grow rapidly over the next two decades. It is estimated that global spending on ecotourism is increas- ing at about six times the industry-wide rate of growth 1 . The time has come for the Mediterranean region, which traditionally based its tour- ism strategies on the 3S model ( sun, sea and sand ), to reflect on the future of this economically important sector. The question is how can the tourism indus- try grow while preserving the natural and heritage resources that are at the core of its business. Sustainable tourism 2 has emerged as an apparent yet challenging response. It was recognised by the international commu- nity nearly ten years ago as an important tool for poverty reduction, environmental protection, cultural preservation and eco- nomic and social development. However, sustainability must be addres- sed in well-designed, integrated national tourism strategies. First, because tour- ism can lead to \u2013 but at the same time is also affected by \u2013 environmental degra- dation and climate change. Second, tour- ist choices are increasingly influenced by sustainability considerations. The greening of tourism, through efficiency improvements in energy, water, and waste systems, reinforces the employ- ment potential of the sector. Green tour- ism could also valorise local sourcing, and promote local culture and the natu- ral environment. 1 UNEP report \u201cTourism \u2013 investing in energy and re- source efficiency\u201d, 2011. 2 Sustainability principles refer to the environmental, economic and sociocultural aspects of the devel- opment of tourism, and a suitable balance must be established between these three dimensions to guarantee its long-term sustainability.

In recent years, it has provided support to more than 100 tourism projects across the region, either directly or through local financial intermediaries, ranging from small cafes through to five-star hotels; \u2022 by providing finance in the form of private equity to foster private sector tourism projects. The impact of pri- vate equity operations is significant, especially as they all involve direct, unguaranteed financing for the pri- vate sector; \u2022 by providing technical assistance to promoters during different stages of the project cycle, such as pro- ject identification, preparation and implementation. Technical assistance operations are funded by the FEMIP Support Fund, which utilises non- repayable aid granted by the Euro- pean Commission in support of FEMIP investment activities; \u2022 by encouraging a better under- standing of the economic issues in the Mediterranean via upstream studies financed under the FEMIP Trust Fund. FEMIP strives to improve the quality of its projects and their impact on the eco- nomic and social development of the Mediterranean partner countries. Preserving the heritage in a Tunisian sustainable tourism project In Tunisia, the EIB lent EUR 2.3m to finance the reconstruction, improvement and rehabilitation of DIWAN Hotel, Tunis. The planned architectural and decorative changes are going to respect Medina\u2019s cultural and architectural heritage. At the same time, the hotel will benefit from its central location from the reconstruction of the main road which links the main Mosque of Zitouna to the Mausoleum of Sidi Brahim Riahi.
