Notably, the share of the sector in total value added has dramatically increased during the period 2005-2012. Source: EUROSTAT \u2013 National Accounts According to EurObserv'ER, in 2013, the share of direct and indirect renewable energy related employment in total employment of the economy in the Netherlands was at about 0.24%, below the EU average of 0.53%. The National Energy Review 2014 indicated that the share of direct and indirect renewable energy related employment in total employment of the economy was approximately 0.5%, slightly below the EU average of 0.53%. Source: European Commission, based on EurObserv'ER and EUROSTAT TRADE BALANCE OF ENERGY PRODUCTS The energy trade balance deficit of the Netherlands represents 3.5% of GDP in 2014, which is higher than the EU average, coinciding almost completely with the deficit on the oil trade balance. The deficit has increased since 2006, again mainly driven by an increase in oil imports. 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0 2.4 2005 2012 NL EU27 Value added of energy sector % of gross value added (total economy) 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 2005 2012 NL EU27 Employment in energy sector % of total employment Towards an Energy Union The Netherlands ",

Energy Security, solidarity and trust ENERGY MIX The energy mix of the Netherlands differs from that of the EU-28, with the notable difference of a higher share of gases and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 of petroleum and products. Compared to 1995, the share of petroleum and products sharply increased (from 36% to 42% of gross inland energy consumption), while the share of solid fuels decreased (by 2 percentage points). The share of gases decreased from 47 to 42% of the energy mix. Gross inland energy consumption in 2013 Source: European Commission, based on EUROSTAT IMPORT DEPENDENCY The Netherlands has a low overall import dependency regarding total fossil fuels, and actually exports gas. However, it has a very high import dependency for petroleum products, but a balanced range of import sources 1 , and therefore a low country supplier concentration index. The increase in earthquake activity has renewed concerns about the decline in Dutch gas production. Following the 1 Top non-EU gas suppliers table is based on EUROSTAT data.

In order to accommodate the increase in generation capacity since 2008, the 380 kV grid needs to be expanded. The interconnection between Denmark West and the Netherlands which may in a later stage also connect new offshore wind farms to the cable is Netherlands' most important Project of Common Interest (PCI). The new interconnection between the Netherlands and Germany at Doetinchem-West, which has a capacity of 1500 MW, is also important. This is aimed at solving the problem of insufficient interconnection which is currently evidenced when the price drops in Germany because of high renewables production, but the price in the Netherlands does not respond. The Netherlands is expected to become a net exporter of electricity after 2020. For gas, no expansion investments are required to accommodate demand for transportation capacity. This is consistent with the converging wholesale prices observed at the Northwest European hubs and the low congestion levels. However, the Netherlands developed a strategy to become Europe\u2019s \u2018gas roundabout\u2019, and to diversify supply sources (LNG, countries of origin). One cluster of PCIs has been identified, implementing gas compressor optimisation.

However, the production and wholesale gas markets in the Netherlands are concentrated due to the exploitation of the large Groningen field by a single producer. Nevertheless, due to pro-market policy-making the Dutch gas hub TTF has developed into the most liquid gas hub in the EU. The Dutch retail electricity market is moderately concentrated. The concentration index for retail gas indicates high concentration. Wholesale electricity prices are in line with EU average, and below regarding gas prices. Household electricity prices are slightly below EU average while household gas prices are above 2 . The switching rates for electricity and gas consumers are well above the EU average indicating a dynamic and competitive market. Dutch consumers rate their electricity and gas retail markets above the EU average 3 . The Netherlands carried out the cost benefit analysis for a wide-scale roll out of electricity smart metering (at least 80% by 2020) with positive results. CONTRIBUTION OF ENERGY TO CONSUMER PRICE EVOLUTION The inflation of consumer prices in the Netherlands has started decreasing only since 2012, with the first serious drop taking place in 2014, which is later than for the Euro Area as a whole where inflation has been decreasing since 2011.

Vulnerable consumers \u2013 defined by law as consumers for whom being disconnected from electricity or gas would have very serious health consequences \u2013 can never be disconnected. A \"non-disconnection period\" running from 1 October to 1 April also applies to all households. Low-income households benefit from social support schemes. 3. Energy Efficiency and moderation of energy demand ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGET 2020 (60.7 Mtoe primary energy and 52.2 Mtoe final energy) Source: European Commission, based on EUROSTAT and on national energy efficiency targets as declared by the MS under the Energy Efficiency Directive The Netherlands' 2020 energy efficiency target is 60.7 Mtoe expressed in primary energy consumption (52.2 Mtoe expressed in final energy consumption). The Netherlands has taken additional measures to improve energy efficiency. According to the National Energy Outlook 2015, the Netherlands is estimated to have a final energy consumption of 49.4 Mtoe in 2020. The Netherlands is also on track to meet the target of 1.5% energy efficiency on an annual basis. When comparing the trend of primary energy consumption with the GDP development over the past decades, there is evidence of a decoupling of both. ENERGY INTENSITY Primary energy intensity of the Dutch economy as a whole has decreased from 2005, while remaining below the EU average. Although a significant energy intensity reduction has been recorded in the industrial sector, i.e. about 12% between 2000 and 2013, this is less than the average energy intensity reduction in the EU28 over the same period (i.e. about 21%). Energy intensity in industry also remains above EU average. ",

This is mainly due to improved housing insulation and increased roll-out of energy efficient household appliances. The specific energy intensity of passengers cars decreased slightly between 1995 and 2010, although somewhat less then the EU average. Emissions of new cars are the lowest in the EU, with 109 g CO 2 /km in 2013. However, the specific energy intensity for freight transport increased consistently between 1995-2010 (by about 12%), i.e. from the same unit of energy fewer tonnes of goods are transported and/or on shorter distances (or the filling factor of goods in freight vehicles is lower).

        "7 Towards an Energy Union \u2013 The Netherlands Regarding transport performance, in EU-28 the inland freight modal shares are 71% by road, 17% by rail, 7% by inland waterways and 5% by pipelines. The respective inland passenger modal shares are 82% by private car, 9% by buses and coaches, 7% by railways and 2% by tram and metro. Compared to the European average, the Netherlands report the highest use of inland waterways in freight transport, given the existence of a network of navigable rivers and canals in the country.

Full implementation of the Energy Agreement for Sustainable Growth is necessary for progressing towards the 2020 target. However, according to the National Energy Outlook 2015, the current measures are projected to not fully deliver on the 2020 target. Hence, the Netherlands is taking additional measures. The planned evaluation of the Energy Agreement in 2016 should also be used to look into additional measures. Use of the cooperation mechanisms under the Renewables Directive could be considered as a way to help achieving the 2020 renewable energy target.

ENERGY & TRANSPORT TAXATION Energy and transport related taxes as a share of GDP amount to 3.0%, which is higher than the EU- average. This is mainly due to comparatively high taxation of transport vehicles and heat and electricity, while taxation of transport fuel is slightly below average. The overall tax burden has fallen between 2005 and 2012, possibly reflecting both the growth of GDP and the pursued climate and energy policy. ",

In October 2013, a \"Climate Agenda\", describing goals and ambitions for 2030 and exploring and paving the way for the next steps towards 2030 and 2050, was agreed by the Government. The first biennial progress report on actions in the Climate Agenda is foreseen by the end of 2015. \uf0b7 The Energy Agreement that the Government signed with key stakeholder in 2013 aims to be a step towards a sustainable energy supply system by 2050. The parties to the Agreement have laid out one goal beyond 2020: to achieve 16% renewable energy in 2023. The Agreement also contains a preliminary goal to limit CO2 emissions in the transport sector to a maximum of 25 Mton CO2 equivalent on the way towards 60% CO2 emissions (compared to 1990) in 2050.

It works on regional initiatives supported by the European Commission to create a regional electricity and gas market as an intermediary step towards a single European market. The Netherlands also participates in the German-led round-table on market developments. Regional cooperation on infrastructure development is necessary to optimise the identification of regional infrastructure priorities and to coordinate cross-border investments. The Netherlands is member of three Regional Groups which have been established under the TEN-E Regulation: Northern Seas Offshore Grid, North South Electricity Interconnections in Western Europe, and North South Gas Interconnections in Western Europe. The Netherlands also plans to be part of the regional initiative on the promotion of the North Sea Offshore Grid, which aims to deliver cost-reduction to the offshore energy system. 8. Cohesion policy contribution The EU Cohesion policy provides for investment possibilities to implement energy policy objectives in the Netherlands which will be complemented by national public and private co-financing, aiming at optimal leverage. It also ensures integrated territorial solutions to challenges by supporting capacity building, technical assistance and territorial cooperation. Internal Energy Market: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 2 million in smart electricity distribution grids in the Netherlands. Energy efficiency: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 57 million in energy efficiency improvements in public and residential buildings and in enterprises in the Netherlands. These investments are expected to contribute to around 1 000 households with improved energy consumption classification. Decarbonisation: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest some EUR 13 million in renewable energy in the Netherlands. These investments are expected to contribute to around 70 MW of additional capacity of renewable energy production. Research, Innovation and Competitiveness: Over 2014-2020, EU Cohesion Policy will invest significantly in R&I and in SME competitiveness in the Netherlands. This will be based on the regional strategies for smart specialisation. For the Netherlands, the strategies include a focus on low-carbon technologies. At this stage, at least EUR 50 million is foreseen for investments in R&I and adoption of low-carbon technologies in the Netherlands, but this might increase further in line with the evolving content of the smart specialisation strategy.
