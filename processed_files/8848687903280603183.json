        "What is the European Pillar of Social Rights? The lasting effects of the economic crisis, coupled with unprecedented changes in the job market, have completely transformed the way many Europeans live and work today. The European Pillar of Social Rights delivers new and more effective rights for citizens in this environment. Its set of 20 principles and rights will better equip people in Europe to access education and skills throughout life and will help ensure that all workers enjoy basic rights. Europe\u2019s leaders endorsed the Pillar at the Social Summit in Sweden in November 2017. It was the first event of its kind in 20 years and the first set of rights to be announced by Europe\u2019s institutions since the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Everybody must work together to make these rights a reality \u2015 European governments, the European Commission, the European Parliament, social partners and civil society. I believe there could be no better way to gain your support in this endeavour than by sharing real-life examples of the Pillar in action. I hope that the 20 stories contained in this book will inspire you and all our partners in helping to bring about a fairer and more social Europe. Marianne Thyssen Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Foreword ",
        "The European Pillar of Social Rights is the EU\u2019s most ambitious social initiative in decades. Its success is a top priority for this Commission, which strives to protect citizens\u2019 rights in our rapidly changing society. The Pillar\u2019s 20 principles and rights aim to promote social convergence and to tackle social challenges in a new world of work. This book shows how these principles and rights are already transforming people\u2019s lives. For example: Asko, from Finland received support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to go back to university, after the Nokia factory he worked in for 20 years shut down. This opportunity helped him find a new job. His story illustrates \u2018education, training and life-long learning\u2019 (Principle 1 of the Pillar). Mateusz, from Poland, had a good \u2018work-life balance\u2019 (Principle 9), taking 7 months of paternity leave so he could spend time with his kids and to allow his wife to continue with her career. Many of us will need \u2018long term care\u2019 (Principle 18) at some point in life. Jannie from the Netherlands needed help taking care of her 82 year-old mother, after her dementia diagnosis. The Commission has already taken strides in ensuring these principles and rights find their way into EU legislation on clear and transparent working conditions; on extending social protection to everyone; and a work-life balance initiative allowing parents and carers to combine work and family life more effectively. A picture is worth a thousand words \u2013 #MySocialRights photo competition We asked young Europeans people to take part in the #MySocialRights photo competition. They were asked \u2019How do you perceive your social rights in Europe?\u2019 and encouraged to answer with a photo, focusing on one of the 20 principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights. The 15 best photos were on display at the European Youth Event in Strasbourg in May 2018. The top photos are included in this book. We would like to thank all the people who shared their experiences and photos. Europe\u2019s social reality is diverse and ever- changing.
