Combining geographic information systems, multi-criteria decision theory and statistical techniques, a geographical instability simulation tool can support decision makers to better understand, analyse and manage instability and insecurity. The JRC Caucasus Instability project aims to provide a holistic view of instability at sub-national level in the Caucasus Region. This report describes the overall process of developing a geographic model of instability in the region. Various studies, techniques and methods are integrated and combined to create an overall picture representing the various potential drivers of instability. The study makes reference to a large body of literature on territorial drivers of insecurity (Section 5). The understanding is grounded in an expert consultation assessing the relevance of identified drivers (Section 6). The analysis uses a large dataset combining geomodelling techniques to represent instability drivers (section 7). The report describes the two tools developed and applied in this study: a statistical model assessing the explanatory power of insecurity drivers (section 8) and an interactive multi-criteria GIS modelling tool integrating the expert knowledge and spatial data (section 9). This report also discusses a potential integration of news event data in the spatial representation of instability (Section 10). 3. Introduction Expert knowledge and spatial data can be combined within a geographic information systems (GIS) framework. This combination creates opportunities to better understand, analyse and support the management of instability and security. Spatial quantitative simulation models are unique in two ways: first, they allow a holistic representation of the forces driving instability and secondly, these models can generate \u201cwhat-if\u201d spatial scenarios exploring the influence of single variables or groups of variables on regional security. Simulation models emphasize the interactions among the components of the system and take into account the quantitative effects of each driving force. Based on clear assumptions, an instability model can be useful for simulation of the impacts of different political decisions and for investment prioritization. The process of decision making comprises three major phases: intelligence, design and choice (Andrienko and Andrienko 2003). The intelligence phase involves situation analysis and problem recognition, the design phase involves finding possible variants of problem solution and the choice phase involves evaluation of the options and selection of the most appropriate ones. While the two first phases can largely be addressed by scientists, the third phase can only be carried out with the involvement of decision makers. The scientific challenge is to communicate better in order to help in the decision making process. Going further, scientists could integrate policymakers within the development of their tools in a real participative approach. Chambers (1989) proposed the use of bottom-up or participative approaches in land-use planning. IIED (1995), FAO (2000), and UNEP have applied this approach to empower local people in developing countries or to assess endangered environments. In the field of natural risks and vulnerability assessment, local consultation is increasingly adopted to estimate the coping capacities of population (Wisner 2006). Information technologies, GIS and remote sensing in particular can also be used as a mean of communication in a participatory approach (Lemma et al. 2005). Specific methodologies have been developed in several fields to carry out decision maker consultations. The Delphi method, developed by Helmer (1966), has become widely accepted by a broad range of institutions as the simplest and most efficient way of collecting knowledge (Turoff and ",
        "6 Linstone 1975, Cooke 1991, Olfert et al. 2006). The structured process synthesizes knowledge from a group of experts through iterative and anonymous investigation of opinions by means of questionnaires accompanied by controlled opinion feedback (Greiving 2006). Multicriteria analyses go a step further in progressively integrating the decision makers within the process of model development. Through user-friendly interfaces, simulation tools have also clearly improved the way to communicate model results to a more general audience. These tools are now able to visualize trade offs between the prioritization of different users to optimize spatial choices. Interactive visual simulation tools present immediately the alternative scenarios of the spatial multicriteria model. The use of these tools within a network of stakeholders to evaluate the weights of a multicriteria approach could promote better communication between scientists of various backgrounds. Two methods of consultation are applied in the GIS Decision support approach of the Caucasus geomodeling project. These methods are: the Delphi method and visual analysis. While multi-criteria participatory approaches are now progressively used in developed and stable countries (Di Mauro et al., 2006), their use in a situation of conflict is a novel and challenging research approach. Regional stability is a common objective of local stakeholders, scientists and international, EU and national policymakers. The JRC/ISFEREA multicriteria model using geographical information system (GIS) technologies can be seen as a communication tool between scientists and policy makers, between technologists and field experts. Addressing the instability of the region should also take into account the perceptions of experts. However, as in most conflict regions, communication between conflicting parties on the ground is usually difficult. The ENVSEC program (UNEP 2004) demonstrated that bringing different parties in conflict to the same table is not an easy task but could be attempted. This project is an initiative in this direction, although the political circumstances in the Caucasus region did not allow us to bring all national experts into the consultation. The following experience of participative cartography attempts a communication between social and technologist scientists that could be used in the future to create a tool for cooperation between opposing sides in negotiation processes. 4. Spatial drivers in quantitative conflict studies Geographic representation of instability uses quantitative conflict analysis, with territory considered as one of the most important driving forces for conflict (Stephenne, Burnley, Ehrlich forthcoming in International Studies Review in 2009). In Political Geography or International Relations scholarship, territorial dimensions include territorial proximity, transboundary issues, distribution of ethnic, linguistic and religious communities, uses of resources, and environmental constraints. 4.1. GIS analysis of territorial dimensions in conflict A new strand of International Relations research addresses conflict and border issues using increasingly GIS and spatial statistical methods (Table 1). This strand of research, its data and methods are analyzed in detail in Stephenne, Burnley, Ehrlich (forthcoming in 2009 in International Studies Review). In these papers, GIS techniques are used to store, create and improve a georeferenced dataset of explanatory variables of conflict or instability. Using such georeferenced datasets it is possible to show the interaction of potential conflict triggers in the countries and districts of the Caucasus. Most conflict studies address spatial/territorial issues at country level, using global datasets. However, the study of civil war using country-level statistics is deemed to be \u201cpotentially flawed\u201d (Buhaug and Rod, 2005) because country level statistics \u201cdilute\u201d the importance of determinants of violence that occur at local level. There is a growing consensus that to be able to study current conflicts \u2013 that are, by and large, civil conflicts (O\u2019Loughlin 2005, Restrepo et al. 2005) \u2013 variables should be available at sub-national level (Hauge and Ellingsten 1998). Global statistical analysis of conflict can be supplemented by disaggregated, quantitative, geo-referenced datasets (Murshed and Gates 2005, Buhaug and Lujala 2005, Lujala et al. 2005 and Gilmore et al. 2005).

Scope of the geomodel of instability in the Caucasus Based on the emerging consensus that conflict drivers should be addressed at the sub-national level, the Caucasus geographic model uses as a starting point the driving forces of conflict described in the conflict literature in order to build an integrated GIS security model. The statistical variables used in the geomodel are descriptive attributes associated with subnational administrative units known as \u201cdistricts\u201d. Table 2: lists spatial variables of territory and border dimensions drawn from political geography and international relations studies at country level. For the Caucasus region area experts added other variables which they identified as drivers of instability. Unfortunately, these variables are not quantitative. This study is a first attempt to measure variables such as \u201chistorical changes in border locations\u201d or \u201cperception of factors for potential mobilization\u201d.

Caucasus Regional Study For over 70 years, the Caucasus was part of the Soviet Union. After the break-up of the USSR, the three independent countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were established in the South (the Russian \u201cTrans-Caucasus\u201d). These Southern Caucasus countries became an integral part of the EU Neighbourhood region. The Northern part of the Caucasus remained a part of the Russian Federation but is still relevant especially because of its ethnic links with the countries of the Southern Caucasus. Although the boundaries of the Caucasus are well defined by the Black and Caspian seas on the West and East (Figure 1), the northern and the southern limits are not (O\u2019Loughlin et al. 2007). ",
        "9 Figure 1 : Caucasian study area (MODIS Rapid Response System, Copyright NASA) During the last 15 years, violent conflicts have occurred in this mountainous region. The recent conflict between Georgia and Russia (August 2008) reconfirm the enduring instability of the region. From the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh between Armenia and Azerbaijan before the dissolution of the Former Soviet Union (FSU), the region has experienced widespread instability during the transition to a new geopolitical order, with aspiring states and autonomous enclaves fiercely guarding their autonomy and \u201csovereignty\u201d (Radvanyi and Muduyev, 2007). The region has witnessed five wars: (i) over Nagorno-Karabagh between Armenia and Azerbaijan from 1989 to1994, (ii) between South Ossetian and Georgian from 1991 to 1992, (iii) between Abkhazian and Georgian from 1992 to 1993, (iv) between North Ossetian and Ingushetia in 1992, (v) between Chechnya and Russia from 1994 to 1996 and 1999-2003. Not only have these wars been ruinous in loss of lives and property, but they have taken place in a region in economic collapse. Together these conflicts have caused the deaths of more than 80,000 people, mainly civilians, and a forced exodus of more than one million migrants and refugees. The first three areas, N-K, SO, and Abhazia, frequently described as \"frozen\" are characterized by uneasy ceasefires. While dormant and unresolved, the reasons for the original disputes continue to fuel the antagonisms and recriminations that impede the return of most of the refugees to their homes. Despite some positive developments, serious local tensions remain. In the wide area of 430,000 km2, disparities between localities are enormous and dissimilarities among various nationalities or ethnic groups no less immense. Representing the complexity of this region in a geomodel is a great challenge. Although the objective is not to explain any of these conflicts or instability, the modeling approach will help in understanding the weight of the main conflict drivers in this region. The geomodeling on the Caucasus aims to provide a holistic view that will include environmental issues related to the security of the region through a quantitative analysis. The multi criteria GIS model integrates earth observation and geo- spatial technologies with formal decision theory (Spatial Decision Support System -SDSS-). This model is an interactive visualization tool for political decision making in the field of security. ",
        "10 The first step of the process was to collect information and data relevant to conflict in the Caucasus region (Stephenne and Macdonald, 2007). Contacts and cooperation with relevant organizations and/or research institutions working on and in the region (UNEP, OSCE, Institut National des langues et civilizations orientales, Paris) were established. A comprehensive GIS dataset on the region was developed to build a geopolitical atlas of the Caucasus, the \u201cCaucasian dataset\u201d in the text below. The producers are J. Radvanyi, director of the Observatoire des Etats post-sovi\u00e9tiques, at the Institut National des Langues et des Civilisations (INALCO, Paris) in a close collaboration with Nicolas Beruchashvili, Georgian professor in Geography (Cartographic Department at the State University of Tbilisi) and other professional cartographers thorough the Caucasus region such as Vitaly Belozerov, Ashot Khoetsian and Musseib Musseibov, respectively Head of the Department of Geography at Stavropol (Russia, North Caucasus), Erevan (Armenia) and Baku (Azerbaijan) State University. In 1997, a first, hand-made Atlas of the geopolitical context of Caucasus was edited by Radvanyi and Beruchashvili using this dataset in Mapinfo environment. The updated version is actually in progress (Radvanyi and Rekacewiz, Autrement, planned in 2009). Figure 2: Administrative units in the Caucasus (Radvanyi et al. Fortchoming) 6. Regional experts consultation Even though socio-economists have often called for more participatory scientific applications, scientists and policy makers usually exchange information in a traditional input-output flow. Aware of the interest of a common analysis, technologists have only rarely been able to be sufficiently understood by non-technologists to integrate their input into the technological process. The integration of regional stakeholders in the development of the decision making tool is thus a novel, challenging scientific approach. 6.1. Delphi consultation The Caucasus study developed its initial geomodel using the spatial driving forces of conflict listed above. However, the development of a spatial decision support tool requires a high level of knowledge ",
        "11 from many experts and from different institutions. The involvement of a high number of regional experts is mandatory to improve the technical tool and to provide an operational picture of instability to decision makers. A large number of regional experts from different institutions were consulted in the decision tool building process through an adapted Delphi method (http://www.iit.edu/~it/delphi.html). A Delphi consultation is a way to coordinate a group communication process. Our consultation aimed (i) to establish an extensive list of driving forces (Table 3), and then (ii) to weight the drivers proposed in this list and prioritise the categories of drivers by a pair-wise comparison. The participants were asked to agree with the list of drivers proposed by the JRC/UNEP-Grid Arendal Caucasus team and then to assess the weights of each of these drivers. Table 3: List of factors of instability assessed by regional experts in the consultation questionnaire Categories Factors for instability in the Caucasus region Rate (0>10) Existing instability Past conflict Federalism/regional autonomy Conflict history Historical changes in border locations or changes in the legal status of geographical entities High number of neighbours Existing conflict in the neighbouring regions Remoteness from the central controlling administration Very large and extended territories Proximity/ Border effect Lack of control over borders Large population Existence of large cities, increasing urbanisation Language and cultural differences between people Religious difference.

Survey analysis 6.2.1. Survey participants The institutions of respondents were classified into four categories: EU bodies, international organisations and NGOs, academic or research institutions and local decision makers. Figure 3 shows ",
        "12 the breakdown of the responses into institution categories. Only one respondent belongs to the \u201clocal decision making\u201d category. Academic institutions and international organisations together account for 78% of the total. A large number of these international organisations are deal with humanitarian aid in close collaboration with European Commission Directorate General ECHO. In fact, 25% of participants have been contacted through the representative of DG ECHO in the Moscow Delegation. EU bodies 20% International Organisations 40% Academic or Research Institutes 38% Local decision level 2% Figure 3: Percentages of responses among four categories of institutions Participants in a Delphi survey are usually anonymous. In the Caucasus survey anonymity has been maintained throughout the process, to reduce the potential for respondents to influence each other.

IAAS-Hamburg University UNEP/GRID-Arendal Academic 6.2.2. Distribution of rates of driving forces Basic distribution statistics describe variations in ratings of instability driving forces among the 45 participants. These values are used in our modelling approach to weight the criteria and propose different scenarios, with different associations made between drivers. Summary statistics were calculated for each factor (Table 5: ). The factors are sorted in increasing order of their average score. This is a measure of their relevance according to the judgement of the respondents. Three factors present values above 7. These factors also have the highest median values (greater than 8). The mode is the score that has been chosen most often. 10 factors present a mode of 0; their relevance in the multi-criteria model should be discussed. These two values will be tested in the model as average values of the expert knowledge. \u201cHistorical changes in border\u201d is the only factor with a score of 10 and occurs most frequently The standard deviation is an indicator of the level of disagreement among survey ratings (Figure 5). Examination of the highest and lowest values of these variables shows a higher level of disagreement for the environmental variables than for the other categories. \u201cExisting instability\u201d and \u201cPast conflict\u201d ",
        "13 are scored with a 7.8 mean rating, with little disagreement. \u201cVery large territories\u201d and \u201clarge population\u201d present also a high level of agreement but they present the lowest importance in the overall instability (means lower than 2). The high variance of scores for \u201cpressure from outside\u201d and \u201cfederalism/regional autonomy\u201d shows discrepancies either in the understanding of these variables or in their geopolitical meaning. Figure 4 illustrates differences in distribution profiles between a factor with a high level of disagreement (competition for cropland) and a quite consensual variable (existing instability).High levels of disagreement are quite logical in these kind of survey, but they also point to the factors which could be scrutinised more closely in the quantitative analysis.

Missing factors A large majority of participants (64% percent) agreed to the list of factors proposed. Only 13 respondents wanted to increase the number of drivers included in the analysis (Table 6: ). Some of these factors were already part of our list (i.e. democratic expression was represented by the variable \u201cperception\u201d), but were not expressed in the same way. In order to reduce to the minimum the time taken to read and complete the table, the list has perhaps been over-summarised. Our factors often combine different indicators. The missing factors reflect also some misunderstandings about the meaning of our list. The third column of Table 6: makes a link between these missing factors and our list of factors when, in fact, we believe we have taken into account the information about this \u201cmissing\u201d factor in our composite criteria. The propositions made by participants help to clarify the meaning of some factors. Because most participants did not object to the table, no major changes were ",
        "15 made to it. All participants are invited to have a look at this table and to comment or ask for an explanation about factors of instability. The factors proposed in the \u201cpolitical system\u201d section were not directly included in the list because of difficulties to be quantified. Based on the expert comments, we added one factor in the second round to deal with the idea of \u201cquality of state governance\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d. The basic assumption of our approach is a quantitative analysis at the district level throughout the Caucasus. Even if we agree on the importance of these factors, most of the time no data exists which may be used to measure them. The complete analysis could discuss in depth these factors and their impact on the model simulations. As one participant proposes, we could produce the data by evaluating the variables through expert knowledge. However, our analysis being subnational at a regional extent, this assessment would need to be done for 300 districts. This would require a deep understanding of the field situation as well as a huge time commitment. Table 6: Missing factors proposed and sorted according to 5 categories. Referring factor Take into consideration the reality of the \u201cState\u201d given the level of corruption, nature of the power, judicial remedies available to citizens, tax collection/social services, structures of the power and existence of a real possibility for a political dialogue political democratization, building of sivil society, good governance, problems of education, absence of free competition in economy, rule of law and etc. Also existing high level regional nepotism, clan politics are also feeding instability in the region. Even in some cases their \u201cimportance\u201d are exceeding notorious impact of religious and ethnic factors Participation - Formalized vs. informal institutions in state and society, more/less transparent decision making processes factors related to the political systems, the quality of the existing governments in regard to conflict management and the political cultures of the respective countries Prevalence of fraud and corruption Include the existence of \u201clawless entities\u201d in the region as major factor of instability as potential safe heaven for illegal trafficking, Existing organising forces (organised movements) Armament/rearmament, reforms of army and military potential increased to be compared to aggressive rhetorics and official propaganda+uncontrolled stocks of arms and existing uncontrolled armed militia. Public discourse influence on public perceptions of conflicts (indexing \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d statements made in the media) Ability of independent and open media to inform/engage the population \u2013 measurement by number of independent media outlets, arrest of journalists, international monitors\u2019 measurements. Ability of population to express political preferences in free and open political systems. Measurements: Reports of international election monitoring agencies, number of people in demonstrations, or numbers registering discontent with political opennesss Bad influence of international organisations, european for exemple, in the deterioration of conflict situation : support to autoritative power structures and sometimes illegal ones. Need to reinforce the justice inside these countries to increase the population confidence. Ignorance of Western policy-makers about the Caucasus, its peoples, history and culture, coupled with a general anti-Russian attitude, which has in the case of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict predisposed these planners, Western ministries and politicians in favour of the Georgians, who are famed for their own anti-Russian sentiments current policy of Russian government, as well as the structure and the nature of regional authorities often protecting the interests of specific groups and clans, which is the origin of instability. Involvement of the international community -e.g. aid agencies and UN agencies. Can be measured by a scale of 1 (no involvement) to 10 (high involvement) Benefits of international community involvement - from negative influence (1) to very beneficial (10) Transfers (remittances, as % of GDP and \u2013 if relevant - public social transfers) Economical stability, level of live, unemployment, illegal arms equipment Business factors (see related indexes) Land tenure (% of landless rural population) Competition for land Energy resources (oil and gas and pipelines) Access to Energy resources both within countries and within countries (ie.

Main comments There are two main recurring comments in the questionnaires received: (i) the idea of regional instability, and (ii) the idea of international pressures. For some of the participants (8/45), it is not relevant to assess the instability at the level of the region. We have been asked to distinguish between Northern and Southern Caucasus, or even between all the existing conflicts. One respondent proposes to make the difference between instability related to one\u2019s state internal factors (internal instability) and the regional instability due to potential conflicts between states, identify potential risks at national ",
        "16 and regional levels and the interaction between the two. This is an important difference that should be clarified in this second round. However the overall assumption of this study is the existence of a complex regional situation in the Caucasus. As it has been clearly higlighted by this survey, the relevance of a distinct behaviour between North and South will be discussed. Four comments relate to the understanding of \u201cexternal pressure\u201d and \u201cperceptions\u201d. These comments help us to clarify these notions. 6.2.5. Pairwise comparison Results of the comparison illustrate that it was a difficult exercise. Comparing several categories is a complex exercise for all of us, with high level of abstraction. Saaty\u2019s test of consistency (Consistency Ratio) in the answers shows strong misunderstandings in the process. Only eight out of forty-five participants provide coherent pairwise comparisons. Table 7 presents the hierarchy of categories (from the most important = 5 to the least one = 1) according to these eight values. Table 7: Average priority levels and ranks within the 8 consistents pairwise comparison Priority Level for the 8 consistent comparisons Rank Instability history 34.8% 5 Proximity/ Border effect 7.7% 1 Population 21.5% 4 Political Influences 20.4% 3 Environment and resources 15.5% 2 Another test of consistency was inadvertently created by a typographical error. On the last line of the table, \u201cpopulation\u201d appears on the right side of the comparison table instead of \u201cenvironment and resources\u201d. The table effectively asked twice the same question: comparing \u201cpopulation\u201d and \u201cpolitical influence\u201d on the 8 th line and on the 10 th line. Only two participants identified our mistake and only 12/45 answers coherently identified opposite numbers for these two lines. 6.3. Second questionnaire In the second round of the consultation, we received a really low number of responses. Three reasons have been clearly identified in this failure. Firstly, the time needed from each participant in completing this second questionnaire was higher than the first one. Secondly, the format of the second questionnaire created some problems in the email transmission as well as in the translation. Finally; some of the respondents replied that they were not able to spend more time on that step even if the general approach presented an interest for them. The objective of this second questionnaire was to confirm the first one, as proposed in the Delphi method. However, the amount of information provided by the survey participants is dense enough to integrate this in our modelling approach. Most of the comments provided during the first questionnaire should be discussed. The geomodel developed below is then based on the first version of the survey. 7. Modelling Instability: Dataset development In the theoretical literature on conflict and instability, there are a few common, frequently repeated explanations. These explanations mainly relate to differences between countries in political system, state capacity, external influences, economy, geography, environment, demography and experience of conflict. A number of studies have identified specific \u201cgeographic indirect roots of conflict\u201d Ullman (1983) as scarcity, competition for territory and resources (B\u00e4chler et al 1995, Homer-Dixon 1999), political system or military expenditure (Hauge and Ellinsten 1998). Many such factors are proposed as explanatory variables in quantitative studies of conflict. The first challenge in a quantitative model is that of data collection. As can be expected from a region with multiple differences, a history of intense conflict and a long past of centralised power, the ",
        "17 available statistical data are fragmented. Given the difficulties of measuring instability in this political context, the Caucasian dataset (Radvanyi, INALCO, 2006) manages to cover a large set of indicators. The dataset has a clear geographical and quantitative focus and largely corresponds to the objectives of our model; it represents a huge opportunity to address spatially the instability within the region of interest. For these reasons, it is the main source of information in this study. Stephenne and MacDonald (2007) evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively the adequacy of this dataset to statistically model instability/stability in the Caucasus by following a structured quality assessment protocol (Johnston et al. 1999). The same study manages to carry out some processing and data harmonization. The data cover the three independent states of the Caucasus region (Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan), 7 republics and 2 federal subjects of the Southern District of the Russian Federation. The unit of this socio-economic dataset is NUTS3 in the independent countries and NUTS4 in the Russian part of the region. The choice of the district level provides a useful homogeneity in the size of the statistical units. Each variable is georeferenced in the GIS framework at this subnational level (district), the so-called \u201cdistrict layer\u201d (Table 3). When experts have identified relevant instability indicators that are not measured in this dataset, other sources of information have been used. The Atlas recently built by Tsoutsiev on historical evolution of the Caucasus region is the main source (\u00e8tnopolitceskoj istorii Kavkaza \u2013 1774-2004, Evropa, Moscou 2006). 7.1. Conflict History It is generally assumed that countries which have experienced an armed conflict are prone to have another conflict, for a number of reasons. First, the cause of the original dispute may not be completely resolved, second, the post-conflict regime may lack capacity to deal with new violence, third, the conflict itself may have generated new disputes and last, the conflicting groups may have acquired experience of organising armed conflicts. Long-running conflicts (Brecher et al. 2000) and conflicts with multiple groups involved (Vasquez, 1993; Cusack and Eberwein, 1982; Brecher, 1993) are particularly likely to recur. 7.1.1. Existing instability The variable dealing with instability per district (binary variable 1/0 on Figure 6a) identifies Caucasian districts where tensions and potential for conflict has been defined and constructed by Radvanyi (Atlas INALCO 1998). This definition is based on the history of territorial disagreements and conflicting events occurring in some part of the region. Figure 6a and b : Instability and past conflict per district ",
        "18 7.1.2. Past conflict The binary variable \u201cPast Conflict\u201d (Figure 6b) refers to the districts completely or partially involved in the main conflicts that occurred in the Caucasus region since 1988 (Radvanyi and Muduyev, 2007). In most of these districts, except in Chechnya, there are no recent armed events. These areas are considered as experiencing a frozen conflict and have a high level of international attention. The districts where there are armed conflicts or territorial occupation have been mapped by Radvanyi (1998). The most recent conflict between Georgia and Russia (August 2008) is not included in the classification because it occurred after the model was developed. 7.1.3. Federalism/regional autonomy Figure 7a shows the binary representation of the 11 autonomous region in the Caucasus: Abkhazia, Adjaria, Adygheie, Chechenia, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkania, Karachaevo_Cherkessia, NK, Nord Ossetia, South Ossetia (Tsoutsiev, Atlas \u00e8tnopolitceskoj istorii Kavkaza \u2013 1774-2004, Evropa, Moscou 2006, map50). Figure 7a and b: (a) Districts belonging to the 11 autonomous regions within the Caucasus, (b) area of the district belonging to the historical \u201cseparatist\u201d movements at the end of the Soviet period as mapped by Tsoutsiev (2006). The historical division of republics and autonomies shown by Tsoutsiev (2006) on map 31 provides a detailed and historical representation of federalism that could be an alternative to the binary representation (Figure 8). Based on this map, we calculated the percentage of the district area where historical claims occurred at the end of the Soviet period, between 1990-1992 (Table 8). The GIS modeling processes are: (i) historical map digitalisation of the boundaries of these regions, (ii) identification of parts with separatism claims (Table 8), (iii) feature rasterisation to define spatially these separatist parts 0/1, (iv) average area of \u201cseparatist\u201d per district.

Historical changes in border locations According to map 21 (Tsoutsiev 2006) representing the \u201cfirst soviet divisions in 1921\u201d, three levels of border changes are visually distinguished per district: 1= changes in the external border, 2= changes in the internal part of the district, 3= new autonomy (Figure 9). While the border line does not correspond to the actual one, the identifier refers to the historical appearance of autonomous countries or ",
        "21 republics. These levels are merged in a binary dichotomy between districts with changes and others \u201cBordch\u201d (Figure 10a) and only the bordering districts are selected \u201cBordch2\u201d (Figure 10b). Figure 9: Digitalisation of map 21 (Tsoutsiev, Atlas \u00e8tnopolitceskoj istorii Kavkaza, Evropa, Moscou 2006) Figure 10a and b : Categorisation of historical changes in borders within districts (a) and selection of bordering districts among these (b) A second source of information about changes in border definition is the map 31 representing divisions of the post-soviet countries in 1990-1992 (see previous section). By geomodelling, we selected the actual borders which intersect lines or borders defining the historical separatist regions (Figure 11a). The number of these specific borders per district is a continuous indicator of historical borders changes (Figure 11b). The combined variable takes then into consideration two types of changes: (i) the historical changes in border locations \u201cBordCh\u201d, as defined on Tsoustiev maps 21, (ii) as well as the changes in the legal status of geographical entities \u201cCount of Border changes per districts\u201d, as defined on Tsoustiev maps 31. These two dates are combined using weights (2 for the first one) to keep the continuous scale of the numbers of borders (Figure 12). ",

Border effect The attempt to use geographical factors is usually driven by their positive correlation with the frequency of armed conflicts. This is because interstate wars are more likely between neighbours than between distant countries (Gartzke and Gleditsch 2006, Mousseau 2003, Russett 2000). Stephenne and Pesaresi (2006) makes a comprehensive review of these studies. The concept of border effect takes into account potential conflict with neighbouring political regimes or armed groups. For interstate conflicts, we can consider the distance between the capitals (Lemke 1995), the minimum distance between the borders of each pair of countries provided this distance is less than 950 km (Gleditsch and Ward 2001), contiguity or shared borders (Richardson 1960), length, number and nature (constraint elements, civil and military infrastructure near the border, etc.) of borders (Wesley 1962, Starr 2002, Furlong et al 2006), terrain characteristics like roughness (Buhaug and Lujala 2005, Collier and Hoeffler 2004, Fearon 2003, Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2005, Starr 2002) and land cover (Buhaug 2005 and Lujala, de Rouen 2004). ",
        "23 7.2.1. High number of neighbours This factor takes into account that potential intruders could affect the central power. International borders refer to the 4 countries : Armenia/Azerbaijan/Georgia/Russian Federation. The geomodelling combines a count of borders per district with a selection of districts with international borders afterwards (Figure 13). The number of borders between districts is not as important as external borders. Figure 13: Number of international neighbours at the district level 7.2.2. Existing conflict in the neighbouring regions The existence of a conflict in a bordering region (either at the district level or at the international level) makes reference to the concept of conflict contamination or \u201cbad neighbours\u201d. This concept is tested both at the level of the districts in this study or at the level of the country as in other studies (Gleditsch et al. 2002; Sambanis, 2001; Ward and Gleditsch, 2002; Esty et al. 1998). The borders of the conflicting districts are selected and the number of bad neighbours counted. This continuous variable can be translated into a binary variable as in the figure below (Figure 14). Figure 14: Number of neighbouring districts in conflict 7.2.3. Remoteness from the central controlling administration Areas of a country which are far from the capital or close to the border, may offer more opportunity for rebellion than areas near the capital. Several studies have hypothesised that the proportion of zones with high difficulty of access is correlated to the risk of civil war in the country but results from ",
        "24 quantitative analysis have produced inconsistent results (Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Collier and Hoeffler, 2004; Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, 2005). With geomodelling tools using the shape of the polygons and its georeferences, we define the centroid of each district. The distance between these points and the capital of the country (Yerevan/ Baku/ Tbilissi/ Moscow) is calculated for each district in order to measure this remoteness (Figure 15). The Geoprocessing steps are (Input layers: Capital cities (Point); District Boundaries (Polygon)) : 1) Project all data layers to Afgooye_UTM_Zone_38N (Project feature, data management tools) 2) Create centroids for District Boundaries (Feature to Point, Data management tools) 3) Create spider diagram for each country using district centroids as origin and capital city as destination 4) Merge all spider diagrams \u2013 export to . dbf - import into MS Excel Figure 15 : Distance between the centroid of each district and the country capital (remoteness factor of instability) 7.2.4. Very large and extended territories The length of the border is an indicator of the size of the territory to be controlled by the central power. This variable refers to the difficulties for security forces to check large areas. At the district level, the indicator is called \u201cBorderLength\u201d (Figure 16) Figure 16 : Border length as the indicator of large and extended districts 7.2.5. Lack of control over borders : mountain risk per district ",
        "25 The issue of control over inaccessible areas is also related to the existence of natural barriers. Fearon and Laitin (2003) have found that mountainous terrain is significantly related to higher rates of civil war. Buhaug and Lujala (2005) found that when rebels were based in mountainous and/or densely forested areas, the conflict went on for longer. This type of accessibility is mainly related to altitude and the slope. The JRC measure of border permeability has been applied at the European level (Stephenne and Zeug, 2007). The mountainous barrier effect is defined using formal decision theory and GIS techniques in Stephenne and Pesaresi (2006). It integrates two datasets derived from GTOPO30 (Verdin and Greenlee 1996). The mountainous risk indicator is extracted for the Caucasus extent and fuzzy normalized in a range from 0 to 256 (Figure 17a). The mean value of this risk per district is used as the indicator of lack of control over borders (Figure 17b). Figure 17a and b: Mountainous risk as calculated in the JRC EUpermeability model (a) and categorisation of these continuous values per district (b). 7.3. Population Arguments relating population characteristics to potential of conflict have focussed on population size and density, ethnic and religious composition and differences, economic well-being and economic disparities. The risk of rebellion or civil crisis is assumed to be higher in large populations than in small populations. This is perhaps because the definition of armed conflict implies a threshold in battle-related deaths more likely to be attained in large size population than in small size population. de Soysa 2002b, Hauge and Ellingsen 1998, and King et al 2001 argue that population density is positively correlated to risk of civil war but Collier and Hoeffler 2004 finds the effect not significant. 7.3.1. Large population In the census data in the Caucasian dataset (INALCO, 2006), population data are available for two different dates: one before the conflict (1989) and the other from 2002. The latter is the most recent census data. But most of the regional conflicts occurred before 2002. Because of the predictive power and because the role as driver of the main occurrence of internal tensions is higher for the 1989 population than for the 2002 figures, this date has been chosen in the model (Figure 18). ",
        "26 Figure 18: Size of the population in 1989 (INALCO, 2006) 7.3.2. Existence of large cities, increasing urbanization The variable proposed to measure the urbanisation and the growth of changes in size of cities calculates a difference between two urban rates in 2002 and 1989 (urb2002-urb1989). The urban rate is calculated as a ratio between the urban population and the total population figure in 2002 (urb2002- urb1989/ pop2002) (Figure 19). Figure 19 : Indicator combining the urbanisation in 1989 and 2002 as a difference between the two dates related to the total figures 7.3.3. Language and cultural differences between people Ethnic differences, mainly polarisation and diversity have been widely discussed as a motivation for conflict (Horowitz 1985, Reynal 2002, Sambanis 2001, Vanhanen 1999, Elbadawi and Sambanis 2002, Ellingsen 2000, Urdal 2004, Collier and Hoeffler 2004, State 2000, Harff 2003, Fearon 2003, de Soysa 2002b). However, quantitative studies report contradicting results about the importance of the ethnicity in the onset of civil wars. The risk of conflict due to ethnic polarisation is not constant over time as it depends on the actual use of ethnicity in explaining the causes of other social problems. Weinstein 2005 finds even with other factors in play, ethnic differences are used by the groups in conflict for recruitment and mobilisation of ",
        "27 fighters. The operationalisation of the polarisation index also suffers from the poor quality of data sources. The ethnic polarization indicator is called \u201ceponymous\u201d. It is calculated in 2002 and related to the total population at this date (Figure 20). The eponymous ethnic group is that which both claims and gives its name to a territory. In Russian \u00ab titulnyi narod \u00bb (nation, predominant indigenous ethnic group) is the historically predominant group of reference with regard to a particular territory or ethnic based national entity. In Soviet practice this was not necessarily the largest ethnic group but rather that which was the historically preexisting indigenous group and which acquired thereby specific hereditary rights to the territory (i.e Abkhazians are a numerically inferior but nonetheless predominant indigenous group). The eponymous ethnic group has been defined as for each distinct territorial entity (the 3 countries, republics and independent regions by identifying a specific eponymous group: Abkhazia, South Ossetia etc. The percentage is calculated taking into account the eponymous group (Abkhazians are a numerically inferior but nonetheless predominant indigenous group) When there is no autonomous entity, i.e Djavakh\u00e9tie, South Georgia inhabited mainly by Armenians, we consider the eponymous group to be Georgian even though they are in the minority compared to ethnic Armenians. The relevance of this whole debate around eponymy can be seen in Ossetia where some Georgians denied S. Ossetians the right to be classified as eponymous. These Georgians based their rejection on the view that Ossetian territory was located in the north, and regarded the South Ossetian claim as illegitimate. For Dagestan the eponymous population is composed of more than one ethnic group . and there are no autonomous entities. For all the districts of Daghestan we define the eponymous population differently to the practice in some Russian texts. We exclude the Russian population and only include the caucasian and turcophone as indigenous even though their presence in the territory is more or less ancient. Figure 20: Eponymous population in relation to the total figures per district 7.3.4. Religious difference In the Caucasus, there is a clear and direct link between ethnic groups and religion (Figure 21). Most ethnic groups also have a religion which is common to all of the members of that group. In some particular cases, this link is not direct and several religions are practiced by members of one ethnic group. For these cases, the location of the ethnic groups explains the differences in religion between its members. In some circumstances the presence of different ethnic groups inside one district can be a driver of instability. Additionally, enclaves of different religions inside districts can be a factor for ",
        "28 instability. This variable is measured by the ratio of the area covered by the minor group according to the major one (Figure 22). Figure 21: Main ethnic families throughout the Caucasus region (a) in relation to spatial distribution of main religious groups (b) Figure 22: spatial pattern of religious minority enclaves measured per district area by the area occupied by the minor religious group related to the area occupied by the major one 7.3.5. Low economic level/Poverty The relationship between the economic level and the risk of armed conflict could be summarised thus: low economic level denotes a low-capacity government, and as a consequence, higher risk of conflict. Rational choice economists (Collier and Hoeffler 2004, Ostby 2005, Geller 2000, Brecher et al 2000) have argued that poor macro-level economic conditions or their deterioration (slow or no growth) may provide motivation for conflict especially if the costs of rebellion are low. Collier and Hoeffler 2002, Collier and Hoeffler 2004, Fearon 2005, Poe 2006) hypothesize that when the economic situation worsens, internal tensions rise and the risk of conflict does as well. However, Hegre and Sambanis 2006 casts doubt on this claim in a recent sensitivity analysis of 18 robust variables explaining the risk of civil wars. Two variables are usually used to account for the economic factor in conflict studies: the gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP growth rate. GDP per capita can measure the level of available resources per capita --sufficiency\u2014(economy, state capacity) but not distribution equity). GDP per capita can be also be used as a proxy of the capacity of the country to manage conflicts. ",
        "29 The Caucasus study has several different indicators from the INALCO database that can be used as proxies of social welfare level or state capacity. Three are selected as the most relevant: number of doctors, number of cars and number of Telephones. Two criteria help to choose among these three: the degree of correlation and the number of missing values. The number of doctor is the least correlated and the most complete factor to represent the economic level of the population within each district (Figure 23). Figure 23: Number of doctors per inhabitants in 2002 as indicator of economic level 7.3.6. Income disparities The idea of inequality can relate to social status, education and income. For countries this idea can be applied to distribution of income or non-income resources such as land. The most common measure of inequality used so far in quantitative studies is the Global Inequality Index (GINI) which only exists at country level. The GINI coefficient measures the income distribution inside population groups. GINI is a measure of vertical inequality, i.e. inequality between individuals, and is very limited in coverage. There have been conflicting results from both qualitative and quantitative studies (Collier and Hoeffler 2004, Fearon 2003, Hegre et al. 2003, Montalvo 2005, Ostby 2005, Murshed 2004, de Soysa and Neumayer 2003, Ostby 2005). Unfortunately, no GINI data are available at the district level. This indicator is available at the level of the oblast in the Russian Federation in 2004 and at the national level in 2001 for the three other countries (Figure 24). These values are distributed to all districts. Because of the conflict in the oblast of Chechnya, this variable has not been calculated. The country value (0,4) is too high to represent the situation of this oblast, and so the variable is left with missing values for Chechnya. ",
        "30 Figure 24: GINI values as indicator of income disparities at the provincial level 7.4. Political influences 7.4.1. International isolation Some studies suggest also a relationship between trade flows (exports, imports, foreign investment) and the risk of conflict (or instability). The strength of international relations are usually measured by commercial flows (import and export). As for the previous variable, there is no data on these flows for each district. The provincial values are attributed to each district in these regions (external trade in statistics per region in million of US dollars). There are two indicators for this factor (Figure 25 a and b). Figure 25: Import (a) and export (b) values at the provincial level in million of US dollars. 7.4.2. Pressure from outside forces While economic indicators are widely known and measured, there is no quantitative indicator measuring the international and external pressure, especially at the district level. As experts claimed that this factor is important to represent instability, we built an index of spatial international pressure based on the idea that some regions throughout the Caucasus can be identified as more related to either the Russian or NATO sphere of influence. The binary index combines different indicators and varies from -1, when the influence is exerted by Russia, to 1 when the influence is exerted by NATO. ",
        "31 The spatial identification of sphere of influence refers to different sources. Some indicators are derived from three maps from LIMES newspaper (Limes, Rivesta Italiana di Geopolitica, Bimestrale n\u00b06/2004, Caracciolo Lucio, \u201cLa russia in giocco\u201d, Gruppo Editoriale L\u2019Espresso spa, Roma). The spatial delineation of the Russian influence covering Abkazia, Ossetia and Nakhichivan (\u201cIntPres\u201d = -1 in these regions) uses the map entitled \u201cthe Balkans of NATO\u201d (p123). The \u201crings of friends\u201d of NATO including Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan (\u201cNatoFriend \u201c= 1) uses the same source. On the map entitled \u201cFrom the Adriatic Balkans to the Euro-Asiatic ones\u201d, we delineated USA/NATO influence in the Russian Caucasus. This indicator is called \u201cBordPress\u201d and has the value of -1 in this area of Russian pressure while the indicator has the value of 1 in the area of Western influence. The BTC corridor built to create an alternative to the Russian oil and gas monopoly is a third indicator indicating a Western influence (=1). Russian military bases indicate a Russian military influence (Stulalin and Lukin 2002) (\u201cMilBases\u201d=- 1). In order to transform the list of military bases of this source into a spatial indicator, a few geoprocessing steps are necessary: (i) a selection of the settlements which have a military base in the georeferenced INALCO dataset (selection according to the name and the location), (ii) addition of one attribute to these settlements file defining a categorization of the bases (from 1 only troops, 2 = medium size, to 3 hierarchical level of military decision and airtroops), (iii) merging the settlement parts (correction) to have only one settlement name, (iv) transformation of polygons into points to refer to the centroid of the city or village (feature to point), (v) checking of the spatial location of these points inside the districts boundaries (i.e Krimsk), (vi) calculation of the number of points (military bases) per districts. The US bases indicate a Western influence. On LIMES\u2019 second map entitled \u201cFrom the Adriatic Balkans to the Euro-Asiatic ones\u201d, a strategic base of the US is represented in Georgia (\u201cUSBase\u201d=1). The presence of border posts indicates spatially the relevance of this place in military strategy (BordPost=-1). The overall pressure index combines these six indicators (IntPres, NatoFriend, BordPress, USBase, BordPost) with a sum of absolute values (Figure 26). Figure 26: Pressure index combining spatial representation of internation spheres of influences 7.4.3. Perception by local people of factors for potential mobilization This factor should identify districts where people have some reasons for territorial claims. There is no existing indicator for this kind of perception. The spatial extension of a mythic national extension per country (\u201cdreamed lands\u201d) is used in this study as an indicator of potential claims over neighbouring regions. Tsoutsiev represents this mythic extension on three maps from 18 to 20 for the three independent countries (Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia) separately. For the Russian Federation, throughout the region we made the assumption that all the Caucasus was part of the mythical nation, as ",
        "32 it was part of the Soviet territory before 1990. The four area of mythical national extension are then georeferenced (with Afgoye projection), spatially delineated and rasterised to extract the area of claims of each nation per district. The calculation of the perception indicator is the sum of each district surface claimed by one of the four nations. This sum is standardised by a division by four and the final value is rounded at 10 -4 to take into account the precision of the geomodelling processes. These processes are presented in Figure 27. The values of the perception indicator are presented on Figure 28. Figure 27: Scheme of geomodelling processes in the definition of national representation and overlapping areas in these myths Figure 28: perception of mobilization based on a mythic representation of a national territory (source Tsoutsiev) 7.4.4. Existing organising forces (or organised movements) Localised organising movements can be identified spatially, independently from the conflict areas. As they are defined by Tsoutsiev (Map32, 2006), factors driving movement of people can be used to represent spatially the areas of anti-government rebellions on religious or ethnic bases (yellow) and the region of tensions (orange) (Figure 29). To transfer this visual cartographical representation into the geomodel, the GIS modeling processes are (Figure 30): (i) historical map digitalisation of vector boundaries, (ii) identification of parts (as polygons) with as attribute the three colours corresponding to the levels of mobilisation, (iii) feature rasterisation to define the area of these parts, (iv) calculation of ",
        "33 average area of \u201cmobilisation\u201d per district in these three levels and combination of these three values per district. This combination is a weighted sum of the three levels of mobilisation: highest priority for the area in conflict, medium priority for areas identified in tensions and lowest priority for areas in rebellions (yellow). It results in a continuous range of values varying from 0 to 1 (Figure 31b). Figure 29: Identification and delineation of vector boundaries for three levels of anti-government organised movements (Tsoutsiev map 32) Figure 30: Geoprocessing Steps in digitalisation of Tsoustiev Map32 ",

Environment and resources 7.5.1. Competition for cropland Competition for territory and resources is clearly related to the ecological approach to conflict in environmental security studies (B\u00e4chler et al 1995, Homer-Dixon 1999). Urdal (2005) recently tested resource scarcity as opposed to population growth explanations for conflict and did not find strong support for either hypothesis. Nevertheless some scholars consider that one of the root causes of violent conflict is the scarcity of resources (economic, state capacity). With this in mind, GDP per capita is a commonly used measure of conflict probability. Hauge and Ellinsten (1998) integrated Malthusian variables in traditional statistical multivariate models of conflicts and concluded that their effects are significant but less important than political regime or military expenditure. This contradicts the findings of the Malthusian and neo-Malthusian theorists (Homer-Dixon1999, Renner 1996). This indicator is the first in the environmental category. In this last category of indicators, there are a high number of sources or references. The environmental variables use global datasets integrating remote sensing data or statistical information in various way of data integration. The indicator measuring the competition for cropland is a statistical ratio of the available area per cultivation related to the population figures in 2002 for each district (Figure 32). ",
        "35 Figure 32: Competition for cropland measured by the area of cultivation per inhabitants (INALCO) 7.5.2. Extremely low crop yields The level of productivity can be measured either by crop yields or by crop production (Figure 33). In this case, the cereal production figures available for 2002 in the Caucasian dataset (INALCO, 2006) are more stable than the yields. These data are chosen in the model. Figure 33: Cereals production in Tons per 2002 is the indicator of the agricultural productivity within the Caucasus 7.5.3. Land degradation Severe land degradation affects a significant portion of the earth's arable lands, decreasing the wealth and economic development of nations. Land degradation cancels out gains advanced by improved crop yields and reduced population growth. As the land resource base becomes less productive, food security is compromised and competition for dwindling resources increases, the seeds of famine and potential conflict are sown. Often land degradation significantly affects water courses (rivers, wetlands and lakes) with nutrients and contaminants associated with soil, which are delivered in large quantities to environments that respond detrimentally to their input. The major causes of land degradation are: (i) poor farming practice, (ii) deforestation, (iii) livestock, (iv) pollution, (v) irrigation. The major stresses on vulnerable land include: (i) Accelerated soil erosion by wind and water , (ii) Soil acidification or alkalinisation, (iii) Secondary salinisation of soil, (iv) Destruction of soil structure and loss of organic matter . ",
        "36 Land degradation risk was evaluated by analysis of dominant soil properties and relief conditions. The main source of soil data is Soil and Physiographic Database for North and Central EURASIA at 1:5000000 scale (1999). This is an updated version of the Digital Soil Map of the World with the same database structure and uses the same soil classification approach. Additionally, GLASOD (Global Assessment of Soil Degradation) database (Oldeman, 1991) has been used as a source of information about current status of soil degradation. Analysis of the GLOSOD database shows that main types of soil degradation in the region are soil erosion and secondary salinization for irrigated lands. Level of stability of soils and simultaneously potential risk of such kind of degradation mainly depends on such soil properties as texture of surface horizon, humus content, and level of salinity, alkalinity, and sodium content, as well as slope degree information (which is one of the attributes of soil map). Potential risk of degradation was evaluated based on expert analysis of soil classification position and properties. The following rating scale has been used for the analysis: low risk of degradation; 0.5 \u2013 medium risk of degradation; 1 \u2013 high risk of degradation. Each soil mapping unit was evaluated using such rating scale. After that, the results of evaluation were aggregated for administrative districts Figure 34. Figure 34: Land degradation risk indicator 7.5.4. Extreme natural events This indicator takes into account two types of hazards: floods and earthquakes. A flood is an overflow of an expanse of water that submerges land. Flooding can occur if water accumulates across an impermeable surface (e.g. from rainfall) and cannot rapidly dissipate (i.e. gentle orientation or low evaporation). We do not take into consideration coastal floods, estuarine floods, and catastrophic floods (result of natural or artificial hazards). The risk of flooding depends on amount of precipitation, acceleration of climate change, soil texture and slope conditions. The recent discussions on climate change are directly relevant to Caucasus, the risk of unpredicted catastrophic consequences will grow with the melting snow and rainy season. As a result, it has been reported in Georgia that 500 people have died because of landslides or other types of natural disasters between 2006 and 2008 not related to the conflict. For example, in the last 30 years mudflows in the Terek river basin in the north-eastern Caucasus have occurred almost annually. The most destructive mudflows were recorded in 2000 and were perhaps linked to persistent above-average summer temperatures. In September 2002 the Kolka glacier near Mount Kazbek,the highest peak in the eastern Caucasus, collapsed. The water that had accumulated inside and below the glacier triggered an avalanche that travelled more than 24 kilometres at very high speed killing over 120 people.\u201d UNEP (2006). ",
        "37 Risk of flooding was evaluated by analysis of precipitation and relief conditions. The main source of the precipitation data is the output of the global ECMWF (European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting) model. The spatial resolution of the data is 1*1 degree. Decadal precipitation sums were analyzed. The main source of relief data is absolute elevation DB from Space Shuttle Radar Terrain Mission (SRTM) (Jarvis, 2008). The spatial resolution of the data is near 90 m. Analysis of flooding risk has been fulfilled in a number of steps: 1. Analysis of extremes in precipitation data for the period 1974-2007. An amount of precipitation more than 100 mm per decade is considered as extreme. If on average more than 3 decades with extreme amount of precipitation are observed per year, the risk of flooding is considered high, if less the risk is considered as low. 2. Absolute elevation data for the region of investigation were transformed into DEM. Then the potential surface water flow direction and potential surface water accumulation were calculated. High risk of flooding was considered for the regions with potential water accumulation value more than 500. 3. An integral map of potential risk of flooding was received using logical OR operation for two maps created during the previous steps of analysis. 4. The results of analysis were aggregated for administrative districts. The share of lands with high potential risk (from 0 (no lands with high risk) to 1 (all lands with high risk)) was used as criteria of evaluation at district level of generalization (Figure 35). Figure 35: Flooding risk within the Caucasus The Caucasus is located in one of the most active Alpine-Himalayan collision belts. Some of the past events of last two thousands years resulted in deaths, infrastructure damages and environmental destruction (UNEP 2002). Since 1800, over 2000 significant earthquakes have been recorded in the region. Over the past decades several powerful earthquakes of 6-6,5of magnitude have shaken the region. The GSHAP Global Seismic Hazard Map provides earthquakes risks values throughout the region (Figure 36a). This GSHAP map depicts the likely level of short-period ground motion from earthquakes in a fifty-year window (peak ground acceleration - pga). The map colors chosen to delineate the hazard roughly correspond to the actual level of the hazard. The cooler colors represent lower hazard while the warmer colors represent higher hazard. Specifically, white and green correspond to low hazard (0 - 8% g, where g equals the acceleration of gravity); yellow and orange correspond to moderate hazard (8 - 24% g); pink and red correspond to high hazard (24 - 40% g); and dark red and brown correspond to very high hazard (> 40% g). In general, the largest seismic hazard values in the world occur in areas that have been, or are likely to be, the sites of the largest plate boundary earthquakes. The pga values were combined with a shaded relief base map. The cell size of the pga and relief base grids is 0.0833 degrees. The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program ",
        "38 (Grunthal et al. 1999) was launched in 1992 by the International Lithosphere Program (ILP) with the support of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), and endorsed as a demonstration program in the framework of the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (UN/IDNDR). The GSHAP project finished in 1999. Figure 36 a and b: Earthquakes risks as calculated by the Global Seismic Hazard Program (a) and mean values per district (b) The indicator of extreme natural events standardizes gshap mean values per district (Figure 36b) to (0- 1) and calculates the mean with the flooding risk (Figure 37).

Inaccessible This indicator is built in the border permeability model (Stephenne and Pesaresi 2006) and refers to the ease with which an average adult person can walk (Figure 38a). Geographical factors measured by global geodataset are combined to assess a mean value of accessibility per to districts (Figure 38b). ",

Environmental damage Most of industrial infrastructure throughout the Caucasus region is in bad condition because of the low level of maintenance. This brings the assumption of an existing risk of pollution or contamination for the population (Envisec 2004). A spatial overlay of industrial production per district in 2002 and plants localization concludes that all plants are located in areas of production (Figure 39). These statistical data are then chosen as the potential risk of environmental damage related to industrial production. Figure 39: Superposition of statistical information about industrial production and plants localisation 7.5.7. Presence of mineral resources : Political conflict studies have considered natural resources as proxies for greed, grievance, opportunity and willingness in conflict (Collier and Hoeffler 2004, Ross 2004, Urdal 2005). Collier and Hoeffler (1998, 2004) use a proxy variable of natural resources extortion to measure the \u201copportunity\u201d for setting up a rebel organization. Ross (2004) finds evidence of the influence of oil, gemstones, timber and drugs as resources that fuel conflicts. Urdal (2005) recently tested resource scarcity as opposed to population growth explanations for conflict and did not find strong support for either hypothesis. Recent studies suggest that the relationship between natural resources and the risk of conflict depends on the nature of the resources. ",
        "40 In this study a relationship is assumed between the presence of minerals and the presence of gas or oil pipelines or energy infrastructures. The sum of length of pipelines for each district is calculated on the INALCO pipeline data (respectively on gas pipelines, and oil Pipelines). Within a district, the presence of a refinery and/or the existence of major crossing points in pipelines are also considered as indicators of risk in the mineral resources characteristics (Figure 40). The combination of these two spatial elements is integrated per district (Figure 41). Figure 40a, b, c and d: main gas pipeline (a), main oil pipelines (b), number of main crossing point in these networks (c) and number of refineries (d) are combined per district to measure the presence of minerals ",

Presence of transboundary resources In districts with international border, the length of rivers as well as the lake areas indicates the amount of water resources that could potentially be the subject of dispute in political decisionmaking processes (Figure 45).

A Statistical model While the multicriteria model (section 9) and the expert consultation started from the drivers identified in the literature, the statistical model starts from the list of variables to identify the most relevant ones. It integrates statistical indicators provided by the geopolitical atlas dataset \u201cCaucasian dataset\u201d (Radvanyi, INALCO, 2006) to explain the level of conflict/instability in the Caucasus region. The statistical variables refer to demographic, ethnical, socio-economic and agricultural information. Table 9 lists these socio-economic parameters available for the homogenous \u201cdistrict\u201d units, corresponding to different levels in the hierarchy of administrative ones. Table 9: Socio-economic data available at the district level Statistical data at the district level Dates Total population 1989/ 1995/ 2002/ 2005 Urban and rural population 1989/ 1995 /2002 Ethnic composition 1989 /2002 Birth and death rates (births/1000 inhabitants) 1995 /2002 Infant death rate (deaths/1000 births) 1995 /2002 Weddings and divorce (nbr/1000 inhabitants) 1995 /2002 Agricultural surfaces (cereals, vegetables, potatoes, technical cultures, vineyards, irrigated) (ha) 1995 /2002 ",

The Caucasian dataset provides clues to analyze the socio- economical evolution between the beginning and the end of the recent instability period. Although political cleavages in the Caucasus often mirror ethnic divisions, these disputes are also seen as much as economic and political conflicts as ethnic conflicts. Results are compared to the assumption claiming ethnicity as a major relevant driver of instability in the region. Given its patchwork of ethnic diversity, perhaps no part of the former Soviet Union provides more fertile ground for inter-ethnic strife than the Caucasus region (Arutiunov 1998). 8.1. Method The logistic regression approach has been widely used in global conflict risk studies (see e.g. Beck et al., 2000; Bennett and Stam, 2000; Goldstone et al., 2000; Elbadawi and Sambanis, 2002). These studies aim to find the relation between the risk of conflict (dependent variable or response) and a given set of indicators (independent variables or factors). This model uses the same approach to assess the political instability risk (dependent variable) at the district level in the Caucasus region. The regression model estimates conflict risks with a regional extent using data for sub-national administrative units. The dependent variable is binary and identifies the existing instability in the region as 0 for stable districts and 1 for instable districts (Figure 46). Were classified as instable the districts where conflicts have occurred in the last 20 years and areas characterized by local tensions or potential instability as defined by expert knowledge (Beroutchachvili and Radvanyi, 1996). ",
        "45 Figure 46: Integration of two conflict levels defined by Radvanyi in a binary variable of instability The model integrates 30 indicators which are either demographic, societal or indexes (Table 10). Three criteria were used to select the relevant set of indicators: low number of missing values, low correlation, and/or hypothesis deduced from an in-depth review of conflict studies (Stephenne et al. forthcoming). Two censuses (1989/2002) provide data before and after the most recent conflicts in the region for (i) integrating indicators from two dates, or (ii) calculating the change in-between the available indicators. After checking the variable distribution, logarithmic transformation and normalization were applied to some data for variance stabilization. The prefix \u201cl\u201d is added to the variable name when there is a logarithmic transformation. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method used, is that recommended for imputing continuous variables with an arbitrary missing data pattern (Schafer and Olsen, 1998) Twenty-two structural indicators cover the demographic and socio-economic aspects of instability (population size -lpop02-, population density -ldensity02-, urban population -city-, infant mortality rate in 2002 -infantdeat02- and 1995 -mortinf95-, mortality level in 2002 -death02- and 1995 -mort_95-, and several economic variables such as the industrial and agricultural production, the numbers of doctors, cars or phones are used to give present an overall picture of the societal structure\u2013 linprod / lagricprod / ldoctors / ldoctors95 / lcars / lcars95 / ltelefony-). The last category of indicators captures the ethnic polarization of the population: ethnic polarization - rq02 and rq89 -, ethno-linguistic fractionalization - elf89 and elf02 - and ratio of the main \u201ceponymous\u201d ethnic group of this area related to the population of other groups: what is called the \u2018eponymous\u2019 population - epopop02 and epopop89-. Eight environmental and territorial risk indicators are added to the socio-demographic ones. Number of borders and length of these borders represent the border effects (Wesley 1962, Furlong et al. 2006). A spatial decision support model provides six environmental factors of risk (Stephenne and Zeug 2007). This model assesses the permeability based on a presumed cost/opportunity behavioural strategy. The suitability of terrain for walking is related to the presence of water barriers (rivers, and lakes) - nw-wat -, to the corridor of fast progression in terms of infrastructures - nw-infr-stat \u2013, to the difficulties related to the progression in mountainous regions according to the slope and the altitude (elevation) - nw_altsl -, to the environmental conditions of the weather \u2013 nw_weat - for which both the snow thickness and the average temperature are taken into account. Another indicator integrates these specific dimensions in the risk of \u201cwalking\u201d \u2013 nw_walk -. The n_hide indicator calculates a risk of being near urbanized areas where the easiness of interaction is higher. ",

Results A rate of 98% of complete observations is an excellent start in a modeling process, especially for a conflict region. The convergence criterion is satisfied and the overall model-fitting statistic is acceptable especially with the complexity of this political subject taken into account. The coefficient of determination R 2 , adjusted according to Nagelkerke (1991) of 0.6 is a high level of reliability for political science. The percentage of concordance rises to a comfortable value of 90.7. The small Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics (Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000) states an overall good fitting for the model (8 DF). Maximum likelihood estimates (Table 11) show highest values of association with the instability levels for ethnic factors and lowest values for environmental ones. There is a clear pattern of high estimates for ethnic indicators and very low for environmental ones.

The model is then reduced by stepwise selection of factors to retain only the most significative. In the stepwise selection, the two first indicators are the eponymous ratio and the death rate in 2002 (Table 12). This identifies these two factors as the most relevant in the Caucasus instability model and the second important result of this modeling exercise. The coefficient of determination R 2 reaches the stage of 0.5 after the selection of these two variables and the difference with the final R 2 is minimal. The relation between the main ethnicity and the total population (eponymy) is definitively the most important factor in the definition of the instability in the Caucasus region. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (Figure 47) at each variable selection step confirm that the first indicator explains a large part of the fitness. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) which measures the performance of the model to predict the response variable reaches already 0.88 after the inclusion of two factors related to the eponymy and demography. The two other indicators selected are the population density in 2002 and the eponymous population in 1989. They slightly increase the AUC but argue for the importance of the ethnic factor in adding the 1989 values in the selection.

This spatial representation depicts patterns of instability at the borders between independent countries as well as Russian independent regions.

        "49 9. A multicriteria model (Common GIS) 9.3. Method It is beyond the scope and intention of this paper to document the range of formal multicriteria analysis (MCA) techniques available. This has adequately been done elsewhere (see, for example, Eastman et al., 1993; Jannsen 1992; and Voogd, 1983). However, this section begins with a short introduction to the technique in the context of the Caucasus project. Multicriteria analysis or multiobjective decision making is a type of decision analysis tool that is particularly applicable to cases where a single-criterion approach (e.g. cost-benefit analysis) falls short, especially where significant environmental and social impacts cannot be assigned monetary values. MCA allows decision makers to include a full range of social, environmental, technical, economic, and financial criteria. MCA methods involve either qualitative or quantitative weighting, scoring or ranking of criteria in terms of their importance to either a single or multiple set of objectives. MCA describes any structured approach used to determine overall preferences among alternative options, where the options accomplish several objectives. In MCA, desirable objectives are specified and corresponding attributes or indicators are identified. The actual measurement of indicators is often based on quantitative analysis (through scoring, ranking and weighting) of a wide range of qualitative impact categories and criteria. Different environmental and social indicators may be developed side by side with economic costs and benefits. MCA provides techniques for comparing and ranking different outcomes, even though a variety of indictors are used. MCA includes a range of related techniques. Some concepts are fundamental to better understand the multicriteria discourse: \u2022 Criterion: A criterion is the basis for evaluation. It is a function that associates each action with a number, indicating its desirability according to consequences. 1 Criteria may be further classified into goals (or targets) and objectives but in the context of this project it is not necessary because we are using the MCA for the evaluation of a complex problem. \u2022 Dominance relation : An action a dominates an action b if a is at least as good as b for all the criteria taken into consideration and much better than b for at least one criterion. \u2022 Efficient action : An action a\u00ceA is efficient if there is no action b in A which dominates a . The concept of efficiency can easily be illustrated graphically (Figure 49). Alternative c performs better than b in all respects and, therefore, c is preferred to b . The same can be said for b compared to a . Thus, only c and d are efficient alternatives. It has to be noted that efficiency does not imply that every efficient solution is to be always preferred over every non-efficient solution; e.g., the non efficient alternatives a and b are preferable to the efficient alternative d if the second criterion would receive a high priority compared to the first . 1 In formal terms, a criterion g is a function defined on the set A of potential actions, so that the comparison of the two numbers g(a) and g(b) allows us to describe and/or argue the result of the comparison of a and b , in relation to the point of view underlying the definition of g . According to Bouyssou (1990), a criterion is a real- valued function on the set A of alternatives, such that it appears meaningful to compare two alternatives a and b according to a particular point of view, on the single basis of the two numbers g(a) and g(b) . ",
        "50 Figure 49: Efficiency in a two-dimensional case In the context of the Caucasus project, MCA helps to compare several districts (355) in a virtual space built by five criteria, so called \u201cinstability categories\u201d. In order to evaluate the dominance characteristics among them, we described and measured each criterion according to the aggregation of a number of indicators, the so called \u201cfactors of instability\u201d. These factors of instability have been thoroughly discussed and submitted to experts in our survey (Table 3). In the section describing the results, the relative importance of each criterion will be assessed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). CommonGIS has been chosen to perform and to illustrate a MCA characterized by spatial differences and geographical distribution of its elements. This method section explains the methodological choices in reference to the concepts, the tools and the particular assumptions adopted in the Caucasus multicriteria model. 9.3.1. Composite indicators In general terms, an indicator is a quantitative or a qualitative measure derived from a series of observed facts that can reveal relative positions (e.g., of a country or a district in our case) in a given dimensional space. The main assumption of the Caucasus project is the quantitative approach. Even if the measurement of some factors is either binary or derived from expert knowledge, the final value is a figure. A composite indicator is a compilation of individual indicators into a single index on the basis of an underlying model. The composite indicator should ideally measure multi-dimensional concepts which cannot be captured by a single indicator alone, e.g., such as industrial competitiveness, sustainable development, quality of life assessment, globalization and innovation (see Cox and others 1992, Huggins 2003, Wilson and Jones 2002, Guerard 2001, F\u00e4re et al. 1994, Lovell et al 1995, Griliches 1990 and Saisana and Tarantola 2002, among others). The multi-dimensional concept studied in this project is the instability in the Caucasus region. The assumption behind this index development is that the literature review as well as the expert consultation provided an overall complete picture of all dimensions of the instability in the particular region. A general objective of most of these composite indicators is the ranking of countries according to some aggregated dimensions (see Cherchye, 2001 and Kleinknecht et al. 2002). Composite indicators which compare country performance are increasingly recognised as a useful tool in policy analysis and public communication. They provide simple comparisons of countries that can be used to illustrate complex and sometimes elusive issues in wide ranging fields, e.g., environment, economy, society or technological development. These indicators often seem easier to interpret by the general public than finding a common trend in many separate indicators and have proven useful in benchmarking country performance. In the Caucasus project, the \u201ccountries\u201d are the 355 district units. The interest of this choice rests on the growing consensus in international studies that to be able to study current conflicts ",
        "51 \u2013 that are, by and large, civil conflicts (O\u2019Loughlin 2005, Restrepo et al. 2005) \u2013 variables should be available at sub-national level (Hauge and Ellingsten 1998). However, composite indicators can send misleading policy messages if they are poorly constructed or misinterpreted. Their \"big picture\" results may invite users (especially policy makers) to draw simplistic analytical or policy conclusions. Instead, composite indicators must be seen as a starting point for initiating discussion and attracting public interest. Their relevance should be gauged with respect to constituencies affected by the composite index. Knowing the potential risks of this aggregation method, the Caucasus project is largely founded on a deep collaboration with regional experts. Jean Radvanyi and Ieva Rucevska have been involved in all model building steps, from the data collection, the dataset harmonization, the experts list definition, the indicators and criteria assumptions until the last step of this participatory experience, the final workshop in January. On January 12 2009, this report will be presented and intensively discussed with a panel of scientists from political studies as well as technologists. The assumptions and results of the multicriteria model will be submitted to their approval to interpret and comment on the \u201cbig picture\u201d. Table 13: Main pros and cons of using composite indicators (Saisana and Tarantola, 2002) Composite indicators are much like mathematical or computational models. As such, their construction owes more to the craftsmanship of the modeller than to universally accepted scientific rules for encoding. As for models, the justification for a composite indicator lies in its fitness to the intended purpose and peer acceptance (Rosen, 1991). A typical composite indicator, I , is built as follow s (OECD, 2003): where x i is a normalised variable and w i a weight attached to x i , with 9.3.2. Method used to generate composite indicators The procedures used in the Caucasus project are adapted from an OECD handbook (OECD 2005) ",
        "52 Step 1. Developing a theoretical framework After Step 1. the constructor should have\u2026 \u2022 A clear understanding and definition of the multidimensional phenomenon to be measured. \u2022 A nested structure of the various sub-groups of the phenomenon. \u2022 A list of selection criteria for the underlying variables, e.g., input, output, process. \u2022 Clear documentation of the above. Two major sources provided the basis of the overall theoretical model of instability in the Caucasus region. The first source is the Atlas of the geopolitical context of Caucasus edited by J. Radvanyi and N. Beruchashvili (1997). This study described spatially the specific geopolitical context of this particular region. This work, the related geodataset and the updating of this large piece of work is the main inspiration of the instability model. The long-term collaboration with J. Radvanyi, geopolitical expert on this region for the last thirty years, guided the model development from the beginning until the end. The second source of information is a large literature review of quantitative conflict analysis, with territory considered as one of the most important driving forces for conflict (Stephenne, Burnley, Ehrlich forthcoming in International Studies Review in 2009). In this paper, the authors discussed and proposed a GIS approach of conflict and security. This approach is applied in the context of the Caucasus regional complex and modified by an expert consultation. The multi dimensions called \u201cthe factors of instability\u201d defined through the literature review, have been discussed and agreed by the collaborators. The expert consultation provided the agreement of a 50 member expert panel on the list of factors proposed. Only minor modifications have been discussed in section 6 (Table 6: ). Step 2. Selecting variables After Step 2. the constructor should have\u2026 \u2022 Checked the quality of the available indicators. \u2022 Discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each selected indicator. \u2022 Made scale adjustments, if necessary. \u2022 Created a summary table on data characteristics, e.g., availability (across country, time), source, type (hard, soft or input, output, process) This report describes in detail the indicators selected and built to quantify the factors of instability. The geomodelling steps are described in detail to allow the reader to understand the meaning of the figures for each factor. However, as described in detail in Stephenne and Macdonald (2007), it is challenging to make an assessment of input data in a conflict region covering 4 different nations with their own individual ways of collecting statistical data. This report evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively the adequacy of the Caucasian dataset with the objective of developing an overall model of instability. It followed a structured quality assessment protocol (Johnston et al. 1999) and consolidated the dataset by GIS topological techniques. The current report is then largely founded on the findings in Stephenne and Macdonald (2007). The overall estimation of the dataset quality limits its use to a scale lower than 1:500000. This result is in harmony with the multicriteria approach which aims to rank the districts throughout the region. Step 3. Normalisation of data Normalisation is required prior to any data aggregation, as the indicators in a data set often have different measurement units. However the selection of a suitable method, is not trivial and deserves special attention. The normalization method should take into account the data properties, as well as the objectives of the composite indicator. Different normalization methods will yeld different results. After Step 3, the constructor should have \u2026 \u2022 Selected the appropriate normalisation procedure(s) with reference to the theoretical framework and to the properties of the data. ",
        "53 \u2022 Documented and explained the selected normalisation procedure and the results. The indicator standardisation applied in the Caucasus model varies from one indicator to the other (Table 14). Most of the time, the simple maximum and minimum stretch is used to standardise values between 0 and 1.

        "54 Step 4. Weighting and aggregation When used in a benchmarking framework, weights have a significant effect on the overall composite indicator and the country rankings. A number of weighting techniques exists. Some are derived from statistical models, such as factor analysis, data envelopment analysis and unobserved components models (UCM) or from participatory methods like budget allocation (BAL), analytic hierarchy processes (AHP) and conjoint analysis (CA). No matter which method is used, weights are essentially value judgements. While some analysts might choose weights based only on statistical methods, others might reward or punish the components that are deemed more or less influential depending on expert opinion, to better reflect the policy priorities or theoretical factors. Most composite indicators rely on equal weighting (EW), i.e. , all variables are given the same weight. This could correspond to the case in which all variables are \u201cworth\u201d the same in the composite but also it could disguise the absence of statistical or empirical basis, e.g. when there is insufficient knowledge of causal relationships or a lack of consensus on the alternative. In any case, equal weighting does not mean \"no weights\", but implicitly implies the weights are equal. Moreover, if variables are grouped into components and those further aggregated into the composite, then applying equal weighting to the variables may imply an unequal weighting of the component (the components grouping the larger number of variables will have higher weight). This could result in an unbalanced structure of the composite index. After Step 4 the constructor should have \u2026 \u2022 Selected the appropriate weighting and aggregation procedure(s) with reference to the theoretical framework. \u2022 Considered the possibility of using multiple procedures \u2022 Documented and explained the weighting and aggregation procedures selected. The AHP weighing method has our preference in this experiment because of the objective of the participatory approach. Section 6 has described the analysis of replies to our questionnaire. AHP weights have been evaluated in the expert consultation (see following section). Experts provided a pairwise comparison of the five categories (Table 7). In the questionnaire experts have also been asked to define their levels of agreement with all the list of instability factors, and to rate the 29 instability factors (Table 5: ). This set of preferences is applied in parallel to the AHP weighting procedure in the results part of this section. In order to compare these visual results and to better understand their meaning, the categories are also combined using equal weights. These three types of weighting procedures are presented in this report. They will be further discussed during the next January workshop. This meeting will be an opportunity to refine these weights according to expert reactions to the visual final results as well as to the sensibility analysis of these weights. Step 5. Robustness and sensitivity Several judgment calls have to be made when constructing composite indicators, e.g. on the selection of indicators, data normalisation, weights and aggregation methods, etc. The robustness of the composite indicators and the underlying policy messages may thus be contested. A combination of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses can help gauge the robustness of the composite indicator and improve transparency. After Step 5, the constructor should have\u2026 \u2022 Identified the sources of uncertainty in the development of the composite indicator . \u2022 Assessed the impact of the uncertainties/assumptions on the final result. \u2022 Conducted sensitivity analysis of the inference, e.g. to show what sources of uncertainty are more influential in determining the relative ranking of two entities. Knowing the difficulties of measuring instability in this political context, the Caucasian dataset (Radvanyi, INALCO, 2006) manages to provide an overall picture of a large set of indicators. ",
        "55 However some of the instability factors defined by either by the literature and the experts are not available in this dataset and are more subject to uncertainty. These indicators are the following: 9.3.3. Analytic Hierarchy Processes (AHP) technique for weight assessment Forman et al. (1983) defines the AHP as a compensatory decision methodology. \u201cAlternatives that are not efficient with respect to one or more objectives can compensate by their performance with respect to other objectives. (\u2026) In particular, AHP as weighting method enables decision-makers to derive weights as opposed to arbitrarily assign them.\u201d Weights represent the trade-off across indicators. They measure the willingness to forego a given variable in exchange for another. Hence, they are not importance coefficients. This could create a misunderstanding, if AHP weights are interpreted as importance coefficients The core of AHP is an ordinal pair-wise comparison of attributes. For a given objective, the comparisons are made per pairs of sub-indicators: Which of the two is the more important? And how much is it more important? The preference is expressed on a semantic scale of 1 to 9. A preference of 1 indicates equality between two sub-indicators, while a preference of 9 indicates that the sub-indicator is 9 times more important than the other one. The results are represented in a comparison matrix, where Aii = 1 and Aij = 1 / Aji. In the expert survey described in Section 6, we administered a questionnaire. The comparison of each of the 5 categories of factors to all the others (2 by 2, or pairwise comparison) is the last part of the questionnaire. The idea was to measure the relative influence of each category on instability. We proposed an example to the experts: if you think that Conflict History is much more important than Proximity/ Border effect, indicate this by putting a \u201c7\u201d in the empty space on the 1 st line. -9 -7 -5 -3 1 3 5 7 9 Least important Extremely unimportant Unimportant Moderately unimportant Equally important Moderately important Important Extremely important Most important Comparison (left to right) Conflict history Proximity/ Border effect Conflict history Population Conflict history Political Influences Conflict history Environment and resources Proximity/ Border effect Population Proximity/ Border effect Political Influences Proximity/ Border effect Environment and resources Population Political Influences Population Environment and resources Political Influences Political influences The results of this exercise identified huge difficulties in the consistency of the points of view. Inconsistency is part of the human nature and people's beliefs are often not consistent. For example, if one claims that A is much more important than B, B slightly more important than C, and C slightly more important than A, his/her judgment is inconsistent and the results are less trustworthy. The number of consistent pairwise comparisons is only 8 out of 45. It could be sufficient for our purposes simply to measure the degree of inconsistency so that the results could be acceptable in the public eye. For a matrix of size Q X Q, only Q\u20131 comparisons are required to establish weights for Q indicators. The actual number of comparisons performed in AHP is Q(Q\u2013 1)/2. This is computationally costly, but results in a set of weights that is less sensitive to errors of judgement. In addition, the redundancy allows for a measure of judgement errors, an inconsistency ",
        "56 ratio. Small inconsistency ratios do not drastically affect the weights (Saaty, 1980; Karlsson, 1998) - The suggested rule-of-thumb is less than 0.1, although 0.2 is often cited. 9.4. Results As described above, in this project many different geographical sets of data are combined. In a participatory approach, a system for map-based visualization of these data is required in order to set up the collaboration between experts. CommonGIS provides visualizations of geo-referenced data through a user-friendly interface for both novice and more expert users. It combines a range of statistical and spatial analysis (choropleth maps, pie charts, bar charts, time graphs, maps with time- diagrams and animated maps...) and includes computational decision support tools, which are useful in multicriteria analysis (i.e. selection, prioritization, and integration of decision options). This tool (i) facilitates visual thinking, (ii) interactively explores and analyses geo-referenced data and (iii) helps decision making in a spatio-temporal context. 9.4.1. Instability criteria These results present the multicriteria model using the AHP results of the consistent answers to the expert survey. These maps will be submitted to a group of experts at the workshop of the 12 th of January. Thereafter, the maps should be considered as a first attempt to visualise the expert\u2019s AHP weighting and to compare these weightings with equal weights as well as a mean preference calculated based on the rating expressed in the survey (Table 3). The set of maps below has to be discussed in detail and refined according to expert and reader comments. The list of instability indicators assessed by the regional experts participating to our survey is divided in five criteria or categories of drivers represented in Figure 50 a, b, c, d and e. ",
        "57 Figure 50 a, b, c, d and e: Five criteria or categories of instability measured in the geomodel: conflict history (a), border effect (b), population (c), political influences (d) and environment and resources (e). The visualisation tool maps these five categories with the same classification thresholds. It allows a visual understanding of the specific spatial patterns for each criteria (Figure 51). While previous maps presented the same data, the contiguous representation adds simultaneity to the comparison. However, it creates also some artefacts such as the over representation of low values in the first category (conflict history). This is related to the fact that this criteria is mainly measured by binary indicators. Most of the districts have a \u201c0\u201c value. While the continuous gradient of colours in Figure 50 provides a smooth effect adapted to continuous values, the simultaneous representation of Figure 51 uses a positive/negative colour scheme. The reader sometimes needs to look carefully at these two sets of maps representing identical information in order to become familiar to this type of classification and map. The automatic classification is interesting because it allows fast, interactive changes in the discussion but has some shortcomings in readability. Figure 51: Multiple map representation of the five categories of instability ",
        "58 These categories of indicators combine indicators with the same weight. However, the experts assessed a level of agreement to each of these drivers of instability in the first table of the questionnaire (Table 3). Taking into account the ratings for these indicator creates a new set of categories that are presented in Figure 52. While in general the spatial patterns are relatively similar, there are some differences. In particular the criterion of \u201cborder effect\u201d has a less sparse classification. This is related to the final weight attributed to each indicator in the specific category. While the AHP weights are 35% for the conflict history category and only 8% for the border effect, each indicator has a weight that is four times higher for the conflict history category compared to the border effect category. By contrast, when the average rates estimated by the experts are used to calculate the criteria, the standardised weights for each indicator can differ greatly. In particular, the indicator called \u201cexisting conflict in neighbouring regions\u201d is rated at the same level as most of the indicators belonging to the category \u201cconflict history\u201d. Because of the high importance of this indicator in the \u201cborder effect\u201d, the spatial pattern of this particular criterion on Figure 52 shows some similarity with the first criterion addressing the conflict pattern.

        "59 9.4.2. Composite indicator of instability The multi-dimensional and composite indicator that should represent the instability in the Caucasus is calculated by a mathematical combination of these categories. As described in details in the methodological section, there are several steps in the development of a composite index. There are also various methods of aggregating and weighting indicators. In this study, we choose to compare two methods: the equal weights where the assumption is that all categories are \u201cworth\u201d the same (Figure 53) and the AHP that fits to the participatory approach based on expert judgement (Figure 54). However, in this first method, if the categories have the same importance, the indicators themselves are also identically distributed. Therefore, the information from the instability factor ratings is missing from both methods. These ratings provide a new set of categories that is compared with the two other methods of indicator composition (Figure 55 and Figure 56). In the figures below, you can see the weights for each category on the left side. The network of lines illustrates the profile of each district according to these weights. At the bottom, all the districts lines end on the scale of ranking. Each district is then attributed with a rank. These ranks are classified in four categories on the respective maps. Figure 53: Composite indicator of instability using equal weights between the five criteria ",
        "60 Figure 54: Composite indicator of instability using the AHP weights defined by regional experts between the five criteria The first interpretation of these three sets of weightings is a strong similarity in the highest class of instable districts. The districts coloured in dark red on the three maps include the entire Caucasus mountain zone with the autonomous regions but also the bordering areas between Georgia and Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabagh, the Nakhichivan and the bordering districts between Azerbaijan and Iran. The importance of the regional autonomous claims and instability or tensions areas (Figure 6) is manifest. This similarity validates the relevance of our model to represent the instability in the overall region. However, while the delimitation of the regional autonomies or instability is binary, this multicriteria index gives a continuous range of values in the measure of instability. The maps use thresholds to represent classes of instability but the figures below provide a ranking of all districts according to their level of instability. The discussion with experts should allow identifying which parts of the Caucasus, and which districts are not classified at the right level. But this map already focuses both on the areas where the risk of instability is higher and on the areas where this risk is low. The central part of Krasnodar and Stavropol Oblast are not unstable regions (classified in blue), while all bordering districts between Georgia and the Russian federation are at high level of instability. The other interest of comparing these maps is the identification of dissimilarities. If some districts are classified always in the same class, it means that the representation is stable. When this district change ",
        "61 from one class to another, it is interesting to better understand the rank of this district in all the indicators to identify the reasons for the variation. Figure 55: Composite indicator of instability using the average of the rates defined by regional experts for each indicator and equal weights for the categories ",
        "62 Figure 56: Composite indicator of instability using the average of the rates defined by regional experts for each indicator and AHP weights for the categories 9.4.3. Sensitivity analysis All science, empirical or theoretical, is never fully validated because all knowledge is related to the particular context and time (Levins 1966). The sensitivity analysis is one of the methods that can, in combination with other tests and simulation, provide a level of confidence in the validity of the model, in this case the capacity to represent the instability in the Caucasus region. The sensitivity of the model is calculated by comparing a wide range of changes in the weights chosen. Analysis of the changes in results related to changes in weights allows us to estimate what are the potential variations of weights. The most interesting part of this analysis is where the values are the more uncertain. This analysis should identify (i) the weights that are the most important in the model, (ii) the stable regional spatial pattern at the district level, (iii) and the specific regions and districts that are the more sensitive to the modifications and then more uncertain in their ranking. CommonGis provides a fast and efficient sensitivity analysis related to the AHP weights defined by the experts and introduced to build the composite indicator. This tool executes a fixed number of iterations in a range of values around the weight. In the Caucasus model, we ask for 50 iterations (Figure 57). To illustrate the sensitivity analysis, we use the last set of values: the average of the rates defined by regional experts for each indicator and equal weights for the five criteria. At the end of the iterations, Figure 58a represents the districts that are always classified either as low or high ranked. These extremes values are stable in the range of changes of the sensitivity analysis. Figure 58b identifies the districts which vary in their ranking position. These are more uncertainly defined by the model. Their classification as instable or less unstable is variable. The analysis of these particular districts is the most interesting part of the participatory approach. The discussion with experts should focus on these areas to understand the variability and meaning of the results. ",

These districts are a smaller set of the more uncertain rankings presented in Figure 58b. Figure 60 could be seen as a summary of the iterations process, the average value of the ranks. This map is the stable composite indicator of our instability model in the Caucasus region.

Mapping of Event Data This section analyses the potential interest of news event data in a spatial model of instability in the Caucasus region. In particular, it describes the interest of mapping event data at the district level over the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict, which is one of the frozen conflicts of the region. Event data is used to study political behavior in a systematic way. World Events Interaction Survey WEIS (McClelland and Charles 1976) and Conflict and Peace Data Bank (Azar, 1980) are early ",
        "65 examples of event data collections. International Relations studies use this event data to try to answer the question \u201cwho did what to whom?\u201d (Schrodt and Gerner 1997). Reporters collect and record politically relevant events and actors from local, national and international news to create large N event data sets, which can be quantitatively analyzed for early warning purposes. 10.1. The FAST Methodology FAST was the early warning and early action project of the Swiss Development and Cooperation Agency, swisspeace. The project systematically collected and recorded politically relevant events. The FAST early warning methodology was to set up locally based participatory networks made up of field reporters and coders. (Krummenacher and Schmeidl 1999). The reporters used news and other publicly available sources for their reports, or relied on their knowledge of events in their country. FAST collected event data in the format: \u2018date of event \u2013 source of event \u2013 event type 2 \u2013 target of event\u2019. Field reporters were guided in their selection of relevant events by a detailed coding manual. The same coding manual was used to guide the coding process, when the information about the event was transformed into code. FAST coders recorded a short description of the event at hand, and additional information like event location and geographic scope of the event. FAST Country Coordinators coded the data according to the IDEA event typology and entered it into a centrally administered database located in Bern, Switzerland. Quality control was carried out by country coders and by a country responsible at FAST headquarters in Bern. FAST collected event data in the format: \u2018date of event \u2013 source of event \u2013 event type 3 \u2013 target of event\u2019. FAST coders recorded a short description of the event at hand, and additional information on both the initiator and the recipients of an event (geographical association, social sector affiliation and literal name), event location, geographic scope of the event, information source and credibility of the information, number of injuries or deaths, degree of damage, and specific topics relevant in the case of any given event. FAST Country Coordinators coded the data according to the IDEA event typology and entered it into a centrally administered database located in Bern, Switzerland. The coded data on each event was accompanied by a short description of the event. Quality control was carried out by country coders and by a country responsible at FAST headquarters in Bern. 10.2. Uses of Event Data Event data sets such as that produced by FAST can be quantitatively analyzed for early warning purposes. In countries or regions where press coverage is low and inconsistent, as in the Caucasus, event data is particularly interesting for early warning purposes. Two features of FAST are particularly relevant in a spatial, subnational study of instability such as the Caucasus Instability Project. Firstly, FAST focused on events at sub national level and secondly, the project used a standard methodology which tried to put a geographical location to each event. It is thus possible to map Fast data. Event data can illustrate the spatial features of instability. Gleditsch and Ward, 2005 point out: \u201cVisualisation can help reveal spatial patterns and maps display, identify and highlights trends in political data.\u201d Importantly, event datasets such as that created by FAST can provide a subnational geographical picture of the intensity of conflict. Buhaug and Rod, 2005 pointed out the interest to investigate \u201cdeterminants of violence that occur at local level.\u201d The Caucasus Instability project follows Hauge and Ellingsten 1998, Wood and Milefsky 2002, Starr 2003, O\u2019Loughin 2003, in using variables at sub- national level. FAST data has been used to produce maps of events in Nagorno-Karabagh (Figure: Nagorno-Karabagh map) The usefulness of event data is determined by the quality of the data, and in particular, on consistent classification of events. The training of human coders is critical due to the complexity of the FAST coding scheme. Due to the long training time changes in coding schemes cannot be implemented 2 IDEA coding scheme (Bond et al. 2003); http://www.vranet.com/idea. 3 IDEA coding scheme (Bond et al. 2003); http://www.vranet.com/idea. ",
        "66 easily. This point is relevant for any changes to the location coding. There is some selection bias introduced when the coders decide which events to report and how they code the selected events. Although subjective bias and inconsistencies can be somewhat reduced by training, supervision and quality control \u2013 they may not be completely eliminated. 10.3. Armenia/Azerbaijan dataset analysis The Fast project provided a database covering events occurring in 2006 in the Nagorno Karabagh territory as well as in Armenia and Azerbaijan, the two countries involved in the conflict. The dataset covers 4482 events in these two countries from 2002 to 2007. Several modifications have been made to this dataset to harmonize the data prior to mapping. 10.3.1. Reporter and time selection Seventeen reporters are involved in coding Armenian and Azeri events. However, there are clear differences in the amount of news integrated by each of these reporters. Four reporters record 98% of these events. These reporters are called : \u201cArmeniaReporter\u201d \u2013ArR-, \u201cAzerbaijanReporter\u201d \u2013AzR-, \u201cKarabakhReporter\u201d \u2013KR- and \u201cNagornoKarabakhReporter\u201d- NKR-. The others thirteen account for less than 3% (108 events) in the total amount of information. As these 108 events make up a very low percentage of the total they were not included in the mapping analysis. Fifty-six events (1.2%) are recorded from April 2004 to January 2006. The four main reporters, both Azeri and Armenian, do not report these events and appear in the database after 2006. From 2006, only 42 events are still coded by 7 of the 13 external reporters throughout the period, with a noticeable increase between March 2007 and June 2007. These events are not considered in the mapping database 10.3.2. Regional reporter structure (Source: personal communication, FAST) Country Coordinators are responsible for the coding of events related to their country. The Country Coordinator for Azerbaijan (AzR) and Armenia (ArR) are respectively based in Baku and Yerevan. In Nagorno-Karabakh, two field monitors, NKR and KR, report to both Country Coordinators in Armenia and in Azerbaijan. Events are then entered in the database by 4 different people located either in the capital of the country or within the secessionist region of the NK. As with all manual coding, there could be some selection bias introduced when the coders decide which events to report and how they code the selected events. Although subjective bias and inconsistencies can be somewhat reduced by training, supervision and quality control, they may not be completely eliminated. The 4 reporters have either Armenian (ArR and NKR) or Azeri (AzR and KR) nationality. As the population in the autonomous region is mainly Armenian and communication between both sides is still difficult, an Azeri should presumably encounter difficulties in staying in this region. There is no information about these potential difficulties in the link between the Azeri field monitor (KR) and the Azeri coordinator based in Baku (AzR). For this reason, the records attached to the KR reporter have been scrutinized in the data analysis. In the case of Azerbaijan, a check of all events reported by the KR identified 207 events with the same content reported by both reporters: AzR and KR. For some events, one article is added at the beginning of the sentence. For others, there are changes in the structure of the sentences (Table 16). Table 16: Example of event recorded twice in the database by two different reporters for Azerbaijan 2006-08-04 AzR Baku, 04.08.2006Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Elmar Mammadyarov suggested that Azerbaijani IDPs return to Nagorny Karabakh first of all in order to achieve an improvement in the negotiating process. After that, the population of Nagorny Karabakh can participate in the referendum on its status. 2006-08-04 KR Baku, 04.08.2006Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Elmar Mammadyarov said, \"Return of Azerbaijanis to Nagorny Karabakh should be provided first of all in order to achieve an improvement in the negotiations. After that, the population of Nagorny Karabakh can participate in the referendum.\" 207 events are reported twice, once by AzR and another time by KR. This figure represents 30% of the events reported by this reporter. 32 events have a different \u201cevent type\u201d code while 176 use the same ",
        "67 event code. There is a specific pattern in the coding of the duplicate events. It is mostly the forceful events that have been repeated. A calculation of this percentage among the duplications raises the level to 20%. As with the double-counting of events this demonstrates a serious flaw in the news coding process. The following analysis does not take into account these 208 events. Instead of 4374 events of the four main reporters, the mapping exercise shows 4166 events. 10.3.3. Location Tree /maps The Fast project\u2019s local information networks are supposed to be familiar with the area where events are occurring. In the case of the KR, the reporter is unlikely to be within the autonomous region. This decreases the reliability of the KR reporting. The few events recorded before 2006 do not reflect the conflicting events occurring in the Nagorno Karabagh region. For the location of their events, Fast reporters refer to 5 spatial entities or territories divided into sub- units (Table 17). In Azerbaijan, these sub-units are called either rayonus or sheheri for agglomeration. Armenia is divided into 11 sub-units called \u201cmarz\u201d. Armenian reporters place events in the Nagorno- Karabakh territory, using 5 sub-units called \u201cregion\u201d. The Azeri refer to the sub-units of the Occupied Territories. The sub-units do not coincide exactly. The overlap causes problems in mapping (Figure 61). The absence of political agreement on boundaries creates a fuzzy definition of the spatial units inside the database. Data can only be compared visually. Table 17: First level of the geographical hierarchy used by Fast Swisspeace to record the location of the news events in Armenia and Azerbaijan. Territory Number of sub- units (rayonus) Azerbaijan 55 Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic 7 Occupied Territories 11 Armenia 11 Nagorno-Karabakh 5 Total 89 Figure 61: Overlapping subunits used as location category by reporters from Azerbaijan or Armenia ",
        "68 The geographical hierarchy used to code the place/location of events in the database is spatially inconsistent in three ways. First, administrative units used by Armenians and Azeris to refer to the secessionist region of Nagorno-Karabakh do not coincide. Askeran, Hadrut, Martakert, Matuni and Shushi regions are included but do not cover the same area as the \u201crayonus\u201d of the Occupied Territories used by the Azeri reporters. Secondly, reporters use both lists of administrative units, one to refer to their own country, the other to refer to the other country. For example, KR reports 2 events following the hierarchy of Nagorno-Karabakh - in the Akeran region and in Martakert region. As an Azeri, the reporter is not supposed to recognize these units. Thirdly, reporters use both levels of the hierarchy, not simply the last level (rayonu). 189 events (4% of the events reported by the 4 main reporters) have no precise location. 10.4. Event mapping exercise Despite the shortcomings of this dataset which could be due to the political context or to the practical organization in the local network, the geolocation and spatial representation make it an interesting product. FAST data has been used to produce maps of events in Nagorno-Karabagh (Figure 61). Of course, the quality and reliability of mapping products depends on the input data and in particular, on consistent classification of events. With some geographical training, clear and structured instructions about maps and location and a demonstration of the value of a spatial representation, a local reporter could provide high-value data for conflict and instability monitoring. The maps presented in this report may help to convince scientists and news reporters of the importance of the spatial information. 10.4.1. Spatial assumptions Some spatial assumptions were made at the beginning of the mapping exercise in order to overcome the technical inconsistencies identified for the location of events. The first assumption was to use the information provided by the FAST database to geo-locate the events, despite the problems mentioned. Overlapping units in Nagorno-Karabagh and Occupied territories (Figure 61) were merged in order to have a common spatial frame for the whole region. The events recorded in different sub-units are assigned to an entity grouping sub-units of both spatial schemes (Table 18). Table 18: Overlapping sub-units merged in a common frame for mapping purposes. Previous N-K sub-units Previous Occupied Territories / Azerbaijan sub- units Martakert region Kalbajar rayonu / Terter rayonu Askeran region - Stepanakert Kahakendi sheheri / Khojali rayonu Shushi region Shushi rayonu Hadrut region / Martuni region Khojavand rayonu The second spatial assumption deals with the two spatially inconsistent levels in the geographical hierarchy. Reporters recorded events either in a sub-unit or in a territory (Table 17). In our interactive maps, we choose to map \u201cterritory level\u201d events to the sub-unit of the capital. 10.4.2. Spatial patterns Some spatial patterns appear in the data (Stephenne et al, forthcoming). Two main comments can be made at the unit level: (i) not all the units contain events and (ii) most of the events belong to a few units. Firstly, all units counted in the hierarchy (Table 17) are not represented in the database. Events occur in 8 out of 11 Armenian sub-units, in 27 out of 55 sub-units in Azerbaijan and in 2 out of 7 in Nakhchivan. Events occur in all sub-units of Nagorno-Karabakh (5/5) and events occur in most of the sub-units of the Occupied territories (8 among 11) where the conflict is localised. Secondly, the most represented sub-units are the capitals of the 5 respective territories: Baku sheheri, Nakhchivan sheheri, ",
        "69 Khankendi sheheri, Yerevan and Askeran region \u2013 Stepanakert. 3058 (70%) events belong to these units. Figure 62: Two spatial focus for interactive consultation of 2004-2006 FAST dataset in Armenia and Azerbaijan related to the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict Quantitative analysis using the IDEA scale of conflict and cooperation identifies other spatial patterns in the dataset. Cooperative events are more widespread in all countries but the highest values are occur in the North of the Nagorno-Karabakh and and the North of Armenia. Conflict events are mainly concentrated in the NK and the Northern part of Armenia, at the border with Georgia. Once the capitals are excluded from the analysis, three Armenian districts present the highest levels of confrontational events: Shirak at the border with Georgia, Taush at the border with Azerbaijan and Syunik at the border with the NK region. Most of the forceful events are concentrated on the ceasefire line. Agdam and Taush district presents the highest values (43 and 44 forceful events recorded). Terter ",
        "70 and Kelbjar districts merged into one single unit, account for 18 forceful events. More than 5 events are reported in Gazak and Fizuli districts. The preliminary qualitative analysis of 2006 news reports confirms the interest of the quantitative pattern. In a qualitative analysis, news reports claim that both sides violated the existing ceasefire agreement regularly (artillery duels, low intensity conflict) (Fast Swisspeace, 2006). From May to October, fires and arsons in villages and on fields adjacent to the LOC were reported. Armed KA forces burned several occupied villages of Azerbaijan\u2019s region of Aghdam. Most of the violence takes place along the LOC. From the literature reviewed and from open source information violence concentrates in: (i) Martuni and Martakert districts of NK, where the Eastern fringes of both districts are controlled by Azerbaijani forces), (ii) Agdam and Fizuli districts on Azerbaijani territory, (iii) the district of Agdam and Shahumian (Geranboy) controlled by Azerbaijani forces and claimed by KA forces, where ceasefire violations are reported (iv) North of Kalbajar district, Kalbajar corridor controlled by KA forces belonging to Azerbaijan. Observation of number of incidences along this line gives information about the intensity of violence. The mapping exercise improves the qualitative spatial understanding by a measure of news events. 11. Discussions and conclusion Combining expert knowledge and geographic information systems (GIS) creates opportunities to better understand, analyse and support the management of instability and security. Only a spatial quantitative simulation model provides a holistic representation of instability and a tool to generate \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios exploring the influence of single variables or groups of variables on regional instability. Simulation models emphasize the interactions among the components of the system and take into account the quantitative effects of each driving force. Based on clear assumptions, an instability model can be useful for simulation of the impacts of different political decisions and for investment prioritization. The JRC/ISFEREA multicriteria model can be seen as a communication tool between scientists and policy makers, between technologists and field experts. Regional stability is a common objective of local stakeholders, scientists and international, EU and national policymakers. Even though socio- economists have often called for more participatory scientific applications, scientists and policy makers usually exchange information in a traditional input-output flow. Aware of the interest of a common analysis, technologists have only rarely been able to be sufficiently understood by non- technologists to integrate their input into the technological process. The integration of regional stakeholders in the development of the decision making tool is thus a novel, challenging scientific approach. The experience of participative cartography attempts a communication between social and technologist scientists that could potentially be used in the future to create a tool for cooperation between opposing sides in negotiation processes. Classical security complex theory posits the existence of regional subsystems as objects of security analysis and offers a analytical framework for dealing with those systems. All the states in the system are integrated in a global web of security interdependence. But because most political and military threats travel more easily over short distance, insecurity is often associated with Proximity. Most states fear their neighbour more than distant powers, security interdependence across the international system as a whole is far from uniform (Buzan et al. 1998). The coverage of our analysis is restricted to the Caucasus regional complex: the three independent states and the Caucasian regions in Russian Federation. Instability in the Caucasus cannot be assessed without taking into account all the transboundary issues of this territory. ",
        "71 Based on the emerging consensus that conflict drivers should be addressed at the sub-national level, the Caucasus geographic model uses as a starting point the driving forces of conflict described in the conflict literature in order to build an integrated GIS security model (Stephenne, Burnley and Ehrlich, forthcoming in 2009 in International Studies Review). The statistical variables used in the geomodel are descriptive attributes associated with subnational administrative units known as \u201cdistricts\u201d. For the Caucasus region, area experts added other variables which they identified as drivers of instability. Unfortunately, these variables are not quantitative. This study is a first attempt to measure variables such as \u201chistorical changes in border locations\u201d or \u201cperception of factors for potential mobilization\u201d. Building a model of instability/insecurity also means looking at the contextual \u201cpredisposing causes of threats\u201d (Sen 1999). Our study of instability is based on the idea that a better understanding of complex interactions between threats affecting instability can be addressed through a modular geomodeling approach. But of course a model can only partially represent reality, especially when reality is a phenomenon as complex and mutable as political stability. In this representation, the collaboration with regional experts is mandatory. The overall list of instability\u2019s driving forces as well as the rating in the relevance of these factors of instability have been assessed by a survey through a large panel of 50 regional experts. The experts confirm the relevance of the list and identify which of these factors were more uncertain (disagreement measured by standard deviation in the experts ratings). They ranked the categories of instability factors and commented on the major issues of a quantitative approach. Despite some sceptical reactions, the high level of response (more than 50%) to the survey reveals the interest of these experts in the quantitative approach. The value of this geomodel is the integration of regional expertise in a unique overall picture of instability of the Caucasus region. While this operational interest is manifest, numbers and quantitative results have to be treated with caution. Even in the case of basic population data the figures are affected by multiple distortions that include efforts to conceal the actual number of refugees living in a region, and to obscure the massive outflow of native inhabitants (Rowland 2007). This kind of quantitative model heavily depends on the quality of input data. However, the analysis helps to identify which information is most relevant and where data gathering could be improved in the future. While the list of relevant indicators has been established, the first challenge in building a quantitative model is that of data collection. As can be expected from a region with multiple differences, a history of intense conflict and a long past of centralised power, building harmonized spatial statistical data is challenging. Given these difficulties in the particular political context of the Caucasus, the INALCO dataset (Radvanyi, INALCO, 2006) is a opportunity because of a clear spatial and quantitative focus that largely corresponds to the objectives of our model. Stephenne and MacDonald (2007) evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively the adequacy of this dataset to statistically model instability/stability in the Caucasus by following a structured quality assessment protocol (Johnston et al. 1999). Various studies, techniques and methods are integrated and combined in this report. The report describes two tools set up in this study: a statistical model assessing the explanatory power of insecurity drivers (section 8) and an interactive multicriteria GIS modelling tool integrating the expert knowledge and spatial data (section 9). This report also discusses a potential integration of news event data in the spatial representation of instability (section 10). The statistical model simulations present interesting results in terms of ranking the importance of drivers in regional instability. This is the great interest of this kind of analysis and it appears relevant in this specific case to discuss some assumptions phrased by the literature. The model claims that the instability in the Caucasus is mainly related to the ethnicity factor. This confirms our main assumption. ",
        "72 This clear conclusion of our analysis should be looked at in parallel to the long running discussion and argument among experts about the importance of this factor. On the other hand, the model sets a lower relevance on environmental drivers of instability. This result is opposed to the ecological approach of conflicts in environmental security studies (B\u00e4chler et al 1995, Homer -Dixon 1999).A number of researchers have pinpointed the shortcomings of this environmental approach. Gleditsch (1998) identifies problems in the work of Homer-Dixon (i.e. model complexity and missing factors) and highlighted the definition of the environmental security as one major issue. Applicability of the method in other part of the world with or without ethnic particularities could be an interesting follow up of this study, bearing in mind that the availability of data is a prerequisite of success. 12.

Combining geographic information systems, multi-criteria decision theory and statistical techniques, a geographical instability simulation tool can support decision makers to better understand, analyse and manage instability and insecurity. The JRC Caucasus Instability project aims to provide a holistic view of instability at sub-national level in the Caucasus Region. This report describes the overall process of developing a geographic model of instability in the region. Various studies, techniques and methods are integrated and combined to create an overall picture representing the various potential drivers of instability. The study makes reference to a large body of literature on territorial drivers of insecurity (Section 5). The understanding is grounded in an expert consultation assessing the relevance of identified drivers (Section 6). The analysis uses a large dataset combining geomodelling techniques to represent instability drivers (section 7). The report describes the two tools developed and applied in this study: a statistical model assessing the explanatory power of insecurity drivers (section 8) and an interactive multi-criteria GIS modelling tool integrating the expert knowledge and spatial data (section 9). This report also discusses a potential integration of news event data in the spatial representation of instability (Section 10). ",
        "The mission of the JRC is to provide customer-driven scientific and technical support for the conception, development, implementation and monitoring of EU policies. As a service of the European Commission, the JRC functions as a reference centre of science and technology for the Union. Close to the policy-making process, it serves the common interest of the Member States, while being independent of special interests, whether private or national. L B - NA - 23692 - E N - C "
