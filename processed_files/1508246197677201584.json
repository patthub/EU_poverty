Member States should ensure that household customers and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises, enjoy the right to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at clearly comparable, transparent and competitive prices. Nevertheless, public service obligations in the form of supply price regulation constitute a fundamentally distortive measure that often leads to the accumulation of tariff deficits, limitation of consumer choice, poorer incentives for energy saving and energy efficiency investments, lower standards of service, lower levels of consumer engagement and satisfaction, restriction of competition as well as fewer innovative products and services on the market. Consequently, Member States should apply other policy tools, and in particular targeted social policy measures, to safeguard the affordability of electricity supply to their citizens. Interventions in price setting should only be applied [] as public service obligations and subject to specific conditions specified in this Directive . A fully liberalised retail electricity market would stimulate price and non-price competition among existing suppliers and incentivise new market entries therefore improving consumers' choice and satisfaction.

        "10691/1/17 REV 1 GW/ns 10 DGE 2B EN (15a) Public service obligations in the form of electricity supply price regulation should be used without overriding the principle of open markets in clearly defined circumstances and be limited in duration. Such circumstances could occur for example when the supply of electricity is severely constrained, causing significantly higher electricity prices than normal, or in the event of market failure where interventions by national regulatory authorities and other competent competition authorities to achieve effective competition have proven ineffective. This would disproportionately affect households, and in particular, vulnerable consumers and energy poor who typically use a higher share of their disposable income on energy bills, compared to higher income consumers. Therefore, these households and in particular vulnerable consumers may be in need of additional temporary protection. Member States applying In order to mitigate the distortive effects of public service obligations in the price-setting for supply of electricity, Member States applying such interventions should strive to achieve effective competition, mitigate distortive effects on retail market functioning and prevent put in place additional measures including measures preventing distortions to wholesale market price setting.

The benefits of this active participation are likely to increase over time when electric vehicles, heat pumps and other flexible loads become more competitive. Consumers should be enabled to participate in all forms of demand response and therefore should have the possibility to opt for having a smart metering system and a dynamic electricity pricing contract. This should allow them to adjust their consumption according to real time price signals that reflect the value and cost of electricity or transportation in different time periods, while Member States should ensure a reasonable exposure of consumers to the wholesale price risk. Member States should also ensure that those consumers who choose not to actively engage in the market are not penalised but instead their informed decision making on the options available to them should be facilitated in the manner that is the most suitable for domestic market conditions.

Member States should be free to choose the appropriate implementation model for independent aggregation while respecting the general principles as laid out in this Directive. Transparent and fair rules should be established to also allow independent aggregators to fulfil this role. Products should be defined on all organised energy markets, including ancillary services and capacity markets so as to encourage the participation of demand response. ",

Moreover, the deployment of electro-mobility constitutes an important element of the energy transition. Market rules set out in this Directive should therefore contribute to creating favourable conditions for electric vehicles of all kinds. In particular, they should safeguard the effective deployment of publicly accessible and private recharging points for electric vehicles and ensure the efficient integration of vehicle charging into system operation.

Community energy offers an inclusive option for all consumers to have a direct stake in producing, consuming or sharing energy between each other [] . Community energy initiatives focus primarily on providing affordable energy of a specific kind, such as renewable energy, for their members or shareholders rather than prioritising profit-making like a traditional energy company. By directly engaging with consumers community energy initiatives are demonstrating their potential in facilitating the up-take of new technologies and consumption patterns, including smart distribution grids and demand response, in an integrated manner. Community energy can also advance energy efficiency at household level and help fight energy poverty through reduced consumption and lower supply tariffs. Community energy also enables certain groups of household consumers to participate in the energy market who otherwise might not have been able to do so. Where they have been successfully operated such initiatives have delivered economic, social and environmental value to the community that goes beyond the mere benefits derived from the provision of energy services. [] E nergy communities should be allowed to operate on the market on a level-playing field without distorting competition. Household consumers should be allowed to voluntarily participate in a community energy initiative as well as to leave it, without losing access to the network operated by the community energy initiative or their rights as consumers.

Member States should put in place appropriate measures such as national network codes and market rules, and incentivise distribution system operators through network tariffs which do not create obstacles to flexibility or to the improvement of energy efficiency in the grid. Member States should also introduce network development plans for distribution systems in order to support the integration of generating installations using renewable energy sources, facilitate the development of storage facilities and the electrification of the transport sector, and provide to system users adequate information regarding the foreseen expansions or upgrades of the network, as currently such procedure does not exist in the majority of Member States.

The scope for discrimination as regards third-party access and investment, however, is less significant at distribution level than at transmission level where congestion and the influence of generation or supply interests are generally greater than at distribution level. Moreover, legal and functional unbundling of distribution system operators was required, pursuant to Directive 2003/54/EC, only from 1 July 2007 and its effects on the internal market in electricity still need to be evaluated. The rules on legal and functional unbundling currently in place can lead to effective unbundling provided they are more clearly defined, properly implemented and closely monitored. To create a level playing field at retail level, the activities of distribution system operators should therefore be monitored so that they are prevented from taking advantage of their vertical integration as regards their competitive position on the market, in particular in relation to household and small non-household customers. \uf0ea 2009/72/EC recital 30 (44) Where a closed distribution system is used to ensure the optimal efficiency of an integrated energy supply requiring specific operational standards, or a closed distribution system is maintained primarily for the use of the owner of the system, it should be possible to exempt the distribution system operator from obligations which would constitute an unnecessary administrative burden because of the particular nature of the relationship between the distribution system operator and the users of the system.

Ownership unbundling, which implies the appointment of the network owner as the system operator and its independence from any supply and production interests, is clearly an effective and stable way to solve the inherent conflict of interests and to ensure security of supply. For that reason, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 10 July 2007 on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market 1 referred to ownership unbundling at transmission level as the most effective tool by which to promote investments in infrastructure in a non-discriminatory way, fair access to the network for new entrants and transparency in the market. Under ownership unbundling, Member States should therefore be required to ensure that the same person or persons are not entitled to exercise control over a generation or supply undertaking and, at the same time, exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator or transmission system. Conversely, control over a transmission system or transmission system operator should preclude the possibility of exercising control or any right over a generation or supply undertaking. Within those limits, a generation or supply undertaking should be able to have a minority shareholding in a transmission system operator or transmission system. 1 OJ C 175 E, 10.7.2008, p.206. ",

Electricity can reach the citizens of the Union only through the network. Functioning electricity markets and, in particular, the networks and other assets associated with electricity supply are essential for public security, for the competitiveness of the economy and for the well-being of the citizens of the Union. Persons from third countries should therefore be allowed to control a transmission system or a transmission system operator only if they comply with the requirements of effective separation that apply inside the Community. Without prejudice to the international obligations of the Community, the Community considers that the electricity transmission system sector is of high importance to the Community and therefore additional safeguards are necessary regarding the preservation of the security of supply of energy to the Community to avoid any threats to public order and public security in the Community and the welfare of the citizens of the Union. The security of supply of energy to the Community requires, in particular, an assessment of the independence of network operation, the level of the Community\u2019s and individual Member States\u2019 dependence on energy supply from third countries, and the treatment of both domestic and foreign trade and investment in energy in a particular third country. Security of supply should therefore be assessed in the light of the factual circumstances of each case as well as the rights and obligations arising under international law, in particular the international agreements between the Community and the third country concerned. Where appropriate the Commission is encouraged to submit recommendations to negotiate relevant agreements with third countries addressing the security of supply of energy to the Community or to include the necessary issues in other negotiations with those third countries.

As soon as the electricity market is sufficiently liquid, this should be achieved through the setting up of transparent market- based mechanisms for the supply and purchase of electricity, needed in the framework of balancing requirements. In the absence of such a liquid market, national regulatory authorities should play an active role to ensure that balancing tariffs are non-discriminatory and cost-reflective. At the same time, appropriate incentives should be provided to balance the in-put and off-take of electricity and not to endanger the system. Transmission system operators should facilitate participation of final customers and final customers\u2019 aggregators in reserve and balancing markets. \uf0ea 2009/72/EC recital 39 and 40 The internal market in electricity suffers from a lack of liquidity and transparency hindering the efficient allocation of resources, risk hedging and new entry. There is a need for enhancement of competition and security of supply through facilitated integration of new power plants into the electricity network in all Member States, in particular encouraging new market entrants. Trust in the market, its liquidity and the number of market participants needs to increase, and, therefore, regulatory oversight of undertakings active in the supply of electricity needs to be increased. Such requirements should be without prejudice to, and compatible with, existing Community law in relation to the financial markets. Energy regulators and financial market regulators need to cooperate in order to enable each other to have an overview over the markets concerned. ",

Such monitoring should be carried out sufficiently early to enable appropriate measures to be taken if security of supply is compromised.
