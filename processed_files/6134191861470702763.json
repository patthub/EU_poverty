( 2 ) OJ L 325, 9.12.2010, p. 4. Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",
        "A. whereas the Treaty provides, in Article 349, for a specific legal basis, based on primary law, under which a specific legal status and common policies have been consolidated in the interest of the outermost regions; B. whereas the Cohesion Policy should be aligned with, and incorporate the features of, the Europe 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at organising policy initiatives around smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, promoting an economy with a high level of employment that is socially and territorially cohesive, and should take due account of the situation of ORs; whereas the starting conditions in the ORs to achieve these objectives are more severe than in some regions and the ORs are prepared to cooperate in the implementation of the five goals with regard to employment, innovation, education, social inclusion, climate and energy to be achieved by 2020 and whereas the need to direct the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy towards exploiting their potential and the growth of sectors of excellence does not mean that the structural obstacles facing these regions and the basic development role played by traditional sectors can be ignored; C. whereas Cohesion Policy must remain one of the main instruments of European action to reduce disparities in the European regions in general, and in the ORs in particular, with a view to enabling them to integrate into the internal market and assert themselves in their respective geographical areas, promoting the economic development and convergence of these regions with the EU mainland and pursuing the EU 2020 targets, since European Funds are key instruments; but whereas this European policy cannot by itself resolve all of the difficulties facing the ORs; D. whereas the major challenge for the economies of the ORs is to transform their constraints into growth potential and opportunities, with instruments that reduce disparities with regard to the free movement of people, goods, capital and services and whereas challenges such as globalisation, climate change, energy supply and the development of renewable energy, the sustainable management of natural, marine and agricultural resources, the preservation of biodiversity, social inclusion and combating poverty, and demographic pressures, require the coordination of all EU policies and instruments; E. whereas the deteriorating economic situation resulting from the economic, social and financial crisis has hit ORs particularly hard, highlighting the structural weaknesses of their economies and their dependence on the outside world; F. whereas European investments in the ORs not only involve a policy of making up delays and compensating for disadvantages, but are also investments carried out for the benefit and to the advantage of the whole of the European Union; Differentiated and holistic treatment for the outermost regions 1. Stresses that, under the terms of the TFEU, the ORs are entitled to differentiated and holistic treatment, enabling them to benefit from the maximum level of support, irrespective of their level of development, so that their specific features are sufficiently considered and protected; 2. Emphasises the need, in accordance with the conclusions of the Fifth Report on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion, to increase the flexibility of Cohesion Policy instruments, in such a way as to allow investments capable of ensuring a level of growth and development in line with EU 2020 Strategy objec\u00ad tives, even under particular geographic and demographic conditions; 3. Supports the advisability of ORs pursuing the main objectives defined in the Europe 2020 strategy, but emphasises the need to modulate these in accordance with their own situations, taking into account their regional diversity, their structural conditions and the potential benefits, while stressing that Article 349 of the TFEU, which stipulates the adoption of specific measures aimed at lessening the impact of OR characteristics, should be used more often than it is, and should be given the legal, institutional and political effect needed to ensure fair integration and economic and social development for the ORs within the internal market and, on a wider scale, within the European Union, and to ensure they can fully participate, on an equal footing with other regions, in all relevant EU programmes; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/3 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",
        "4. Believes that some flexibility needs to be shown for the ORs as regards concentration on the three main thematic objectives laid down in the new proposals for regulations from 2014, so as to avoid excessively restricting the possibility of diversifying and developing existing potential and of exploiting their comparative and competitive advantages; 5. Considers that other criteria should be used to determine the eligibility of ORs for the allocation of structural funds, given that the per capita GDP criterion does not provide an accurate reflection of their specific situations and is contrary to the spirit on which \u2018outermost region status\u2019 is based and to the Treaty itself; calls therefore for the implementation of a specific criterion whereby ORs are classified among the least developed regions regardless of their GDP, this being the most appropriate approach to their specific situation; stresses, moreover, that the co-financing rates in respect of the ORs should be 85 % for all instruments providing aid for those regions; calls for an extension of the period of implementation of these funds in the ORs with a view to more effective implementation; 6. Deplores the proposal, within the additional ERDF funding, to reduce drastically the amounts to be allocated to the ORs and regions with a low population density for the financial period from 2014 to 2020 and is concerned that this allocation, initially designed to compensate for the effects of the structural disadvantages of the outermost regions and regions with a low population density, has been reduced to 50 % by earmarking for different objectives; calls for this allocation to be increased to a co-financing rate of 85 %, as for ERDF mainstream; calls therefore for the financial arrangements for the implementation of EU 2020 should provide for access to EU funding that is at least equal in real terms to that available for the current financial framework in order to implement the Europe 2020 strategy in a coherent and effective manner; 7. Regrets that cuts in other cohesion areas have been made, and more specifically that the Commission proposes an overall cut to economic, social and territorial cohesion financing of 5,1 % in constant 2011 prices for the next programming period, including a cut of 20,2 % in the financing for convergence regions (excluding transition regions), a 5,6 % drop in the financing for competitiveness regions and a 2,9 % decrease in the Cohesion Fund allocations; 8. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s plan to include a budget line for \u2018Outermost regions and regions with a very low population density\u2019 in MFF 2014-2020, as this will create a clearer link between the funds allocated for those regions and their objectives; 9. Draws attention to the fact that in the proposal for a Regulation on the next ESF, the situation of ORs will not be referred to, considering not only the structural characteristics listed in Article 349 of the TFEU but also their specific economic situation which puts them among the regions with the highest unemployment rates in the EU; 10. Emphasises that European taxation and customs policies should be adjusted in order to enhance the competitiveness of the outermost regions\u2019 economies and that the existence of appropriate tax and customs frameworks is of paramount importance to the diversification of economic activity and the creation of sustainable jobs in the ORs; 11. Stresses the need for OR citizens to benefit from the advantages of the internal market on an equal footing with other EU citizens and calls for the adoption of measures in accordance with the recommen\u00ad dations of the Solbes report; Calls for the possibility of developing a specific framework on state aid to ORs to be examined, and favours retaining the current levels of aid for investment in large, medium and small enterprises and the possibility of granting operational aid which is not degressive or limited in time, within a flexible regulatory framework, given that this aid has proven that it does not harm competition and that it assists the ORs in achieving their Europe 2020 strategy objectives, particularly those on innovation, research and the environment; stresses in this connection the importance of public services for economic, social and territorial cohesion in ORs, particularly in the transport, aviation and maritime, postal, energy and communications sectors; 12. Stresses the importance of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises through the allocation of Union funds, with the aim of developing the productive fabric of the ORs and as a means of promoting workers\u2019 skills, thus enhancing region-specific products and the local economy; EN C 258 E/4 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",
        "13. Considers that EU intervention should aim to play a key role and boost initiative by developing, in the ORs, centres of excellence based on sectors which exploit their advantages and their know-how, such as waste management, renewable energy, energy self-sufficiency, biodiversity, student mobility, climate research and crisis management. considers that while measures taken at European mainland level and on the basis of the general characteristics of the European mainland are not always effective in the outermost regions, experimental schemes approved under Article 349 of the Treaty which have had real success can be extended to the rest of the EU; encourages the Commission to maximise these schemes within these regions with a view to achieving innovative, solidarity-based and sustainable growth; A specific framework for European policies in the outermost regions 14. Calls for agricultural support measures under the POSEI scheme to be strengthened in order to compete with producers who benefit from lower production costs, and calls for the specific arrangements made for the ORs within the CAP to be maintained; 15. Advocates the need for prior assessment of the impact of European regulation projects on the economies of the Outermost Regions; 16. Highlights the need to maintain measures for the sustainable management and protection of marine resources, to gradually restrict access to marine areas identified as biogeographically sensitive so that eventually only local fleets are allowed there, to use environmentally friendly fishing equipment, to promote aquaculture, and to reintroduce the possibility of granting fleet renewal and modernisation aid so as to improve health and safety conditions, and to implement good practices, and calls for an increase in the compensation for additional costs in the POSEI fisheries programme; emphasises the need to take an approach that is better adapted to the realities of each region, on the basis of development models for the sector drawn up by local stakeholders; 17. Regrets that the proposal for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy does not take sufficient account of the situation of the ORs; draws attention to the marine dimension of the ORs and the importance of the fishing sector in regional development policy and jobs for local populations in view of their Exclusive Economic Zone, the potential of which should be reflected in concrete and coherent measures for a genuine marine economy and duly taken into account in the integrated European maritime policy programme; recalls the growing economic interest in the immense biogenetic and mineral wealth of the ocean depths in the outermost regions, which must be included in the \u2018Renewed Strategy for the ORs\u2019 with the aim of developing a knowledge economy based on the sea; considers in this connection that the ORs must be at the heart of EU maritime policy, emphasising the role they could play in the sustainable use of the sea and coastal regions as well as in international maritime governance, and that the Atlantic ORs should be able to participate in the Atlantic Strategy currently being developed; 18. Draws attention to the importance of the tourism sector and calls on the Commission to speed up the implementation of the European Action Plan and ensure more effective coordination of the existing funding lines, giving specific attention to the ORs; 19. Emphasises that the ORs wish to focus on a research and innovation strategy and on the growth of their business structure, particularly by promoting an entrepreneurial spirit among young people, so as to allow the development of SMEs and avoid youth unemployment; argues for the creation of technological infrastructures and Europe-wide innovation hubs, the development of projects and partnerships with Scientific and Technological System organisations and the exchange of ideas and good practices through European innovation support networks and smart specialisation such as the S3 platform, and long-term investments in the ORs, in the framework of Cohesion Funding and to ensure active participation in the flagship projects of the EU 2020 strategy; calls for the efforts made to date concerning the ORs to be pursued in order both to step up the establishment of local research facilities that are equal to their potential and to encourage and help the development of attractive, successful universities, with genuine resources and with standards equal to those of universities in other parts of the Union\u2019s territory; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/5 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",
        "20. Emphasises the need to facilitate synergy between Cohesion Policy funds and the Framework Programme for Research and Development in order to increase the development of the outermost regions and curb the under-utilisation of research funds; 21. Notes that a single European transport area should contribute towards ensuring the inclusive growth of the ORs, reduce their access gap and combat climate change; calls for the establishment of a specific framework to provide transport subsidies in the ORs particularly for public transport and to develop maritime transport between the islands; calls also for the establishment of logistical platforms and supports the implementation of projects such as Motorways of the Sea; highlights the possibilities of the Marco Polo programme for the ORs; calls on the Commission to increase the programme\u2019s flexibility and extend it after 2013 and calls for the Connecting Europe Facility to include specific references to the ORs; urges that ORs be included in TEN-T networks and the new instrument aimed at facilitating European interconnections; 22. Points out that the ORs\u2019 dependence on imported fossil fuels results in substantial additional costs; notes also the relatively low level of regional policy investments in ORs to combat climate change; proposes strengthening the renewable energy sector and energy efficiency through initiatives such as the \u2018Pact of Islands\u2019, aimed at developing local action plans for renewable energy and projects suitable for financing, in order to achieve a reduction in CO 2 emissions of at least 20 % by 2020 by setting up a dedicated programme for research projects in the fields of renewable energy and diversification of the regional energy base, specifically with regard to geothermal, wave and hydrogen energy, and setting up a specific programme in the field of energy to reduce the costs due to remoteness, infrastructure and provision of services, in order to promote the ambitious policies the ORs have committed to on the development of renewable energy; 23. Notes with concern the effects of climate change in the ORs, most notably rising water levels; calls on the Union to address these issues in its climate change prevention and response strategy; recommends the appropriate use of energy resources and the development of the potential of renewable energies; 24. Urges the Commission to establish a specific programme in the field of energy, transport and information and communications technology, based on the POSEI schemes with the best possible synergies with other EU strands of action in these fields; 25. Considers it necessary to help Member States ensure that the inhabitants of these regions have full access to the sources of the information and communication media provided by new technologies, e.g. broadband technology and wireless technologies, including satellite, and, in particular, access to broadband infrastructure so as to promote economic growth and better administration through the digitisation of services; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that all inhabitants of the ORs have access to broadband internet by 2013; 26. Recognises, in view of the fact that the digital economy is without doubt a driver of economic development in the EU, the effects of the growing problem of digital exclusion, which can become a serious barrier to development; 27. Considers that the innovative financing methods of cohesion policy could partially resolve the chronic lack of investment in very small enterprises/SMEs in the ORs and stresses the need to improve access to funding for businesses in ORs in particular by setting up a dialogue with the EIB Group and by supporting the creation of local investment funds in each OR as well as the development of regional capital investment markets in accordance with the proposal in the above-mentioned Pedro Solbes Mira report on Europe\u2019s outermost regions and the Single Market; calls on the Commission to make a legislative proposal to Parliament and to the Council to this end. 28. Calls for experimental schemes for public procurement, in a limited number of sectors, to be set up in these regions, such that the award procedures are weighted by taking into account the location of the bidders; EN C 258 E/6 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",
        "Better governance and integration of the outermost regions in the EU and in their geographical environments 29. Advocates greater involvement of the regional authorities of the ORs in preparing and implementing European programmes and policies, respecting the principles of flexibility, adaptability and modulation, within a framework of subsidiarity and a multi-level and partnership-based form of governance, in part\u00ad nership with the private sector and civil society, in order to ensure that their specific needs are taken into account at all levels of the decision-making process and to ensure greater visibility of these regions in the EU institutions; 30. Considers that one of the main weaknesses of the ORs is resource management; believes it is necessary to equip them with sufficient rudiments to allow them to manage their investments, especially in infrastructure \u2013 not only transport infrastructure but also that for water, energy and waste management; 31. Recalls that the above-mentioned recent report by Pedro Solbes Mira on Europe\u2019s outermost regions in the single market revealed that the economies of the ORs are constrained in almost every respect by additional costs; draws the attention of the Commission to the monopolies, abuse of dominant positions and cartel offences which have the unfair consequence of exacerbating high living costs; calls on the Commission to carry out an in-depth study on pricing in the ORs in order to determine the correct instruments to make the common market more efficient in these regions; 32. Points to the role of the ORs as EU borders with the rest of the world and advocates an approach, particularly through pursuing the debate the Commission has said it will hold in partnership with the ORs, that recognises their closeness to EU third countries, including the countries with which they have special cultural and historical ties; draws attention to their integration problems in their respective geographical areas, and to the need to find specific innovative schemes which encourage real regional integration through shared programmes and projects between the ORs and neighbouring third countries and to help establish good connections between their respective geographical areas; stresses the significant impact that the external aspects of some EU policies have on ORs and highlights the need to carry out studies to measure the impact of international trade and fisheries agreements and their effects on the ORs and their local production, while also establishing compensatory measures to mitigate any damage resulting from such agreements; 33. Regrets the initial reluctance shown by DG Trade to take into account the specific characteristics of the outermost regions when negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and urges the Commission to continue to seek compromises that respect the interests of the ORs concerned, when it comes to reaching final agreements with the ACP countries; 34. Recalls again the need for better synergy between cohesion policy funds and the European Devel\u00ad opment Fund in order to enhance projects of general interest and the regional integration of ORs; recalls in this connection Parliament\u2019s reiterated position in favour of including the EDF in the budget; 35. Stresses the importance of regional cooperation for ORs and of the continuation of territorial cooperation programmes in the ORs; in this context, advocates more relaxed regulations aimed at using more effectively the available funding and completing cooperation projects as well as raising the ERDF co- financing rates to 85 %, giving greater priority to transnational cooperation and removing, in the case of the ORs, the 150km criterion for sea borders in cross-border cooperation; also recalls that the special geographical location of the ORs, and the importance of their geostrategic role, represent a considerable added value for the European Union in its relations with African and Central American countries and the United States of America; 36.

Recommends also that, whenever a gross breach of human rights is committed by a partner country with which an international agreement, such as a partnership and cooperation agreement, has been concluded, the EU take bolder steps in carrying out the appropriate sanctions as stipulated in the human rights clauses of the agreement, including possible temporary suspension of the agreement; 27. Highlights the importance of drawing up adequate follow-up programmes to the EU Election Observation Mission Reports in close cooperation with the European Parliament, ensuring that these follow-up programmes are also linked to any development programmes; 28. Stresses that the mainstreaming of international justice must include systematically taking account of the fight against impunity and the principle of complementarity in the broader context of trade, devel\u00ad opment and rule-of-law assistance; stresses that rehabilitation and reintegration of victims in society and affected communities must be the central concern, with a special focus on vulnerable groups, including women, children, young people and people with disabilities; highlights the importance of establishing constitutional structures, including an efficient legal system, the separation of powers and a recognised and independent judiciary in order to strengthen the promotion of human rights in any country; recommends that the Rome Statute of the ICC be added to the package of international treaties on good governance and the rule of law to be ratified by third countries admitted to the System of Generalised Preferences Plus (GSP+); recommends the consistent inclusion of ICC clauses in the human rights and democracy clauses of EU agreements with third countries, taking account of the fact that such clauses are to be considered as essential elements of the agreements, with the focus on strategic partnerships and the countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy; EU action in the context of the United Nations 29. Welcomes the adoption by the UN General Assembly of resolution 65/276 on the participation of the EU in the work of the UN as a modest start to a greater endeavour to upgrade the EU role in the organisation; stresses that speaking with one voice should not come at the expense of human rights concerns and, on the contrary, considers that the EU must now vigorously insist on exercising its rights and put its enhanced status to work in order to pursue an ambitious human rights and democracy promotion strategy; 30. Reiterates its call on the Council to authorise the VP/HR to draft guidelines for regular consultations between the ambassadors of the Member States and the EU\u2019s ambassadors, especially between those working at multilateral level in places like Geneva and New York, so that the EU can successfully pursue its UN agenda and act for the promotion and defence of human rights; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/17 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",

Stresses the fact that in order to attract a consensus on more of its proposals at the HRC, the EU\u2019s capacity for outreach must be improved as a matter of urgency, including through enlisting the support of the VP/HR to lobby capitals in third countries in support of EU positions; welcomes the more strategic, medium-term approach to the preparation of HRC sessions being taken within the Human Rights Working Group of the Council (COHOM); EU policy on the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the fight against impunity 33. Welcomes the updating of the EU\u2019s policy on the ICC of 12 July 2011; notes that the Rome Statute of the ICC establishes a mechanism of \u2018last resort\u2019 to bring to justice the individuals responsible for crimes against humanity, genocide, war crimes and the crime of aggression, as provided by the principle of complementarity enshrined in the Rome Statute; recognises the Commission\u2019s efforts to establish an \u2018EU Complementarity Toolkit\u2019 aimed at supporting the development of national capacities and generating political will for the investigation and prosecution of alleged international crimes, and stresses the importance of thorough consultations with Member States, Parliament and civil society organisations in order to finalise the toolkit; welcomes the efforts of civil society in Member States to support comple\u00ad mentarity efforts in countries where crimes under international law and massive human rights violations have occurred, and encourages the continuation of such efforts; encourages the EU and its Member States to adopt a set of internal guidelines outlining a code of conduct for contacts with persons wanted by the ICC; calls on all Member States (notably the Republic of Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg and Portugal) to enact national legislation on cooperation with the Court and conclude framework agreements with the ICC in order to facilitate cooperation, in particular to ensure the execution of arrest warrants and other Court requests; 34. Welcomes the adoption at the Kampala Review Conference of amendments to the Rome Statute related to the crime of aggression and certain war crimes, and calls on all Member States promptly to ratify these substantive amendments and to implement them as part of their domestic penal systems; in this context, calls on the Council and the Commission to use their international authority in the interests of securing and strengthening the universality of the Rome Statute for an internationally agreed definition of acts of aggression in breach of international law; welcomes the EU\u2019s pledges, in particular on the fight against impunity as a core value to be shared with our partners when entering into agreements, and calls for their consistent implementation; 35. Recommends that the EU systematically include ICC clauses in agreements with third countries and promote respect for, cooperation with and assistance to the ICC within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement and of dialogues between the EU and regional organisations such as the African Union, the Arab League, the Organisation of American States and the OSCE, and third countries; 36. Welcomes the EU\u2019s and Member States\u2019 financial and logistical support for the ICC, and recommends that it be maintained; expresses its deep concern over the outcome of the budget discussions at the December 2011 session of the Assembly of State Parties, which threatens to leave the Court underfunded and thus undermines its ability to deliver justice and to respond to new situations; calls on the EU and its Member States to show adequate support for the functioning of the Court, including taking a proactive role in the surrender of indictees; EN C 258 E/18 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",
        "EU policies to support democratisation 37. Insists that the goals of development, democracy, human rights, good governance and security are intertwined; reiterates its conviction that all EU external actions must combine a political dimension which supports pluralism, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and a development dimension which focuses on socio-economic progress, including eradication of poverty, the fight against inequality, and the basic need for food, based on sustainable development; adds in this context that EU development aid programmes should include concrete and substantial reforms to ensure respect for human rights, transparency, gender equality and the fight against corruption in beneficiary countries; notes, furthermore, that stricter conditionality and suspension of aid should be applied in beneficiary countries which manifestly disregard basic human rights and freedoms and which fail to enact legislation that fulfils international obligations; 38. Considers that the performance-driven \u2018more for more\u2019 approach should drive the relations of the EU with all third countries, that the EU should only grant partner countries advanced status if clear human rights and democracy requirements are met, and that it should not hesitate to freeze this status should these requirements no longer be fulfilled; considers that serious consideration should be given to this in further negotiations with Russia on the new advanced Partnership Agreement; 39. Calls for systematic support for new, freely and fairly elected parliaments, especially in countries in transition and those to which the EU has sent election observation missions; considers that such support should be financed by the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) and geographic instruments; 40. Welcomes the plans to establish a European Endowment for Democracy (EED), as set out in the Joint Communication of the VP/HR and the Commission, the Council Conclusions of the 3101st and 3130th meetings, leading to the Declaration on the Establishment of a European Endowment For Democracy agreed to by COREPER on 15 December 2011, together with the efforts undertaken by a European Endowment for Democracy Working Group established under the auspices of the EEAS in cooperation with Member States and EU institutions; underlines the Endowment\u2019s potential function, under Parliament\u2019s oversight, as a flexible and expert tool to support actors striving for democratic change in non-democratic countries and countries in transition; urges the Council to ensure that, among its other actions, any such tool complements the activities of existing instruments, in particular the EIDHR, without creating unnecessary bureaucratic structures; stresses that the EU\u2019s contribution to the EED budget must be genuinely additional and must be delivered in full conformity with financial rules, respecting the right of the budgetary authority to monitor and scrutinise; Election support 41. Stresses the importance of a political support process not simply focused on the period immediately before and after elections, but based on continuity; welcomes the VP/HR\u2019s attention to \u2018deep democracy\u2019, which links democratic processes with human rights, freedom of expression and association, freedom of religion and belief, the rule of law and good governance; underlines that in this context the right to religious freedom should also be assigned a duly prominent role; points out that this right is in fact generally recognised as one of the most fundamental of all human rights; 42. Stresses again the importance of choosing priority countries for election observation missions on the basis of a mission\u2019s potential for impact on the promotion of genuine long-term democratisation; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/19 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",

Calls on the Council, the Commission and the EEAS to develop a political strategy in relation to each EU election observation mission, followed up by an assessment of democratic progress two years after the mission, to be submitted during Parliament\u2019s annual human rights debate with the VP/HR; welcomes the commitment of the VP/HR to focus in election observation on the participation of women and national minorities, as well as persons with disabilities, both as candidates and voters ( 1 ); 44. Stresses the importance, at the end of each election observation mission, of drawing up realistic and achievable recommendations in cooperation with other international actors, where applicable, with the dissemination and monitoring of these recommendations to be carried out by EU Delegations; considers that Parliament\u2019s standing delegations and the joint parliamentary assemblies should play an enhanced role in following up these recommendations and analysing progress with regard to human rights and democracy; supports, therefore, the promotion of a sustainable and regular dialogue with these third country parlia\u00ad ments; underlines the need to improve the working methodology of European Parliament election obser\u00ad vation delegations and to take care to enhance the skills of the participating MEPs and personnel; Human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries 45. Stresses that participation in a structured human rights dialogue, while welcomed, is too often used as a pretext to avoid discussion of these issues at higher political levels including partner summits; calls on all EU institutions, the Member States and their embassies to make greater efforts to integrate these dialogues in all in-country EU external actions; stresses the need for transparency and genuine prior consultation of civil society organisations, as well as debriefing after the dialogues, in order to report on the results; 46. Expresses, therefore, its disappointment at the lack of progress achieved in a number of human rights dialogues (which now number over forty) and takes note of the view expressed in some quarters that, in certain cases, EU human rights consultations are being instrumentalised and have become a process rather than a means to achieve measurable, tangible results; 47. Regrets that the post-dialogue/consultation assessments undertaken have not led to the development of clear performance indicators or benchmarks; urges that objectives be set in advance of, and evaluated immediately after, each dialogue or consultation, in a transparent manner and involving the widest possible stakeholders; stresses that the conclusions of these assessments must be fed into summit meetings and other contacts between the EU and its partners, and must inform the EU and its Member States\u2019 actions in other bi- and multilateral settings; considers that particular consideration must be given to these indicators to ensure the effectiveness of democracy and human rights clauses in all EU agreements, whatever their nature; 48. Stresses the importance and urgency of improving the modalities and substance of these dialogues in consultation with civil society; reiterates that dialogues can be constructive and can have a real impact on the ground only if followed up with concrete steps taking account of the EU\u2019s objectives and the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Dialogues with third countries, as well as if corrective measures are put in place; 49. Recalls that the EU should use these dialogues as an instrument to raise individual cases of human rights violations in third countries, such as cases of political prisoners and detainees, e.g. in Vietnam and China, imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of basic rights, such as freedom of expression, assembly, association and religion; calls on the EU, furthermore, to make regular use of this opportunity and follow up responses to individual cases it has raised, monitor these cases, and closely coordinate with the human rights organisations involved and other countries which have human rights dialogues with the country in question; EN C 258 E/20 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 ( 1 ) Human Rights and Democracy at the Heart of EU External Action - Towards a more effective Approach, Joint Communication, 12 December 2011 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",

Is disappointed to note that only a limited number of assessments have been carried out and on an irregular basis despite the Guidelines stipulation that the dialogues \u2018must preferably be assessed every other year\u2019; strongly regrets that there has been no systematic involvement of the European Parliament in the assessments to date, including for Russia and China; calls for a formalisation of access for the European Parliament to these assessments and a guarantee that this will be carried out in the most open and transparent way possible; recalls that the Guidelines state that \u2018civil society will be involved in this assessment exercise\u2019, and considers that the implementation of this commitment requires the establishment of a concrete mechanism to that effect; 51. Is particularly concerned at the situation in Mali since the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 22 March 2012 and by the fact that the country is facing its \u2018worst humanitarian crisis in the last 20 years\u2019 as a result of the food insecurity affecting some three million people and the displacements caused by the clashes in the north of the country; calls on the European Union to make additional humanitarian aid available to address this situation; regards it as essential, further, that the European Union and its Member States should work to bring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict, based on protection of the population groups affected, which does not involve outside interference in the country\u2019s political affairs; 52. Reiterates that women\u2019s rights should be an important part of the human rights dialogues conducted by the EU and of the EU\u2019s political dialogue with third countries with which cooperation or association agreements have been signed, in line with the human rights clauses in these agreements, and that women\u2019s participation in peaceful transitions \u2013 both at the negotiating table and in active roles \u2013 should be expanded; calls on the Commission and the Council to take all appropriate measures in the event of any violation of these provisions; 53. Regrets that, despite all the calls from Parliament and other international institutions, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was sentenced in his second politicised and administratively motivated trial in Russia, which did not comply with the principles of a fair and independent judicial system, thus strongly violating human rights; Human rights and democracy clauses 54. Calls for all contractual relationships with third countries, both industrialised and developing, and including sectoral agreements, trade and technical or financial aid agreements, to include clearly worded binding clauses on human rights and democracy, without exception; calls on the Commission to ensure a stricter enforcement of these clauses; reiterates the need to develop a single catalogue of human rights and democracy benchmarks for descriptive and evaluation purposes, recognised by all EU institutions; suggests that the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights and other core international human rights conventions could constitute a viable element of such a human rights and democracy EU benchmark; 55. Asks the Commission not to be reluctant to use the suspension mechanism for standing agreements whenever the standard human rights clauses are repeatedly violated; 56. Stresses that the application of the clause as it currently stands in Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) due to come before Parliament in the near future provides an opportunity for Parliament itself to explore the potential for setting human rights benchmarks in advance of ratification, in order to achieve concrete and verifiable progress in respect for human rights; reiterates its call on the Commission to draft a new \u2018model clause\u2019 referring to the parties\u2019 international obligations, comprising a procedure for consultation and specifying political and legal mechanisms to be used in the event of a request for cooperation to be suspended on the grounds of repeated or systemic human rights violations in breach of international law; takes the view that the enforcement mechanism of the human rights and democracy clause, as requested by Parliament, is the only way to ensure the genuine implementation of such clauses and should be considered as a preventive and alerting mechanism, setting up a dialogue between the EU and the partner country, and to be followed up with a monitoring mechanism; recommends that a clear and gradual system of sanctions be developed, without prejudice to possible final suspension; insists strongly on the need for Parliament to be a joint decision-maker with the Commission and the Council in this respect; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/21 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",

Proposes the use of objective indicators and criteria in human rights impact studies and the assessment thereof; Trade and human rights 59. Expects a comprehensive human rights chapter, in addition to social and environmental chapters, in all future Free Trade Agreements and, in the context of negotiations currently underway, regrets the objections to this principle expressed by some of the partners, such as India and Canada; calls for the chapter on sustainable development in agreements to be strengthened through the inclusion of a complaints procedure open to the social partners and civil society, the establishment of an independent body to settle pertinent disputes and the possibility of recourse to a dispute settlement mechanism with provision for fines and the suspension of trade benefits in the event of an aggravated breach of the environmental and labour standards concerned, equivalent to mechanisms for market access provisions; stresses that the monitoring and enforcement mechanisms of the GSP+ scheme should be further strengthened; demands that the objectives of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) should be binding on European companies operating in countries with institutional weaknesses; European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) 60. Considers that the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 has served to demonstrate the inadequacy of the EU\u2019s policies hitherto to effectively support people\u2019s strong desire for democracy, respect for fundamental freedoms, justice and accountable and representative government in countries where this is denied; welcomes, therefore, the Joint Communications by the Commission and the VP/HR on \u2018A new response to a changing Neighbourhood\u2019, expressing, among other points, the need for the establishment of the European Endowment for Democracy, and \u2018A partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean\u2019, and the approach taken of shared commitments and mutual accountability as regards the universal values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, stronger incentive-based conditionality, differentiation of policies, the advancing of multilateral and sub-regional cooperation and the principle of further involving civil society; stresses that the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 would become a paradox if it were to develop in a direction that denies the fundamental human rights of women, human rights defenders, religious minorities and other societal groups in the Arab Spring countries; 61. Considers that since the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 began, in-country NGOs and organised citizens have been playing a critical role in mobilising people and promoting their participation in public life, with the aim of informing people of their rights and empowering them to understand and embrace democracy; stresses that political priorities for future reforms will need to stem from participatory consultations with in-country NGOs and civil rights advocates; 62. Stresses the need to support democratic movements in the Eastern Neighbourhood, and welcomes the new approach to the ENP aimed at providing greater support for partners engaged in building deep and sustainable democracy and support for inclusive economic development, as well as strengthening the two regional dimensions of the European Neighbourhood Policy; 63. Supports a performance-based \u2018more for more\u2019 approach in line with the new vision of the ENP; insists that differentiation should be based on clearly defined criteria and regularly monitored benchmarks and proposes that the benchmarks laid down in the Communications be considered as objectives, to be complemented by more specific, measurable, achievable, time-bound benchmarks; calls on the EEAS and the EN C 258 E/22 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",

Emphasises the crucial importance of active civil society participation in and contribution to processes of governance and societal transformation, recognising the need to include representatives of women\u2018s and minority groups in such processes; strongly supports greater engagement with civil society in these processes, both in terms of ever-greater outreach and a stronger emphasis on including the views of civil society in policy-making; welcomes in this respect all the EU programmes that aim at training young professionals and simplifying student exchange programmes for third country nationals as these contribute effectively to the development of civil society; underlines the need for an independent structural and financial support for civil society; considers that, as in the case of the UPR process within the UNHRC, local and international civil society actors should be involved in the Commission\u2019s ENP progress reports by delivering separately their own assessment to be added to these reports; welcomes moves towards the establishment of the Civil Society Facility (CSF) and the European Endowment for Democracy, and calls for substantial funding for these in the forthcoming Multi-annual Financial Framework; and insists that, in future, civil society must be engaged so as to contribute directly through an institutionalised\u2019civil society monitoring mechanism\u2019; 65. Is deeply concerned that four European Neighbourhood partner countries have not signed the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, 11 countries have not ratified it, and a further 14 have not designated the national preventive measures required; calls for urgent EU action to address this shortfall; 66. Believes that the promotion and support of non-violence reflects an international value that is an appropriate way of defending and promoting human rights from within, particularly considering that the non-violent methodology offers an effective outcome in terms of the prevention of conflict and support for democracy, rule of law and civil society around the world; proposes giving non-violence a role of relevance and political weight in the internal and external policies of the European Union with support for those initiatives that can sustain and develop non-violent and peaceful activism around the world with the dissemination of practical assistance to support non-violent activists and human rights defenders; 67. Reiterates its call on the VP/HR and the Member States to work towards a strong EU common position on the follow-up to the fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict, publicly demanding the imple\u00ad mentation of its recommendations and accountability for all violations of international law, regardless of the alleged perpetrator, through the conduct of independent, impartial, transparent and effective investigations; takes the view that there can be no effective Middle East peace process without accountability and justice; External financial instruments, in particular the EIDHR 68. Notes that, while there have been strong EU policy statements in favour of human rights, a dilution has been observed downstream in the programming cycle whereby human rights pledges disappear from specific instruments and country sectoral allocations; observes that unfortunately human rights and democracy have sometimes been \u2018ghettoised\u2019 into the EIDHR to the detriment of mainstreaming throughout all instruments; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/23 Wednesday 18 April 2012 ",

Strongly recommends that within the future development instruments a special focus be put on thematic programmes, as they especially address human rights issues in order to promote mutually reinforcing bridges between development and human rights; 71. Notes that, in order to maximise coherence and effectiveness, a strategic approach is needed to combining different geographic and thematic instruments to protect and promote human rights, based on a solid analysis of the local context, eliminating current and avoiding future double standards; welcomes, in this respect, the commitment given in the 12 December 2011 Joint Communication on Human Rights and Democracy at the Heart of EU External Action: Towards a More Effective Approach to take the human rights country strategies into account in the programming and implementing cycles of the EU\u2019s assistance, and invites the VP/HR to draw up a more detailed methodology to implement this commitment; 72.

Welcomes the clearer definition of the objectives of the EIDHR and its updated scope which reflects the stronger focus on economic, social and cultural rights, on freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief and on democracy support; appreciates the new possibility to directly award grants to finance actions in the most difficult conditions or situations, or to enhance support for human rights defenders and non-registered organisations; 74. Underlines the fact that Parliament\u2019s prerogatives must be respected in the programming of the EIDHR and of the other instruments, with special emphasis on human rights and democracy; accordingly, firmly maintains that the Strategy Papers for these instruments cannot be regarded as implementing acts and must be adopted in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 290 TFEU on delegated acts; Death penalty 75.

Notes that 60 % of all individual cases of human rights violations and abuses both within and outside of armed conflict documented by Amnesty International have directly involved the use of small arms and light weapons; recognizes the particularly serious impact of small arms and light weapons on the enjoyment of children\u2019s rights and children\u2019s protection from violence; commends the global leadership shown by the EU in adopting a legally binding common position on arms exports in 2008, but notes the need for further monitoring its implementation at EU level; urges the EU to show leadership in the process to achieve an international Arms Trade Treaty at this year\u2019s UN Conference and to ensure that a robust, legally binding treaty is agreed; 81.

        "D. whereas the Europe 2020 Strategy states that, by 2020, 40 % of 30-34-year-olds in Europe should complete higher education or equivalent studies, given the estimate that 35 % of all jobs in the EU will require such qualifications; notes, however, that in 2010 only 26 % of the workforce in the EU had attained this qualification level; E. whereas more than 21 % of young people in the EU are unemployed; F. whereas in the EU in 2010, 16,5 % of young people were not in education or the labour market; G. whereas in the EU in 2010, unemployment of tertiary education graduates stood at 5,4 % compared with more than 15 % among those with only lower secondary education; whereas, on the other hand, it is taking longer and longer for the majority of those graduates to find secure employment; H. whereas over 60 % of university graduates are women, but the majority of senior positions in univer\u00ad sities (e.g. postdoctoral positions and professorships) are still held by men; I. whereas only 13 % of institutions in the higher education sector are headed by women and only 9 % of universities have a female head of staff, and whereas women therefore have considerably less influence with regard to research decision-making; J. whereas 75 of the top 200 universities worldwide are to be found in the EU Member States; K. whereas only 200 of Europe\u2019s 4 000 higher education institutions rank among the top 500 in the world; L. whereas universities have been an important resource in Europe for almost a millennium, whereas the importance of their role in the progress of society should not be reduced to their contribution to the economy, and whereas their development should not depend solely on their ability to adapt to the economic needs of the current economic model; M. whereas equal access for all young people to higher education and training should be encouraged; N. whereas universities encourage individual autonomy and creativity and play a very important role in the promotion of knowledge, and whereas the Member States should therefore make every effort to ensure that higher education is widely accessible without discrimination, particularly on social, economic, cultural, racial or political grounds; O. whereas education, especially higher and tertiary education, is responsible for shaping the attitudes and values that underlie civil society; P. whereas the national legislation of the respective Member States considers higher education to be a fundamental tool for determining the future of EU citizens; Q. whereas education is the responsibility of the Member States, and whereas it is important to ensure that higher education institutions receive financial support, first and foremost through the provision of adequate public funding; R. whereas the creation of a European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is a significant development that could contribute to European integration while respecting the diversity of education in the various EU Member States and the goals of higher education in relation to society; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/57 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "S. whereas the European Union has an important role to play in strengthening this area while drawing on the efforts and cooperation of the Member States in this regard; The changing role of higher education institutions 1. Calls on higher education institutions to integrate lifelong learning into their curricula, with the help of economic assistance and different study programmes, and to adapt to a student base that includes adults, elderly people, non-traditional learners, full-time students who have to work while studying and people with disabilities, and therefore calls on higher education institutions to implement programmes aimed at removing existing obstacles and barriers; 2. Invites higher education institutions to take into account the needs of professionals who need, as lifelong learners, to update and broaden their skills at regular intervals, including through the organisation and fine-tuning of update courses which are accessible to all social groups, close cooperation with employers and the development of courses which meet the needs of the labour market and which could facilitate a return to education for unemployed workers; 3. Calls on higher education institutions to uphold the spirit of autonomy in teaching and research while providing specific study programmes with the aim of meeting the needs of professionals who wish to update their skills; 4. Reiterates that higher education has the potential to promote social inclusion, social advancement and upward social mobility; calls, with respect for the principle of subsidiarity, on Member States, regional and local governments and higher education institutions to strengthen \u2013 inter alia through the development of adequate financial support schemes \u2013 their efforts to widen equitable access to studies for all, from early childhood to higher education, irrespective of sex, ethnicity, language, religion, disability or social back\u00ad ground, and to fight all forms of discrimination, recognising multiculturalism and multilingualism, including sign languages, as fundamental values of the EU that need to be fostered; 5. Calls on the Member States to pay increased attention to, and to support higher education institutions serving traditional national, ethnic or linguistic minorities, with a special focus on endangered cultures and languages; 6. Invites higher education institutions to encourage student participation in sports; 7. Underlines the complementary role of state, private and religious forms of higher education across Europe; 8. Emphasises the importance of promoting democratic values, while stressing the need to acquire a sound knowledge of European integration and ensuring that Europe\u2019s former totalitarian regimes are understood as part of its common history; 9. Also emphasises the need to continue traditional education in an academic spirit and not to permit the education system to be totally subordinated to the labour market, in view of the need to shape ethical and moral values among students at the same time as caring about academic progress; 10. Calls on the Member States and higher education institutions to establish a general framework \u2013 covering rules, responsibilities, political and educational objectives and the quality of, and priority given to, training and research \u2013 in which to promote best practices and respond to the challenges of the communi\u00ad cation society; 11. Emphasises that academic staff and students, as well as their organisations and associations, need to be involved in the modernisation of higher education institutions; stresses that both excellence in research, in the broad sense of the term, and excellence in teaching and scientific achievement need to be rewarded, without thereby penalising those higher education institutions \u2013 for example humanities faculties \u2013 that do not fit into evaluation and performance criteria linked solely to the skills demanded by the market economy; EN C 258 E/58 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "Information about higher education institutions 12. Stresses that the quality and relevance of higher education are a core condition for taking full advantage of Europe\u2019s intellectual capital; 13. Proposes the introduction of clear and uniform criteria for the creation of pan-European rankings of higher education institutions, thereby allowing prospective students to make an informed choice of university and providing comprehensive information about the respective universities; 14. Encourages the Commission\u2019s initiative to launch, in cooperation with all the institutions, students and other stakeholders involved, a multi-dimensional tool for the differentiated classification and ranking of higher education institutions based on characteristics such as a long tradition of providing higher education in Europe, the quality of teaching, student support (i.e. scholarships, counselling, housing), physical and info- communication accessibility, regional engagement and knowledge transfer; opposes, on the other hand, the establishment of a classification of higher education institutions on the basis of non-homogeneous performance indicators which do not take into account the diversity of educational pathways, programmes and linguistic diversity in European universities; 15. Also emphasises that this tool should not solely involve compiling conventional ranking tables and that specific characteristics of the relevant institutions should be afforded due attention in the results; 16. Suggests that consideration be given to instituting a unified mechanism for the monitoring and evaluation of compliance with academic standards by higher education institutions, both public and private; Funding higher education systems 17. Stresses that higher education is a public good that fosters culture, diversity, democratic values and personal development and prepares students to become active citizens who will support European cohesion; 18. Insists once again that Member States should reach the target of investing 2 % of GDP in education; 19. Points out that mainly public and also private funding is of primary importance for the modern\u00ad isation of higher education systems; emphasises that investment in higher education in Europe is crucial to overcoming the current economic crisis; calls on the Member States and higher education institutions to expand scholarship and funding programmes for those institutions and to develop innovative methods of funding mechanisms which can contribute to more efficient functioning of higher education institutions, complement public funding without increasing the pressure on households and make higher education accessible to all; expresses regret at the significant cutbacks to education budgets in several Member States, as well as the constant increase in education fees, which is leading to a significant increase in the number of vulnerable students; 20. Calls for the EU budget for 2014-2020 under the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund to include spending on higher education related to investments in university infra\u00ad structure and academic staff; The transition from higher education to the labour market 21. Calls on higher education institutions to adapt to new challenges by creating new fields of study that reflect the needs of the labour market, taking into account the development of science and technology by maintaining an appropriate balance between theoretical knowledge and practical skills; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/59 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "22. Calls for the promotion of best practices that help higher education institutions to strengthen teaching and research in all subject areas through the inclusion of students and to provide additional key qualifications for the labour market, in order to facilitate young people\u2019s transition from higher education to the labour market; 23. Calls for higher education institutions to be opened up both to offer continuing vocational training and to create appropriate courses for workers who have not attained an upper secondary educational qualification, so as to tap into additional potential to achieve the quota of graduates; 24. Urges the Commission to present its proposal for a quality framework for traineeships, and emphasises the success of the ' Erasmus placements ' that give students the opportunity to gain work experience abroad, and insists that this action be continued under the new programme and strengthened by means of suitable funding; 25. Calls on higher education institutions and institutions responsible for the education sector at regional, national and European level to monitor trends in labour market requirements in order to reflect more accurately future needs in terms of learning opportunities; 26. Highlights the need to track graduates\u2019 employment outcomes to measure how well higher education responds to labour market demands; welcomes, therefore, the Commission\u2019s commitment to improving the availability of such data, with the principal aim of providing students with the necessary information to guide their study choices, while at the same time giving higher education and research institutions the necessary information to identify and, subsequently, develop programmes of study covering both general knowledge and specific professional skills through lifelong learning, in ongoing dialogue with those involved in the production of knowledge but also with society as a whole and with the state; 27. Urges Member States to collect and publish statistical data regarding the correlation between different higher education degrees and employment opportunities; 28. Calls for the development of an international databank, similar to AlmaLaurea, which helps graduates to identify suitable job, training, study and research opportunities, removing economic obstacles through bursaries and student loans in order to ensure real equality among students, and thereby encouraging mobility and the matching of skills and jobs; reiterates the importance of proper communication in ensuring that this information is easily accessible to students, recent graduates, the unemployed, jobseekers and employers; 29. Considers youth guarantee schemes to be a valuable tool facilitating the transition from higher education to jobs, and calls on the Member States to incorporate such schemes into their national transition strategies; 30. Recalls the important role that the structural funds can play in this regard; welcomes the commitment made in the \u2018Youth Opportunities Initiative\u2019 communication (COM(2011)0933) to the full deployment of the resources available, and calls on higher education institutions and local authorities to use this opportunity in order to increase the provision of support and guidance for students entering the labour market; Gender balance in higher education 31. Notes that there are still gender disparities in European education systems even though almost all countries have now implemented policies to combat them, and that such disparities influence both performance at school and study and career choices, and have a negative effect on economic growth and on the welfare state; 32. Highlights the fact that many female students attending vocational or secondary schools still choose careers which reflect traditional gender roles; notes, therefore, that better vocational guidance is needed in order to combat persistent stereotypes; EN C 258 E/60 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "33. Points out that, because their higher education qualifications are not marketable enough, women are more often overqualified and underpaid for their jobs and often end up unemployed or in casual jobs, a situation which further disadvantages them on the labour market at the start of their careers, fuelling the cycle of pay inequality; 34. Recalls that, across the Member States, there are still very few initiatives in place to provide information about gender equality and promote gender equality in education; suggests that teachers should receive specific training on equality between men and women; 35. Points out that the sharing of domestic and family responsibilities between women and men is a sine qua non for the advancement and achievement of equality between women and men; calls on universities and higher education institutions to recognise that women learners may have specific additional responsi\u00ad bilities outside of learning, such as caring for young children or elderly relatives; stresses the need for universities to supply parents \u2013 especially women \u2013 with a sufficient quantity of high-quality, affordable and accessible childcare, including community centres, so as to facilitate their equal participation in studies and research; also encourages the introduction of a greater variety of study modes, such as part-time and distance learning, and, in this connection, reminds the Member States and the EU institutions to increase the level of financial support for lifelong learning in order to enable women to continue their studies, to re- enter the workforce and to balance their professional and personal responsibilities; Engaged higher education institutions 36. Encourages higher education institutions to engage more intensively with their regions and establish dynamic collaborative actions with regional governments, local councils, public bodies, non-governmental organisations and small and medium-sized enterprises to enhance regional development; points out that this should also strengthen interaction between higher education institutions and employers; 37. Calls on the Member States and their central and regional authorities to include and support higher education institutions in cross-border cooperation; 38. Encourages the Member States to intensify the interaction between the sides of the knowledge triangle (education, research, innovation) as a key element for growth and job creation; 39. Points out that the development of higher education curricula and research programmes should remain a task for universities, taking into account the needs of the labour market as regards employability; 40. Welcomes the Commission's support for ' Knowledge Alliances ' and ' Sector Skills Alliances ' in which higher education institutions exchange information with businesses while developing curricula to address skills shortages; calls upon businesses and entrepreneurs, including small and medium-sized enterprises, actively to develop partnerships with higher education institutions by providing high-quality internships for students and lecturers and capitalising on lecturers\u2019 general transferable skills; reiterates, however, that higher education institutions produce cultural content which translates not only into vocational skills but also into general knowledge, in terms of intellectual experience of reality and of the common values by which people live; 41. Calls for a commitment to more flexible and innovative learning approaches and to delivery methods which are always centred on students' needs; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/61 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "42. Notes the need for cross-border higher education institutions and enterprises to cooperate in practical programmes and in shaping students\u2019 future careers by identifying the specific development pathways, expectations and challenges that will await them in the labour market; 43. Emphasises the usefulness of developing mechanisms and management strategies that facilitate the transfer of innovative ideas and research results into society and business and allow society and businesses to provide input to higher education regarding current and expected needs for skills and innovations, taking into account best practices from all over the world; points out that such a connection is likely to favour financially only those research and higher education institutions that specialise in innovation and technology at the expense of education linked purely to the humanities; 44. Reaffirms the value of democratic governance as a fundamental way to ensure academic freedom and promote active participation by all actors in the life of a higher education institution; 45. Emphasises that transparency, equal distribution of rights and obligations between the relevant cooperation partners and higher education institutions, and a balanced principle of representation must be observed in the context of cooperation, so as to ensure that higher education institutions are enabled to organise and develop themselves independently as public amenities in accordance with academic principles; 46. Also emphasises that the principle of democracy and self-governance among higher education institutions and their staff and students should be respected and maintained in all collaborative projects; 47. Demands, therefore, that higher education institutions and their various bodies be required to disclose cooperative agreements with third parties; 48. Emphasises the importance of cooperation between higher education institutions and NGOs and the European voluntary sector, in order to promote active citizenship and involve students in active partici\u00ad pation through working for the NGO sector; 49. Underlines the importance of sport in the education process; calls on Member States to support and encourage sport among students and to increase support for grassroots sport programmes; 50. Points out that the extent and intensity of collaboration between higher education institutions and their partners in business and society vary strongly across Member States, institutions and academic disciplines; 51. Stresses that continuous investment in the link between education, culture, research and innovation is necessary; stresses the importance of further supporting and developing the European Institute for Innovation and Technology with its knowledge and innovation communities; 52. Emphasises the importance of culture in higher education and calls for the inclusion of special criteria for the humanities in both innovation and research; 53. Emphasises the need to engage higher education institutions and provide support for student initiatives, as well as assisting in the coordination of such activities among other higher education institu\u00ad tions, enterprises and local authorities from various Member States; Mutual recognition of qualifications 54. Acknowledges the richness inherent in the wide variety of higher education institutions in Europe; calls on the Member States and these institutions to develop clear, integrated pathways that allow learners to progress from other types of education into higher education and to change between different tracks and types of institutions; EN C 258 E/62 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "55. Emphasises, however, the need to maintain the diversity of educational pathways and programmes, teaching methods and university systems in the EU; takes the view that it is consequently necessary to develop a national qualification framework, while at the same time promoting the mutual recognition of degrees and qualifications across all Member States; 56. Urges all EU countries to implement the national qualification frameworks linked to the EHEA Qualifications Framework and to develop, and provide financial support for, mutual recognition; 57. Points out that student mobility, and above all study at other universities under the Erasmus Programme, contributes to the exchange of good practice and thus to the modernisation of higher education; notes, therefore, the need for the home university to recognise qualifications acquired while studying at other universities; 58. Supports the Commission\u2019s proposal to improve recognition of study undertaken abroad, by consoli\u00ad dating the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS); calls for additional efforts on the part of the EU and its Member States to ensure more effective recognition and greater harmonisation of academic qualifications as well; Enhancing mobility in the EHEA and beyond 59. Reiterates that higher education is a common European public good and that Member States, regional governments, local authorities and the EU share a common responsibility in developing and strengthening the EHEA, the European Research Area (ERA) and the Bologna Process; 60. Stresses that greater coordination among Member States in the field of higher education \u2013 including through strong financial and political support for agreements on common core curricula and well-defined learning outcomes \u2013 is a prerequisite for achieving the goals of employability and growth in Europe; calls on the Member States to step up cooperation between their relevant ministries in order to update existing curricula to meet the needs of the labour market; 61. Points out the need for collaboration between the EHEA and the ERA as a means to support university research programmes in both science and the humanities; 62. Demands that the attractiveness of the EHEA and the ERA for students and researchers from all over the world be promoted and that collaboration with non-EU countries in educational matters and issues relating to mobility at staff and student level be strengthened, in particular with the countries which are covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) or which directly border the EU, in order to turn the EHEA into a magnet for training and knowledge that is both macroregional and global, particularly in relation to exchange and professional training programmes; 63. Asks the Commission to propose the creation of Euro-Mediterranean Erasmus and Leonardi da Vinci programmes, aimed at promoting transnational mobility among students from both sides of the Medi\u00ad terranean; 64. Calls for the opening of mobility, exchange, research and work experience programmes to students from countries affiliated to the Eastern Partnership; 65. Recalls the importance of mobility among both students and teachers and, in this connection, invites the Commission to make progress on the EU Visa Code; 66. Recalls the target whereby 20 % of Europe's graduates should be mobile by 2020, and emphasises the importance of language skills as a prerequisite for increased mobility within the EHEA and employa\u00ad bility; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/63 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "67. Supports the reinforcement of language and sign language teaching \u2013 and of the teaching and development of local and regional languages \u2013 within the EHEA as a prerequisite for the development of true European citizenship based on multiculturalism and linguistic pluralism; 68. Emphasises the need for the higher education system in each Member State to provide higher-quality teaching so that increased mobility opportunities for students do not go hand in hand with a worsening of the \u2018brain drain\u2019, which is now a genuine social problem in some Member States; 69. Points out that the persistent disparities between western and central-eastern European higher education systems must be addressed through real integration measures, with a view to encouraging and supporting cross-border collaboration between higher education institutions; calls on the Commission, therefore, to develop a strategy and draw up a professional financial action plan for reducing these significant regional disparities; 70. Calls on the Member States, the EU and European higher education systems to evaluate the possi\u00ad bility of promoting, within the study cycle, a compulsory training period at a university in a Member State other than the one to which the student is affiliated; 71. Reiterates the principle that loan schemes cannot substitute the grant systems put in place to support access to education for all students regardless of their social background; 72. Asks the Commission for further clarification of the proposal to create a financial instrument to help students secure funding for a Masters degree outside their home Member State, regardless of their social background and financial situation; demands fair and transparent access to the scheme throughout the Member States; 73. Endorses the Commission's proposal to increase the EU budget available for education, training, research and youth in the next multiannual financial framework, thereby complementing the action taken by the Member States, given that investment in education, training and research is key to attaining the Europe 2020 targets and achieving smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe; * * * 74.

        "A. whereas information and communications technology (ICT) has a profound direct and indirect impact on the political, economic, social, cultural and everyday life of EU citizens; whereas a competitive digital single market that would eliminate all barriers for cross-border e-services and be free of distortions of competition would benefit EU citizens considerably; B. whereas eGovernment brings all technology and use relating to online information, guidance and administrative procedures under one umbrella; C. whereas the ICT sector is directly responsible for 5 % of EU GDP, with a market value of EUR 660 billion annually, but contributes far more to overall productivity growth (20 % directly from the ICT sector and 30 % from ICT investment); D. whereas there are no uniform rules on electronic invoicing, and for the most part its benefits remain untapped; E. whereas ICT can make a significant contribution to the EU 2020 Strategy, particularly with regard to employment, sustainable economic and productivity growth, citizen empowerment, R&D, energy, innovation and the environment, and to tackling the grand societal challenges; F. whereas SMEs play a particularly important role in the digital market; G. whereas cloud computing is an economic and ecological tool that improves the IT performance of public and private concerns, cuts processing costs and limits storage costs, all of which are clearly benefits, but the connection between user and server is insufficiently secure and the user experiences a certain loss of control; H. whereas the Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2011 shows progress, but 26 % of EU citizens have never used the internet and only 48 % of people belonging to disadvantaged groups use it; I. whereas the digital divide, whether seen as an internet access divide or an e-skills/digital literacy divide, directly affects eGovernment adoption and is detrimental to citizens\u2019 participation in public life and democracy; J. whereas a competitive digital single market needs to ensure the successful deployment of ultrafast broadband and telecommunications networks across all EU regions and eliminate disparities between levels of infrastructure development in and between Member States, in order to ensure the demographic sustainability of sparsely populated regions; 1. Is aware of the major contribution made by the ICT sector to the EU\u2019s industrial policy, innovation, growth, competitiveness and the trade balance; 2. Underlines that users are the key for the digital strategy and that there is a pressing need in the EU to strengthen users\u2019 awareness, role, involvement, perspective and trust in relation to security, safety and privacy in the information society, and to develop ICT-related human capital; 3. Reaffirms that eGovernment empowers European citizens and helps reform and modernise public administration, by making it more transparent and accountable and reducing the costs of public services; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/67 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "4. Stresses that the barriers to eGovernment adoption are not necessarily only technological, but also organisational, political, legal and cultural, and that successful solutions and practices are usually highly dependent on local conditions; 5. Underlines that the creation of a European eGovernment Area has the potential to be an essential part of the Horizon 2020 agenda, boosting the promotion of economic and social growth, stimulating inno\u00ad vation and human capital development, and helping meet the societal and political challenges faced by the EU; 6. Stresses the need to take account of and combat the digital divide; 7. Notes that cloud computing enables access to a shared hub of IT resources that can be quickly relayed with a minimum of management effort and service provider interaction, and that the cloud\u2019s effectiveness lies in its flexibility, the productivity gains it brings and its role in protecting the environment, but that first and foremost it needs to be technically reliable and robust; eGovernment Action Plan 8. Welcomes the adoption of the European eGovernment Action Plan 2011-2015, the European Inter\u00ad operability Strategy (EIS) and the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) for European public services (EPS); calls on the Member States to take rapid action to align their national strategies to these overarching policies; 9. Supports the overall targets for increased use of eGovernment services in 2015, i.e. 50 % of citizens (up from 41 %) and 80 % of businesses (up from 75 %), but calls on the Commission and Member States to consider these targets as minimum thresholds; 10. Calls for special programmes and eGovernment platforms to be developed with the aim of protecting and promoting local, regional, ethnic and linguistic diversity; 11. Regrets the fact that, according to the Digital Agenda Scoreboard 2011, only 50 % of eGovernment users filled in forms online; 12. Notes the correlation between GDP and availability of eGovernment services, and calls for appro\u00ad priate funding for the development of eGovernment, both at national and European level; 13. Underlines that the internet is increasingly used on mobile devices by both citizens and enterprises, and calls for action to ensure that eGovernment services are accessible and adapted to multiple channels of delivery, including call centres and the mobile internet (m-government); 14. Points out that successful eGovernment calls for comprehensive integration and optimisation of administrative processes, taking account of the right to local self-government at and across all levels; 15. Highlights that eGovernment is particularly beneficial for EU citizens and entrepreneurs, particularly SMEs, who now often face insurmountable barriers when operating cross-border within the EU, as it brings reduced administrative costs and burdens, increased productivity, efficiency, competitiveness, transparency, openness, policy effectiveness, accessibility and streamlining of procedures, and as it should facilitate the building of synergies and sharing of resources and capabilities between firms and allow a more collaborative professional environment for SMEs; 16. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to publish publicly funded data in machine-readable form (and in real time) under open licences, in order to allow the innovative reuse of public-sector information by both academia, including students, and the general public, and for research and business development, thus also enhancing transparency; EN C 258 E/68 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "17. Points out that there is still no clear definition of the term \u2018public administrative data\u2019 and that, with a view to clarifying its precise meaning, a common understanding must be reached by means of public discussion; 18. Calls on the Commission to do everything possible to ensure that educational institutions and cultural establishments remain outside the scope of Directive 2003/98/EC; 19. Notes that the main barriers to crossborder access to e-services of public administrations are related to the use of eIdentification and eSignatures, and that there is a lack of interoperability at EU level; 20. Considers that in order to ensure effective EU-wide crossborder eGovernment services providing two- way and/or automated interaction between administrations and citizens and/or businesses, there needs to be a clear and coherent EU legal framework for the mutual recognition of eAuthentication, eIdentification and eSignatures; 21. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to continuously inform citizens about the existing EU portals, such as SOLVIT and Your Europe, as the current lack of information is delaying further development of the business environment and consumer protection arrangements, especially in crossborder areas; 22. Calls on the Commission to keep track of all existing online problem-solving tools and information portals provided by itself and the Member States, and to interlink or consolidate them where possible; recommends that new online portals be developed only when integration into existing solutions is not feasible; 23. Welcomes the adoption and contribution of the Action Plan on eSignatures and eIdentification as well as of the STORK pilot project, in terms of interoperability of crossborder public services; calls on the Commission to revise the eSignature Directive, and calls for a decision that will ensure the mutual recog\u00ad nition of eIdentification and eAuthentication; 24. Emphasises that wherever data processing procedures are employed in educational institutions and cultural establishments, personal data must be covered by individual access rights in order to protect them against unauthorised use; 25. Considers that eSignature interoperability from the eGovernment perspective has legal aspects (eSig\u00ad nature use in the public sector \u2013 Article 3.7 of the eSignature Directive; the relationship signature/auth\u00ad entication; the supervision/accreditation dilemma; the national perspective; security levels; signature qualifi\u00ad cations) as well as technical aspects (identifiers in certificates; signature type; signature format; signature validation); is of the opinion that for the evolution of applications with a view to a fully interoperable European eSignature service for signature validation purposes, the most significant recommendation should be to set up a Federation of Validation Authorities (FVA) to coordinate Member States\u2019 National Validation Authorities (NVAs) ( 1 ); 26. Notes that the Commission has mandated CEN, CENELEC and ETSI to update and rationalise the European eSignature standardisation framework; calls on the Commission to submit a yearly progress report to Parliament, based on the reports submitted twice a year by the European standardisation bodies; 27. Calls on the Member States to develop open educational software at European educational institu\u00ad tions, to exchange best practice, and to develop online platforms for collaboration on educational materials and resources that are free for students and take due account of data protection and copyright rules; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/69 ( 1 ) IDABC- Preliminary Study on Mutual Recognition of eSignatures for eGovernment applications, 2007. Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "28. Underlines that eGovernment applications should be reviewed and, if necessary, modified to ensure they are also open to non-resident users; stresses that interoperability is needed at local, regional and national level and at EU level; 29. Considers that the interoperability of eGovernment applications requires the interoperability of national Private Key Infrastructures (PKI) through a European Validation Service (European Bridge); 30. Welcomes the public consultation launched on the subject of draft guidelines on links between ICT standardisation and public procurement, and calls for a proposal on the matter; 31. Invites the Member States to develop national eGovernment strategies, in line with the objectives and targets of the eGovernment Action Plan and the Digital Agenda, as a means towards developing the European digital single market and the European eGovernance Area; 32. Points out that, as the European eGovernment Action Plan and infrastructure and services develop, security requirements must be met at all levels and that the best achievable protection of privacy and personal and financial data must be ensured in order to prevent unauthorised monitoring of the latter in any form; 33. Calls on the Member States to make use of ICT tools to improve transparency, accountability and citizen involvement, increase efficiency and competitiveness, reduce administrative burdens, time and costs, improve administrative processes, reduce carbon emissions, save public resources, and contribute to a more participatory democracy while building up trust and confidence; 34. Encourages the Member States to oblige public entities to make data available by maintaining repositories and catalogues of public data and ensuring that rules for disclosure and reuse are established, taking due account of copyright law and the law on the protection of databases; 35. Calls on the Member States to implement \u2018one-stop shops\u2019 and make use of intermediary actors, with a view to providing a seamless, integrated and easily accessible system of contact points for users, for both domestic and crossborder eGovernment services; 36. Underlines that eGovernment can enhance the quality of our democracy and can play an important role in increasing the active participation of citizens - especially the young generations \u2013 and businesses alike in public and political life and democratic processes; notes that in this regard, pilot consultations or referendums, particularly at local level, should be encouraged; 37. Welcomes the launch of OCS (Online Collection Software), developed on the Commission\u2019s initiative within the framework of the ISA programme and intended to allow signatories to submit, from 1 April 2012, their support for a proposed citizens\u2019 initiative by online means, as well as to be used by the organisers of a petition for managing the collection, storing and submission of signatures; therefore wishes to see the e-government strategies implemented as soon as possible; 38. Underlines that interoperable crossborder eGovernment services should benefit from innovative architecture and technologies (public cloud services, Service-Oriented Architecture), and calls for the upgrading of IPv6-relevant eGovernment infrastructure and online services of public interest; 39. Recognises the major potential of cloud computing, for businesses and private citizens alike; however, stresses that with the increased use of cloud services, supervision of the relocation of IT resources and strict control of access to servers and data are required, inter alia in order to prevent unauthorised commercial use by other parties, and that as a consequence these issues should be dealt with in the reform of the EU data protection rules as proposed by the Commission (COM(2012)0011), COM(2012)0010)); EN C 258 E/70 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "40. Stresses that a secure crossborder eGovernment system is an integral part of the European Critical Infrastructure Protection programme; calls for adequate measures to be put in place to ensure data and privacy protection and minimise vulnerability to cyber-attacks; recognises the important role of ENISA in assisting the EU and the Member States in their efforts to provide secure and robust eGovernment services; calls for the introduction of truly democratic forms of monitoring of data use and of the methods employed; 41. Welcomes the contribution of the IDA, IDABCD and ISA programmes and CIP large-scale pilots, as well as of the ePractice forum in designing and implementing crossborder interoperable solutions; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure the long-term sustainability of these actions; 42. Welcomes and supports the \u2018Connecting Europe Facility\u2019 (CEF) proposal, which allocates almost EUR 9,2 billion to support investment in fast and ultrafast broadband networks and pan-European digital services; CEF will provide grants for building the infrastructure needed to roll out e-ID, e-identification, eGovernment, e-procurement, e-health, e-justice and customs-related services, and will serve to ensure interoperability and meet the costs of running the infrastructure at European level, linking up Member States\u2019 infrastructures; 43. Considers that the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative will mobilise private financing for targeted investment in the future key EU infrastructures, such as roads, railways, energy grids and pipelines and broadband networks; 44. Reiterates the importance of future high-speed services that will help deliver the EU\u2019s energy effi\u00ad ciency and safety objectives and other communications capabilities (e.g. efficient and intelligent transport systems, person-to-machine communication systems); 45. Welcomes the adoption of the Open Data Package, and calls on the Member States to support the reuse of public sector information in innovative ways (non-personal information); calls for the better involvement of local and regional authorities as regards access to public-sector information in order to improve the provision of information to the public, business and institutions, and to facilitate the creation of new jobs while boosting development at local and regional level; 46. Underlines the importance of measurement methodologies (qualitative and quantitative), focused on efficiency and effectiveness in terms of eGovernment and democracy and using SMART ( 1 ) targets, which should be in active use across governments; 47. Regrets that the list of all key crossborder public services to be made available online by 2015 has not yet been agreed by the Member States; calls on the Commission to step up its efforts towards achieving this goal; 48. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop and put in place specific ICT tools to facilitate eParticipation - such as common ePetitioning schemes - with the aim of giving EU citizens and representative associations the practical means of exercising their rights under the citizens\u2019 initiative provisions laid down in Article 11 TEU; 49. Recalls the key commitment to reduce both digital literacy gaps and competence gaps by half by 2015, and, in this sense, welcomes the proposals to enhance digital literacy, skills and eInclusion, and especially the proposal to make digital literacy and related components a priority for the European Social Fund regulation (2014-2020); reiterates the need for a \u2018no citizen left behind - inclusion by design\u2019 approach, and stresses the need for a user- and citizen-centred design of eGovernment services; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/71 ( 1 ) SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timed.

Calls on the Commission and the Member States to launch digital training programmes to promote the full use of eGovernment services, reinforce digital literacy and overcome the e-barriers affecting SMEs and disadvantaged sectors of the population such as older people, persons with disabilities, minorities, immigrants, the unemployed and those living in remote areas of the Union; to this extent, e-learning should be incorporated into national education and training policies, including the definition of programmes, the assessment of training outcomes and the professional development of teachers and trainers; 51. Regrets the delay affecting the legislative proposal aiming to ensure that public-sector websites are fully accessible by 2015; welcomes the Roadmap for digital inclusion, and calls for implementation of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), including Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for eGovernment portals, as well as available and affordable customised terminals tailored to the needs of disabled persons; 52. Recommends, with a view to ensuring quality in the provision of these services, that they be brought into line with the international standards, norms and guidelines concerning good practice, such as ISO 27001 on information security or ISO 20000 on quality in IT service management processes; eProcurement 53. Stresses that eProcurement enables EU public procurement and maximum choice for public auth\u00ad orities, resulting in the efficient spending of money, transparency, accountability, public trust, and the strengthening of the internal market and competition; 54. Emphasises that in the EU-27 public expenditure represents 16 % of GDP, and urges the use of eProcurement for all public procurement by 2015; calls for the use of eProcurement also for concessions; 55. Regrets the fact that in 2010 only 13 % of EU enterprises used the internet to submit a proposal to public authorities through a public electronic tender system; calls on the Member States to encourage the participation of SMEs in eProcurement; 56. Stresses that eProcurement consists of two phases: pre-awarding ( 1 ) and post-awarding ( 2 ); calls on the Member States to fully implement and integrate both phases on their eProcurement portals by 2015; 57. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the qualitative level of ICT projects in public administrations, so as to ensure that administrations\u2019 strategic objectives for innovation are pursued and that general standards are raised as regards the quality, duration and cost of tenders; 58. Urges the Commission and the Member States to promote, in central and local public adminis\u00ad trations, the pre-commercial procurement (PCP) model, which enables public procurers to share with suppliers the risks and benefits of designing, prototyping and testing new products and services, pool the efforts of several procurers, create the optimum conditions for wide commercialisation and take-up of R&D results, and help keep such projects within the operating budget assigned to them; EN C 258 E/72 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 ( 1 ) e-Notice, e-Tendering, e-Submission, acceptance of e-Signatures.

Urges the Commission to submit the White Paper on interconnecting eProcurement capacity in the EU \u2013 \u2018A strategy for eProcurement\u2019; 62. Calls on the Commission to introduce an implementation monitoring mechanism to review progress, barriers, corrective action, etc, in the context of the introduction of eProcurement in the Member States; 63. Considers that the Commission, as a leader, should set an example to all by implementing the eProcurement system in all its organs; eInvoicing 64. Welcomes the eInvoicing Initiative, which aims to make eInvoicing the predominant method of invoicing in the EU by 2020, and the Commission decision setting up the European Multi-Stakeholder Forum on eInvoicing (EMSFEI); 65. Underlines the substantial benefits offered by eInvoicing as a tool for the more efficient and less burdensome management of all customer-supplier relationships, in both public and private spheres, by means of shorter payment times, fewer errors, better collection of VAT, reduced printing and postage costs and business process integration; notes also that such a tool allows greater transparency of the information flows and exchanges involved in issuing invoices; 66.

        "1. Deplores the decision taken by the Argentine Government, disregarding a negotiated solution, to proceed with the expropriation of the majority of shares of a European company; maintains that this represents a unilateral and arbitrary decision which entails an attack on the exercise of free enterprise and the principle of legal certainty, thus causing the investment environment for EU businesses in Argentina to deteriorate; 2. Notes that this decision affects only one undertaking in the sector and only part of its shares, which could be considered discriminatory; 3. Expresses its deep concerns regarding the situation as it represents the non-fulfilment of obligations under international agreements; warns about the negative effects that such measures might have, such as international disinvestment and adverse consequences for Argentina in the international community; 4. Recalls that the objective of the ongoing negotiations on the Association Agreement between the EU and Mercosur is to introduce a framework for economic integration and political dialogue between the two blocks in order to achieve the highest degree of progress and prosperity for both regions, and believes that for such negotiations to be successful both sides have to approach the talks in a spirit of openness and mutual trust; points out also that decisions such as that taken by the Argentine authorities can put a strain on the climate of understanding and friendship needed to reach such an agreement; 5. Regrets that Argentina has not respected this principle and has introduced several restrictive trade and investment measures, such as non-tariff barriers, which have hampered EU businesses and global trade with Argentina; 6. Calls on the Commission to respond to these restrictions using all the appropriate dispute settlement tools available at the World Trade Organisation and the G20 to cooperate with other countries facing similar discriminatory barriers to trade and investment; 7. Calls on the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission and the High Representative for CFSP to make every effort with the Argentine authorities to defend the Community interest and to safeguard the principle of legal certainty which guarantees Europe\u2019s presence and investment in this South American country, by returning to the path of dialogue; 8. Urges the European Commission and the Council to explore and adopt any measures required to safeguard European interests in order to avoid such situations arising again, including the possible partial suspension of the unilateral tariff preferences under the GSP scheme; 9. Recalls the deep friendship between the EU and the Republic of Argentina, with which the EU shares common values and principles, and urges the Argentine authorities to return to the path of dialogue and negotiation as the most appropriate means of resolving possible differences between trading partners and countries that are traditionally friends; 10. Welcomes the statement by High Representative Ashton condemning the action of the Argentine Government and the cancellation of the meeting of the EU-Argentina Joint Cooperation Committee; urges Commissioner De Gucht and High Representative Ashton to use all diplomatic avenues available to solve this situation with their Argentine counterparts; calls on the Commission and the Member States to work closely with their colleagues in international fora such as the G20 and the WTO to achieve a consensus opposing the actions of the Argentine Government; 11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments of the Member States, the Government and Parliament of the Argentine Republic and the members of the Mercosur Council.

        "N. whereas peer review field visits by the OECD/DAC regularly show that local staff can feel underutilised or not fully integrated into the local donor team; 1. Welcomes the general conclusions of the ECA\u2019s report and calls on the Commission to continue its efforts to increase the effectiveness of aid delivery; 2. Welcomes the very comprehensive and analytical report prepared by the European Court of Auditors, as well as the excellent timing of the assessment of the results of the devolution process; 3. Calls on the Commission to ensure that its headquarters have sufficient capacity and human resources to provide adequate support to delegations through the Quality Operations Directorate; 4. Notes that, according to the Court\u2019s report, further efforts are necessary on the part of the Commission in order improve the manner in which it evaluates the quality and the results of its inter\u00ad ventions; takes the view that this will result in better accountability for the EU\u2019s financial interventions and will ensure increased visibility for its actions; 5. Encourages the Commission to complement the criteria and strengthen the procedures for assessing the quality of the projects financed, in order to increase the quality of aid and further to decrease the number of non-performing projects; notes that the impact of aid expenditure is of paramount importance for Parliament; 6. Is concerned that over the period 2005 to 2008 the composition of delegation staffing shifted towards more political and trade-oriented functions, and calls on the Commission to strike an appropriate balance in delegations\u2019 staffing between aid management and other functions; 7. Considers the high turnover rate of staff in delegations to be unacceptable (40 % of Commission staff are contract agents), as this weakens the institutional memory and negatively affects the efficiency of operations; 8. Notes that 6 % of the commitments under the budget available for 2006 were not contracted by 2009 and were therefore lost under the D+3 rule; calls for this percentage to be brought down, and would like to be informed of the relevant percentages and amounts for 2010 and 2011; 9. Calls on the Commission and the EEAS to address specifically the areas identified by the audit, in particular the workload within delegations, the adequacy of staffing levels among delegations and the balance of delegations\u2019 staffing between aid management and other functions; 10. Calls on the Commission to consider promoting local consultation, where possible, when deciding on aid projects and monitoring their progress; 11. Believes that, in order to make EU development policy more coherent and more effective, the Commission services within the EU delegations should contribute to development aid policy-making and be in the lead for its implementation; repeats its call on the Commission to appoint Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) focal points in each delegation to monitor the impact of EU policy at partner-country level; 12. Points out that consideration should be given to using local expertise and that the existing staff of the EU delegations should strive towards greater involvement in the local societies, in order to bridge the knowledge gap and to ensure an accurate understanding of the local environment in which they operate; 13. Calls on the Commission to offer and provide in a more systematic manner legal and financial training for local staff, with a view to optimising the management of EU aid and ensuring good governance in the medium term at local authority level; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/89 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "14. Believes that both the mandate and the competences of the EEAS in development cooperation are still unclear, and calls on the Council and the Commission to take the necessary steps to resolve this situation; notes with concern, in this connection, that the separation between the EEAS\u2019s political and administrative tasks and the Commission\u2019s aid management tasks might be a source of possible incon\u00ad sistencies in the implementation of the principles of the Paris Declaration; 15. Emphasises, in line with the decision establishing the EEAS, that all of the staff working in a delegation come under the authority of the head of delegation, since this is the only way to ensure the coherence of EU external action in a given country in line with the Lisbon Treaty; 16. Calls on the Commission and the Council to continue to advocate a reduction in the number of areas of intervention, in line with the EU Code of Conduct on Complementarity and Division of Labour and the Agenda for Change; 17. Believes that the relevant EU financial instruments and the European Development Fund (EDF) need to be more poverty-focused and more flexible with regard to their approach and operation, and that more accountability and transparency and better value for money in terms of achieving clear results should also be encouraged; 18. Expects the Commission to take all the necessary measures to overcome the weaknesses of the supervisory and control systems, notably at delegation level, as indicated by the Court; asks the Commission to inform Parliament\u2019s competent committees by the end of 2012 at the latest as to the measures it has taken; 19. Notes the Court of Auditors\u2019 criticism ( 1 ) of the working relationship between the Commission\u2019s headquarters and its delegations for the management of external aid; calls for the processes in question to be reviewed and simplified with a view to reducing internal bureaucracy, and for a report on the action taken to be submitted to Parliament; 20. Encourages the Commission to require the delegations systematically to carry out technical and financial monitoring visits to projects and to focus the internal reporting system more on the results achieved by the aid interventions; 21. Calls on the Commission, with the active participation of the delegations, to analyse and identify possibilities for leveraging the aid programmes in the partner countries with the involvement of the EIB and of European national and international institutions that finance development; 22. Calls on the Commission to show how further devolution of financial and human-resource respon\u00ad sibilities from Commission headquarters to delegations would add value by improving dialogue and the coordination and programming of EU aid on the ground; 23. Stresses that neither the Commission nor the Member States should use the current economic and financial crisis to justify a \u2018doing more with less\u2019 approach involving containing or reducing staffing levels in bilateral aid agencies; 24. Stresses the importance of ensuring the highest professional standards amongst staff working on development cooperation, both at the Commission and at the EU delegations and the bilateral aid agencies; 25. Believes that, in the interests of smooth implementation of the EU budget, heads of delegation should be able to delegate the management of a delegation\u2019s administrative expenditure to their deputies, and that the Financial Regulation should if necessary be revised accordingly; EN C 258 E/90 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 ( 1 ) See ECA Special Report No 1/2011, Figure 1.

        "26. Calls on the Commission and Member States to make greater efforts to improve links between EU delegations and bilateral agencies and partner governments and other development groups such as think tanks, universities, foundations, NGOs and sub-national authorities, since closer ties will maximise the comparative advantages of the devolution process and of the different actors within the national context, while avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort; 27. Calls for it to be ensured, during the process of devolving the management of EU external aid from centralised services to delegations, that Parliament keeps its powers of oversight and scrutiny; 28. Welcomes the Court of Auditors\u2019 remark that the role of the EEAS in the area of consular protection should be further explored; 29.

Calls on the Commission and the Member States to include \u2013 at all levels of decision-making \u2013 gender equality and gender justice objectives in policies, action plans and other measures relating to sustainable development, disaster risk and climate change, by carrying out systematic gender analyses, establishing gender-sensitive indicators and benchmarks and developing practical tools; underlines that the climate change negotiation process must take into account the principles of gender equality at all stages, from research and analysis to design and implementation and the development of mitigation and adaptation strategies; 4. Recalls that, in its 4th Assessment Report of 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that the impact of climate change varies according to gender, age and class, with the poor being most likely to suffer the most; takes the view that achieving gender equality is key to human development and is a fundamental objective in the fight against poverty; demands that a gender-based approach be applied across the board in the drawing-up of development, human rights and climate change policies; calls for steps to be taken to ensure that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) acts in accordance with human rights frameworks and with national and international agreements on gender equality and equity, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); 5. Highlights the fact that climate change and its negative impacts should also be regarded as a devel\u00ad opment issue with gender implications that is relevant to all sectors (social, cultural, economic and political), from the local to the global level, and that concerted efforts are required by all stakeholders to ensure that climate change and disaster risk reduction measures are gender-responsive, sensitive to indigenous people and respectful of human rights; EN C 258 E/94 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "6. Welcomes the growing awareness of the gender aspect of climate change in the high-level climate talks, and interventions by high-level actors; stresses however the need to see concrete action to include more women,in EU climate diplomacy, at all levels of decision-making and especially in climate change negotiations, by means of measures such as introducing 40 %+ quotas in the delegations; 7. Reminds the Commission and the Member States of its resolution on the climate change conference in Durban (COP 17), and urges them to act on its commitment to \u2018strive for female representation of at least 40 % in all relevant bodies\u2019 for climate financing; underlines the need to apply this principle to technology transfer and adaptation bodies as well; 8. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to collect country-specific and gender-disaggregated data when planning, implementing and evaluating climate change policies, programmes and projects, in order effectively to assess and address the differing effects of climate change on each gender and to produce a guide on adapting to climate change, outlining policies that can protect women and empower them to cope with the effects of climate change; 9. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to mainstream gender-sensitive statistics in all environment-related policy areas, in order to improve the measurement of the general situation of women and men with regard to climate change; 10. Recalls that the inclusion in EU foreign policy of issues relating to the promotion of gender equality and the elimination of discrimination should continue to contribute to women playing a central role in decision-making, policy formation, the management, conservation and monitoring of natural resources and of the environment, and efforts to combat climate change; 11. Calls for a \u2018climate-friendly\u2019 indicator (as an alternative to GNP) to monitor how growth, consumption and lifestyle patterns influence climate change; 12. Calls on the EU and the Member States to assess to what extent climate-related policies take account of women\u2019s needs, and urges them to apply a gender-based perspective when formulating gender-sensitive sustainable development policy; Adaptation 13. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to set up easy-to-use tools for gender impact assessments of projects throughout project life-cycles, such as the tools used for development projects; 14. Calls for inclusive local solutions and projects, including built-in awareness of existing vulnerabilities and capacities to cope, such as the traditional experiences and knowledge of indigenous people, and in particular women; 15. Points out that women are globally very active at civil society level, and therefore calls on the Commission to facilitate and support the networking of women\u2019s organisations and civil-society actors; 16. Calls on the Commission to envisage programmes whereby the transfer of modern technologies and know-how can help developing communities and regions adapt to climate change; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/95 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "17. Points out that women play a crucial role in water abstraction and management in developing countries, as they are often the ones collecting, using and distributing water, not just in the home but also in farming; calls on the Commission to provide development aid for accessible programmes to sink wells using renewable energy sources and simple, easy-to-maintain water treatment systems; 18. Calls for the integration of gender-aware capacity-building and training into adaptation solutions, which must be compatible with the special needs of women and take into account the specific obstacles, but also capabilities and experiences, of women; 19. Highlights the importance of relying on the knowledge of women and encouraging local solutions that have very concrete influence on people\u2019s daily lives, such as the project \u2018Girls in Risk Reduction Leadership\u2019 in South Africa, or several projects to help women\u2019s groups install drinking water facilities and toilets in Indian slums; 20. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to integrate the gender issue into strategies for preventing and managing the risks associated with natural disasters, and to promote women's empowerment and awareness through capacity-building before, during and after climate-related disasters, along with their active involvement in disaster anticipation, early warning systems and risk prevention as part of their role in resilience-building; 21. Notes that in many communities around the world, women\u2019s responsibilities in the family make them more vulnerable to environmental change, which is exacerbated by the impact of climate change; points out that they are being affected in their multiple roles as food producers and providers, caregivers and economic actors; 22. Calls for an increase in transparency and inclusiveness of existing mechanisms and planning processes, such as National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and future National Adaptation Plans, and for these principles to be promoted in future climate-related treaties, mechanisms and bilateral cooperation efforts; 23. Emphasises that there is strong evidence that the impact on health of climate-sensitive conditions, such as malnutrition, and the incidence of infectious diseases, such as malaria, varies according to gender; notes with concern the high female mortality rate in disaster situations; takes the view that more gender- specific research into the impact of climate change on women's health would help to achieve a more targeted response; calls on all governments to make more efforts to ensure better prevention, treatment and access to medicine and drugs \u2013 especially for women, as they are a vulnerable group, particularly in their capacity as care providers \u2013, to commit to a series of actions aimed at addressing the health risks associated with climate change, and to provide a framework for gender-based health risk assessments and adaptation/ mitigation measures in relation to climate change; 24. Underlines that 70 % of the world\u2019s poorest are women, who carry out two-thirds of all work done but own less than 1 % of all goods; notes that they are denied equal access to and control over resources, technology, services, land rights, credit and insurance systems and decision-making powers and are thus disproportionately vulnerable to, and affected by, climate change and have fewer opportunities to adapt; underlines that 85 % of people who die as a result of climate-induced natural disasters are women, that 75 % of environmental refugees are women, and that women are also more likely to be the unseen victims of resource wars and violence resulting from climate change; 25. Calls on the EU and its Member States to develop a principle of \u2018climate justice\u2019; insists that the greatest injustice of our failure to tackle climate change effectively would be the detrimental effects on poor countries and populations, and on women in particular; EN C 258 E/96 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",

Calls on the Commission and the upcoming Presidencies of the Council of the European Union to launch a study focusing specifically on the gender dimension of mitigation policies; 27. Emphasises that targeted policies are needed to avoid gender-segregation and discrimination in the green economy, where new technology and science jobs are already almost exclusively male-dominated; stresses, in this connection, the importance of entrepreneurship in terms of opening up the green economy to both women and men; 28. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to encourage women to pursue technical and scientific training and careers in the environmental and energy technology sectors, since the need for expertise in this area will guarantee women secure jobs with a stable future and ensure greater awareness of women\u2019s needs when it comes to defining climate change policies; 29. Calls on the Commission to support a reform of existing mechanisms and funds to make them more transparent, inclusive and reflective of the contributions to emissions reductions by local communities and particularly women and to promote these principles in future climate-related treaties, mechanisms and bilateral cooperation efforts, with a view to developing better ways to ensure the economic empowerment of women; 30. Recognises that population growth has a climate impact, and highlights the need to respond adequately where the contraceptive needs of women and men in any society remain unmet; 31. Recalls that avoiding dangerous climate change and limiting the increase in average temperatures to 2\u00b0 C, or 1,5\u00b0 C if possible, compared with pre-industrial levels, is necessary and absolutely critical in order to avoid dramatic negative consequences for women and other vulnerable groups; 32. Calls on the Commission to set up a toolkit to encourage inclusive decision-making, as was done in the transport and energy sectors in Malm\u00f6 (Sweden) and in the Vollsmose area (Denmark) ( 1 ); 33. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop indicators to evaluate the gender impact of projects and programmes and to promote gender budgeting in climate-related policies, whether these policies are conducted at international, national, regional or local levels; 34. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop tools and guidance for the gender analysis of mitigation policies and programmes, and related research programmes and activities; 35. Stresses the important role played by women in implementing mitigation measures in daily life, e.g. through energy- and water-saving practices, recycling measures and the use of eco-friendly and organic products, as they are still seen as the primary managers of these resources in the home; calls on the Commission to launch awareness-raising campaigns at the grassroots level, focusing on everyday consumption choices related to household and childcare activities; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/97 ( 1 ) Gender mainstreaming in the public transportation policy in Malm\u00f6: http://www.nikk.no/ A+gender+equal+and+sustainable+public+transport+system.b7C_wljSYQ.ips; and the project to train ethnic minority women to be environmental ambassadors in Vollsmose: http://www.nikk.no/Women+are+everyday+climate+experts. b7C_wljQ1e.ips.

Underlines, in this connection, the importance of strengthening the active participation of women in innovation for sustainable development as a means of tackling the serious challenges posed by climate change; 38. Points out that climate change will inevitably lead to migration from regions affected by calamities such as droughts or floods, and that the EU must keep in mind the need to protect women in any camps set up for internally displaced persons and refugees; 39. Notes that the impact of environmental change on migration and displacement will increase in the future and that, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 80 % of the world\u2019s refugees are women and children; reiterates the importance of identifying gender-sensitive strategies for responding to the environmental and humanitarian crises caused by climate change; takes the view, therefore, that urgent research is required on how to manage environmental migration in a gender-sensitive manner \u2013 this includes recognising and responding to gender roles and responsibilities in the area of natural resources and may include ensuring that scarce resources are available to communities in need and that water is provided for refugees; Financing 40. Calls on the EU delegations to respect the principle set out in its aforementioned resolution on the climate change conference in Durban (COP 17), to ensure that gender balance in all climate finance decision-making bodies is guaranteed, including the Green Climate Fund Board and possible sub-boards for individual funding windows; 41. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop climate change mitigation and adap\u00ad tation programmes and strategies that use gender analysis to improve the welfare of women and girls and take into account gender inequalities in access to credit, information, technology, land, natural resources, sustainable energy and reproductive health information and services; calls for such programmes and strategies to include innovative financing solutions such as micro-credit schemes, in particular in emergency cases such as those of climate refugees; 42. Stresses the need for financing mechanisms to reflect women's priorities and needs, and for the active involvement of organisations that promote gender equality in the development of funding criteria and the allocation of resources for climate change initiatives, particularly at local level and in the activities of the Green Climate Fund; 43. Calls for the integration of gender equality as a cross-cutting issue in all climate funds and instru\u00ad ments; stresses that this integration requires gender expertise and should extend to the mission, governance and operational modalities of such financing mechanisms, and that operational modalities and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms should ensure that women and local communities benefit from adequate funding; 44. Calls on the Commission and the EU delegations to support scaled-up, new and additional funding particularly for adaptation actions which directly benefit women, who are often disproportionally vulnerable to climate change impacts; calls for the provision of such adaptation funding to be exclusively in the form of grants; EN C 258 E/98 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",

Deplores the fact that the EU failed to meet its 2010 biodiversity target; 2. Welcomes and supports the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, including all its targets and actions; takes the view, nevertheless, that some actions may have to be strengthened and specified more clearly, and that more concrete measures should be deployed in order to ensure effective implementation of the strategy; 3. Stresses the urgent need for action, and the need to give higher political priority to biodiversity in order to meet the EU\u2019s 2020 headline target for biodiversity and global biodiversity commitments; emphasises that, with adequate financial resources and political will, the tools exist to halt the loss of biodiversity; emphasises that the preservation of biodiversity is a collective challenge that should be addressed with the commitment and participation of numerous interested parties: 4. Welcomes the Commission communication on Biodiversity 2020, and Notes that climate change, biodiversity loss, threats from invasive species and overconsumption of natural resources are transnational and transregional challenges which affect every EU citizen, whether living in an urban or a rural area, and that urgent action is needed at every level of government \u2013 local, regional and national \u2013 in order to mitigate these effects; 5. Invites the Member States, therefore, to integrate the strategy into their plans, programmes and/or national strategies; 6. Takes the view that the biodiversity safeguards contained in existing EU law must not be weakened; 7. Stresses that the new strategy must not fail as well; calls on the Commission, therefore, to provide Parliament with two-yearly progress reports in which the Council and Commission elaborate on the state of play; 8. Emphasises that the real test of the EU\u2019s commitment to achieving the biodiversity target \u2013 and the real key to this issue \u2013 is not the new strategy, but rather the forthcoming reforms of the common agricultural and fisheries policies and the Multiannual Financial Framework; points out, further, that the inadequate degree to which biodiversity protection was integrated into other EU policies caused the failure of the first strategy; 9. Takes the view that the difficulties encountered in meeting the target set for 2010 call for an in-depth review of the methods applied to date; maintains that strategic studies covering all the factors that may affect protected areas must be carried out, and that these studies should be incorporated into urban planning and be accompanied by educational and information campaigns on the importance of local natural resources and their conservation; 10. Stresses that biodiversity loss refers not only to species and habitats but also to genetic diversity; calls on the Commission to develop a strategy for the conservation of genetic diversity; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/101 Friday 20 April 2012 ",

Notes that our natural heritage is a major ecological asset which is fundamental to human well-being; takes the view that all Member States should cooperate and coordinate their efforts in order to ensure more effective use of natural resources and avoid net losses in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services in both rural and urbanised areas; Targets \u2013 mainstreaming biodiversity in all EU policies 12. Highlights the importance of mainstreaming biodiversity protection and conservation in the devel\u00ad opment, implementation and funding of all other EU policies \u2013 including those on agriculture, forestry, fisheries, regional development and cohesion, energy, industry, transport, tourism, development cooperation, research and innovation \u2013 in order to make the EU\u2019s sectoral and budgetary policies more coherent and ensure that it honours its binding commitments on biodiversity protection; 13. Underlines that the EU Biodiversity Strategy should be fully integrated into the strategies for the mitigation of, and adaption to, climate change; 14. Recalls that the precautionary principle constitutes a legal basis to be applied in all legislation and decisions affecting biodiversity; 15. Stresses that protecting, valuing, mapping and restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services is essential in order to meet the goals of the Roadmap to a Resource-Efficient Europe, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to consider, as part of specific measures, presenting a timetable for mapping and assessing ecosystem services in the EU which will enable targeted and efficient measures to be taken to halt the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystem services; 16. Emphasises that the loss of biodiversity has devastating economic costs for society which until now have not been integrated sufficiently into economic and other policies; urges the Commission and the Member States, therefore, to value ecosystem services and to integrate these values into accounting systems as a basis for more sustainable policies; takes the view that any economic model that disregards the proper preservation of biodiversity is not viable; also stresses that actions to restore ecosystems and biodiversity have significant potential to create new skills, jobs and business opportunities; 17. Stresses the need to carry out a thorough assessment of the negative impact on biodiversity of different sectors of the economy; 18. Emphasises that the biodiversity strategy is part of the Resource-Efficient Europe flagship initiative, and recalls that regional policy plays an essential role in ensuring sustainable growth through the actions it supports to tackle climate, energy and environmental issues; 19. Maintains that a significant number of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic (transmissible among wildlife, domestic animals and humans), and recognises that trade in wildlife and changes in land use and management may lead to new or modified interfaces among humans, domestic animals and wildlife that could favour disease transmission and loss of biodiversity; stresses that integrating biodiversity strategies into animal health, animal welfare and trade policies is paramount; 20.

        "Conserving and restoring nature 21. Emphasises the need to halt the deterioration in the status of all species and habitats covered by EU nature conservation legislation and achieve a significant and measurable improvement in their status at EU level; stresses that this should take the form of an improvement in at least one of the parameters for conservation status defined in Article 1 of the Habitats Directive, without any deterioration in the other parameters; 22. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to undertake to adopt integrated strategies in order to identify each geographical area\u2019s natural values and the features of its cultural heritage, as well as the conditions necessary for maintaining them; 23. Emphasises that biodiversity objectives need to be implemented through concrete action in order to be effective; regrets that, in spite of the action taken to combat biodiversity loss, in the EU only 17 % of habitats and species and 11 % of key ecosystems protected under EU legislation are in a favourable state; calls on the Commission to analyse, as a matter of urgency, why current efforts have not yet succeeded and to consider whether other, potentially more effective instruments are available; 24. Stresses that, in order to establish a clear pathway to achieving the 2050 vision, at least 40 % of all habitats and species must have a favourable conservation status by 2020; recalls that, by 2050, 100 % (or almost 100 %) of habitats and species must have a favourable conservation status; 25. Expresses concern at the increasing deterioration of essential habitats, such as wetlands, which should be treated as a priority and addressed by means of urgent measures that actually correspond to the special protection status granted to them by the EU; 26. Recognises that infrastructure-building, urbanisation, industrialisation and physical intervention in the landscape in general are among the most significant drivers of the fragmentation of ecosystems and habitats; calls on local, regional and national governments, in the context of their planning regulations and imple\u00ad mentation measures and within the framework of their competences, to consider these factors \u2013 which pose a threat to ecosystems and habitats \u2013 in their planning and development projects on both a large and a small scale; recognises the pressures and need at local and regional level to provide substantial economic development, and recommends that local and regional authorities be mindful of striking a balance between development and the need to protect biodiversity and natural habitats; supports further reform and use of regional and local development policies in order to deliver biodiversity benefits and halt further loss of habitats, especially in times of economic and financial crisis; 27. Supports stepping up the use of environmental impact assessments (EIAs), sustainability impact assessments (SIAs), strategic environmental assessments (SEAs) and other instruments in order to take account of biodiversity loss and the effects of climate change in regional and local decision-making; points out that all regions will benefit from projects that promote climate change mitigation and the protection of biodiversity loss, including less developed regions; 28. Urges the Member States to ensure that the process of designating Natura 2000 sites is finalised by 2012 in line with Aichi Target 11; deplores greatly the delay in designating marine sites; is concerned about the reintroduction of hunting in the Danube Delta and its possible negative impact on biodiversity; calls on the Commission to verify that Member States are implementing Article 7 of the Birds Directive (2009/147/EC ( 1 )), particularly with respect to hunting; 29. Highlights the urgent need to step up efforts to protect oceans and marine environments, both through EU action and by improving international governance of oceans and areas beyond national jurisdiction; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/103 ( 1 ) OJ L 20, 26.1.2010, p. 7.

Believes that better cross-border cooperation could have significant benefits when it comes to meeting the Natura 2000 objectives; highlights the need for closer cooperation between European, national, regional and local authorities with regard to protecting biodiversity and natural resources; under\u00ad lines, in this connection, the opportunities offered by cross-border, interregional and transnational cooperation with a view to tackling biodiversity loss, and believes that making better use of the potential of territorial cooperation and of exchanges of information, experience and good practice would contribute significantly to achieving that aim; points out that the inclusion of biodiversity-related priorities in regional macrostrategies is an important step towards restoring and preserving biodiversity; 32. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure proper conservation of the Natura 2000 network through adequate funding for those sites; calls, in particular, on the Member States to develop binding national instruments in cooperation with the different stakeholders, through which they define priority conservation measures and state the relevant planned source of financing (whether from EU funds or Member States\u2019 own budgets); 33. Takes the view that the enforcement of EU legislation, in particular on the environment, must be improved; 34. Invites the Commission, in view of the vast differences between Member States with regard to the implementation of the Natura 2000 legislation, to provide further clarification or guidance where necessary, based on best practices; also asks the Commission to provide guidance or share best practices for the management of areas adjoining Natura 2000 sites; 35. Calls on the Commission to increase its capacity to process and investigate effectively complaints and infringements connected with the proper implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives, and to develop adequate guidance for the Member States with regard to monitoring on-the-ground implementation of those directives; calls on the Commission, furthermore, to incorporate measures to enhance the imple\u00ad mentation and joint enforcement of the Birds and Habitats Directives into its current work on improving the implementation and inspection of environmental legislation; considers it essential, in the light of its resolution of 20 November 2008 on the review of Recommendation 2001/331/EC providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States ( 2 ), to strengthen the EU Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law (IMPEL), and urges the Commission to report on possible ways of doing so, including the feasibility of establishing an EU environmental inspection force, and to present a proposal for a directive on environmental inspections; 36. Supports the Commission initiative regarding training programmes for judges and prosecutors; stresses, however, that the Commission and the Member States should ensure that such training programmes are also available to professionals dealing with Natura 2000 sites, e.g. regional and local authorities responsible for law enforcement and other administrative bodies responsible for implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives; 37.

Notes the limited public awareness in the EU of the importance of biodiversity conservation and the severe environmental and socio-economic costs associated with its loss; stresses the need for a more comprehensive communication strategy in line with Aichi Target 1; 39. Welcomes the intention of the Commission and the Member States to launch a major communi\u00ad cation campaign for Natura 2000 by 2013, to improve the application of EU environmental protection provisions and to foster the coexistence of environmental protection, sustainable economic growth and social development as equal, non-contradictory principles; calls, to this end, for the promotion of successful projects and the dissemination of information to the public on the feasibility of environmentally benign economic development in important natural and cultural heritage areas such as those belonging to the Natura 2000 network; 40. Stresses the need to organise biodiversity awareness and information campaigns for all ages and social categories, on the understanding that awareness campaigns for children and adolescents who are deeply concerned about this topic should be organised first and foremost in the school setting; takes the view that education and professional training, particularly in farming, forestry and related sectors, should concentrate more on the role of biodiversity; 41. Recognises that NGOs have an important role to play in biodiversity protection by contributing to the decision-making process, taking action on the ground and raising public awareness; 42. Recommends extending governance to the mobilisation of citizens, and also to non-profit organi\u00ad sations and economic actors, with the emphasis, in the case of the latter, being on integrating biodiversity into company strategies; recognises the value and knowledge of, and the work done by, the voluntary and community sector in protecting biodiversity, and asks regional and local governments to involve such groups in planning and consultation for projects, by establishing partnerships between authorities, the private sector and non-governmental organisations; 43. Recognises the great importance of maintaining a close relationship with local actors and the direct managers of the land in question, and therefore encourages the Commission to make greater efforts in this regard, paying attention to the experience and special knowledge that these actors can contribute when drafting legislation, with a view to ensuring the good condition of the habitats that are home to the biodiversity we wish to preserve in the EU; 44. Maintains that one reason we have failed to reverse the continuing trend of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation globally is our incomplete understanding of the complexity of biodiversity and the interactions of its components with one another and with the living environment, including the value of biodiversity for current and future human generations; reiterates that biodiversity science is the necessary backbone for any kind of policy implementation; 45. Stresses, therefore, the need to invest more in research on biodiversity, including in relation to one or more of the relevant \u2018societal challenges\u2019 addressed by Horizon 2020, so as to avoid fragmentation of research policy; takes the view that such an increase in funds for biodiversity research could be achieved within the overall existing means, given the low take-up; believes, on the one hand, that research could give us a better understanding of biodiversity and its importance for all aspects of human activities, and, on the other, that it will contribute, through innovative concepts, to new and improved policies and management and development strategies; 46. Stresses the need for a multidisciplinary and transboundary research approach when it comes to biodiversity, which is inherently connected to fields such as ecology, genetics, epidemiology, climate science, economics, social anthropology and theoretical modelling; emphasises the need for science-based policies in the sustainable management of ecosystems and natural resources, especially in the economically and socially vital sectors of agriculture, fisheries and forestry; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/105 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "47. Considers it essential that available scientific data on biodiversity, examples of best practices for halting biodiversity loss and restoring biodiversity, and information on nature-based innovation and devel\u00ad opment potential be more widely known and shared among policy-makers and key stakeholders, and that the relevant ICTs play a crucial role in delivering new opportunities and tools; welcomes, therefore, the fact that the Commission has set up the EU Business and Biodiversity Platform, and encourages it to develop the Platform further and promote greater cooperation between administrations and businesses in the EU, including SMEs; 48. Calls for the Biodiversity Information System for Europe (BISE) web portal to be made available in all the official EU languages, so as to contribute to data and information sharing; Maintain and restore ecosystems and their services 49. Notes the requirement under the CBD to restore 15 % of degraded ecosystems by 2020; regards this as a minimum, however, and wishes the EU to set a considerably higher restoration target reflecting its own more ambitious headline target and its 2050 vision, taking into account country-specific natural conditions; urges the Commission to define clearly what is meant by \u2018degraded ecosystems\u2019 and to set a baseline against which progress can be measured; 50. Urges the Commission to adopt a specific Green Infrastructure Strategy by 2012 at the latest, with biodiversity protection as a primary objective; underlines that this strategy should address objectives relating to urban as well as rural areas, inter alia in order better to fulfil the provisions of Article 10 of the Habitats Directive; 51. Deplores the fact that the development of the Commission\u2019s Green Infrastructure Strategy is planned only for 2012, while energy and transport corridors have already been identified in the European Infra\u00ad structure Package proposal; calls on the Commission, therefore, to accelerate work on the Green Infra\u00ad structure Strategy and to ensure that the proposed Target No 2 is achieved; agrees that synergies between energy, transport and ICT projects should be maximised in order to limit the negative impact on biodi\u00ad versity, and that only actions which comply with EU law and are in line with the relevant Union policies should receive EU funding; 52. Emphasises that the creation of natural environments should not be limited to designated areas alone, but should also be encouraged in different places \u2013 for instance in cities, along highways and railroads and at industrial sites \u2013 in order to develop a truly green infrastructure; 53. Urges the Commission to develop an effective regulatory framework based on the \u2018No Net Loss\u2019 initiative, taking into account the past experience of the Member States while also utilising the standards applied by the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme; notes, in this connection, the importance of applying such an approach to all EU habitats and species not covered by EU legislation; 54. Calls on the Commission to devote particular attention to species and habitats whose \u2018functions\u2019 are of priceless economic value, since efforts to preserve biodiversity in the future will be directed at those areas that will produce economic benefits over a short period of time, or be expected to do so; 55. Recognises that biodiversity and ecosystem services provide significant non-monetised benefits to industries and other economic actors; invites organisations representing the private sector to put forward proposals on how best to preserve and restore biodiversity on a meaningful scale; EN C 258 E/106 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "56. Recognises the need to promote green infrastructure, eco-innovation and the adoption of innovative technologies in order to create a greener economy, and calls on the Commission to draw up good practice guides in this area; urges the Commission, the Member States and local and regional authorities to take account of the recommendations made in the TEEB study, which is intended as a useful advisory tool for local and regional policy-makers, administrators and managers; underlines the need to expand and intensify training for beneficiaries of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, and for local, regional and national govern\u00ad ments, in dealing with the complex European and national legislation aimed at protecting nature and increasing awareness of the importance of biodiversity loss; invites the Commission to put in place technical assistance mechanisms designed to promote knowledge at regional and local level with regard to implementation-related problems; Agriculture 57. Recalls that over half of the EU\u2019s territory is managed by farmers, that farmland delivers important ecosystem services and has considerable socio-economic value, and that funding for the CAP represents a significant part of the EU budget; stresses that the CAP is not confined to the aim of food provision and rural development, but is a crucial tool for biodiversity, conservation, mitigation of climate change, and maintenance of ecosystem services; notes that the CAP already includes measures aimed at environmental protection, such as decoupling, cross-compliance and agri-environment measures; considers it regrettable, however, that these measures have so far failed to halt the overall decline in biodiversity in the EU and that farmland biodiversity is in continued decline; calls, therefore, for a reorientation of the CAP towards the provision of compensation to farmers for the delivery of public goods, since the market is currently failing to integrate the economic value of the important public goods agriculture can deliver; 58. Emphasises the connection between water management and biodiversity as an essential component for sustaining life and for sustainable development; 59. Stresses the need to move from a means-based approach to a results-based approach in order to assess the effectiveness of the instruments applied; 60. Calls for the greening of Pillar I of the CAP in order to ensure the conservation of biodiversity in the wider farmed landscape, improve connectivity and adapt to the effects of climate change; welcomes the Commission\u2019s CAP reform proposal, which provides for a \u2018greening\u2019 of the CAP through the allocation of Pillar I payments to a package of basic good practices applied at farm level, including crop rotation and diversification, permanent pasture and a minimum \u2018ecological focus area\u2019; underlines that such greening measures need to be workable and must not create unnecessary bureaucracy; reiterates its call for area-based support for the Natura 2000 network under the direct payment scheme; believes that resource-efficient, environment- and climate-friendly agricultural practices will ensure both the sustainability of agricultural businesses and long-term food security, and recognises that the CAP should play a significant role in achieving this; 61. Calls for \u2018greening\u2019 practices to be geared to agricultural diversity in the various Member States, taking into account, for example, the specific situation of Mediterranean countries, which is not addressed by the proposed thresholds in relation to the diversification of crops and land of ecological importance; notes that assembled crops, permanent crops (olive groves, vineyards, apple orchards) and rice crops are some examples of practices that should be compatible with \u2018greening\u2019, given the high ecological and conservation value of some of these agricultural systems; 62. Maintains that assistance to public and private actors working to protect forest biodiversity in terms of species, habitats and ecosystem services must be increased under the new CAP, and eligibility extended to areas connecting Natura 2000 sites; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/107 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "63. Calls for all CAP payments, including those made from 2014, to be underpinned by robust cross- compliance rules which help to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services, covering the Birds and Habitats Directives (without watering down the current standards applicable from 2007 to 2013), pesticides and biocides legislation and the Water Framework Directive ( 1 ); calls for simple and transparent rules for those affected; 64. Calls for a strengthening of Pillar II and for drastic improvements in all Member States to the environmental focus of that pillar and to the effectiveness of its agri-environmental measures, including through minimum mandatory spending on environmental measures \u2013 such as agri-environmental measures, Natura 2000 and forest environment measures \u2013 and support for High Nature Value and organic farming; underlines that the environmental measures under the two pillars should be mutually reinforcing; 65. Acknowledges the critical report of the European Court of Auditors on agri-environment schemes; notes that very limited environmental objectives have been met with the EUR 22,2 billion available for 2007-2013; urges the Commission to ensure that future agri-environmental subsidies are approved only under strict environmental criteria; 66. Draws attention to the fact that the increase in demand for agricultural fuels and the consequent intensification of pressure for their production in developing countries are threatening biodiversity, particularly in developing countries, owing to the degradation and conversion of habitats and ecosystems such as wetlands and forests, among others; 67. Takes the view that the inspection of agricultural practices should be strengthened in order to prevent biodiversity loss; maintains, in particular, that discharges of slurry should be controlled and even prohibited in the most sensitive areas in order to preserve ecosystems; 68. Encourages the Commission and the Member States to explore the phenomenon of land aban\u00ad donment in some parts of Europe, supporting the targeted maintenance of biodiversity and avoiding desertification whilst providing new socio-economic opportunities for rural development; stresses, however, the need to respect existing land ownership; also underlines that European farmers play an important role as \u2018guardians\u2019 of the landscape; 69. Warns that various species and habitats which are highly valued from a conservation perspective, including those protected by EU legislation, are dependent on agri-environmental systems in which the presence of human beings is a key factor; highlights, in this connection, the importance of halting and reversing land abandonment; advocates increased support for small and medium-scale farming, family-based farming and extensive farming, which promote proper conservation of natural resources; 70. Calls on the Commission, in the context of the new CAP reform, to step up its efforts in support of agricultural sectors which make a proven contribution to preserving biodiversity, and in particular the bee- keeping sector; points out that wild and domesticated insects such as bees account for 80 % of the pollination of flowering plants, and that the decline with which they are threatened represents an enormous challenge for our societies, whose agricultural production, and therefore food, depends in large part on the pollination of flowering plants; stresses, therefore, that particular attention should be paid to apiculture in the measures to be taken to protect biodiversity; 71. Emphasises the importance of halting and reversing the reduction in species diversity and crop varieties, which leads to an erosion of the genetic basis on which human and animal nutrition depends; advocates the need to promote the use of traditional agricultural varieties specific to certain regions; calls for appropriate legislation and incentives for the maintenance and further development of diversity in farm genetic resources, e.g. locally adapted breeds and varieties; EN C 258 E/108 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 ( 1 ) Directive 2000/60/EC, (OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 1).

        "72. Stresses the need for more effective cooperation at European level in the field of scientific and applied research regarding the diversity of animal and plant genetic resources in order to ensure their conservation, improve their ability to adapt to climate change, and promote their effective take-up in genetic improvement programmes; Forestry 73. Calls for specific action with a view to achieving Aichi Target 5, whereby the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, should be at least halved by 2020 and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation significantly reduced; 74. Calls on the Commission, once the study on the impact of European consumption on deforestation has been completed, to follow up its findings with new policy initiatives addressing the types of impact identified; 75. Calls on the Member States to adopt and implement forest management plans taking account of appropriate public consultation, including effective measures for the conservation and recovery of protected species and habitats and related ecosystem services; 76. Urges the Member States and the Commission to encourage the adoption of forest management plans, inter alia through rural development measures and the LIFE+ programme; stresses the need for forest management plans to include special biodiversity measures, notably specific measures for the conservation of protected species and natural habitats in order to improve their status, both within and beyond Natura 2000 areas; 77. Urges the Member States to design their forestry policies in such a way as to take full account of the importance of forests in protecting biodiversity, in preventing soil erosion, in carbon sequestration and air purification and in maintaining the water cycle; 78. Urges the Member States to ensure that forest fire prevention schemes in their forest management plans include ecosystem-based measures designed to make forests more resilient to fires; Fisheries 79. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s proposals for the reform of the CFP, which should guarantee the implementation of the ecosystem approach and the application of updated scientific information serving as the basis for long-term management plans for all commercially exploited fish species; emphasises that only by securing the long-term sustainability of fish stocks can we ensure the economic and social viability of the European fisheries sector; 80. Stresses that no one country can deal with the problem of biodiversity loss, particularly in marine ecosystems, and that the Member State governments must cooperate and coordinate their efforts more effectively in order to address this global issue; emphasises that strong implementation of biodiversity policy benefits both society and the economy; 81. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to implement marine protected areas in which economic activities, including fishing, are subject to strengthened ecosystem-based management, making it possible to reconcile preservation of the environment with the practice of sustainable fishing; 82. Stresses that there are still large gaps in knowledge regarding the state of marine ecosystems and fisheries resources, and calls for increased EU efforts in the area of marine research; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/109 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "83. Requests the Commission and the Member States to consolidate their efforts in collecting scientific data on fish populations, where these are deficient, with the aim of offering more reliable scientific advice; 84. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to cooperate with a view to establishing a \u2018European coastguard\u2019 in order to boost common monitoring and inspection capacity and ensure enforcement; 85. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to step up their efforts to ensure that catches fall below Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) levels by 2015, and to take ecological considerations into account when defining MSYs; stresses, therefore, that a lack of adequate scientific data should not be used as an excuse for inaction, and that in such circumstances fishing mortality rates should be decreased on a precautionary basis; recalls the legal obligation \u2013 as set out in the Marine Framework Strategy Directive (MFSD) ( 1 ) \u2013 to ensure that all commercially exploited fish stocks are within safe biological limits by 2020; 86. Points out that the commitment to maintain or restore fish stocks, by 2015, to levels above those able to produce the MSY, as provided for in the CFP reform package proposed by the Commission, was endorsed by heads of state and government at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Devel\u00ad opment in 2002; 87. Underlines that fisheries management should contribute to achieving favourable conservation status pursuant to the Birds and Habitats Directives and achieving the objective of Good Environmental Status (GES) under the MFSD; stresses that long-term management plans should be based on multiple species rather than single species, taking account of all aspects of fish populations \u2013 in particular size, age and reproductive status \u2013 in order better to reflect an ecosystem-based approach, and that strict timelines for their development should be set; 88. Stresses that the new CFP and all subsequent measures adopted by Member States must be in full compliance with Directives 92/43/EEC, 2009/147/EC and 2008/56/EC; 89. Stresses that the aim of eliminating discards of less valuable target species and by-catches of protected non-target species, including cetaceans, sea turtles and sea birds, should be incorporated into the CFP and implemented as a matter of urgency; stresses, moreover, that the new CFP should include a clear obligation to release non-target species with a high chance of survival; 90. Points out that measures aimed at eliminating discards of juvenile and under-sized fish or catches beyond quota should be designed in such a way as to avoid providing any perverse incentives for the landing and commercialisation of discards; 91. Underlines that targets and timelines should be set for the reduction of overcapacity so that a net reduction in fleet capacity can be pursued; 92. Notes that the biodiversity of the marine environment is being seriously jeopardised by illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU fishing) and stresses that cooperation between the Member States and third countries should be strengthened in order to combat such IUU fishing; 93. Notes that the establishment of fisheries reserves (areas in which fishing activities may be banned or restricted) is a particularly effective and cost-efficient measure with a view to achieving the long-term conservation of fish stocks; calls on the Member States and the Council, in this connection, to designate fisheries reserves and stipulate the management rules to be established therein, with a particular focus on nursery grounds or spawning grounds for fish stocks; 94. Calls on the Commission to develop reliable indicators of environmental sustainability, including marine and coastal sustainability, in order to assess the degree of progress towards the overall goal of protecting biodiversity; EN C 258 E/110 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 ( 1 ) Directive 2008/56/EC, (OJ L 164, 25.6.2008, p. 19).

        "Invasive alien species 95. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that measures are taken to prevent both the entry of new invasive alien species into the EU and the spread of currently established invasive alien species to new areas; calls, in particular, for clear guidelines under the CAP Rural Development Regulation in order to ensure that afforestation does not harm biodiversity and to prevent the provision of financial support for the planting of invasive alien species; underlines the need for ambitious strategies and up-to-date inventories both at the EU level and in the Member States; takes the view that these strategies should not focus solely on those species considered to be a \u2018priority\u2019, as suggested in Target 5 of the Biodiversity Strategy; encourages the Commission, with a view to enhancing the knowledge base, to support similar activities to those supported under the DAISIE (Delivering Alien Invasive Species Inventories for Europe) project; 96. Urges the Commission to come forward in 2012 with a legislative proposal which takes a holistic approach to the problem of invasive alien plant and animal species in order to establish a common EU policy on the prevention, monitoring, eradication and management of these species and on rapid alert systems in this area; 97. Recognises that prevention is more cost-effective and environmentally desirable than measures taken once an invasive alien species has already been introduced and become established; calls, therefore, on the Commission and the Member States to give priority to preventing the introduction of invasive alien species, as supported by the hierarchical approach to such species adopted in the CBD; 98. Underlines the need to ensure that trade in threatened species \u2013 included in the Red List drawn up by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \u2013 is subject to increased restrictions and, in particular, strict regulation; calls, furthermore, on the Commission and the Member States to monitor and report regularly on imports of exotic and non-native species and to ensure full implementation of the Zoos Directive ( 1 ); requests the Commission to assess and make proposals for a ban on wild-caught animals for the pet trade; 99. Calls on the Commission to take note of existing national strategies and action plans and ensure that island habitats receive proportionate consideration in the upcoming Invasive Alien Species Regulation; Climate change 100. Recalls the inter-linkages between biodiversity and the climate system; is mindful of the significant negative impact of climate change on biodiversity, and underlines the fact that biodiversity loss inherently exacerbates climate change on account of the degradation of the carbon sink provided by the natural environment; emphasises the urgency of biodiversity protection, inter alia as a means of mitigating climate change and preserving natural carbon sinks; International dimension 101. Urges the Commission to propose legislation to implement the Nagoya Protocol so that the Union can ratify the Protocol as soon as possible; 102. Underlines that, given the global nature of biodiversity and ecosystem services and their crucial role in meeting global sustainable development objectives, the EU strategy must also step up EU efforts to avert biodiversity loss and thereby contribute more effectively to achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/111 ( 1 ) Directive 1999/22/EC, (OJ L 94, 9.4.1999, p. 24).

Welcomes the UN General Assembly resolution of 6 December 2011 aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the world\u2019s fisheries ( 1 ), which stresses that urgent efforts are needed to achieve sustainable use of the world\u2019s oceans and seas; 105. Welcomes the plan \u2013 presented in November 2011 \u2013 developed by four UN agencies (UNESCO, FAO, UNDP and IMO) to encourage countries to renew their commitment to limiting the degradation of the oceans and dealing with threats such as overexploitation of fisheries, pollution and biodiversity decline; 106. Encourages the Commission and the Member States to continue promoting a common approach to nature conservation throughout the EU, welcomes the Commission\u2019s acceptance that it needs to cooperate with the Member States to ensure the effective protection of biodiversity in the EU\u2019s outermost regions and overseas countries and territories, which host more endemic species than the entire European continent; wishes to see the strengthening of the specific instruments for safeguarding and protecting biodiversity there, particularly the BEST (Voluntary scheme for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Territories of the EU Outermost Regions and Overseas Countries and Territories) preparatory action supported by Parliament since 2011 and providing proper financing for the protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the EU\u2019s outermost regions and overseas countries and territories; 107. Calls on the Commission and the Member States strictly to implement and enforce multilateral environmental agreements, including (but not limited to) the CITES Convention and the CMS; 108. Calls on the Commission and the Member States effectively to mainstream environmental sustain\u00ad ability in their relations with third countries and as part of global processes such as the Millennium Development Goals; 109. Urges the Commission to enhance the contribution of EU trade policy to conserving biodiversity, and therefore supports its proposal to include a chapter on sustainable development in all new trade agreements which lays down substantial environmental provisions relevant to the trade context, including biodiversity goals; 110. Recognises the increase in illegal international trafficking of species covered by the CITES Convention; calls, therefore, on the Commission and the Member States to work to increase the capacity of Interpol in this respect and to prioritise the issue of illegal wildlife trade in bilateral discussions with third countries; 111. Recognises that the EU is a top importer of wildlife and that it influences biodiversity conservation in other parts of the world through its policies and commercial activities; calls on the EU to take measures to reduce the negative impact of EU consumption patterns on biodiversity by incorporating initiatives relating to sustainable agriculture and wildlife trade in all trade agreements; 112. Calls on the Rio+20 Earth Summit to make concrete progress on innovative and independent sources of finance for biodiversity protection in developing countries, and insists that the EU and its Member States be proactive in achieving results in this regard; 113.

Acknowledges that it is necessary to achieve an economy based on sustainable energy sources in a cost-effective way without compromising biodiversity objectives, and that such an economy could contribute towards achieving these objectives; deems it necessary, in this context, to introduce further safeguards regarding the sources, efficiency and quantity of biomass used for energy; calls on the Commission, also in this context, to clarify as soon as possible what effect biofuels have on biodiversity, including the impact of indirect land use, and calls for the establishment of effective sustainability criteria for the production and use of all biofuels, including solid biomass; Financing 115. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to identify all existing environmentally harmful subsidies, according to objective criteria, and calls on the Commission to publish, by the end of 2012, an action plan (including a timetable) on how to phase such subsidies out by 2020 in line with the Nagoya commitments; 116. Emphasises the importance of mobilising both EU and national financial support from all possible sources, including the creation of a specific instrument to finance biodiversity, and of developing innovative financial mechanisms \u2013 in particular habitat banking in conjunction with offsetting \u2013 in order to reach the targets set in the area of biodiversity; 117. Stresses the need to increase the budget for research focusing on the environment and biodiversity under the next Research Framework Programme, in a manner proportionate to the huge needs and challenges associated with tackling both biodiversity loss and climate change, in order to help close identified knowledge gaps and support policy; 118. Calls on the Commission to review whether the current regulatory regime adequately incentivises strategies to enhance biodiversity, and to propose cost-effective solutions to shift spending on biodiversity from bureaucracy towards protection and enhancement; 119. Agrees that well-designed, market-based instruments aimed at internalising the external costs of consumption and production activities to the environment can contribute to achieving the objective of halting biodiversity loss if combined with incentives for green investment within the sectors concerned; 120. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s launch of the Business and Biodiversity Platform with a view to engaging the private sector in the biodiversity agenda; 121. Urges the Commission to report to Parliament and the Council on options for the introduction of payments for ecosystem services, taking into account the role of biodiversity conservation; 122. Calls on the Commission and the Member States fully to implement and fund the new Strategy for Biodiversity to 2020 by ensuring that every EU funding measure is consistent with biodiversity and water protection laws; 123. Stresses the imperative need to ensure that the next Multiannual Financial Framework (2014-2020) supports efforts to achieve the six targets set out in the Biodiversity Strategy, and that funding for the LIFE programme is stepped up; emphasises the need to focus on corporate social responsibility projects which promote biodiversity; 124. Notes, furthermore, that the enormous economic value of biodiversity offers a worthwhile return on the investment in its conservation; calls, therefore, for an increase in funding for nature conservation measures; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/113 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "125. Calls on the Commission and the Member States, with a view to ensuring adequate financing of the Natura 2000 network, to ensure that at least EUR 5,8 billion per year is provided through EU and Member State funding; calls, furthermore, on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that adequate funding is made available through various EU funds (for example the CAP funds, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the cohesion funds and a strengthened LIFE+ fund), with better coordination and coherence between these funds, inter alia through the concept of integrated projects, thereby improving transparency for the different regions in receipt of EU funding; calls for the EIB to be involved in developing innovative financial instruments and technical and advisory services for co-financing projects relating to biodiversity; 126. Expresses its disappointment with the proposed allocation for the new LIFE programme, which, despite its remarkable success over two decades, continues to receive an insignificant share of the EU budget; takes the view that the challenges addressed in the biodiversity and nature conservation plan call for a substantial increase in the funds allocated to the LIFE programme; 127. Notes with concern that the number of projects financed under the LIFE+ programme each year is below the indicative allocation in various Member States; invites the Commission to assess the reasons for this under-implementation and where necessary to propose changes to the rules governing the programme, particularly as regards co-financing levels; 128. Recognises the importance of green public procurement, and believes that more attention should be focused on its use, especially by public authorities in receipt of EU funding; recommends that the authorities responsible for the management and control systems created in the Member States to manage structural and cohesion funding should support projects which provide for such procedures; 129. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s proposal to invest in the protection and restoration of biodiversity under the Cohesion Fund in the 2014-2020 funding period; also recommends considering the potential of Natura 2000 for local economies and labour markets; 130. Recognises that the \u2018green economy\u2019 is a means of generating skills and employment, and calls for it to be supported with funding which will help build capacity at a local level and build on local and traditional knowledge in the fight to protect biodiversity; highlights the fact that approximately 30 % of the total allocations for cohesion policy for 2007-2013 are available for activities with a particular impact on sustainable growth; encourages the Member States, and especially local and regional authorities, in the context of halting biodiversity loss, to be more active and step up their efforts to invest in natural capital, and to use regional policy funding for natural risk prevention as an element in the preservation of natural resources and in adaptation to climate change, particularly with a view to the 2014-2020 programming period; 131.

        "B. whereas for a decade the 6th EAP has provided an overarching framework for environment policy, during which time environmental legislation has been consolidated and substantially completed, and whereas its adoption by codecision has increased its legitimacy and has helped create a sense of ownership; whereas, however, Member States and the Commission have not always acted in accordance with this programme, and whereas it had some shortcomings which have to be addressed; C. whereas progress towards the objectives set out in the 6th EAP has been variable, with some objectives having been achieved (climate change, waste) and others not having been achieved (air, urban environment, natural resources), while the attainment of others depends on future implementation efforts (chemicals, pesticides, water), and whereas a number of challenges remain and additional efforts are required; D. whereas the 6th EAP has been compromised by a lack of implementation of the environmental acquis in the areas of air pollution control, water and waste water treatment, waste and nature conservation; E whereas the goal of halting the decline of biodiversity by 2010 has not been reached due to a lack of political and financial commitments; F. whereas \u2018The European Environment \u2013 State and Outlook 2010\u2019 (SOER 2010) points out that major environmental challenges remain which will have significant consequences if left unaddressed; G. whereas certain aspects of environmental legislation should be reviewed, in particular by strengthening the independence of environmental impact assessments in the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive; H. whereas environmental degradation \u2013 air pollution, noise, chemicals, poor water quality and ecosystem degradation \u2013 is an important factor in the rise of chronic diseases; whereas an ambitious EU envi\u00ad ronmental protection agenda is therefore a key component for effective prevention of disease and ill- health; I. whereas major differences remain between Member States as regards environmental quality and public health; 1. Underlines the urgency of adopting as soon as possible a 7th EAP, in order to address the environ\u00ad mental challenges lying ahead; calls therefore on the Commission to present a proposal for a 7th EAP without delay; 2. Considers that the new 7th EAP needs to describe in an unambivalent manner the environmental challenges the EU is faced with, including accelerating climate change, deterioration of our ecosystem and increasing overuse of natural resources; 3. Emphasises, in light of the current sustainability challenges that face the EU, that the Environmental Action Programmes, as overarching instruments, contribute to ensuring the necessary coordination among the various Community policie; considers, specifically, that in the coming decade, it will be even more crucial to address environmental issues with a more coherent and integrated approach that takes into account the links between them and that fills the remaining gaps, as otherwise irreversible damage may be caused; 4. Considers that the 7th EAP should provide a positive narrative on the benefits of stringent environ\u00ad mental policy to strengthen public support and political will to act; 5. Takes the view that the 7th EAP should set concrete targets for 2020 as well as setting out a clear ambitious vision for the environment in 2050 aimed at providing a high quality of life and well-being for all within safe environmental limits; EN C 258 E/116 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "6. Considers that the timeline for the 7th EAP should be aligned with the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the Europe 2020 strategy; stresses, however, that key decisions in other policy areas with a strong impact on the environment are likely to be taken before the adoption of the 7th EAP. 7. Stresses that the 7th EAP should provide the right framework to ensure adequate funding, including for innovation, research and development and that financing environmental objectives, in synergy with LIFE, and fully integrating protection of the environment should be an important part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework, of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), of the Cohesion Policy and of Horizon 2020; considers, in particular, that the EU should allow new sources of financing to be created for the EAP, for instance through the mobilisation of market instruments and payments for ecosystem services; 8. Considers that the 7th EAP should be an overarching framework that makes it possible to deal with both persistent and emerging environmental and sustainability challenges, with due regard for existing and planned measures; 9. Considers that, for the coming decade, the 7th EAP should ensure that the EU\u2019s environmental choices are sufficiently clear and predictable for national and local administrations, citizens, businesses and investors; is of the opinion that this overarching EU programme should send a strong political signal to the rest of the world and contribute to establishing international environmental governance; 10. Invites the Commission to base its future proposal for the 7th EAP on the following 3 \u2018i\u2019s priorities: \u2014 Implementation and strengthening \u2014 Integration \u2014 International dimension; 11. Believes that many of the goals contained in the 6th Environment Action Programme are well formulated, but is also aware that many are far from having been met; would therefore like to see more of these objectives being transferred to the 7th Environment Action Programme; 12. Wishes to emphasise the importance of allowing the precautionary principle to govern the EU's environment policy; Implementation and strengthening 13. Notes with concern that implementation of the environmental acquis is still insufficient; considers that full implementation and enforcement at all levels, and further strengthening, of key environmental and related policy priorities \u2013 climate change, biodiversity, resources, environment and health, as well as social and employment policies, energy, sustainable transport, sustainable agriculture and rural development \u2013 are crucial; emphasises, therefore, the need for clear, consistent environmental legislation, based on public policy evaluations and feedback; 14. Highlights the fact that full compliance with EU environmental law is a genuine Treaty obligation and a criterion for the use of EU funds in Member States; 15. Underscores the fundamental importance of informing citizens about our environmental policies in order to involve them in the success of such policies; requests, therefore, that a greater effort in this respect be made in the future Action Programme, bearing in mind that a better environment for a better life cannot be created unilaterally from within the Institutions without the support of society itself; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/117 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "Climate change 16. Takes the view that the 7th EAP should ensure full implementation of the climate and energy package and provide for a strengthening of it; 17. Considers that the 7th EAP should reflect the need for binding targets for energy efficiency and/or energy savings as this will contribute to combating climate change and to environmental protection; stresses the importance of a flexible Community framework, in order to ensure that the proposed energy efficiency measures take due account of the specificities in each Member State; 18. Takes the view that the 7th EAP should also take the debate beyond 2020 and consider mid-term targets for emissions reductions, energy efficiency and renewables for 2030; 19. Considers that the 7th EAP should also address maritime and non-CO 2 emissions; 20. Considers that adaptation to climate change should be properly addressed by the 7th EAP, taking into account the different necessities of the regions, on the basis of the upcoming EU Adaptation Strategy; invites the Commission to put forward an ambitious proposal for reforming EU plant health legislation in order to effectively combat the proliferation of invasive species and pests, some of which are the result of climate change; 21. Acknowledges the additional benefits of a growing renewable energy production in terms of pollution reduction and health impacts, provided that it effectively reduces non-renewable energy production; 22. Recommends increasing support for regional low-carbon, climate-resilient strategies and small-scale climate projects by SMEs, NGOs and local authorities under the Climate Action sub-programme included in the new LIFE programme proposed by the Commission; Efficient and Sustainable Use of Resources 23. Recalls that an absolute reduction of resource use is urgently needed; asks the Commission to interpret the term \u2018resource efficiency\u2019 broadly so that all resources are covered; points out that these include, for example, natural energy and non-energy resources, such as water, ecosystems and biological diversity; asks the Commission also to integrate sustainable materials management and sustainability in production and consumption into the area of resource efficiency; 24. Considers that the 7th EAP should be instrumental in achieving a long-term target, namely reducing the Ecological Footprint by 50 % within the next 20 years; points out that the EU's excessive ecological footprint is undermining regional and global prospectss for natural ecosystems that can sufficiently support humankind; 25. Considers that the objectives of the Roadmap towards a resource-efficient Europe should be fully included in the 7th EAP; 26. Invites the Commission to already use \u2013 and improve \u2013 existing resource efficiency indicators where available and set targets without any delay in close cooperation with the Member States and all other interested parties, and to develop as soon as possible new indicators and targets where needed, as requested in the Roadmap; calls on the Commission, in view of the limitations of the flagship indicator on resource productivity, to define an indicator for material consumption, using a lifecycle-based approach that inte\u00ad grates hidden flows, i.e. the potential for environmental pressures to be transferred outside the EU, and movements of shortfalls and dependencies, without delay; EN C 258 E/118 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "27. Takes the view that the 7th EAP should provide for the development of a legislative framework for mainstreaming into relevant policies, especially that of sustainable production, the notion of cascading use of resources, ensuring that our scarce raw materials are used to their full potential; 28. Takes the view that the 7th EAP should include objectives on how to deal with the urban environment, where the majority of European citizens live, where more than two thirds of CO 2 emissions are produced, and which has a considerable impact on the environment, and that it should provide guidance on how to promote integrated environmental planning, sustainable mobility, quality of life and human health in cities, taking into account the principle of subsidiarity; 29. Calls on the Commission and the Member States, with a view to implementing pollution reduction strategies in the urban environment, to examine the possibility of creating a European support framework for the progressive implementation of urban mobility plans in European cities, establishing procedures and financial support mechanisms at European level for preparing urban mobility audits as well as urban mobility plans, and setting up a European Urban Mobility Scoreboard; 30. Considers that the 7th EAP should provide for full attainment of the goals for sustainable and ecological consumption and production set out in the Roadmap, for example as regards Green and Sustainable Public Procurement in compliance with the principles of transparency and fair competition; calls for the development of product policy, addressing the whole product lifecycle and including animal welfare friendly methods of production; calls on the Commission, once the harmonised European method for calculating a product\u2019s environmental footprint has been finalised, to ensure that additional information for consumers about the environmental impact of products, beyond existing schemes (eco-label, energy label, organic certification, etc.), is included; calls on the Commission to extend the scope of the Ecodesign Directive and review the implementation thereof; 31. Considers that the 7th EAP should encourage the creation of incentive schemes to promote demand for recycled materials, particularly when incorporated in finished products; 32. Takes the view that the 7th EAP should provide for full implementation of waste legislation, including compliance with the waste treatment hierarchy while ensuring coherence with other EU policies; considers that it should set more ambitious prevention, re-use and recycling targets, including a net decrease in waste generation, no incineration of waste that is suitable for recycling or composting with respect to the hierarchy of the Waste Framework Directive, and a strict ban on the dumping of selectively collected waste in landfill,s as well as sectoral objectives for resource efficiency and process efficiency benchmarks; recalls that waste is also a resource and can often also be reutilised, in which case we can ensure the efficient use of resources; invites the Commission to investigate how to make collecting waste from consumer products more efficient both by extending the principle of extended producer responsibility and through guidelines on managing recovery, collection and recycling systems; emphasises the need to invest in the recycling of raw materials and rare earths, since mining, refining and recycling rare earths can have serious consequences for the environment unless managed appropriately; 33. Believes that targets that have already been set in several directives regarding the collection and separation of waste should be further elaborated and set for the highest and most qualitative recovery of materials in each of the phases of recycling, namely collection, dismantling, pre-processing and recycling/ refinery; 34. Considers that the 7th EAP should take into account the provisions of the forthcoming Blueprint on EU Water Policy and stresses the value of a better coordinated approach to water pricing; calls on the Commission, therefore, to facilitate access to solutions to water shortages, water recovery and developing alternative irrigation techniques and to encourage the optimisation of the successive uses of water extracted from the water cycle, including recycling water used for agricultural and industrial purposes where appro\u00ad priate, and recovering the nutrients and energy contained in waste water; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/119 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "35. Calls on Member States to ensure the full and effective implementation of water legislation and takes the view that, to ensure compliance with the Water Framework Directive and the Directive on the assessment and management of flood risks, measures must be developed to recover the natural banks of rivers and reforest the adjacent areas; 36. Urges the Commission to involve all relevant stakeholders in the formulation of targets which should ensure sustainability of land use in the 7th EAP; calls on the Commission to define critical land-use issues such as the loss of semi-natural habitats and the displacement of high-value land uses by bioenergy crops; emphasises, in this connection, the need for sustainability criteria for biomass and biofuels which also address the issue of indirect land-use change; 37. Considers that the 7th EAP needs to address the impacts of European policies outside the EU, and asks the Commission, therefore, to take forward the issue of reducing the EU's land footprint in third countries, in particular by addressing indirect land use change due to biofuels and biomass for energy, and to include the objective that no land of high environmental value will be converted to new uses in order to produce crops for the EU; Biodiversity and Forestry 38. Underlines the importance of acting now, in order to set the EU on the right track to fully meet its own biodiversity 2020 headline target, as well as its global commitments on protecting biodiversity, as we cannot afford to fail again, and of planning sufficient resources for the conservation of the Natura 2000 Network; considers that the difficulties encountered in meeting the target set for 2010 indicate the need for an in-depth review of the methods applied to date; believes that integrated strategic studies, including studies of the elements that could influence protected areas, must be carried out; considers that these studies should be incorporated into urban planning and be accompanied by educational and information campaigns about the importance of local resources and their conservation; 39. Considers that the objectives of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy, including its targets and actions, should be fully included in the 7th EAP as a means to ensure its full implementation; considers that certain actions need to be reinforced in the short term so that biodiversity is more clearly addressed in all policy areas, and that additional actions are necessary (e.g. action to restore degraded eco-systems) to effectively achieve the 2020 target; stresses that the 7th EAP will provide a powerful framework to support the adoption of the necessary legal and financial instruments, starting with guaranteed funding for Natura 2000; 40. Emphasises the importance of mobilising both EU and national financial support from all possible sources, as well as developing innovative financial mechanisms, to ensure an adequate level of support for biodiversity; 41. Invites the Commission to publish a communication on the new European Forestry Strategy by the end of 2012, to propose effective measures to improve cooperation between Member States on forestry issues and to encourage a rational use of forestry resources and sustainable forest management; 42. Recommends including a stronger focus on forests in the new Common Agricultural Policy by promoting agroforestry and a rural development policy based on sustainable landscapes; 43. Calls for the introduction of a new Community regulation on preventing fires or, at the very least, proposes to strengthen cooperation between Member States in this area; EN C 258 E/120 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "Environmental quality and health 44. Takes the view, given that poor environmental conditions have a substantial impact on health, involving high costs, that the 7th EAP should notably: \u2014 continue to include the 6th EAP\u2019s objective that by 2020 chemicals will only be produced and used in ways that do not have a significant negative impact on health and the environment; \u2014 address air quality \u2013 including indoor air quality \u2013 and its impact on health; \u2014 address noise and its impact on health; \u2014 provide for the development of specific measures relating to emerging human and animal health threats, currently not sufficiently addressed, to examine the effects of new developments on human and animal health, such as nanomaterials, endocrine disruptors and the combination effects of chemicals, on the basis of scientific studies and commonly accepted definitions, where available; \u2014 include action to protect children's health from environmental pollution, on the basis of the WHO Europe Parma Declaration on Environment and Health, of March 2010; \u2014 tie in with the second Environmental Health Action Plan; 45. Underlines that the 7th EAP should set specific goals to ensure that by 2020 the health of European citizens is no longer undermined by pollution and hazardous substances; 46. Considers that full regard should be paid to the methods used for the risk assessment of chemicals, prioritising alternatives to animal tests; considers also that the 7th EAP should provide for the adoption of an EU-wide strategy to reduce the number of animals used in safety testing, while guaranteeing a high quality of life for humans and animals in the EU; 47. Believes that there is a need for a holistic approach to health and the environment, which focuses on precaution and the prevention of risks, and in particular takes account of vulnerable groups such as foetuses, children and young people; 48. Considers that efforts should be made to focus on prevention, precaution and promotion of environment-friendly activities at EU level, in the field of research, innovation and development, with the goal of reducing the environmental burden of disease; 49. Considers that the 7th EAP should address the transport issue by promoting more investment in environment-friendly transport systems and proposing solutions to tackle congestion, CO 2 emissions and micro-particles; 50. Considers it important that the 7th Environment Action Programme pay special attention to the continued phasing out of mercury, both within and outside the EU; Enforcement 51. Calls on the Member States to see to the full and proper implementation of EU environmental legislation and adopted policies and strategies, and to ensure adequate capacity and finances for full implementation, including in times of austerity, as non-implementation or incomplete implementation of EU environmental legislation is not only unlawful, but also far more costly to society in the long run; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/121 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "52. Considers it essential to strengthen the European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law (IMPEL) and urges the Commission to report on possible ways of doing so; 53. Calls on the Commission to systematically apply ex-ante controls of compliance with all relevant Community laws, particularly in the area of Cohesion Policy, before granting any funding; 54. Considers it important to view the 7th EAP as a means of communication with European citizens, so that it can mobilise these citizens, not least for the purposes of enforcing agreed policies on the ground; 55. Calls on the Commission to step up its role as the \u2018guardian of the Treaties\u2019 in order to ensure correct transposition, implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation by all Member States; recommends greater local authority participation throughout the process of defining environmental policy so as to improve implementation of the legislation across the board, including setting up teams to transpose environmental law at regional and local level; calls on the Commission, therefore, to explore what role the European Environment Agency could play in relation to transposition and implementation; Integration 56. Takes the view that environmental considerations are gaining increasing importance in other sectoral policies and that, accordingly, environment policy should be further integrated into other policy areas; 57. Invites the Commission to develop indicators in order to be able to measure improvement of integration; 58. Takes the view that the objectives of Roadmap 2050 can only be achieved if complementary strategies are implemented, including assessment of agriculture, reforestation and the introduction of policy incentives for innovation and rapid implementation of solar, geothermal and marine energy; 59. Urges the Commission to include in its 7th EAP proposal an aggregated list of all the existing environment-related targets for the different policy areas, notably climate change, biodiversity, transport, energy, agriculture, fisheries and cohesion policy, and examine them in conjunction with each other, so as to allow for an appropriate comparison and to ensure that objectives are coherent; 60. Urges the Commission, when reviewing the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and Directive 2001/42/EC, to ensure that they contribute to a sustainable use of land as a critical resource in the EU and also to extend the scope of environmental impact assessments to cover not only large projects, while tightening and expanding the criteria of such assessments but also to include the notion of cascading use of resources and full life-cycle analysis; 61. Calls on the Commission to propose a procedure ensuring the impartiality and independence of environmental impact assessments, first of all by eliminating the direct relationship between project developers and the assessors; EN C 258 E/122 Official Journal of the European Union 7.9.2013 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "62. Recommends that an equitable balance be found between the need to combat climate change and to halt or mitigate biodiversity loss and the Seventh Environment Action Programme, so that the European Union can achieve the EU 2020 targets and avoid unnecessary costs resulting from climate change and biodiversity loss; stresses in this context the importance of cohesion policy post-2013; also emphasises, with prevention policy in mind, the need to see costs as investments for the future and for new jobs and to launch information, awareness and other campaigns so as to allow best practice to be exchanged at all levels; underlines the need for better use of technical assistance at national, regional and local levels in order to increase administrative capacity where needed; considers it necessary to efficiently match research and innovation objectives with local and regional development needs; 63. Takes the view that the objectives of Roadmap 2050 can only be achieved if complementary strategies are implemented, including assessment of agriculture, reforestation and the introduction of policy incentives for innovation and rapid implementation of solar, geothermal and marine energy; 64. Takes the view that the 7th EAP should include a strict and detailed plan both at European and national level for the phasing-out of all environmentally harmful subsidies by 2020, for example those affecting biodiversity, in order to respect the Nagoya commitments; 65. Considers that the 7th EAP should provide for the inclusion of environmental considerations beyond the current climate change and energy headline indicators in the European Semester; calls on the Commission, in particular, to integrate resource efficiency policies as set out in the Resource Efficiency Roadmap, and to monitor through the European Semester Member States' follow-up to country-specific recommendations accordingly; 66. Underlines the important role of regional and local authorities, non-governmental organisations, academia as well as civil society and the private sector, in the promotion and implementation of effective environment policy across the EU; 67. Considers that, in order to achieve meaningful results, implementation of the programmes at regional and local level must be ensured, and the process must be inclusive of all interested parties; calls for attention to be paid to the situation of regions and territories with special geographical features, such as islands, mountain regions and sparsely populated regions; welcomes the Commission\u2019s proposal to strengthen the use of Environmental Impact Assessments and Strategic Environmental Impact Assessments in local and regional decision-making; 68. Underlines that the 7th EAP should provide for the full implementation of the Aarhus Convention, in particular regarding access to justice; stresses, in this connection, the urgent need to adopt the directive on access to justice; calls on the Council to respect its obligations resulting from the Arhus Convention and to adopt a common position on the corresponding Commission proposal before the end of 2012; 69. Takes the view that the 7th EAP should aim at supporting the development of alternative models to measure growth and welfare \u2018beyond GDP\u2019; 70. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the \u2018green economy\u2019 globally, inte\u00ad grating environmental, social and economic aspects such as poverty reduction; EN 7.9.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 258 E/123 Friday 20 April 2012 ",
        "71. Underlines the importance of demonstrating to EU citizens, especially in the current economic climate, that environmental protection is not contradictory to sustainable economic and social development; advocates, to this end, the promotion of successful projects and the dissemination of information to the public on the feasibility of environmentally benign economic development in important natural and cultural heritage areas like the Natura 2000 network; 72. Recalls that the 7th EAP should provide for the right framework to ensure adequate funding, including funding for innovation, research and development; 73. Takes the view that the LIFE+ programme should be managed by the Commission, with the emphasis being placed on projects of innovation and excellence, promoting SMEs and R&D institutions and prioritising the maintenance of biodiversity with a systematic and integral approach and agricultural technologies compatible with the preservation of the soil and the food chain of animals\u2019 ecosystems; believes that the EU\u2019s LIFE+ programme should be more widely promoted in all regions of Europe in order to encourage innovative practices at local level and enhance the impact and awareness of the \u2018Environmental Policy and Management\u2019 section of this programme; 74. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop within the next Research Framework Programme a research and innovation programme targeting new materials and resources which could in the future replace existing raw materials that are in short supply; International dimension 75. Considers that the 7th EAP should have as a goal to integrate environmental considerations into all EU external relations, in particular into development aid and trade agreements, in order to promote environmental protection in third countries; urges the EU to promote joint programming of environmental research activities with its neighbours; 76. Invites the Commission to include in its proposal a goal for the EU to fully support the work on environmental accounting done by the UN, the World Bank and European Environment Agency, in order to equip the world with a harmonised environmental accounting system; welcomes the commitments made in the EU Biodiversity Strategy to improving knowledge of ecosystems and their services in the EU (as in the case of forests); encourages Member States to share information about their experiences and to compare notes on methodologies relating to ecosystem accounting; 77. Considers that the 7th EAP should provide for timely implementation of EU international commit\u00ad ments, in particular in the framework of the UNFCCC and the CBD; 78. Urges the Commission to integrate in the 7th EAP the outcome of the Rio+20 conference on the Green Economy and on strengthening International Environment Governance; * * * 79.

The reinforced Stability and Growth Pact and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union require Member States, in particular those whose currency is the euro, to comply with strict fiscal disci\u00ad pline, simultaneously applying spending controls and generating sufficient tax revenues. For these reasons, and because the Euro Plus Pact, agreed by the Heads of State or government of the Member States whose currency is the euro, provides that the development of a CCCTB \" could be a revenue-neutral way forward to ensure consistency among national tax systems while respecting national tax strategies, and to contribute to fiscal sustainability and the competi\u00ad tiveness of European businesses \" , it is of vital importance that Member States whose currency is the euro are able to meet their budgetary commitments, in order to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole, and it is desirable that the CCCTB is applied as soon as possible to as many companies as possible. Amendment 8 Proposal for a directive Recital 4 c (new) (4c) In light of the vital role that SMEs play in the internal market, the Commission should develop and make available to SMEs engaged in cross-border activities, a tool that mitigates the administrative burden and costs and that thus enables them to voluntary opt into the CCCTB system.

(5) Since differences in rates of taxation do not give rise to the same obstacles, the CCCTB need not affect the discretion of Member States regarding their national rate(s) of company taxation.

        "TEXT PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION AMENDMENT Amendment 10 Proposal for a directive Recital 5 a (new) (5a) This Directive does not aim to harmonise Member States' corporate tax rates. If, however, it becomes apparent that the economic efficiency, effectiveness and equitability of corporate taxation would benefit from an introduction of minimum rates, the Commission should consider whether such harmonisation is appropriate when reviewing the appli\u00ad cation of this Directive. This is all the more important as the evolution of corporate tax rates in the Member States clarifies that tax competition within the internal market has an impact. It is therefore useful, in the spirit of the report entitled \" A New Strategy for the Single Market \" of 9 May 2010, to determine whether the impact of such competition is beneficial or harmful to a tax culture that is appropriate for the internal market of the 21st century. In particular, attention should be paid to whether the removal of the underlying tension between market integration and tax sover\u00ad eignty is one of the ways to reconcile the market and the social dimension of the internal market. Amendment 11 Proposal for a directive Recital 6 (6) Consolidation is an essential element of such a system, since the major tax obstacles faced by companies in the Union can be tackled only in that way. It eliminates transfer pricing formalities and intra-group double taxation. Moreover, losses incurred by taxpayers are automatically offset against profits generated by other members of the same group.

Amendment 2 Proposal for a directive Recital 1 a (new) (1a) In addressing an issue as wide-ranging and crucial as energy taxation in the Union, consideration of climate and environmental policy imperatives, however necessary, is not sufficient. Energy policy and industrial policy aims constitute equally critical challenges for the Union. Furthermore, in order for the internal market to function in an adequate and efficient way in the area of energy, all Union initiatives and legislation relating to this area need to be continuously and carefully coordinated. Not only should amendments to Directive 2003/96/EC be compatible with other energy- related policies, but those policies should also be appropriately adapted to the energy taxation framework.

Since CO 2 -related taxation complements the operation of Directive 2003/87/ EC, the market price of the emission allowances should be closely monitored in the periodic review of the Directive, incumbent on the Commission. The minimum levels of general energy consumption taxation should at regular intervals be automatically aligned to take into account the evolution of their real value in order to preserve the current level of rate harmonisation; to reduce the volatility stemming from energy and food prices, this alignment should be made on the basis of the changes in the Union-wide harmonised index of consumer prices excluding energy and unprocessed food as published by Eurostat . (11) It should be ensured that the minimum levels of taxation preserve their intended effects. To that end, the minimum levels of general energy consumption taxation should be examined at regular intervals . Amendment 13 Proposal for a directive Recital 11 a (new) (11a) Given the complex nature of the requirements which the two components of the new system, namely energy taxation and CO 2 -related taxation, are intended to meet, clear rules, which, in the interests of all consumers, are trans\u00ad parent and readily understandable, should be laid down at all levels in order to guarantee that the system can be properly administered. Amendment 14 Proposal for a directive Recital 12 (12) In the field of motor fuels, the more favourable minimum level of taxation applicable to gas oil, a product originally put to business use for the most part and thus traditionally taxed at a lower level, creates a distortive effect with regard to petrol, its main competing fuel. Article 7 of Directive 2003/96/EC therefore provides for the first steps of a gradual alignment to the minimum level of taxation applicable to petrol. It is necessary to complete this alignment and gradually move to a situation where gas oil and petrol are taxed at an equal level. deleted Amendment 15 Proposal for a directive Recital 12 a (new) (12a) Implementing the new tax structure will involve increasing the rate of taxation of gas oil to bring it into line with that for petrol. This may call into question both the decision taken by the Union automobile industry to focus on clean, energy-efficient conventional combustion engines and the achievement of the Union's CO 2 emissions reduction targets, since the CO 2 limit values set can be achieved only if a sufficient number of vehicles on the road are powered by gas oil.
