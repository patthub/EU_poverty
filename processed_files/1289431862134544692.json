When the country activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, a specialised French team assisted Bolivian authorities in fighting the fires. The EU also provided the Bolivian firefighters with tents and water pumps to facilitate their job. A team of 6 Swedish experts established a remote basecamp, which could shelter 200 people in tents with electricity and water. In addition, the EU team built an operation centre and trained the local forces. The response helped protect houses, communities and several national parks from the danger.
