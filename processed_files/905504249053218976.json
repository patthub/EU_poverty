        "vii Executive summary The objective of this study is to provide an in-depth review of the evidence on poverty and associated inequalities, and on what reduces them, in order to inform the European Union\u2019s reflections on implementing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. This is accomplished partly by scrutinising the literature, but significantly by means of new analytical work, which seeks to: \u2022 assess trends for indicators of poverty, inequality and human development, using robust methods for assessing change, either between 1990 and a recent year or, in some cases, between 2000 and a recent year; \u2022 explore the relationship between being part of a \u2018special status\u2019 group \u2014 namely least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), fragile and conflict-affected states (FCAS) \u2014 or geographic category \u2014 sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) or the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states \u2014 and indicators of poverty, inequality and human development; \u2022 analyse various projections of extreme poverty through 2030, highlight the assumptions they make and provide commentary on the most likely scenarios; \u2022 interrogate conventional country categories \u2014 notably LDCs, FCAS and middle- income countries (MICs) \u2014 and investigate the possibilities of creating a spectrum of country categories based on recent progress as well as income levels; \u2022 draw out the main challenges and opportunities in this changing picture, and assess policy implications. Key methods applied in measuring change are: \u2022 analysis of the headcount ratios (and numbers) of people who are poor as well as averages of countries\u2019 poverty headcount ratios, so that both people and countries are units of analysis; \u2022 for analysis of income poverty, the use of three poverty lines: extreme poverty, currently at USD 1.90/day, moderate poverty at USD 3.10/day and ultra poverty at USD 1/day ( 1 ); \u2022 for analysis of inequality, consideration of the implications of trends for the average person as well as the average across countries; \u2022 comparison of absolute and relative measures of change in income, human development and inequality over time, to benefit from the perspectives each offers; \u2022 a focus on numbers of people who are poor and affected by inequality \u2014 as well as shares \u2014 to incorporate demographic shifts. The analysis focuses both on the country level and on various country groups, including geographic regions (SSA and ACP countries), country income groups \u2014 using World Bank categories, with a particular focus on MICs \u2014 and some special status groups of countries (LDCs, LLDCs, FCAS). ( 1 ) These thresholds are expressed in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP). For 2005 PPP the corresponding values are USD 1.25, USD 2 and USD 0.70, respectively. ",
        "viii Changing geography of poverty The report shows that, while progress has been rapid in the developing world, improvements have been experienced very unevenly. It examines trends in poverty among countries, geographic regions, income categories and \u2018special status\u2019 designations and considers how poverty has fared in those groups in which it has been the highest compared with the rest of the developing world. Finally, it assesses how deprivations have evolved in child mortality (under-five mortality) \u2014 a vital non-income measure of well-being \u2014 and how this compares with patterns of poverty reduction. The analysis highlights the following findings. \u2022 At a global level . The World Bank (2015) estimates that extreme poverty fell from 37.1 % to 12.7 % of the world\u2019s people between 1990 and 2012, and that the number of extremely poor people globally has fallen by over half. China has contributed the lion\u2019s share (close to two thirds) of the reduction that has occurred. Progress on reducing moderate and ultra poverty has been slower. \u2022 At a regional level . Presently, SSA is the region with the highest share of extremely poor people (headcount ratio estimated at 35 % in 2015), followed by south Asia (13 %) (World Bank, 2015). The regional distribution of poverty has shifted in the past two decades \u2014 having fallen sharply in east Asia and the Pacific (EAP) and become more concentrated in south Asia and notably in SSA, where the number of extremely poor has also increased. SSA presently houses half of the extremely poor globally and nearly 80 % of the ultra poor. In EAP, the share of poor people globally fell for all three poverty lines between 1990 and 2012: from 51 % to 16.3 % for the extremely poor, from 54 % to 4.6 % for the ultra poor and from 47 % to 21 % for the moderately poor. For south Asia, in turn, while the share of ultra-poor people globally fell from 17 % to 7 %, the share of extremely poor and moderately poor rose from 29 % to 34 % and from 31 % to 42 %, respectively, between 1990 and 2012. In SSA, the share of poor people globally increased sharply for all three poverty lines: from 14 % to 43 % for extreme poverty, from 13 % to 29 % for moderate poverty and from 23 % to nearly 80 % for ultra poverty. \u2022 By income group . Poverty rates are higher in low-income countries (LICs) than in MICs but most poor people (up to three quarters) now live in MICs. This is mainly because of gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia and Nigeria and reclassification of these countries from LICs to MICs. One in four extremely poor people (26 %) are in India alone, and together these five countries account for nearly 60 % of the world\u2019s extreme poor. \u2022 Poverty reduction was faster in the 2000s compared with the 1990s . For the MICs, for example, in the 1990s the average change in the extreme poverty headcount was an increase of 2.6 percentage points, with extreme poverty increasing in 35 countries and decreasing in 48; in the 2000s it was a reduction of 9 percentage points, with increases in only seven countries. \u2022 The lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), where the bulk of the extreme poor are at present, have mostly achieved national incomes significantly higher than the lower-middle-income threshold, which implies limited risk of reversion. Reducing poverty in these countries may be less about the absolute volume of financial and other resources available and more about addressing national inequality, social policy and the patterns of economic growth pursued (Sumner, 2016: 24). ",
        "ix \u2022 At a country level . The average poverty headcount ratio is 18 % but at the extreme it is 82 % (Madagascar). Extreme poverty has fallen in around 80 % of the 109 developing countries with enough data to assess change between 1990 and 2012. Ten countries (five in SSA) account for 70 % of persisting poverty in the world, and the 10 countries with the highest poverty levels are all in SSA. \u2022 Non-income aspects . Progress on non-income dimensions of well-being \u2014 namely, in this report, reduction of under-five mortality, which is well correlated with other non-income dimensions \u2014 has been far more evenly distributed than progress on income poverty. Under-five mortality levels are converging between regions and income groups, and the countries with the highest levels of income poverty have registered some of the strongest improvements. In absolute terms, the fall has been the highest in SSA (by nearly 90 deaths per 1 000 live births) and south Asia (by nearly 75 deaths). The highest under-five mortality rate is currently 167 deaths per 1 000 live births (Angola) and 12 countries (all in SSA) have a rate of over 100 deaths per 1 000 live births. However, two thirds of global under-five deaths take place in 10 countries alone. In particular, 28 % of under- five deaths globally occur in India, and more than half of child deaths take place in just four countries \u2014 India, Nigeria (9 %), China (7 %) and Pakistan (7 %). All but two of the 10 countries that contribute the most to the global burden of child mortality are MICs. Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Nigeria stand out both for their high rate of under-five mortality and for the large number of under-five deaths that result. \u2022 Geography, special status and country performance . Around half of countries in the overlapping SSA, ACP and special status categories (LDCs, FCAS, LLDCs) have been moderate or strong performers in terms of progress in poverty reduction since 2000, though their overall performance has mostly fallen short of developing country averages. All the special status categories diverged significantly in terms of progress in poverty reduction from the rest of the developing world and this was driven largely but not entirely by the difference in progress between SSA countries and those in the rest of the developing world. \u2022 The effect of multiple geographic/special status designations . Having multiple geographic/special status designations is typically associated with higher poverty levels and a lower rate of poverty reduction \u2014 but again this does not hold true uniformly. Belize, for example, has no special status, yet its poverty headcount has increased since 2000. In contrast, Chad and Uganda, which belong to multiple groups (SSA, landlocked FCAS and LDCs), have registered strong a performance. This suggests these designations are generally, but not necessarily, a hindrance to poverty reduction. Changing geography of inequality The report looks into income inequalities and how they have evolved at different spatial scales \u2014 among people in the world, between countries and regions and within countries. It also examines trends in \u2018special status\u2019 country categories relative to the rest of the developing world and how income inequalities evolve as countries transition between income groups. Finally, it considers the evolution of inequalities in educational attainment and how these relate to inequalities in income. The analysis points to the following findings. ",
        "x \u2022 Inequality matters for two reasons: (1) because higher inequality has been linked with lower economic growth, higher poverty, poorer education and health outcomes, and an increased likelihood of crime and violence; and (2) because of growing cross-border movements and the influence of global standards on people\u2019s perceptions of their situation and their aspirations (Milanovic, 2013). In particular, countries where inequality fell were more likely to experience poverty reduction. \u2022 At a global level . Inequality among people globally is at a high but may have decreased modestly in the past two decades, primarily because of rising incomes in China (and to a much lesser extent India) and the development of a global middle class. \u2022 At a regional level . Inequality has risen in EAP over the past two to three decades, largely because of unequal income growth within China, and it has been fairly constant in SSA, if South Africa is excluded. Since about 2000, inequality has also risen in south Asia, but from a much lower base, whereas in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) it has declined, owing to falling within-country inequality. \u2022 For the ACP countries and for SSA , average initial inequality (in 2000) across countries was higher in both these categories than for the rest of the developing world and the gap with the rest of the world also grew over time (up to 2012). However, if we look at the same data, but this time weighted by population, for SSA we find that in 2000 inequality was lower than in the rest of the developing world but it increased so sharply that SSA became more unequal than the rest of the developing world by 2012. This suggests sharp rises in inequality in certain populous countries of the region. In fact, seven of the most unequal countries in the world today are in SSA \u2014 namely, Angola, Botswana, Central African Republic (CAR), Comoros, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia \u2014 all with a Gini exceeding 0.55. But, excluding these countries (five of them have populations of under 5 million and most are in southern Africa) and controlling for country incomes, inequality levels in the region then become comparable with those elsewhere in the developing world. \u2022 Within countries: Aggregate within-country inequalities have risen steadily \u2014 largely as an artefact of the experience of China. If China is excluded from the calculation, aggregate within-country inequality is remarkably constant \u2014 as some countries have become less equal others have become more so. More disaggregated examination of the 2000s shows inequality has fallen in more countries than it has risen in. o Income group transitions . Inequalities appear to rise somewhat as countries transition to higher income groups, but there is little connection between levels of income and inequality (Hoy et al., 2016). This is evident when exploring country-level averages \u2014 and particularly when four high- inequality outliers (CAR, Honduras, Lesotho and Zambia) are excluded. The population-weighted data analysis shows higher inequality in those countries that have higher income levels but this is driven by circumstances in China. o Absolute inequality : The size of the gap between rich and poor has risen in all countries and deserves more attention, especially considering that changes in absolute inequality over time measure who accumulates the additional income generated from growth, and may more accurately reflect how people ",
        "xi perceive inequality. Absolute inequality has worsened in every country income category. o By special status and geography . Average within-country income inequality was lower in FCAS and LLDCs than in the developing world overall but the differences were small and there is pronounced variation within each category. The average change among these special status groups was a slight decrease \u2014 and inequality declined in more countries than it rose in. For the ACP countries and for SSA, average initial inequality across countries is higher in both these categories and the gap with the rest of the world rose over time. \u2022 Non-income aspects : In contrast with trends in income inequality, inequalities in education have declined in nearly all countries. They have also fallen in FCAS, LDCs and LMICs but remain higher in these groups than in other developing countries. In contrast, they were lower in upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) in 1990 than elsewhere and declined sharply over the period. Projections The study presents medium-term projections of growth and inequality, and discusses their potential impact on income poverty. Based on the most reliable projections (and our own estimations from available data), the aim is to evaluate the likely range of scenarios and to anticipate trends through 2030 (global, regional, for \u2018special status\u2019 groups and by country), and where poverty is likely to be concentrated. Potential shocks that could disrupt these projections are discussed, as is the impact of the downgrading of growth forecasts. These issues demonstrate the high risk inherent in making any sort of projections. Taken together, the evidence suggests the following, by 2030. \u2022 At a global level . To eliminate extreme poverty, higher rates of growth and/or greater efforts to make growth more pro-poor than in the past will be needed. Different assumptions regarding growth in particular result in different poverty forecasts (the average projected headcount for 2030 is 5.6 % at USD 1.25 a day in 2005 purchasing power parity (PPP)). The most plausible scenario, in our view, suggests a poverty headcount of 6.5-7 % (in 2005 PPP) or 4-6 % for USD 1.90 in 2011 PPP. It is estimated that growth of the bottom 40 % would need to be 2 percentage points higher than mean to eliminate extreme poverty at a global level if current growth levels continue. \u2022 There is reason to believe that, as countries\u2019 poverty falls, the poverty rate becomes more sensitive to inequality and less sensitive to growth (Gibson, 2016). Given this, and the increasing inequality observed in much of the developing world over the past two decades, an expanded range of scenarios including variation in both growth and inequality leads to the finding that any poverty headcount at or below 2010 levels is plausible in 2030. \u2022 By region, income group and special status . Income poverty is likely to be concentrated in SSA, in FCAS and in LICs/LDCs, though a sizeable share of the extreme poor may remain in MICs, especially those that are also FCAS. In many of the pessimistic projections, the number of poor people in LICs in 2030 is greater than it is in 2010. Under the most pessimistic projections, it is also possible that the number of poor people could rise in UMICs (Edward and Sumner, 2013). By comparison, the pessimistic projections for LMICs are about half or less ",
        "xii the 2010 figure. 2030 poverty estimates for SSA suggest a range of between 19 % and 33 % (in 2005 PPP, potentially slightly lower in 2011 PPP), and that the absolute number of poor people could rise. Poverty levels in south Asia are uncertain, given that many poor people are situated near the extreme poverty line. \u2022 The reason the number of poor people in SSA could be higher in 2030 than at present relates to both current poverty rates and the significant size of the poverty gap (which expresses the average shortfall of the poor from the poverty line). By comparison, a large share of the population in south Asia lives around the extreme poverty line, such that growth at the lower end of the distribution can push large numbers of people over the poverty line. This is why uncertainty about future south Asian poverty levels drives variation in projections. The poor in south Asia could account for virtually none of global poverty in 2030, or as much as 20 %. \u2022 Lagging sub-regions include the Pacific, east, west and central Africa and some countries in Central America and the Caribbean, especially Haiti. \u2022 FCAS . Estimated 2030 headcounts span from 13 % to around 50 %, and have an average of 22 %. The share of the global poor living in FCAS could be somewhere between 21 % and 62 %. The share and number of poor people in middle-income FCAS is expected to increase over time, whereas the share of poor people in low- income FCAS may diminish. \u2022 The only projections of LDCs \u2019 performance through 2030 anticipate persistently high poverty and a relatively slow reduction rate. Even under the most optimistic scenario, 268 million people could still be living in extreme poverty in 2030 in LDCs; the worst case figure is in excess of 650 million. The share of the LDCs\u2019 population in global extreme poverty is expected to worsen \u2014 from about 62 % to 82 % under the static inequality scenario. \u2022 By country . The goal of reaching a 3 % global poverty level is compatible with much higher levels of extreme poverty in some countries. Even under the most optimistic assumptions, more than half the population in Madagascar and DRC could be living in extreme poverty in 2030. While 25 (23 %) of the 109 developing countries with data are expected to reduce poverty headcounts by over 90 %, on current trend poverty headcount rates are set to increase in 11 countries (10 %). \u2022 Exogenous threats . Climate change and conflict could greatly disrupt poverty reduction scenarios that assume growth rates and inequality are the only parameters that change, and that they do so in line with past trends, making the above projections not fully reliable. Climate-related risks appear to be increasing while conflict-related risks may be diminishing. \u2022 The downgrading of growth forecasts is itself a threat to what can be achieved by 2030. For example, for India, there is a difference of over 25 % in income per person in 2030 when using 2012 forecasts for 2013 versus actual data. This has huge ramifications for estimates of extreme poverty in 2030 given that many people live on just below USD 1.25 a day (2005 PPP). Initial analysis suggests that, under the 2013 International Monetary Fund growth forecasts, another 50 million people could potentially be in poverty in 2030. And if developing countries grow at half the rate of the 2000s for the next 15 years, then the poverty rate could still be above 10 % of the developing world\u2019s population in 2030. ",
        "xiii Progress-based country categories and possible reasons for differential progress The report proposes a new approach to categorising countries combining income level and progress in poverty reduction, on the grounds that existing country categories, especially MICs, and even LMICs, are too large and now too heterogeneous to be useful for policymaking purposes. The analysis of progress is repeated for LDCs and FCAS. FCAS are further divided into severely conflict-affected poor states (SCAPS \u2014 LDCs that are also severely conflict-affected) and others. The report then uses these new progress-based categories, as well as the issue-based categories (LDCs and FCAS) divided into subcategories also based on progress in poverty reduction, to explore the possible determinants of the poverty trends observed. This involves investigating the statistical associations of a range of development indicators with these progress-based categories. The international community is increasingly focusing its attention (and, in some cases, aid) on LICs and FCAS. While this is perfectly reasonable, this analysis draws attention to one other group of countries: L-LMICs making weak progress or regressing on poverty. Moreover, it also highlights those FCAS and LDCs that are making weak progress or regressing on poverty. Furthermore, in the case of FCAS, the subset of 14 SCAPS account for much of the difference between FCAS and other developing countries \u2014 so it too is worthy of attention. The analysis suggests the following. \u2022 L-LMICs making weak progress on poverty or regressing have experienced a combination of low government revenue and aid per poor person, relatively weak government effectiveness and significant environmental challenges, especially in south Asia, where there may be a trade-off between growth and environmental protection. Some (but not all) L-LMICs making weak progress on poverty are significantly dependent on foreign direct investment (FDI) in mineral extraction. This category is reducing its high levels of environmental vulnerability more slowly than other categories. Governance issues would appear to be critical in achieving greater progress on poverty (and environment) for these countries. \u2022 A subset of \u2018severely conflict-affected poor states\u2019 (the SCAPS) has been making a markedly lower level of progress in reducing poverty compared with all other FCAS. The SCAPS account for most of the difference between FCAS and other developing countries on poverty rates (and several other indicators). The average for the non-SCAPS FCAS is very close to the average for all non-FCAS on many indicators including poverty reduction. One possible explanation for the high levels of poverty in the SCAPS compared with other FCAS is that the depth of poverty is much greater in SCAPS than in other FCAS. \u2022 There is a worrying divergence among FCAS between a group of SCAPS and other FCAS not making (much) progress on poverty on the one hand, and those making stronger progress on the other hand, in terms of trends in growth, volatility of growth, human development and vulnerability to climate change. This looks like a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of driving factors \u2014 volatile growth, poor government effectiveness, low aid and environmental vulnerability \u2014 that will make it next to ",
        "xiv impossible for these countries to progress towards the eradication of poverty in future. \u2022 Although few LDCs have graduated from this special status, about a third are doing relatively well in term of progress on poverty. The rest overlap substantially with FCAS, and the same issues apply as just described for FCAS. As said earlier, SCAPS are also LDCs. LDCs experiencing regress or weaker progress on poverty do not face quite the same \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of factors inhibiting poverty reduction as do FCAS making weaker progress: although they exhibit lower and more volatile growth than other LDCs, higher vulnerability and sensitivity to climate change and divergence on under-five mortality, government revenues are a little higher, as are FDI and aid flows, and education and health expenditure, compared with in other LDCs. \u2022 The fact that aid per poor person is higher to lower-progress LDCs, despite their (on average) lower government effectiveness, suggests donors have recognised the plight of these countries, at least in relative terms. However, when aid per poor person to LDCs is compared with aid to other developing countries, there is a massive and diverging gap, suggesting a lot more could be done to address LDC issues through aid. \u2022 Many developing countries making weaker progress on poverty or that are regressing are mineral exporters. However, exploiting minerals by itself does not prevent other developing countries from progressing on poverty: it is government effectiveness that may influence whether this is possible. Commodity exporters with lower progress on poverty, and where government effectiveness is lower, where education expenditure is lower and where overlaps with FCAS and LDC categories are frequent, represent another group that should receive a great deal of international attention with respect to poverty reduction. However, these countries are mostly covered by the previous two groups \u2014 FCAS and LDCs making weaker progress/regressing. \u2022 While governance improvements will be critical in FCAS, governance is also a key issue for weaker progress L-LMICs, not all of which are FCAS. UMICs, by contrast, are generally capable of sustained progress on poverty, especially where they have effective policy frameworks. This could also be extended to upper LMICs (U-LMICs) with strong policy frameworks. A summary of challenges and opportunities Finally, this report identifies the challenges and opportunities for the international community and national policymakers that emerge from the analysis and puts forward recommendations in the context of the 2030 agenda. While our intention is not to imply that all the stakeholders involved in international development need to evolve in precisely the same direction, we do believe they will need to ask themselves how better to respond to the changing geography of poverty and inequality and work more intensively and better in difficult environments, in particular in the poorest FCAS and in SSA, as well as in some LMICs making less than average progress on poverty. They also need to look at how to address the issues of some better- off countries in Asia, where large numbers of extremely poor people remain. ",
        "xv As identified earlier, major global challenges with respect to the eradication of poverty now and in the future are located in SSA and south Asia. Within this, significant attention needs to be given to FCAS and LDCs, especially those with the \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of challenges identified above. The SCAPS also merit a greater degree of attention. These are all overlapping categories. Relevant policy issues include extending social assistance to all the ultra poor to bring their level of living closer to the poverty line and paying close attention to (and supporting the rise of) rural casual wages, which tend to determine levels of living at the bottom of the income distribution. A further challenge is to maintain an adequate focus on the MICs where a high proportion of today\u2019s poor live \u2014 especially those L-LMICs making weak progress on poverty. The most successful Chinese \u2018model\u2019 is one of massive job creation, improving job quality and skills over time and intense private sector development alongside FDI. It is a major challenge to extend aspects of this model to other developing countries, though countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam have at least partially taken up that challenge, and Ethiopia and Rwanda in Africa aspire to. Lessons from recent work on sustaining escapes from poverty suggest some important policy supports for people escaping poverty are well developed, but others \u2014 policies on social assistance and insurance, the rural nonfarm economy, rural wage labour markets and migration \u2014 are weakly developed. In order to strengthen the impact of policy in these countries, significant attention to domestic resource mobilisation, and redistribution through the fiscal system, is also needed. In order to sustain poverty reduction in MICs with large populations in poverty, it may be useful for donors to reconsider their policies for reducing aid to such countries or at least to define innovative aid modalities which could offset the reduction of aid thus ensuring that the poor in those countries are not negatively affected. Looking to the future, the slowdown of global (and Chinese) growth represents a significant challenge, and the report argues there is a need to look again at redistributive measures. Integrated social protection may be another approach. \u2018Leaving no one behind\u2019 will be difficult because of the existence of countries that will retain large numbers of extremely poor people. In addition, the disrupters of development, such as conflict and climate change, could further hinder progress. This report also highlights inequality as inimical to growth, political stability and poverty reduction, and this reinforces the importance of a focus on social protection and tax policies. Major opportunities exist, by contrast, in the way in which the international community has developed a principled approach to its support for developing countries, in its consistent support for human development, which now needs to be leveraged for a greater impact on income poverty, in the strengthening of the knowledge base on poverty and inequality reduction and human development, and in the increasing number of poor developing countries with significant mineral exports \u2014 which does not have to be a \u2018curse\u2019. There are LICs and LDCs making stronger progress where aid levels are lower than they might be, given generally higher levels of government effectiveness than in other LICs/LDCs \u2014 this is a clear opportunity to aid more. It can be hard for countries to sustain progress; continued and increased aid can play a role in this. This is one example ",
        "xvi of how greater knowledge can play a role in shaping the decisions of international agencies. Other examples drawn from this report include knowledge about the perfect storm of challenges facing FCAS, and to a lesser extent LDCs making weaker than average progress, compared with other FCAS and LDCs. Similarly, the study shows that there is a concentration of poor people in L-LMICs making weak progress on poverty reduction. This could challenge the international tendency to reduce aid allocations once countries reach the low-/middle-income threshold. A further example of the role of increased knowledge, and a development opportunity in itself, is the more uniform progress on human development across different categories of developing countries, which the international community has consistently supported over two decades, as a basis for poverty reduction. What is needed is to extend and deepen human development support, and to link explicitly human development progress to economic development for the poor and poorest people. So in cases where education expenditure does not seem to contribute to poverty reduction outcomes, working out why this is and adjusting policies and aid programmes would make sense. Finally, the fact that most countries in SSA will be mineral exporters by 2020 is also an opportunity. It was thought some years ago that countries with strong mineral exports were condemned to the \u2018resource curse\u2019. We now know that this is not necessarily the case. To help make the resource curse a thing of the past, there are opportunities to support the demand for better governance, and to provide countries with direct support for diversification and rebalancing their economies, if the macroeconomic conditions are right. ",
        "1 CHAPTER 1: Introduction This study provides an in-depth analysis of the evidence on extreme poverty and inequality, and on what reduces them, to inform the European Union\u2019s reflections on implementing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Where we can derive clear implications for national level and for international development policy, we elaborate these. We accomplish these objectives partly by scrutinising the literature, but significantly by means of new analytical work, which will seek to: \u2022 assess trends for indicators of poverty, inequality and human development, using robust methods for assessing change; \u2022 explore the relationship between country membership of a special status group \u2014 namely, least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and fragile and conflict-affected states (FCAS) \u2014 or geographic category \u2014 sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) or the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states \u2014 and indicators of poverty, inequality and human development; \u2022 analyse various projections of extreme poverty through 2030, highlight the assumptions they make and provide commentary on the most likely scenarios; \u2022 interrogate conventional country categories \u2014 notably LDCs, FCAS and middle- income countries (MICs) \u2014 and investigate the possibilities of creating a spectrum of country categories based on income levels and recent progress on poverty; \u2022 draw out the main challenges and opportunities in this changing picture, and assess the policy implications. 1.1 Focus of the report A key focus of this report is on examining how poverty and inequality have evolved across countries and groups of countries since 1990, the baseline for the millennium development goals (MDGs). Key methods we apply in measuring change are: \u2022 analysis of shares of people who are poor as well as averages of countries\u2019 poverty shares, so that both people and countries are units of analysis; \u2022 comparison of absolute and relative measures of change over time, to benefit from the perspectives each offers; \u2022 a focus on numbers of people who are poor and affected by inequality \u2014 as well as shares \u2014 to incorporate demographic shifts. Often, studies make distinct choices from the outset about which method to apply. In this study, the systematic joint application of these methods enables a more comprehensive assessment of where progress has occurred, to what extent and for how many people. This is a distinctive contribution of this report to the literature. 1.1.1 Comparing group progress in terms of the share of people who are poor with country averages While the conventional approach in global monitoring is to focus on shares of people across areas of the world with certain characteristics (e.g. share of people living in ",
        "2 poverty), our analysis compares these findings systematically with country-level averages. The former approach stresses that each person has equal value, regardless of where they live; the latter assigns each country an equal value so as to avoid overlooking the circumstances of people living in less populous countries. Both are important to ensure no country (as well as no person) is left behind. These two approaches sometimes give very different accounts of progress, but each is valuable in ensuring that large and small countries alike experience the reach of global agreements such as the 2030 agenda for sustainable development (the 2030 agenda) (Samman, 2015a). 1.1.2 Measuring change over time We discuss measures of progress in terms of absolute and relative change \u2014 for example a fall of 15 percentage points or a reduction by half. However, each measure will be potentially misleading because the starting point heavily conditions the amount of change registered (see Gidwitz et al., 2010). For example, take two countries, Country A with an initial poverty headcount of 80 % and Country B with a headcount of 20 %. The maximum change Country B can attain is 20 percentage points, compared with a maximum of 80 points for Country A. In other words, countries with larger deprivations have a greater possibility of registering larger absolute changes. Conversely, it may be easier for better-off countries to record higher rates of relative change, given that lower levels of absolute change translate into relatively higher levels of progress. If Country B reduces its poverty headcount by 10 percentage points, this represents a 50 % reduction; Country A would need to reduce its poverty headcount by 40 percentage points to record a similar percentage fall. Figure 1.1 compares absolute and relative change in the poverty headcount ratios in low- income countries (LICs), lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) and upper-middle- income countries (UMICs) to illustrate this point. It is immediately apparent that similar absolute changes in poverty translate into much higher relative changes for UMICs compared with LICs. Examining both absolute and relative changes in poverty and inequality over time and taking these measures together can yield complementary insights into how countries have fared. Figure 1.1: Absolute/relative progress on poverty reduction by income group, c.2000-present Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. ",
        "3 1.1.3 Demographic shifts and impact In addition to examining the share of people who are poor \u2014 or living in high-inequality settings \u2014 we look at how this translates into absolute numbers of poor people. This enables us to factor demographic change into the analysis \u2014 namely, changes in the population (and in the distribution of poor and non-poor people). For example, although the poverty headcount ratio in SSA fell between 1990 and 2015, a rise in the region\u2019s population (and higher fertility among poorer women) meant the number of poor people rose markedly. Table 1.1: Key indicators used in the analysis Dimension Indicator Source Monetary poverty Extreme, moderate and \u2018ultra\u2019 poverty lines (*) World Bank PovcalNet database Human development Under-five mortality rate Unicef Income inequality Palma ratio Computed from PovcalNet Gini index World Bank PovcalNet database Inequality in human development Gini index of education Wail et al. (2011) (*) See section on \u2018Analysing poverty\u2019 below in this section for a more detailed explanation . The data gaps that constrain our understanding of what has occurred are well documented elsewhere (OECD, 2015; Stuart et al., 2015), and so we simply acknowledge them here (see Box 1.1). Box 1.1: Data limitations and improvements under way Large data gaps complicate the analysis of levels of deprivation and trends over time. Data on income poverty are particularly lacking. For example, within sub-Saharan Africa, as of 2012, only 25 of the region\u2019s 48 countries had conducted at least two household surveys to track poverty over the previous decade (Beegle et al., 2016). Nonetheless, this reflects a marked improvement on the situation at the start of the millennium development goals (MDG) period. The 1990 World Development Report featured global income poverty estimates for just 22 countries. Today, the Bank\u2019s poverty database, PovcalNet, contains more than 1 000 household surveys from 131 developing countries, representing 87 % of the developing world\u2019s population ( 2 ). And the Bank recently pledged to ensure that the 78 poorest countries would have household surveys every 3 years \u2014 with the first round to be completed by 2020 ( 3 ). Some data gaps are concealed by a reliance on modelled data. For example, statistics on maternal mortality are available for over 140 countries but these are estimated based on data for just 16 % of births and associated error margins are large (Samman, 2015b). Measuring progress on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) will represent a new challenge. On average, data have been or are being collected on under half (46 %) of the proposed SDG indicators (Cassidy, 2014: 5). An estimated USD 1 billion will be needed each year to enable 77 of the world\u2019s poorest countries to collect the data needed to measure and support the SDGs (ibid.). Analysing poverty Poverty has many dimensions. However, \u2018its most fundamental element concerns the ability of families to have enough food and resources to survive and to think and plan beyond their short-term survival\u2019 (Chandy et al., 2015: 3). To assess income poverty, this study adopts two conventional thresholds for extreme poverty and moderate poverty, respectively, denominated in international dollars. The thresholds for extreme ( 2 ) http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/ ( 3 ) http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/10/15/world-bank-new-end-poverty-tool- surveys-in-poorest-countries ",
        "4 poverty are USD 1.25 in 2005 purchasing power parity (PPP) ( 4 ) or USD 1.90 in 2011 PPP (defined in relation to the 15 poorest countries in 2005 PPP). For moderate poverty, they are USD 2 a day in 2005 PPP or USD 3.10 a day in 2011 PPP (defined in relation to the median of 74 developing countries in 2005 PPP) (Chen and Ravallion, 2008; Ferreira et al., 2015). Much of this study was conducted prior to the October 2015 release of poverty numbers in 2011 PPP USD (and most of the secondary material reviewed here also uses numbers based on 2005 PPP exchange rates). But, where possible, and with a view to providing the most up-to-date evidence possible, we draw on new data in 2011 PPP. These two sources should complement one another given that the 2011 PPP revisions, by construction, have affected only slightly the overall number of poor people and the geographic distribution of poverty (see Annex 1). The report also includes a USD 0.70 measure in 2005 PPP (USD 1 in 2011 PPP), calculated as the \u2018minimum consumption floor\u2019 of the poorest, which has not changed since the early 1980s (Ravallion, 2016). This measure of \u2018ultra poverty\u2019 provides different insights into the geography of poverty, and trends often differ from those seen with higher poverty lines (extreme and moderate poverty). This ultra poverty line helps support the \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 principle of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development (Box 1.2). ( 4 ) In other words, differences in price levels between countries have been factored into the income poverty estimates such that, in theory, USD 1 in Botswana should have the same \u2018purchasing power\u2019 as USD 1 in Malaysia. ",
        "5 Box 1.2: Efforts to measure ultra poverty The \u2018ultra poverty\u2019 line this report proposes is not well known and merits some discussion. It represents an effort to capture poverty approaching minimum survival levels. In the early 1980s, economist Michael Lipton coined the term, defining it on the basis of people eating below 80 % of their energy requirements despite spending at least 80 % of their income on food, who were therefore at risk of malnourishment in the event of shock (Lipton, 1986). He estimated that 10-20 % of people in LICs had fallen into this category. Hill et al. (2007) sought to establish the \u2018poorest of the poor\u2019 and set a poverty line of USD 0.54 (in 1993 PPP exchange rates). They estimated that around 17 % of the poor, or 162 million people, fell into this category. More recently, Ravallion (2016) computed that USD 0.67 (in 2005 PPP exchange rates) was the \u2018minimum consumption floor\u2019 experienced by the \u2018poorest stratum of society\u2019, and that this had risen very little since the early 1980s, although mean consumption had gone up. He also cites the work of Lindgren (2015), who reaches a \u2018survival line\u2019 of USD 0.67 as \u2018the only estimate to date of the biological floor\u2019 that he is aware of. This translates into a poverty line of USD 1 in 2011 PPP. However, Chandy et al. (2013b) establish USD 0.70 as the average consumption of the poor in SSA, suggesting it may not be an actual minimum. Nonetheless, these convergent estimates suggest it is a reasonable estimate of near-destitution \u2014 therefore we use it here to illustrate trends among the very poorest ( 5 ). Mean consumption and expected minimum (USD per person per day, 2005 prices), 1980-2012 Source: Ravallion (2016). Because the extreme and even the moderate poverty lines have limited value in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the Middle East and north Africa (MENA) and Europe and central Asia (ECA) (where a value of USD 4-5 has been suggested as more appropriate) (European Report on Development, 2013; Sumner, 2016), our focus is on east Asia and the Pacific (EAP), south Asia and SSA, regions to which these lower thresholds are most applicable. In Annex 1, we consider the impact of the 2011 PPP figures on poverty measurement, consider what a more reasonable poverty line might be for richer countries and look at proposed alternatives and extensions to the international poverty lines that are the focus of this report\u2019s analysis. We examine trends in the share of the population who are poor (poverty headcount), the absolute number of poor people and the depth of their poverty (poverty gap index). The poverty gap is the average shortfall of the poor from the poverty line expressed as a share of the poverty line. In other words, it is a synthetic measure accommodating the incidence and depth of poverty. More intuitively, it can be thought of as the cost of ( 5 ) McKay and Perge (2010) show that, in some cases, severe poverty may be a reasonable lower-bounds estimate of chronic poverty \u2014 although their analysis relies on national poverty lines (which vary widely between countries) rather than a fixed international poverty line. ",
        "6 eliminating poverty, or the amount of money that would need to be transferred to the poor to bring their expenditures up to the poverty line. Analysing human development and inequality In Chapters 2 and 3 on poverty and Chapter 4 on inequality, respectively, we contrast patterns in income and in human development more broadly. In the poverty chapters, we contrast trends in income poverty with the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) indicator. This was more correlated with an array of indicators of human development than any other indicator of approximately 50 considered (Ranis et al., 2005). This report also addresses progress on reducing inequality among individuals (so-called \u2018vertical inequality\u2019) in the distribution of income (or consumption) and of years of education. Our analysis includes a discussion of the popular Gini coefficient \u2014 which characterises inequality on a scale between 0 (perfect equality) and 1 (maximum inequality) \u2014 and, for income inequality, the recently introduced Palma coefficient, which is the ratio of the incomes of the top 10 % of a society relative to those of the bottom 40 % (Cobham and Sumner, 2013) ( 6 ). This focus on the bottom 40 % is also attuned to the World Bank\u2019s recent emphasis on \u2018shared prosperity\u2019. 1.2 Country groupings The analysis in this report is made across countries and across several country groupings ( 7 ). The 2030 agenda for sustainable development identifies particular groups as meriting emphasis owing to their special circumstances, and we concentrate particularly on these: In deciding upon these goals and targets, we recognize that each country faces specific challenges to achieve sustainable development, and we underscore the special challenges facing the most vulnerable countries and, in particular, African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing the middle-income countries. Countries in situations of conflict also need special attention (UNGA, 2015). Annex 8 lists the countries facing special circumstances, by group, that this report analyses. Analysis of these groups alongside country experiences will add to our understanding of progress over time, and facilitate targeting as well as the identification of successful policies in the light of these special circumstances. We focus particularly on the experiences of countries in SSA and the ACP countries, and LDCs, LLDCs and FCAS, to identify the extent to which being part of each category has conditioned country performance in reducing poverty and inequality, and future trajectories. This examination of existing categories, in turn, leads to the proposal of a new classification (Chapter 6). ( 6 ) The Palma coefficient derives from the work of Gabriel Palma, who points to an increasing disparity in the income shares of the top 10 % and bottom 40 % of the population across developing countries over time, coupled with a roughly constant income share in the fifth to ninth deciles. Palma argues that negotiation between the top 10 % and bottom 40 % has determined the form of particular income distributions in developing countries \u2014 with the top 10 % particularly influential in most cases (Palma, 2011). ( 7 ) An important methodological issue arises given that the composition of many of these groups changes over time, as countries \u2018graduate\u2019 or as criteria for entry and exit change. By looking only at present group membership, we risk understating progress in groups like the LICs, where the most successful performers have graduated into a higher category. Conversely, if we had taken the 1990 designations as a point of departure, we would have a biased accounting of progress in the LDCs, as the analysis would omit those countries that entered this group over the period. This methodological choice needs to be borne in mind in interpreting the results in this report. ",
        "7 The reasons for singling out these groups vary. Regarding MICs, for example, evidence suggests that, when countries progress into middle-income status, they may find themselves in a \u2018middle-income trap\u2019, which impedes further progress \u2018due to rising costs and declining competitiveness \u2026 The hallmarks of success become binding constraints\u2019 (Griffith, 2011: 39). The so-called \u2018special status\u2019 countries, in turn, appear to have various structural characteristics that shape their development prospects. The LDCs, for example, have recognised structural impediments to growth. Vulnerabilities also relate to location: although research finds \u2018no simple \u201cgeographic determinism\u201d\u2019 (Gallup et al., 1999: 31), adverse geography often implies high transport costs, an unfavourable \u2018disease ecology\u2019 and poor conditions for agriculture \u2014 for example a dependency on rain-fed agriculture in sub-humid or arid regions (Sachs and McArthur, 2005). Fragility and conflict, in turn, are linked to a range of negative development outcomes (Collier, 1999; McIntosh and Buckley, 2015). 1.2.1 World Bank income categories, regions and special status groups The major categorisations include income groups \u2014 LICs, LMICs, UMICs and high-income countries (HICs) \u2014 that originated and are maintained at the World Bank. This categorisation is probably the most significant and widely used set of categories (Box 1.3). However, recently it has been subject to criticism (e.g. Alonso et al., 2014; Hoy et al., 2016), with alternative thresholds being proposed (Fantom and Serajuddin, 2016), as well as distinct operational and analytical categorisations. However, given their importance, this report uses these categories, with a focus on MICs and the transitions from LICs to MICs and LMICs to UMICs. World Bank income categories have been extremely influential in shaping our understanding of how poverty and inequality evolve as countries develop, and of appropriate operational responses. Countries are assigned to categories based on their per capita gross national income (GNI); income thresholds (as of July 2014) were USD 1 045 (LMICs), USD 4 125 (UMICs) and USD 12 746 (HICs) ( 8 ). The composition of these income-based groups has changed significantly over the past two decades. For example, 20 UMICs became HICs during this period, 37 countries went from low- to lower-middle-income status and one country (Equatorial Guinea, which discovered oil in 1995) went from LIC to HIC status. This fluidity is the product of significant income growth for most countries, alongside fewer cases of regression. In the 2000s alone, many changes have occurred (Figure 1.2). ( 8 ) http://data.worldbank.org/news/2015-country-classifications ",
        "8 Figure 1.2: Country-level transitions in World Bank income groups, 2000-2015 Source: Hoy et al. (2016: 14, Figure 4). Of 215 present-day countries, the number the Bank has been able to classify over time ( 9 ) has varied \u2014 particularly with the inclusion of the former Soviet Bloc in the early 1990s. The number increased from 174 in 1990 to 205 in 2000 and to 215 by 2011 \u2014 owing both to the creation of new countries and to increased data availability for existing countries. Within this set of countries, the number of those categorised as developing (e.g. LICs or MICs) has remained at 135 over time, but this represents a declining share of the number of countries with data: the share of developing countries in total (developing + developed) fell from 78 % in 1990 (135 of 174) to 63 % in 2014 (135 of 215). The number of LICs fell from 51 to 31 (Figure 1.3), meaning that although LICs accounted for nearly 30 % of countries with data in 1990, the share was just under 15 % in 2014. The analysis in this report is focused on the present-day developing world \u2014 that is, those countries the World Bank identifies as LICs and MICs (Box 1.3). Figure 1.3: Evolution of World Bank income group categories, 1990-2014 Source: Computed from data in WDI (2015). ( 9 ) Categorisation is based on the existence of GNI per capita in USD. ",
        "9 Box 1.3: Sample of countries analysed for this report Two issues that it is crucial to address from the outset concern sample composition and data gaps. First, our country-level data on income poverty are from the PovcalNet database, which provides comparable data over time at a country level for 126 out of the 135 countries that were considered as developing in 1990. Second, PovcalNet regional/global aggregations are based on this set of countries and include imputations of poverty data as a regional average for countries where data are missing ( 10 ). Each of these choices is problematic, given our focus in this report. First, our concern is with present-day developing countries \u2014 135 countries (LICs and MICs) corresponding to World Bank fiscal year 2016, or the 2014 calendar year ( 11 )( 12 ). Annex 2 lists the countries corresponding to each developing region in this year, and those considered high income (both within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and outside this grouping). Our analysis focuses on 109 developing countries with available data over the 1990-2012 period (listed in Annex 3), which together cover 92 % of the present developing world\u2019s population. We construct aggregates for groups where either one half of countries (for country-weighted estimates) or two thirds of the population (population-weighted estimates) is covered. A second issue concerns the imputation of missing data when constructing group aggregates, once the coverage criteria are met. As noted, in its regional and global imputations, the Bank assigns countries with missing data values in line with their regional poverty headcount ratio ( 13 ). Take the example of south Asia, where data are missing for one country, Afghanistan. Applying the average headcount for countries in the region in 2012 (19 %) to Afghanistan\u2019s population (approximately 30 million) would imply a poverty headcount of roughly 6 million people. This method is arguably justifiable for regional estimates of numbers of poor people but becomes problematic for our purposes of comparing performance across different types of groups, for two reasons. First, it assumes region is the most appropriate comparator. Afghanistan is also an LDC and a FCAS, and we argue for the importance of these types of demarcations in shaping poverty experiences. Therefore, it is unclear whether the country should be assigned a poverty headcount that assumes the poverty prevalence of south Asia, or that of the LDC group, or that of the FCAS (or some combination of the above). Second, poverty trajectories vary depending on group composition \u2014 so how Afghanistan\u2019s poverty rate would change over time would also depend very much on which group is considered the appropriate comparator. For these reasons, we do not impute values for countries missing data, apart from in the regional and global estimates presented in Chapter 2, where we also use the World Bank country sample for the sake of comparability with published estimates. Elsewhere, when we refer to numbers of poor people, these are lower- bounds estimates based on those countries for which data are available. Where we refer to the share of poor people from different groups \u2014 for example ACP countries or LDCs \u2014 in the global total, this is based on the 109 countries for which comparable data are available. Accordingly, the trends may merit more emphasis than the levels. It follows that, for these two reasons (sample composition and the treatment of countries that lack data), our estimates for aggregates are likely to differ from published estimates that rely on other groupings and/or methods to fill country data gaps. In terms of regions , for this report, the World Bank categories are used (SSA, MENA, ECA, EAP, south Asia) (see Annex 2). We also add the ACP country grouping, composed of 79 countries, given their interest for the EU. LDCs represent the oldest category of developing countries, focused on identifying countries with low incomes and structural impediments to growth (UNDESA, 2008). In 1970, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) first approved a list of 24 countries, using criteria of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), share of manufacturing in GDP and adult literacy. Over time, criteria for inclusion have evolved (they are now a combination ( 10 ) See http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/index.htm?0,2 ( 11 ) See https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/378834-how-does-the-world-bank- classify-countries. NB: countries are reassigned on 1 July of each year based on their per capita incomes for the previous calendar year, and these groupings remain intact for the entire fiscal year \u2014 i.e. until the following 1 July. ( 12 ) As of early 2015. Note that Russia and Venezuela were reclassified as UMICs (and therefore developing countries) in July 2015. ( 13 ) Note this is not entirely straightforward. Dykstra et al. (2014a) observe, along similar lines, \u2018We found it impossible \u2026 to replicate the World Bank\u2019s regional estimates based on the country data from PovcalNet, due to lack of a sufficiently detailed documentation for the process\u2019 (p. 11). ",
        "10 of income, economic vulnerability and human assets), and the list has grown to its present 48. Because of the prolonged process of graduation and relapses, very few countries move out of this group \u2014 Botswana in 1994, Cape Verde in 2007, Maldives in 2011 and Samoa in 2014. Recently, UNGA decided that Equatorial Guinea (a HIC under the World Bank classification) will graduate in 2016 and Vanuatu in 2017. Recent analysis suggests this category remains pertinent because it is issue focused (Alonso et al., 2014; see also Sumner, 2016). Overlapping with the LDC category are two further categories focused on geographical impediments \u2014 LLDCs and small island developing states (SIDS). These are not subject to specific targeted support but rather to framework agreements specifying partnerships between them and their development partners \u2014 for example the EU relationship with SIDS through the ACP (Hein, 2004, in Alonso et al., 2014). LLDCs lack direct access to an open sea. Currently, 31 countries have this status, which has been shown to impose considerable costs on development, because of high trade impediments and negative spill overs in terms of growth and infrastructure arising from being situated amid other poor countries \u2014 the so-called \u2018bad neighbourhood effect\u2019 (Collier, 2008; Esteban et al., 2013; Paudel, 2013). SIDS have in common small size (based on either population or land mass) and geographical remoteness. There is no official SIDS list \u2014 as many as six lists co-exist, with countries self-selecting into this designation (Alonso et al., 2014: 4). Note that this report pays scant attention to this group, owing to a lack of data ( 14 ). FCAS is the other major category now in widespread use internationally. Moreover, especially with the advent of the self-defined G7+ group of fragile states, the category is also embedded in some nations\u2019 discourse about themselves. Again, the report devotes considerable effort to discussing progress these variably challenged states have made. We provide analysis for the newly proposed severely conflict-affected and poor states (SCAPS), a category that draws on UN definitions of \u2018conflict-affected\u2019 to develop a unified global approach to tackling these issues (Manuel, 2015). 1.2.2 Identifying fragile and conflict-affected states There is no global agreement over which states are most affected by conflict (Manuel, 2015). To understand better the effects of conflict and fragility from a cross-national perspective, we compared nine lists of crisis countries assembled by the EU, the World Bank, OECD, universities and other institutions (Table 1.2) and identified the number of lists on which each country featured (see Annex 4). These lists are said to be \u2018holistic\u2019 or comprehensive in their use of a broad range of criteria for what fragility entails. This is useful in addressing \u2018the question of which states the international community must worry about most\u2019, though Ziaja (2012a) argues that their utility is more limited when it comes to distinguishing causes and consequences of conflict (p. 8). Our own categorisation of FCAS is defined as the set of 45 countries that featured on at least one third of these lists (i.e. three or more). The designation is somewhat arbitrary ( 14 ) We compute group aggregates where there are data for at least 50 % of countries (country-weighted aggregates) or two thirds of the population (population-weighted aggregates). The SIDS group did not meet either criterion. ",

Chapter 4 focuses on inequality. Chapter 5 examines projections of poverty to 2030 and the assumptions that underlie them, highlighting the potential disrupters of climate change and conflict. For each of these themes, the report follows a similar structure, focusing first on income-based measures at the global level, then by region and income group and by country and then by \u2018special status\u2019. In the chapters on poverty and inequality, this is followed by a brief discussion of patterns of human development. In proposing new country categories (Chapter 6), the study suggests that new categories and subcategories (in the case of MICs, LDCs or FCAS) could be usefully based on a combination of country status and progress towards eradicating extreme poverty, a central target of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG1). It also provides further insights into the drivers of persistent poverty and poverty reduction for these new categories derived from the data analysis carried out for this report. A final chapter draws out the opportunities and challenges presented by this analysis for international development cooperation. ",
        "12 CHAPTER 2: The changing geography of poverty \u2014 overview Two chapters in this report focus on the changing geography of poverty. These aim, respectively, to provide a global overview and an analysis of so-called \u2018special status\u2019 countries. This chapter details levels and trends in income poverty and child mortality among developing countries between 1990 and 2015 \u2014 the period of the MDGs. It seeks to identify which regions and countries have been more and less successful in reducing poverty over this period and shows that, while progress has been rapid in the developing world, improvements have been experienced very unevenly. The following may be noted in particular. \u2022 At a global level . Extreme poverty has fallen considerably. World Bank estimates suggest a drop from 37 % (1990) to 13 % (2012) of the world\u2019s people and that the number of poor people has fallen by over half (Cruz et al., 2015) ( 15 ). China has contributed the lion\u2019s share (close to two thirds) of the reduction that has occurred. Progress in reducing moderate and ultra poverty has been slower. \u2022 At a regional level . Currently, it is SSA whose poverty headcount ratio is highest (an estimated 35 % in 2015), followed by south Asia (13 %) (Cruz et al., 2015). The regional distribution of poverty has shifted in the past two decades \u2014 falling sharply in EAP and becoming more concentrated in south Asia and notably in SSA. SSA presently houses half of the extreme poor globally and nearly 80 % of the ultra poor. \u2022 By income group . Poverty is higher in LICs than in MICs but GDP growth in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia and Nigeria means up to three-quarters of poor people now live in MICs. India alone has one in four extreme poor (26 %). Together, the countries account for nearly 60 % of the world\u2019s extreme poor. \u2022 At a country level . Here, the average poverty headcount ratio is 18 %; at the extreme it is 82 % (Madagascar). Extreme poverty has fallen in 88 of the 109 developing countries analysed in this report (or around 80 %) (see Box 1.3). Ten countries (five in SSA) account for 70 % of persisting poverty in the world, while the 10 countries with the highest poverty levels are all in SSA. \u2022 Non-income aspects . Progress on non-income dimensions of well-being \u2014 namely, child mortality \u2014 has been far more evenly distributed than it has for income poverty. Mortality levels between regions and income groups are converging, and the countries with the highest levels of income poverty have registered some of the strongest improvements. Eight of the 10 countries presently contributing to most of the global burden of child mortality are MICs. This chapter is organised as follows. Section 2.1 gives an overview of performance globally, by region and by income group. Section 2.2 provides analysis at the country level, and Section 2.3 looks more closely at poverty trends within MICs. Section 2.4 addresses progress on child mortality, as representative of non-income well-being. ( 15 ) Note that the Cruz et al. estimates reflect PovcalNet.org computations. As Chapter 1 noted, these typically assume a 1990 country classification and the imputation of missing values. ",
        "13 2.1 Measuring poverty globally, by region and by country 2.1.1 Trends in global poverty ( 16 ) Between 1990 and 2012, the latest year for which reliable estimates are available, the extreme poverty headcount in the world fell by 65 %, from 37.1 % to 12.7 %, in 2011 PPP USD (Cruz et al., 2015: 2) ( 17 ). This remarkable fall meant the first MDG \u2014 which aimed to reduce by half the share of people living below the USD 1.25 a day poverty line in 2005 PPP \u2014 was met 5 years ahead of schedule ( 18 ). Over this period, the number of poor people fell by 54 %, from 1 958 million to 902 million (or by over 1 billion people) (Figure 2.1). Estimates for 2015 suggest the share of poverty fell further, to 9.6 %, that year, such that 702 million people remained extremely poor (Cruz et al., 2015: 2). Progress has been more rapid in the 2000s: the global headcount fell by 8 points between 1990 and 1999 and 16 points in the next 12 years. Figure 2.1: Extreme poverty globally (2011 PPP), 1990-2012 and projections for 2015 Source: Computed from data in Cruz et al. (2015: 2). Our estimates suggest China has contributed close to two thirds of the total reduction in world poverty (Table 2.1) ( 19 ). The country\u2019s poverty headcount ratio fell from 67 % in 1990 to 6 % in 2012 (and an estimated 4 % in 2015); its headcount fell from 756 million poor people to 87 million. Poverty reduction in India also contributed, albeit to a lesser extent (nearly 20 % of the reduction). The country\u2019s headcount ratio fell from 48 % to 19 %, from 418 million poor people in 1990 to 231 million by 2012. ( 16 ) Note that the Bank PovcalNet.org extreme poverty estimates are calculated based on the assumption that poor people are in developing countries only. Therefore, when it computes the global extreme poverty headcount, it does so assuming that all people who live outside the \u2018developing world\u2019 are non-poor. It provides separate estimates for the poverty headcount for the developing world but, since these are less well known, we cite them more sparingly, typically in footnotes. For moderate poverty (and any other estimates the user generates, in our case ultra poverty), the headcounts are presented as for the developing world alone, and so we follow this convention. ( 17 ) For the developing world (as per previous note), the estimated fall is from 44 % to 15 %. ( 18 ) http://www.worldbank.org/mdgs/poverty_hunger.html ( 19 ) Using Bank estimates of the total poverty headcount, we arrive at a figure of 64 %. Using our sample dataset of 109 countries, the figure is 67 %. ",

Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Absolute poverty reduction has been more pronounced for the USD 1.90 and USD 3.10 a day poverty lines than for the USD 1 a day line, which is relevant only to the poorest countries (Figure 2.2). World Bank statistics suggest that, according to the USD 3.10 a day poverty line, 66 % of the developing world population was poor in 1990, and this fell by nearly half (47 %) to 35 % in 2012. In contrast, fewer than 13 % of people in developing countries were ultra poor in 1990, and this share fell to 2 % in 2012 \u2014 though ultra poverty remained salient in SSA, where 16 % of the population lived below this poverty line. In other words, the share and number of people living below all three poverty lines in the developing world has fallen, particularly in the 2000s, but it remains unacceptably high, with over one in three people living in moderate poverty and more than one in 10 in extreme poverty. Figure 2.2: Moderate, extreme and ultra poverty in the developing world, 1990-2012 NB: Poverty headcounts are computed assigning each country\u2019s poverty headcount a \u2018weight\u2019 based on its share in the global population. Here, extreme poverty headcounts are provided for the developing world (see footnote 16). Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Globally, the average poverty gap relative to the extreme poverty line fell by two thirds \u2014 from 13 % to 4 %. Analysis of country-level data for the 109 countries with data in 1990 and 2012 points to a huge fall in the range of variation (Box 2.1). ",
        "15 Box 2.1: Evolution of the poverty gap at a country level Our analysis of the 109 countries with comparable data in 1990 and 2012 points to a huge fall in the poverty gap \u2014 from 17 % to 5 % \u2014 and in its variation. For example, the interquartile range, which measures the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the distribution, fell by 43 %. Evolution of the poverty gap per person across 109 developing countries, 1990-2012 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Taking the poverty headcount and gap measures in conjunction, we see that fewer people are poor than was the case previously and that, on average, people who are still poor are less poor than they have been \u2014 a finding also reflected in the World Bank\u2019s new, intuitive, \u2018person-equivalent poverty measure\u2019 (Box 2.2). However, as Ravallion (2016) cautions, the minimum survival level \u2014 as seen in our ultra poverty line \u2014 has remained unchanged since the early 1980s, although fewer people live near this level. Box 2.2: Person-equivalent poverty measures An innovative way to combine traditional measures of the poverty headcount and of the poverty gap, which is concerned with the extent to which poor people are poor, is the newly proposed \u2018person-equivalent\u2019 headcounts. These count the number of \u2018equivalent poor people\u2019 by setting a benchmark according to the initial conditions of the poor and thereafter assigning people with incomes below the poverty line a greater weight based on the depth of their poverty. For example, if a person is twice as poor as a person at the poverty line, they are counted as two person equivalents. Between 1990 and 2012, the person-equivalent poverty headcount declined by more than the traditional poverty headcount. That is, not only the number of poor people fell but also the average depth of their poverty. In 1990, the two measures were the same (by design) \u2014 at 36.8 % \u2014 but by 2012 the person-equivalent headcount was 2.2 points lower. This suggests reductions in traditional poverty rates were accompanied by even larger reductions in person-equivalent terms. This was also true of SSA, south Asia and EAP. Source: Cruz et al. (2015). 2.1.2 Shifts in the regional distribution of poverty Because the fall in poverty has been experienced unevenly, the locus of poverty has shifted between regions. World Bank estimates show that the extreme poverty rate in EAP in 1990 was over 60 %, higher than in any other region, followed by SSA (56 %) and south Asia (51 %). But over the next two decades the share and number of extremely poor people in EAP fell over 90 %, far more than reductions in either south Asia or SSA (Figure 2.3, Table 2.2). It follows that the global composition of poverty changed markedly (Figure 2.4, left panel) ( 20 ). While in 1990 just over half of extremely poor people were in EAP, this figure had fallen to 12 % in 2012, while the share in SSA had risen from 14 % to nearly 50 %. Meanwhile, the share of extremely poor people ( 20 ) Note here that, as PovcalNet.org data assume the same number of people are extremely poor in the developing world and globally, the global composition of poverty and the developing world composition are interchangeable. ",
        "16 globally had grown slightly in south Asia, from 30 % to 33 %. In 1990, extremely poor people in SSA and south Asia accounted for less than half of the global total (44 %); by 2012, they accounted for 82 %. As income growth occurred in several poor but populous countries, these transitioned from low- to middle-income status and the global composition of poverty shifted accordingly. In particular, China became a LMIC in 1999 and a UMIC in 2010, India became a LMIC in 2007 and Indonesia and Nigeria became LMICs in 2011. Partly owing to these shifts, the LMICs housed half the global poor in 2012, compared with one third in LICs, despite poverty being much lower in the former (19 % vs 43 %) (Figure 2.4, right panel). Although too late to appear in these data, the transition of Bangladesh to lower-middle-income status in 2015 will have reinforced this concentration.

The poverty gap also reflects the evident shift in the geography of poverty: not only did poverty fall most in EAP but so did its intensity (Table 2.3). In EAP, the average poor person had an income that was 22 % below the poverty line, and this had fallen to 1.5 % by 2012. In south Asia, the fall was also steep \u2014 from around 15 % to about 4 %. In SSA, by contrast, the fall was less extreme \u2014 from 25 % to 16 %. The net result was that, while EAP accounted for 51 % of the poverty gap in 1990, the share was 11 % in 2012; in south Asia, the share remained at about one quarter; and in SSA, it climbed from 18 % to 60 % of the total (Figure 2.5).

We now turn to the moderate poverty line (Table 2.4, Figures 2.6 and 2.7) and the ultra poverty line (Table 2.5, Figures 2.8 and 2.9). The comparison across the three levels of poverty \u2014 and particularly of how each is distributed globally \u2014 is illuminating. In EAP, the share of poor people fell for all three poverty lines. Notably, whereas in 1990 ultra poverty in EAP was at over half of the developing world total (54 %), by 2012 the share had fallen to under 5 %. For south Asia, the share fell by 10 points and the share of extremely poor people rose by 4 points, but the share of moderately poor people rose sizeably (by about 11 percentage points). In other words, standards of living have risen but many people remain between the extreme and moderate poverty lines and are therefore vulnerable. In SSA, in contrast, the share of poor people increased sharply for all three poverty lines \u2014 in the case of ultra poverty jumping from just under one quarter of the developing country total to nearly 80 %.

Rapid progress in the more populous countries meant that, by 2010, the share of poor people and the country average of poverty rates had converged (Figure 2.10), after which gains in more populous countries \u2014 namely, China \u2014 continued to outpace average country-level reductions. The average poverty headcount in 2012 for the 109 developing countries with data in 1990 and 2012 was 20.2 % \u2014 4.2 percentage points above the share of people who were poor (15.9 %). ",
        "21 Figure 2.10: Share of people in extreme poverty and country-average extreme poverty headcount in 109 developing countries, 1990-2012 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Comparing the 1990-2012 period with the 2000s makes clear the general improvement in poverty reduction in the latter. Our estimates suggest that, between 1990 and 2012, the poverty headcount in the developing world fell on average 1.32 percentage points each year. In the 1990s, it fell approximately 1.09 percentage points per year, and between 2000 and 2012 the rate increased to 1.61 percentage points per year. The same trend holds when we look at the fall in the poverty rate across the 109 countries (Figure 2.11). The average reduction was 1.02 percentage points yearly between 2000 and 2012 \u2014 1.5 times the rate of reduction between 1990 and 2012 (of 0.66 percentage points per year). Not only did the poverty rate fall more in the 2000s, on average, but also the range of country experiences was more positive, featuring lower increases in poverty and higher falls. Nonetheless, the 0.66 percentage point reduction across countries is under half the average yearly change measured across people (1.32 points) \u2014 again pointing to the disproportionate reductions some populous countries experienced. Figure 2.11: Absolute average change in country poverty rates, 1990s and 2000s NB: This figure shows the average change in poverty experienced by the 109 countries in our sample in the 1990s and 2000s, respectively.

        "22 Strikingly, many of the top and bottom performers in our sample had very similar poverty levels in 1990. Examination of country-level performance since then reveals a large diversity of experience. Of the 109 developing countries with data in 1990 and 2012, the extreme poverty headcount fell in all but 21, and the gains were much higher than the reversals (Figure 2.12). At one end of the spectrum, remarkable reductions are evident in many EAP countries in particular. For example, poverty fell by more than 50 percentage points in Cambodia, China and Vietnam \u2014 as it did in Bhutan, Cape Verde, Guinea and Nepal. In Vietnam, a top performer, the poverty headcount fell from 61 % to 3 % of the population (Box 2.3). In relative terms, among the 91 countries with sufficient data ( 21 ), 11 countries experienced a reduction of more than 90 %, 30 countries more than 75 % and 47 countries more than 50 %, in line with the MDG target. However, in some 14 countries (about 15 % of our sample), poverty rose at least marginally, and it rose by more than 10 points in five countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (11 points), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (14 points), Guinea-Bissau (19 points), Uzbekistan (21 points) and Madagascar (22 points). In general, countries in SSA experienced the most limited reductions. Relative rises were as high as 300 % (Uzbekistan, where the poverty headcount rose from 6.6 % to 27.1 %). Changes in the poverty gap were very closely associated with changes in the poverty headcount (Figure 2.13). The poverty gap fell most in several SSA countries between 1990 and 2012 \u2014 notably, Guinea (52 points), Swaziland (35 points), Mali (35 points), Burkina Faso (34 points), Sierra Leone (31 points) and Cape Verde (30 points).

Box 2.3: Remarkable poverty reductions in Vietnam Vietnam has exhibited one of the highest rates of economic growth and poverty reduction globally, albeit one accompanied by higher inequality. Only 20 years ago, the country was among the poorest in the world. It was emerging from decades of war, which had left a damaged infrastructure, many people dead and millions injured or displaced (Rama, 2008). However, initial conditions favoured subsequent development. These included low levels of inequality, high levels of human capital, a favourable employment structure (a small non-agricultural labour force and nascent industrialisation) and high population density (Bernab\u00e8 and Krstic, 2005). Vietnam built on this foundation with a set of well-designed and well-implemented policies. Several factors underpin this strong performance: 1. Pragmatic party leadership encouraged both internal debate and policy innovations based on a trial- and-error approach. These factors enabled the adoption and implementation of an effective set of policies, the Doi Moi policies, which were crucial to economic progress. 2. Strong (although not necessarily efficient) governing and market institutions were in place. These enabled the government to implement economic reform and to adopt and disseminate new technologies and ideas. 3. A wide-reaching network of infrastructure enabled efficient and effective implementation of economic reform policies. 4. Equitable initial investments in human development meant the populace was primed to take advantage of economic opportunities, and attracted significant foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. 5. Equitable land reform with targeted investment in agriculture and the liberalisation of trade in commodities brought significant increases in agricultural yields and rural poverty reduction. Strict regulation prevented reconsolidation of land by elites in subsequent years. Vietnam has gone from being a net importer of rice to being the second largest exporter in the world today. These reforms also led to high poverty reduction in rural areas, by diversifying rural incomes (Klump and Bonschab, 2004; Rama, 2008). Vietnam has been able to sustain its progress for two decades, thanks to the effective adoption and implementation of Doi Moi ; continued land reform; and pragmatic, careful and sequenced liberalisation. The gradual liberalisation process followed a two-track approach: protecting some sectors while liberalising others and designing measures to attract FDI into labour-intensive industries. Vietnam\u2019s story of progress challenges the orthodoxy of liberalisation, privatisation and fiscal austerity. A strong sense of social solidarity and equity also contributed to effective policy and implementation, and to continued investment in human development (albeit not benefiting all). Human capital improvements have enabled people to take advantage of market opportunities. Remaining challenges include rising inequality, environmental degradation and corruption.

        "24 We have seen that the number of people who are extremely poor in 2012 is concentrated in certain regions and income groups, as well as in particular countries. Among those people who were poor in 2012, over one quarter were in India and nearly 60 % lived in five countries: Bangladesh, China, DRC, India and Nigeria. Some 70 % of extremely poor people lived in 10 countries: in addition to the above Ethiopia, Indonesia, Madagascar, Mozambique and Tanzania (Figure 2.14). The 10 countries with the highest poverty rates, in contrast, are all in SSA (and all LICs), with poverty rates ranging from 82 % (Madagascar) to 57 % (Rwanda) (Figure 2.15). Three countries appear on both lists \u2014 that is, they have one of the highest extreme poverty rates in the world and this also translates into a very large number of poor people: DRC, Madagascar and Mozambique. It is important to note that, other than the high share of SSA countries on both lists, half of extremely poor people live in MICs \u2014 notably India, but also Bangladesh, China, Indonesia and Nigeria. For this reason, we will now examine the MIC experience more closely. Figure 2.14: Countries contributing most to global poverty, 2012 NB: Countries in orange are MICs.

        "25 2.3 Persisting poverty amid progress in middle-income countries A key feature of the shifting geography of poverty in the past two decades is that, with the graduation of many populous but poor LICs to middle-income status, up to three quarters of poor people now live in MICs (Sumner, 2012, 2016). The 84 present-day MICs are hugely diverse, as expected owing to their large number, and exhibit a wide range of poverty levels and trends ( 22 ). At a country level, the poverty headcount presently ranges from effectively zero (in several ECA countries and Samoa) to 63 % in Zambia. Between 1990 and 2012, the average poverty headcount ratio of today\u2019s MICs fell by half: from 24.8 % in 1990 to 12.1 % in 2012. Over the 1990-2012 period, poverty increased in 16 MICs (nearly 1 in 5) \u2014 notably, Uzbekistan (by 20.5 percentage points), Georgia (15.5), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (14.1), Djibouti (9.5) and Zambia (8.4) \u2014 and it declined in 68 (Figure 2.16). Breaking this into periods, in the 1990s the average change in the poverty headcount was an increase of 2.6 percentage points ( 23 ). Poverty increased in 35 countries (42 % of the sample), most severely in ECA countries including Moldova (38 points), Uzbekistan (50 points) and Tajikistan (53 points). It decreased in 48 MICs, most notably in Cape Verde (34 points), Pakistan (32 points) and Swaziland (31 points). Again, progress was faster in the 2000s, with a wider range of positive experiences. The average change was a reduction of 9 percentage points. Since 2000, poverty has increased in six MICs: Belize, Bulgaria, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Macedonia and Zambia. At the other extreme, poverty fell by more than 30 percentage points in five countries: Angola, Bhutan, Kyrgyzstan, Vietnam and Uzbekistan. Breaking down the MICs further, both the UMICs and the LMICs in our sample had similar poverty levels in 1990, but subsequent declines were far steeper in the former (Figure 2.17). In both categories, the number of poor people has declined. The share of people in UMICs in the global extreme poor has decreased markedly (Figure 2.18), reflecting the strong decline in poverty in China. In contrast, in the LICs, the poverty headcount ratio fell by some 20 percentage points but the number of poor people increased. ( 22 ) Note that Montenegro only enters our sample in 2005; therefore the trend analysis is based on 83 MICs. Annex 5 provides detailed data on poverty trends for all three poverty lines. ( 23 ) Omitting Kazakhstan, where poverty rose 48 600 % as the poverty headcount grew from 0.02 % to 9.74 %. ",

        "27 Figure 2.18: Extreme poor globally by income group, 1990-2012 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. The LMICs reduced poverty much more quickly in absolute terms between 2000 and 2012 (though less so than the LICs), whereas relative change was highest in the UMICs (Table 2.6). This points to the value of considering both measures of poverty reduction. Table 2.6: Average annual change in poverty headcount by income group, 1990-2012 Relative change (%) Absolute change (percentage points) LICs -1.14 % -0.90 MICs -1.70 % -0.60 LMICs -1.35 % -0.75 UMICs -2.09 % -0.42 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. At present, three MICs have poverty rates above the LIC average of 48 %: Zambia (62 %), Lesotho (57 %) and Nigeria (52 %). As a group, however, the MICs are distinct from the LICs in terms of their growth trajectories, a theme we revisit in Chapter 6. 2.4 Under-five mortality and links with income poverty reduction In order to analyse human development more broadly, and how trends compare with those for income poverty, we analyse progress in tackling under-five mortality. We selected this indicator for two reasons. First, it is a good proxy for human development. Second, country coverage is high, at over 160, or about 85 % of the world\u2019s countries. Since 1990, under-five mortality has fallen by more than half \u2014 from about 12.7 million child deaths annually to 5.9 million (Unicef et al., 2015) \u2014 though this falls short of the MDG target, which stipulated a global reduction of three quarters. The percentage change (54 %) is almost identical to the reduction in global extreme poverty over this period. However, in marked contrast with falls in income poverty, which, as we have seen, have been shared unevenly, progress on reducing child deaths has been experienced much more broadly. Child mortality has fallen markedly across all the world\u2019s regions. In absolute terms, the fall has been highest in SSA (by nearly 90 deaths per 1 000 live births) and in south Asia (by nearly 75 deaths). In relative terms, the fall has been slightly greater in the rest of the developing world (outside SSA and south Asia), where levels fell by about two thirds from lower starting levels. Country ",
        "28 performance has varied markedly: around a third of countries (62) have reduced child mortality in line with the MDG target of two thirds, and another 74 have cut it by a half; notably, despite their low national income levels, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania have all met the MDG target (ibid.). Levels of under-five mortality are correlated with poverty levels, but the relationship is not deterministic (Figure 2.19). In contrast with income poverty, on which country experiences converged only slightly, convergence is more distinct for child mortality (Figure 2.20). Whereas in 1990, for example, the gap between SSA, the region with the highest mortality, and the rest of the developing world was in excess of 100 deaths per 1 000 live births, by 2013 it had fallen to around half that amount (Figure 2.21, left panel). The same trend of convergence holds when examining LICs relative to LMICs and UMICs (Figure 2.21, right panel). For each of these groups the average country\u2019s child mortality fell by 50 %, but this involved an absolute reduction of 99 deaths per 1 000 live births on average for LICs, 46 for LMICs and 26 for UMICS.

(2015). As this pattern suggests, poorer countries have experienced larger absolute drops in mortality than richer countries (Figure 2.22). This appears unremarkable, given that initial levels of child mortality were much higher in countries with higher poverty shares. But, even after controlling for initial child mortality levels, this finding holds. Rodriguez- Takeuchi and Samman (2015) argue that an S-shaped curve characterises patterns of mortality reduction since 1990, whereby change was hardest to register for countries at the highest and lowest levels of the distribution \u2014 and the largest amount of progress took place in countries between the 75th and the 95th percentiles. In other words, countries with relatively high levels of child mortality initially \u2014 which were also among the poorest \u2014 achieved the greatest progress. Figure 2.22: Poverty headcount in 1990 and change in child mortality 1990-2012 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database and Unicef et al. (2015). Kenny explains this divergence between progress on reducing poverty and that on child mortality by distinguishing drivers of progress in income growth and measures of \u2018quality ",
        "30 of life\u2019, including health and education (Kenny, 2011). He suggests that, while the former depends on national institutional change, which requires \u2018a long-term and context- specific path of improvement\u2019 (p. 3), the latter has been driven largely by exogenous factors \u2014 namely, the diffusion of technologies (e.g. oral rehydration, vaccination, antibiotics, all relatively cheap) and the spread and uptake of new ideas. He illustrates this pattern by modelling country-level change in mortality relative to initial levels of mortality and global rates of change between 1950 and 2000, and finds that these two factors explain around 85 % of the change that occurred. The analysis does not imply a limited role for national governments, but rather suggests a focus on areas such as subsidies and extensions for new technology, conditional cash transfers to bolster their reach and social marketing, to promote demand. Concerted international action and cooperation are also essential (UNDP, 2010). As it stands, the highest child mortality rate is currently 167 deaths per 1 000 live births (Angola), and 12 countries have a rate of over 100 deaths per 1 000 live births (Figure 2.23). However, the global burden of child deaths is concentrated in a small number of countries \u2014 two thirds take place in 10 countries alone (Figure 2.24). More than one in five child deaths globally occur in India, and more than half of child deaths take place in just four countries \u2014 India, Nigeria, China and Pakistan. Angola, DRC and Nigeria stand out both for their high rate of mortality and for the large number of resulting child deaths. Notably, Angola, with the highest mortality rate, is a UMIC, and all but two of the 10 countries that contribute most to the remaining burden of child mortality are MICs.

        "32 CHAPTER 3: The geography of poverty \u2014 SSA, ACP and countries facing special circumstances This chapter seeks to identify which country categories are associated with progress on poverty or a lack thereof \u2014 namely, the extent to which geography and different types of \u2018special status\u2019 matter. SSA is presently the region with the highest extreme poverty, while the ACP countries are of special interest to the EU. A number of countries have been classified according to the special circumstances they face, linked to a structural constraint, which typically confers certain entitlements \u2014 for example being an LDC, a FCAS or landlocked. We profile each of these groups and examine the extent to which geography and special status are linked to progress and whether and how belonging to more than one of these groups matters. The analysis shows that, while having more than one such designation is associated with higher income poverty levels and a lower rate of poverty reduction, and multiple designations tend to amplify this effect, there are many exceptions. In other words, adverse geography and structural constraints can impede progress, on average, but are not deterministic. The following may be noted in particular. \u2022 The effect of multiple geographic/special status designations . Having multiple geographic/special status designations is typically associated with higher poverty levels and a lower rate of reduction \u2014 but this does not hold true uniformly. Belize, for example, has no special status, yet its poverty headcount has increased since 2000. In contrast, Chad and Uganda are located in SSA and are landlocked FCAS as well as LDCs \u2014 and yet they have registered a strong performance. \u2022 Profiles of SSA, ACP and special status countries . Profiles highlight aspects of these groups\u2019 common and unique experiences in tackling poverty. Key issues are the increase in the number of extremely poor people over the 1990-2012 period and in their share of global poverty. More and less successful countries in each case are highlighted. \u2022 Non-income aspects . Child mortality has fallen disproportionately in special status countries, in marked contrast with their performance on income poverty, such that they account for a relatively lower share of the global mortality burden compared with the rest of the world. This chapter is organised as follows. Section 3.1 examines the extent to which country performance in poverty reduction overlaps with geography and with belonging to one or more special status categories. Section 3.2 provides profiles of poverty levels and trends in SSA, the ACP countries and the special status groups. Section 3.3 discusses how they compare with one another. Section 3.4 examines the performance of special status groups with respect to child mortality. Annexes 6, 7 and 8 provide additional information with respect to this chapter. Annex 6 contains data on the number of poor people in SSA for the 1990s and 2000s, by country, for 41 countries of the region. Annex 7 provides data on extreme, ultra and moderate poverty for each country category discussed in this chapter. Annex 8 provides the contribution of each country in each category to the change in poverty that each category experienced over the 1990-2012 period. ",
        "33 3.1 Geography, \u2018special status\u2019 and country performance We open by considering the effects for a country of having multiple geographic/special status designations \u2014 being in SSA and an LDC, a FCAS and/or a landlocked country. We do not include being an ACP country (since this category is largely made up of countries in SSA). Our analysis suggests the trend is not straightforward: countries with no designations and those with all four designations were the best performers. Notably, the group of countries with all four designations had the highest share of countries registering above-mean absolute and relative growth over the two-decade period, and no countries that regressed. In countries with zero or one such designation, 1990 poverty levels were 47 % and 35 %, respectively; these shares had fallen to around 10 % by 2012 (Figure 3.1). In the countries with two to four designations, in contrast, initial poverty rates were between 57 % and 69 % and reductions were slower, such that by 2012 between 38 % and 50 % of the population remained poor. However, notably among the eight countries with all four designations \u2014 Burundi, Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Rwanda and Uganda \u2014 the initial poverty level was higher than for any other constraint category, at 69 %, but the 2012 poverty level was lower than for countries with either two or three designations. At a country level, experiences are diverse (Figure 3.2). Belize, for example, has no special status, yet its poverty headcount has increased since 2000. Certain SSA countries in contrast \u2014 notably Chad and Uganda \u2014 are also landlocked FCAS as well as LDCs \u2014 and yet they have been strong performers.

Meanwhile, the share of poor people in countries with two or more designations increased as a share of global extreme poverty. The increase was most notable for those countries with two designations, which included Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania. ",

Having shown a general but non-deterministic association between the number of geographic/special status designations a country has and poverty levels and trends, we now go on to explore trajectories for SSA, ACP and each special status group in turn for the 1990s and 2000s. 3.2 Mapping poverty and progress in SSA, ACP and \u2018special status\u2019 countries 3.2.1 Sub-Saharan Africa The previous chapter gave an overview of the changes that have taken place in SSA as a region. Here, we focus in more depth on changes at a country level. Persisting poverty in SSA is a particular cause for concern, given the slow reduction of the region\u2019s poverty headcount ratio coupled with a sharp increase in the number of poor people in the region over the period. By 1999, the share of poor people living in SSA (58 %) was slightly higher than it had been in 1990 (56 %), such that the 1990s represented yet another \u2018lost decade\u2019 for the region (Figure 3.4). The poverty headcount proceeded to fall by 14 points in the succeeding decade, owing principally to reductions in Ethiopia, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. The distribution of changes at a country level is also revealing (Figure 3.5). In the 1990s poverty fell in 25 of the 41 countries of the region with available data, and in the 2000s it did so in 34 of these countries. The average change across countries was -6 percentage points between 1990 and 2002 and -10 points between 2002 and 2011. However, the distribution was much more compressed in the second period, meaning there were far fewer extreme rises (or falls). While in the first period the extremes were an increase of 27 percentage points (DRC) and a decline of 40 points (Cape Verde), in the second the range was between a rise of 12 points (Zambia) and a fall of 32 points (Angola, Chad). There were far fewer very poor performances in the 2000s, and some countries registered stellar progress, including (at very different income levels) Ethiopia (Box 3.1), Ghana and Guinea (Figure 3.6).

        "37 people rise but also the share of poor people in SSA in global poverty increased (and this holds true according to all three poverty lines) (Figure 3.7). Within the region, the number of extremely poor people rose in 29 (70 %) of the 41 countries with data in both 1990 and 2012 (Figure 3.8). Of these 29 countries, in nine a rise in the number of extremely poor people in the 1990s was at least somewhat offset by a decline in the 2000s, but in 20 of the 29 countries the number of poor people grew in both decades. In 12 countries, the number of poor people declined overall from 1990 to 2012: in seven countries, the number of poor people declined in both periods; in four countries, the number of poor grew in the 1990s but was offset by greater decreases in number of poor in the 2000s; and in Swaziland, the number of poor declined in the 1990s and rose in the 2000s. The largest rises over the two-decade period were in Nigeria (which accounted for 37 % of the increase), DRC (which accounted for 27 %) and Madagascar (which accounted for 11 %) (Figure 3.9).

Finally, the poverty gap \u2014 which measures how far poor people are from the poverty line \u2014 declined in the region by around a half between 1990 and 2012 (from 27 to 15). In the rest of the world it fell nearly threefold (from 8 % to 3 %). Box 3.1: Progress and poverty reduction in Ethiopia Ethiopia registered one of the largest absolute declines in extreme poverty in SSA in the MDG period \u2014 from a 63 % headcount in 1995 to 37 % in 2011 (World Bank, 2014). Moreover, access to primary education more than tripled, going from 26 % gross enrolment in 1994/1995 to 95 % in 2012/2013. Secondary enrolment reached 34 % in 2013; in fact, Ethiopia is approaching the SSA average, despite its very low starting point. The country has also experienced one of the most marked declines in the intensity of multidimensional poverty among countries for which longitudinal data are available (Alkire and Roche, 2013). Also striking is that, while income inequality has increased in many countries over the past decade, Ethiopia\u2019s has remained low \u2014 in fact the Gini has declined since 1995. All this has happened while Ethiopia\u2019s economy has grown at an average of 11 % over the past 10 years \u2014 not only the fastest growth rate in SSA but also among the highest worldwide. Concerns over authoritarianism and civil liberties notwithstanding, Ethiopia\u2019s successful performance since the mid-1990s has followed a period of social and political stabilisation. Key ingredients of its success include a focus on agriculture-led development, social protection and universal education. Moreover, Ethiopia\u2019s development planning has consistently recognised the need for a multidimensional approach to policy formulation and implementation, and poverty reduction has been at the core of government policy. Many countries claim such synergies in their planning processes but few implement them successfully. High and sustained economic growth, particularly in agriculture A focus on agriculture-led development has been integral to Ethiopia\u2019s recent development strategy, notably the agricultural development-led industrialisation programme, initiated in 2005 together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The level of Ethiopian investment in agriculture has been notable. Government spending on agriculture in SSA as a whole has declined since 1990, from 5.9 % of GDP to 2.7 % in 2013. In 2003, African governments signed the Maputo Declaration, agreeing to allocate at least 10 % of national budgetary resources to agriculture and rural development within 5 years. Ethiopia is among the seven countries that have exceeded the target in most years (Benin and Yu, 2012), having consistently allocated over 15 % of total national expenditure to agriculture. ",
        "40 Government policy has targeted agricultural productivity while facilitating the flow of benefits towards poor people. A key pillar has been construction of rural roads to allow farmers to access markets. The country\u2019s road density increased from 29 km to 44.5 km per 1 000 km 2 between 2000/2001 and 2009/2010 and the average time to reach an all-weather road reduced from about 7 hours in 2000-2001 to 3.7 hours (IFAD, 2015). Ethiopia is a top recipient of aid for infrastructure, but the government has also invested heavily from its own resources (FDRE, 2015). The government has focused too on developing agricultural extension and advice. Between 2004/2005 and 2009/2010, nearly 62 000 extension workers were trained and some 9 300 farmer training centres were established (GRIPS Development Forum, 2011). Because, again, the Ethiopian government has heavily invested its own resources, it has maintained a great deal of independence over its agricultural extension programmes. Most other African countries saw their extension programmes retreat under market liberalisation (Berhanu and Poulton, 2014). Social protection Ethiopia\u2019s productive safety net programme is the largest social protection programme in SSA and a key driver of poverty reduction. Introduced in 2005 as a response to the inefficient use of food aid, the programme provides unconditional, predictable transfers (in cash or food) to poor rural families during periods of food deficit and requires able-bodied adults to participate in communal productive activities, for example rehabilitating land and water resources and developing community infrastructure. In 2010, roughly 1.5 million households participated (approximately 10 % of the country\u2019s population). The programme is mainly donor funded and its budget represents 1.2 % of Ethiopia\u2019s GDP (Lieuw-Kie Song, 2011). The public works component has reduced unemployment and tightened labour markets by creating numerous job opportunities (which pay selected beneficiaries USD 0.75 a day), with an estimated 1.2 million workers employed annually (ibid.). A recent study by the World Bank (2014b) estimated that transfers had reduced poverty by 7 % since 2005. By increasing agricultural input use, the programme also improved agricultural productivity in rural areas and so contributed to reducing poverty and inequality. The universalisation of primary education has been hard-wired into every national development plan since 1995. Unlike in many other countries, the expansion of education has not been a siloed initiative, in competition with other resource and planning priorities. Instead, it has always been seen as a vital, time- bound and protected component of the headline strategy of agriculture-led development. Indeed, research has shown that farms in Ethiopia with educated household members achieve higher yields, opt for a higher- value crop mix and are more likely to adopt improved soil and water conservation practices and to take up value-adding rural service activities alongside farming (Weir, 2000). Working from an extremely low base towards the goal of achieving 100 % net primary enrolment meant that new or expanded schools had to be built in virtually every village cluster ( kebele ). Just over 19 000 primary schools were built in two decades from 1992 to 2012 and the number of secondary schools, although slower to expand, grew more than five times over that same period (EFME, 2000, 2013). Source: Lenhardt et al. (2015). 3.2.2 Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries The ACP countries are of particular interest to the EU. Unsurprisingly, given that most of countries in this grouping are African (especially those for which data are available), trends for this group closely reflect those for SSA. Data are available for 56 of the 79 ACP countries \u2014 42 of 48 (88 %) in SSA, seven of 16 in the Caribbean (44 %) and seven of 15 (47 %) in the Pacific. Some 71 % of ACP countries are represented as a whole, but by sub-region it is only for SSA that this sample represents more than 50 % of countries. Levels of poverty in these ACP countries in 1990 were only slightly higher than those in non-ACP countries \u2014 with poverty headcounts of 55 % and 47 %, respectively. Over the following two decades, progress for people in ACP countries was slower than for those in the rest of the developing world and the gap in poverty levels widened (Figure 3.10). Poverty reduction in ACP countries was lower than that in the rest of the developing world, in both absolute terms (the falls were 13 points and 37 points, respectively) and relative terms (the falls were 25 % and 77 %, respectively). The number of poor people in the ACP countries grew 38 % between 1990 and 2012, or by 103 million people; it also grew slightly in the 2000s (4 %). As a result, the share of the ACP population in developing world poverty grew from 15 % to 44 % (Figure 3.11). ",

Figure 3.11: Share of poor people in ACP countries in developing world poverty, 1990-2012 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. At the country level, progress was made in the second decade of the 1990-2012 period (Figure 3.12). For the 56 countries for which data are available, poverty increased in over 22 countries (34 %) in the 1990s, and it did so in eight (14 %) in the 2000s. At the tail ends of the distribution, in the 1990s, poverty decreased in Guinea by 35 percentage points and it increased in DRC by 35 percentage points. In the 2000s, poverty decreased in Angola and in Chad by 32 percentage points while it increased in Zambia by 12 percentage points. In relative terms too, the situation improved: in the 1990s, the median relative change was -9 %, whereas in the 2000s it was -21 %. ",

Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. African countries were both the top and the bottom performers in ACP (Figure 3.13). ACP countries that performed particularly well include Cape Verde and Guinea, which reduced the percentage of poor people by over 50 percentage points ( 24 ). Ghana and Sudan, in turn, reduced the number of people living in poverty by 48 and 32 percentage points, respectively. On the other hand, the percentage of people living in poverty increased by 14 percentage points in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and by 19 points in Guinea-Bissau. The number of people living in poverty fell most in Ghana (5.7 million) and in Sudan (4.3 million). Conversely, DRC and Nigeria added a respective 28 million and 38 million people in poverty. Outside of SSA, the strongest ACP performer is Timor-Leste, which reduced its poverty headcount by around 40 percentage points, and the Dominican Republic, which eliminated extreme poverty (with a 2012 headcount of 2.9 %). And while only SSA ACP countries increased their poverty headcount, the number of poor people increased in some non-SSA ACP countries \u2014 as in Haiti, where the poverty headcount ratio fell between 1990 and 2012 (from 60 % to 55 %) but the number of poor people rose by over 1.2 million. Ghana and Ethiopia were the countries that contributed the most to reductions in poverty in the ACP group between 1990 and 2012, but their contribution was offset by increases in DRC, Madagascar and Nigeria. Finally, the poverty gap in ACP countries fell significantly, from 23 % to 13 %, but for non-ACP countries the fall was from 7.1 % to 1.5 %. ( 24 ) Note that the poverty data for Cape Verde underwent a substantial upward revision for the 1990s in 2016 (although it is one of the five countries for which 2005 PPP estimates were preserved). For example, the 1990 estimated headcount was revised from 19.8 % to 68.6 %. ",

Our sample includes 39 of the 48 LDC countries. On average, poverty was lower and the percentage reduction was more acute in less populous countries. Some populous countries, such as DRC and Madagascar, performed particularly poorly. Meanwhile, in non-LDCs the fall was from 46 % to 12 % \u2014 signifying a divergence in poverty trajectories between LDCs and the rest of the world. The number of poor people in these LDCs climbed from 281 million to 310 million, and their share in developing world poverty climbed too, from 15.3 % to 36.5 % (Figure 3.15).

The distribution of changes across decades at the country level is telling. Some 38 % of countries (of the 39 for which data are available) increased poverty in the 1990s, compared with only 17 % in the 2000s (Figure 3.16). The median change in the 1990s was -10 %, compared with -22 % in the 2000s. The distribution also shifted \u2014 with higher reductions and lower increases in poverty in the 2000s. At the extremes, in the 1990s Guinea reduced poverty by 35 percentage points, whereas DRC increased poverty by 27 percentage points. In the 2000s, Nepal decreased poverty by 40 percentage points, and Zambia was the most extreme of the five countries that increased poverty: its extreme poverty headcount climbed by 12 percentage points. Figure 3.16: Absolute reduction in poverty in LDCs, 1990s and 2000s Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Particularly strong performers in the LDC group were Bhutan, Cambodia and Nepal \u2014 all of which reduced poverty by nearly 60 percentage points between 1990 and 2012. At the other end of the spectrum, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar and Zambia were all poor performers (Figure 3.17). Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal made the strongest positive contribution to the overall change in poverty in the LDCs; DRC and Madagascar made the biggest negative contributions. ",
        "45 Figure 3.17: Poverty headcount in LDCs, 1990 and 2012 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Finally, the poverty gap among these countries fell by nearly half \u2014 from 28 % to 16 % \u2014 whereas for non-LDCs it reduced from 8.4 % to 3 %. 3.2.4 Fragile and conflict-affected states The share of extremely poor people in the 32 of the 45 FCAS with data has fallen by 22 percentage points since 1990, from just over half (56 %) to 34 %. However, the 2012 level of 34 % was three times higher than the share of poor people living outside FCAS (Figure 3.18). The absolute number of extremely poor people in these FCAS increased by 3 % to 352 million over the period, though in the 2000s the share of the global extreme poor living in FCAS fell by 10 %. This stands in contrast with sharp declines for all poverty lines in non-FCAS. It follows that the share of poor people living in FCAS as a share of the total extreme poor increased over time, from just under a fifth of the global total of extremely poor (19 %) to 41 % (Figure 3.19).

Among the FCAS, country performance was extremely diverse. Pakistan, Nepal and Guinea, among others, registered large drops in poverty, whereas rises were especially prevalent in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau and Madagascar (Figure 3.21). Pakistan, along with Bangladesh and Nepal, are the strongest positive contributors to the overall poverty change for FCAS; the strongest negative contributors were again DRC, Madagascar and Nigeria.

The number of poor people in the 29 of the 31 LLDCs with data rose from 112 million to 120 million \u2014 and the share of LLDC poverty in total developing world poverty went up from 6 % to 14 % (Figure 3.23).

        "48 Figure 3.23: Share of poor people in LLDCs in developing world poverty, 1990-2012 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. At the country level (Figure 3.24), the poverty trend largely changed direction between the 1990s and 2000s in the LLDCs. In the 1990s, the median absolute change was an increase of 1 percentage point, whereas in the 2000s it was a decrease of 15 percentage points. The range of variation also decreased across the two periods, with extremes on both ends becoming smaller and closer together. In the first period, at one extreme, Tajikistan increased its poverty headcount by 53 percentage points, whereas in Swaziland poverty fell by 31 percentage points. In the second period, the poverty headcount increased by 12 percentage points in Zambia and in Nepal it fell by 40 points. Figure 3.24: Absolute annual change in poverty headcounts in LLDCs, 1990s and 2000s Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. At a country level, changes are marked, with Bhutan, Nepal, Turkmenistan and Uganda performing particularly well (Figure 3.26). The top positive contributors in this group to the changes that occurred were Ethiopia, Nepal and Turkmenistan. The top negative contributors were Malawi, Uzbekistan and Zambia. ",

Several similarities are apparent \u2014 in terms of rates of reduction of poverty relative to the rest of the developing world; increases in the share of poor people in global extreme poverty; and rises in the number of poor people in SSA/ACP and special status countries. In addition, there are both similarities and differences in terms of which countries have contributed the most to the changes that have occurred for each category. We discuss each of these points in turn. First, between 1990 and 2012 the share of people living in extreme poverty in all the geographic and special status categories that we cover here fell by about 19 percentage points, compared with over 30 percentage points for the developing world as a whole. For moderate poverty too, the average fall of 13 percentage points for the categories covered was outstripped by the reduction of 34 percentage points in the developing world. In contrast, for ultra poverty, changes were about the same \u2014 at 11 percentage points and 12 percentage points, respectively. In other words, SSA, ACP and the special status groups reduced ultra poverty at the same rate as the developing world as a whole. ",
        "50 Figure 3.26: Absolute falls in poverty recorded by special status countries, 1990-2012 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Another way of looking at these changes is in terms of the share of the population who are poor in each category and in terms of relative change. Here, too, poverty fell for all groups but percentage falls were lower for the special status categories and SSA/ACP relative to the rest of the developing world (Figure 3.27). We also see that the reductions in extreme poverty were unequally distributed and certain categories of countries benefited much less than others. Figure 3.27: Percentage fall in poverty in special status countries and rest of developing world Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Second, it follows from this that the share of poor people remains disproportionately concentrated in SSA/ACP and special status countries, and that this share increased over the period. Poor people in SSA and ACP countries and FCAS each accounted for over 40 % of the share of those in poverty globally in 2012. People in SSA and ACP countries ",
        "51 have tripled their share of poverty over a two-decade period, and people in all special status categories have doubled their share in global poverty since 1990. Third, the number of poor people in each of these geographic or special status categories increased between 1990 and 2011 but since 2000 the changes have been more muted (Figure 3.28). In fact, in the 2000s, in three groups \u2014 FCAS, LLDCs and LDCs \u2014 the number of people living in poverty decreased. Nonetheless, the number of people living in poverty was higher in 2012 than in 1990, for every category. Figure 3.28: Change in people living in poverty in SSA/ACP and special status groups, 1990-2012 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Finally, some countries emerge as consistently strong contributors to the change in poverty across groups \u2014 both positively and negatively. For example, Ethiopia is among the top five positive contributors in every special status category (and in ACP/SSA). DRC, Madagascar and Nigeria are among the strongest negative contributors in many categories. Annex 8 provides much more detail on this point. 3.4 A broader perspective on well-being through under-five mortality The previous chapter showed a process of convergence with respect to the U5MR: it has improved globally and in all regions, and in the poorest countries it has improved the most. Here, we continue this analysis to show that the improvement has extended to ACP/SSA and all \u2018special status\u2019 groups. Both the absolute reduction in the rate of deaths and the percentage reduction have been higher for the average country in these groups than for the rest of the developing world. As a result, child mortality rates between these groups and other countries have converged (Figure 3.29). The sharper decline for special status groups when the mortality rates are weighted to reflect the experiences of the average person (rather than the average country) indicates that improvements have been even stronger in more populous countries. In Bangladesh and Ethiopia, two of the most populous special status countries, child mortality fell by more than half over the two-decade period, with rates falling in each case by over 100 deaths per 1 000 live births. Again, this strong progress \u2014 and the juxtaposition with progress on poverty reduction \u2014 reinforces the point that patterns of progress in the reduction of child mortality \u2014 and, ",
        "52 by extension, other improvements in health and in education \u2014 have been far more equitable than for income poverty. As Chapter 2 discussed, this reflects a different set of underlying mechanisms based on the sharing of technology and of knowledge between countries.

        "53 CHAPTER 4: The changing geography of inequality This chapter aims to provide a detailed overview of levels and trends in income inequality among and within developing countries from 1990 on. It brings together existing and new analytical work to show how income inequalities are evolving at different spatial scales \u2014 among people in the world, between countries and regions and within countries. It also examines trends in \u2018special status\u2019 countries relative to the rest of the developing world and how inequalities evolve as countries transition between income groups. Finally, it considers the evolution of inequalities in educational attainment, a critical non-income dimension of well-being, and how these relate to inequalities in income. The analysis points to the following patterns. \u2022 At a global level . Global inequality is at a high but may have decreased modestly in the past two decades, primarily because of rising incomes in China (and to a much lesser extent India). \u2022 At a regional level . Inequality has risen in EAP over the past two to three decades, largely because of unequal income growth within China, and it has been fairly constant in SSA, if we exclude South Africa. Since about 2000, inequality has also risen in south Asia, but from a much lower base, whereas in LAC it has declined, owing to falling within-country inequality. \u2022 Within countries . Aggregate within-country inequalities have risen steadily. This is largely an artefact of the experiences of China. More disaggregated examination of the 2000s shows inequality has fallen in more countries than it has risen in. However, absolute inequality \u2014 the size of the gap between rich and poor \u2014 has risen in all countries. o Income group transitions . Inequalities appear to rise somewhat as countries transition to higher income groups, but there is little connection between levels of income and inequality (Hoy et al., 2016). o By special status and geography . Aggregate within-country income inequality was lower in FCAS and LLDCs than in the developing world overall but the differences were small and there is pronounced variation within each category. The average change among these special status groups was a slight decrease \u2014 and inequality declined in more countries than it rose in. For the ACP countries and for SSA, average initial inequality across countries is higher in both these categories and the gap with the rest of the world rose over time. \u2022 Non-income aspects . In contrast with trends in income inequality, inequalities in education have declined in all countries on average. They have fallen in FCAS, LDCs and LMICs but remain higher in these groups than in other developing countries. In contrast, they were lower in UMICs in 1990 and declined sharply over the period. 4.1 Inequality globally and by region 4.1.1 Why inequality matters? High inequality conditions who benefits from economic growth and to what extent (Edward and Sumner, 2014a). It matters both because of basic intrinsic concerns over fairness and because of its linkages to many other aspects of well-being. Globally, it is estimated that, between 1981 and 2005, while economic growth lifted hundreds of ",
        "54 millions of people out of poverty, increases in inequality meant nearly 600 million people who otherwise would have escaped poverty were denied that chance (Hillebrand, 2009:7). As distinct from poverty, inequality is a property of groups rather than individuals, so the group within which it is measured assumes great importance. Milanovic (2013) has argued that, as the global economy has become more integrated, the distribution of income among the world\u2019s people has come to matter increasingly, because of greater cross-border movement and the influence of global standards on people\u2019s perceptions of their situation and their aspirations. It also has a bearing on the type of global redistribution that is feasible and the impact this would have. For example, given high global inequality, it is estimated that very limited redistribution could effectively eliminate moderate and extreme poverty (Edward and Sumner, 2014a; Ortiz and Cummins, 2011). At the level of countries, higher inequality has been linked with lower economic growth, higher poverty, poorer educational and health outcomes and an increased likelihood of crime and conflict (see Melamed and Samman, 2013). Part of the reason is the pernicious political economy that results when economic benefits are concentrated in elite groups, a situation that can lead to society paying high economic and social costs (World Bank, 2006). 4.1.2 Trends in global inequality Prior to the 1980s, the global distribution of income was best characterised by a twin- peaked distribution reflecting a clear divide between rich and poor countries, as typified in Figure 4.1 (upper panel). Changes wrought by global integration over the past three decades have eroded this distinction, pointing to the growth of a global \u2018middle class\u2019, driven principally by rising incomes in China (and to a lesser extent India) (Figure 4.1, lower panel).

Lower panel: Lakner and Milanovic (2015: 16). Measures of global inequality seek to capture how inequality is changing among people globally by assessing the joint effects of changes in distributions within countries (whether, on balance, countries are becoming more or less unequal) with changes between them (how average incomes within countries are changing relative to one another) ( 25 ). Assessing the former requires detailed analysis of household surveys that characterise income distribution within countries, whereas the latter can be computed on the basis of measures of mean income derived either from surveys or from national accounts data. Given the stringent data requirements, rigorous assessments of global inequality are available only from the mid-1980s onward, though there have been some attempts to assess earlier trends on the basis of national accounts data coupled with less systematic evidence on income distributions ( 26 ). Several studies have sought to trace the ( 25 ) According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) (2008), \u2018Household budget surveys are used to measure income shares to calculate a precise image of within-country inequality. Then, each income share is weighted by the GDP per capita of the country considered in order to calculate the mean income for each income class\u2019 (footnote 11, p. 82, cited in www.thebrokeronline.eu/Articles/Putting-inequality-on- the-map/Measuring-inequality-different-methods-different-outcomes).

        "56 evolution of between- and within-country inequality over the past two to three decades and to assess the net effect of these trends ( 27 ). While they differ over the details, there seems to be broad consensus around the following points. \u2022 Within-country inequalities have risen since the mid- to late 1980s ( 28 ). \u2022 Between-country inequality has declined, particularly since the mid-2000s. \u2022 Taking these two tendencies together, most analysts concur that global inequality has fallen modestly (at least over the past few years) because the second tendency (the drop in between-country inequality) is much stronger than the first. For example, Milanovic (2015) estimates a fall of the global Gini coefficient from 0.72 in the 1990s to 0.69/0.70 in 2008 and 0.67 in 2011. These key messages come with two caveats. The first is that trends over the past 20-30 years are driven predominantly by rising incomes in China. If China is excluded from calculations, aggregate within-country inequality is \u2018remarkably constant \u2014 as some countries have become less equal, others have become more so\u2019, whereas between- country inequality has risen slightly (Edward and Sumner, 2014b; Figure 4.2). The second caveat: these estimates do not account adequately for the incomes of top earners (or money held in tax havens) \u2014 and, where these incomes are estimated, their inclusion may erode most of the seeming decline in inequality (Anand and Segal, 2015; Milanovic, 2015). Figure 4.2: Global Gini coefficient and within- and between-country components, 1980-2010, with and without China Global Gini coefficient, survey means (not filled) World excl. China, Gini coefficient, survey means (not filled) Source: Edward and Sumner (2014b, Figures 1 and 7, respectively). What difference do the new 2011 PPP exchange rates make to global inequality estimates? The short answer is that they do not change them much. According to Edward and Sumner (2015), who conduct the first systematic comparison of their effects on 1870 (the industrial revolution) through to around 2000. Goda (2013) provides a range of historical estimates. ( 27 ) See, for example, Ravallion and Chen (2012), Milanovic (2012, 2013), Edward and Sumner (2014b) and Lakner and Milanovic (2015). ( 28 ) According to Ravallion and Chen (2012), \u2018The within country component accounted for less than one third of inequality in the developing world as a whole in 1981, but almost half in 2008\u2019 (p. 2). Milanovic (2013), in contrast, asserts that the within-country component fell from around 66 % (around 1870, the time of the industrial revolution) to around 33 % circa 2000 \u2014 \u2018this points to the \u2018overwhelming importance of location, or citizenship (which is the same) \u2014 i.e. being a member of a rich or poor country \u2014 for our lifetime incomes\u2019 (p. 205). The analysis of Edward and Sumner (2014b) is broadly consistent with Ravallion and Chen\u2019s. However, they all concur that the between-country component of inequality has more recently declined. ",
        "57 global inequality measures, \u2018the choice of PPPs used makes some difference but not a great deal. The levels of global inequality are high and trends without China show global inequality is barely falling between 1990 and 2012 whether 2005 PPP or 2011 PPPs are used\u2019 (p. 25). More specifically, within-country estimates (which do not rely on international comparators) are unaffected; between-country estimates fell slightly owing to aggregate consumption rises in many developing countries; and resulting global estimates also were slightly lower (Figure 4.3). For example, Edward and Sumner (2015) estimate a global Gini of 0.61 for 2012 using 2011 PPP, compared with 0.65 using 2005 PPP. If China is excluded, the respective figures are 0.63 and 0.68 ( 29 ). Figure 4.3: Global Gini coefficient using 2005 and 2011 PPP conversions Source: Edward and Sumner (2015: 25). Milanovic illustrates how between-country and global inequality have evolved in recent decades \u2014 as well as how China (and to a lesser extent India) are driving the observed patterns. As Figure 4.4 shows, Milanovic (2012) compares the Gini coefficient computed for countries\u2019 mean incomes (i.e. between-country inequality), assigning each country an equal weight in the total (Concept 1), with a Gini that is \u2018weighted\u2019 for countries\u2019 respective populations (Concept 2). This latter Gini reflects the disproportionate size of China and India relative to the rest of the world and therefore accounts for the vast income growth they have experienced. He also measures inequality among the world\u2019s people using pooled household survey incomes from the mid-1980s onward (Concept 3), estimating a Gini of around 0.7, far higher than within any country, and \u2018almost certainly the highest level of relative, and certainly absolute, global inequality at any point in global history\u2019 ( 30 ). Encouragingly, however, he notes a fall of 1.4 points between 2002 and 2008 and suggests this could signal the beginning of a reduction in global inequality, if income growth in emerging market economies continues to outpace that of richer countries and within-country inequalities are kept in check. ( 29 ) Milanovic (2015) similarly reports a decline of 3 points in computing the Gini using 2011 PPP data. ( 30 ) He cautions too that this is likely to be a lower-bounds estimate, given the lack of data from many of the poorest countries and the underreporting of top incomes within households. ",
        "58 Figure 4.4: Inequality among countries and among people globally, 1952-2011 Source: Milanovic (2013: 200, Figure 2). Milanovic\u2019s work also gives insights into the dynamics underlying the observed shifts. He shows that, from 1988 to 2008, the world\u2019s richest 1 % and middle classes in the emerging economies were the main \u2018winners\u2019 (to use his terminology) in the global income distribution. The real incomes of the top 1 % (which consists primarily of individuals in western Europe, northern America and Japan) increased by around 60 %, while at the median the increase was 80 % (reflecting rises in incomes in Brazil, China, Egypt, India and Indonesia). The main \u2018losers\u2019 have been the bottom 5 % of the global population, whose real incomes have remained static, and those between the 75th and 90th percentiles, whose real income gains have stagnated (at least in the 1990s) ( 31 ) \u2014 including many in transition and LAC countries and some in rich countries (Figure 4.5). The bottom third of the global income distribution (excepting the bottom 5 %) have experienced significant gains (of between 40 % and 70 %), as reflected in the fall in extreme poverty. Milanovic (2012) describes this shift as \u2018probably the profoundest global reshuffle of people\u2019s economic positions since the Industrial Revolution\u2019 (p.13). Figure 4.5: Shifts in the global distribution of income, 1988-2008 Source: Milanovic (2013: 202, Figure 4). ( 31 ) Edward and Sumner (2015: 24) argue they may have recovered somewhat in the 2000s. ",
        "59 In a recent analysis, Anand and Segal (2015) supplement analysis of household surveys (drawing on Milanovic\u2019s dataset of household survey incomes through 2005) with \u2018newly available estimates of top income shares derived from tax data in a range of countries\u2019 (p. 939). Once they append new and imputed data on top incomes, they report that \u2018inequality is higher, and there is some indication of an increase in global inequality\u2019, which appears to be driven by a concentration of wealth in the top percentile. They report a Gini of 0.722 and.735 (compared with Lakner and Milanovic\u2019s (2013) estimate of 0.715 for 2003 and 0.705 for 2008). They find that, between 1998 and 2005, the income share of the top percentile of the world rose from 17.3 % to 20.7 %. This is echoed in other recent analysis pointing to rise in top income shares in English-speaking countries, China and India over the past 30 years (Atkinson et al., 2011) ( 32 ). 4.1.3 Shifts in the regional distribution of inequality This same analysis of shifts between countries and within countries and their net effect is replicated at the regional level within the same studies cited above ( 33 ). The three key studies point to very consistent regional trends, so we present the data from Edward and Sumner (2014b), since these are the most up to date, extending through 2010 (Figure 4.6). The data show that, at a regional level, LAC and SSA are the most unequal. Since 2000, inequality has declined in LAC, given declines in within-country inequality in the region (Box 4.1). In SSA, the Gini appears to follow a cyclical pattern, although if South Africa is removed from the sample the picture is one of constancy \u2014 falling within- country inequality offset by rising between-country inequality (Edward and Sumner, 2014b: 13). In EAP, inequality rose sharply from the late 1980s, owing largely to a rise in inequality in China. More detailed examination of trends within China shows a rise in the Gini from 0.30 in the early 1980s to 0.48 in 2011 (S. Li, 2013: 1) and that, while incomes grew across the distribution, growth was highest for the richest. For example, the incomes of the poorest decile rose 50 % between 2002 and 2007, while those of the top quintile nearly doubled (Sicular, 2013: 2). Inequality is lower in south Asia than elsewhere in the developing world, though it appears to have increased since about 2000 ( 34 ). ( 32 ) This is also reflected in Oxfam\u2019s recent analysis showing that 62 billionaires own the same wealth as the bottom half of the global population (Hardoon et al., 2016) and that, on current trend, the richest 1 % of people in the world will own half of global wealth by 2016 (Hardoon, 2015). ( 33 ) Namely, Ravallion and Chen (2012), Lakner and Milanovic (2013) and Edward and Sumner (2014b). ( 34 ) This may owe to the use of consumption to characterise the distribution in most Indian estimates (using the National Sample Survey). An estimate on the basis of a 2011 income survey suggested a Gini of 0.51, 0.15 points higher than the consumption-based estimate (Milanovic, 2016). ",

Box 4.1: Inequality reductions in Latin America The recent experiences of LAC, long the region with the most unequal income distribution, provide a notable exception to the trend of rising inequality within countries over the past two to three decades. From the early 2000s, there appears a marked fall in inequality. Of 17 countries with enough data, 13 experienced a fall in the Gini between 2000 and 2009. Two main reasons explain most of this fall. First and foremost, rising levels of secondary education produced a falling skills premium, such that returns across skilled and unskilled labour became more equal. Second, governments increased and expanded progressive social transfers, leading to a rise in non-labour income, particularly for the poorest. Demographic change \u2014 namely, increased labour force participation \u2014 also contributed, but to a lesser extent. An examination of education within the region in the 1990s and 2000s suggests that in the latter decade the expansion of education was more equitable owing to greater efforts to extend education to the poor, but also that it had an equalising impact on income distribution, given more stable and perhaps increasing relative demand for low-skill labour. The role of conditional cash transfers should not be understated. Despite their low share in household total income (less than 1 %), programmes such as Brazil\u2019s Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, Chile\u2019s Solidario and Mexico\u2019s Progresa are estimated to account for 15 % of the decline in inequality in Chile and 21 % of that in Brazil and Mexico. Critics argue such programmes are providing transfers rather than opportunities, and are not addressing the concentration of income in the richest segments of the population. Instead, it is countered, universal social spending and more progressive taxation are needed, as well as the underlying institutional developments that would support these. Indeed, taxes have been ineffectual, accounting for just 1 % of the fall in the Gini. To what extent did politics matter? Countries across the political spectrum enjoyed a reduction in inequality across the 2000s. However, some evidence suggests leftist governments may have performed better, and that a new redistributive politics is at play in countries with social democratic regimes such as Brazil and Chile, compared with other countries such as Argentina and Venezuela, where the fall was attributable more to \u2018good luck\u2019 than to sound policy. Source: Melamed and Samman (2013). 4.2 Shifts in inequality within countries The regional inequality measures in the previous section focused on the combined impact of changes in between-country and within-country inequality. Our focus here is on inequalities within countries \u2014 a key level within which they are experienced and a key focus for policy interventions. As discussed above, aggregate within-country inequalities appear to have risen since the late 1980s. However, as also noted, this pattern appears to be driven principally by rising ",
        "61 inequality in China. Excluding China, \u2018within-country inequality in the rest of the world has overall been remarkably constant \u2014 as some countries have become less equal, others have become more so\u2019 (Edward and Sumner, 2014b). However, this net change masks countervailing trends at the regional level: increasing inequality in EAP countries, constancy in south Asia and reductions in LAC and SSA. It also masks considerable country-level diversity. In this section, we explore these changes at the country level, focusing on secondary analysis and our own analysis of the 78 countries for which we have comparable inequality data for the early 2000s (2000/2005) and late 2000s (2008/2013). We focus our analysis on the 2000s rather than the 1990s and the present because we have comparable data for only 61 countries for this longer period. A snapshot of these data reveals the following. \u2022 The 10 most unequal developing countries in the late 2000s \u2014 all with a Gini of over 52 \u2014 were in either LAC or southern Africa. \u2022 The 10 most equal developing countries \u2014 all with a Gini of below 30 \u2014 were in ECA, except Pakistan (in south Asia). \u2022 At a country level, over the 2000s, inequality fell in 51 countries in our sample and climbed in 27. The decline was most acute in Bolivia (15 points), but the Gini fell over 10 points in three countries (Bolivia, plus Nicaragua and Nepal) and it decreased by 5 points or more in 20 countries (26 % of the sample). The increase was highest in Guinea-Bissau (15 points), higher than 10 points in three countries (Guinea-Bissau, plus Zambia and CAR) and higher than 5 points in nine countries (11 % of the sample). The average change was a decrease of 1.4 points \u2014 indicating that the falls, on average, were slightly higher than the rises. Over the past decade, the Gini coefficient has risen in relatively fewer developing countries (LICs, LMICs and UMICs alike) than those in which it has fallen. For the LICs, the average change was a decrease of nearly 0.3 points, whereas for both LMICs and UMICs it was a decline of around 1.8 points. Only in HICs have the number of rises outpaced the number of declines (Figure 4.7). Nevertheless, because the rises have taken place in more populous countries, this creates a picture of rising inequality. If we remove India and China from the sample, population-weighted inequality appears to have stagnated in the 2000s (Figure 4.8). ",

Figure 4.8: Evolution of the Gini coefficient in developing countries minus China and India Source: Author elaboration of data in Edward and Sumner (2014b). This echoes the findings of Cobham and Sumner (2013), who compute the Palma ratio for 76 countries between 1990 and 2010/11 and examine its distribution over time in terms of the extent to which countries were able to move between quartiles. Similarly, their analysis points to significant \u2018stickiness\u2019: in 18 countries inequality improved, in 19 it deteriorated and in the remaining 39 it remained unchanged (ibid.: 9). Trends in inequality in China and in India merit special emphasis, given their disproportionate impact on (population-weighted) aggregated estimates of the (within- country) Gini coefficient (Figure 4.9). The Gini in China is estimated to have risen from 0.32 in 1990 to 0.43 in 2010, though there are signs it may have started to decrease more recently (Box 4.2). In contrast, changes in India have been more muted since 1980 but show a small increase from the early 1990s. ",

Box 4.2: Inequality in China \u2014 is it starting to fall? Inequality in China has risen from the late 1980s (when it was first measured) until recently (see Sicular et al., 2006; Li et al., 2011; Sutherland and Yao, 2011). By one estimate, the Gini coefficient grew by one third between 1988 and 2008, and this is largely responsible for the rising share of within-country inequality in the world over the past decades. However, since 2008, the Gini appears to have decreased \u2014 according to one estimate, from 0.49 in 2008 to 0.46 in 2015, mainly owing to falling urban\u2013rural inequalities. In 2009, average urban incomes were 3.3 times higher than average rural incomes; this has since narrowed to 2.7. One reason is income growth in rural areas. Other factors include demographic shifts (resulting in a shrinking working-age population) coupled with the expansion of redistributive health insurance and education policies and the elimination of an agricultural tax.

Of the 23 FCAS for which we have data, inequality rose in nine (39 %) and declined in 14 (61 %). Of the 26 LDCs with data, the Gini coefficient rose in 12 (46 %) and fell in 14 (54 %). And of the 24 LLDCs with data, inequality rose in nine (37.5 %) and fell in 15 (62.5 %). Figure 4.10: Evolution of Gini coefficient in FCAS, LDCs and LLDCs ",
        "64 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Trends over time differ between categories. For LDCs and FCAS, inequality is lower than in non-LDCs and non-FCAS circa 2000. Average inequality thereafter rises slightly in the LDCs (exceeding the non-LDC average) while it declines slightly in FCAS and slightly less than in the non-FCAS (Figure 4.11, Panels 1 and 2). For LLDCs and non-LLDCs, the trend is very similar (Panel 3). Figure 4.11: Evolution of LDCs and non-LDCs, FCAS and non-FCAS and LLDCs and non-LLDCs Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. For the ACP countries and for SSA, average initial inequality across countries is higher in both these categories and the gap with the rest of the world grows over time. However, if we look at the same data for SSA weighted by countries\u2019 respective populations, inequality is lower in 2000 but rises so sharply that the region becomes more unequal than the rest of the developing world \u2014 this suggests sharp rises in inequality in certain populous countries (Figure 4.12). ",
        "65 Figure 4.12: Evolution of inequality, ACP/non-ACP countries and SSA/rest of developing world Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Closer examination of the SSA region reveals a more nuanced story. In fact, the relatively high inequality that is apparent in SSA (and the ACP countries) is in fact driven by a small number of high-growth, high-inequality countries. In a recent study drawing on the most up-to-date estimates of poverty and inequality in the region, Beegle et al. (2016) find overall inequality among people in the region has increased (in line with the trend discussed earlier) \u2014 from 0.52 in 1993 to 0.56 in 2008. They observe that seven of the most unequal countries in the world today are in SSA \u2014 namely, Angola, Botswana, CAR, Comoros, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia \u2014 all with a Gini exceeding 0.55 (Figure 4.13). But, excluding these countries (five of them have populations of under 5 million and most are in southern Africa) and controlling for country incomes, inequality levels in the region then become comparable with those elsewhere in the developing world. Moreover, after controlling for subregional differences, \u2018Inequality levels do not differ significantly between coastal and landlocked, FCAS and non-FCAS, or resource-rich and resource-poor countries\u2019 (ibid.: 14). But key factors associated with inequality include geography, education and demographics (Box 4.3). In terms of change, they find that, at the country level, there is no conclusive trend: among the 23 countries for which they have comparable data, inequality increased in half and declined in half (Figure 4.14). The average country Gini fell by almost 5 % (with no change if countries are weighted by their respective populations). The countries where inequality fell are more likely to have experienced poverty reduction (Figure 4.15). ",

Box 4.3: Drivers of inequality in SSA Sizeable shares of inequality in SSA can be explained by differences in geography, in education and in demographics. Spatial inequalities account for as much as 30 % of inequality in some countries, while education of the household head is associated with even larger gaps between households \u2014 about 40 % of the total in Rwanda, South Africa and Zambia. The demographic composition of households also matters \u2014 explaining some 30 % of inequalities in Senegal and 32 % in Botswana. Source: Beegle et al. (2016). 4.4 Income groups and transitions between groups ( 35 ) So far, we have seen that there is considerable variation at a country level and there are changes over time \u2014 but an important issue this side-steps is the extent to which inequality and growth are linked. This is particularly important considering the high growth rates the developing world has been experiencing over the 2000s and the income group transitions this has enabled. In this section, we devote more consideration to how levels of inequality vary in line with income group and to changes in inequality as countries move into higher income groups. In line with the Kuznet hypothesis, a popular claim exists that, in recent years, as LICs have experienced rapid economic growth and graduated to middle-income status, inequality has tended to increase. This narrative has been reinforced in recent publications by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) (2013) and the World Bank (e.g. Besley and Cord, 2007). For example, per UNDP (2013), \u2018Developing countries that moved to higher income classifications, irrespective of initial income level, experienced larger increases in inequality than countries that stayed in the same income group\u2019 (p. 67). ( 35 ) This section is taken from Hoy et al. (2016), to which one of the authors of this report contributed. ",
        "68 In contrast, the analysis of Hoy et al. (2016) concludes that (1) income levels are not associated with levels of inequality and (2) while income growth tends to be associated with increases in inequality, the relationship is weak. This argument is made by comparing the experiences of countries that stayed in each income group over the 2000s with those of countries that graduated into a higher income group. On average, countries that moved from low- to lower-middle-income status over the 2000s had the fastest growth in GNI per capita and experienced the largest increase in inequality (4 % measured by the Palma ratio) (Table 4.1). Most other subsets of countries actually experienced decreased inequality. These new LMICs also exhibited higher inequality than countries that stayed LICs, and a Palma ratio similar to those in other UMICs. But, if the data are weighted for countries\u2019 respective populations, those countries that moved from low- to lower-middle-income status had lower inequality than those that stayed LICs (Table 4.2). In other words, the use of population-weighted data calls into question the idea that LICs that became LMICs have high levels of inequality. Changes in inequality alter dramatically depending on the type of average used for countries that have stayed LMICs compared with those that have become UMICs. In fact, the difference between country- and population-weighted averages owes largely to circumstances in China, where inequality is known to have increased markedly. There is a great deal of variation between countries, and some outliers dramatically alter the averages for the country categories \u2014 notably CAR, Honduras, Lesotho and Zambia. If we exclude these outliers, the stylised fact discussed above \u2014 that inequality in LMICs is higher than it is in LICs where data are country weighted \u2014 appears to be entirely unfounded. In fact, there is a swing in the opposite direction. Excluding outliers, in the latest survey the average Palma for countries that have stayed LICs was 1.79 compared with 1.54 for countries that were LICs in 2000 and became LMICs. As such, beyond a few outliers, there is effectively little difference in the average level of inequality between countries that have moved from low- to lower-middle-income status and those that have stayed LICs. These findings lend support to the view that the relationship between growth and inequality is \u2018decidedly non-deterministic \u2014 that is, policy matters\u2019 (Hoy et al., 2016: 14). ",

(2016, pp.15-16, Table 3) (computed from WDI 2015 and PovcalNet). How might we reconcile this argument with the popular view that inequality in rapidly growing countries is worsening? One way to bridge this gap is to differentiate between relative inequality, which is the subject of this chapter, and absolute inequality (Hoy, 2015a). Absolute inequality directly refers to the absolute gap between the rich and poor (Ravallion, 2007) and thus warrants greater attention, especially considering that changes in absolute inequality over time measure who accumulates the additional income generated from growth, and may more accurately reflect how people perceive inequality (Hoy, 2015a). If we revisit the growth and inequality nexus considering absolute rather than relative measures, a different pattern emerges (Table 4.3). Indeed, absolute inequality measured by the Absolute Palma (ibid.) has worsened in every income category (as defined by mean GNI per capita or mean income derived from surveys). While this rising absolute inequality may be one reason for the popularly felt unease about inequality, it also shows this problem is not closely related to a particular income status or the move of countries from one to another. Absolute inequality has risen in all countries, and it will do so in most growing countries.

        "70 4.5 Education inequalities: patterns and trends Education is an appropriate non-income dimension in which to examine inequality, for both theoretical and technical reasons. Fairness in the distribution of education is important in its own right \u2014 but it has also been connected with higher levels of innovation and productivity (World Bank, 2006), higher income equality (see Meschi and Scervini, 2013) and social cohesion (Green et al., 2003). Moreover, the way education is measured \u2014 for example in terms of years of schooling \u2014 makes it well suited to conventional approaches to characterising inequality. The Gini index is typically applied to measure inequality in income \u2014 or consumption. However, researchers have sought to extend its reach to consider non-income aspects of well-being. Chief among them is education, with the Gini applied to measure dispersion in the years of education (as opposed to income) (Thomas et al., 2001) ( 36 ). 4.5.1 At a global level In contrast with income, the inequality of education globally has fallen markedly over the past 150 years. Morrison and Murtin (2010) compute global inequalities in average years of schooling (cross-validated by historical data on illiteracy rates) from 1870 through 2000. They suggest the Gini index fell from 0.82 in 1870, in which year 76 % of the global population was illiterate, to 0.37 by 2000, in which year 82 % was literate. 4.5.2 At a regional level and by income group Distinct global datasets have been compiled \u2014 for example Thomas et al. (2001) or Wail et al. (2010) \u2014 over time periods dating from 1950 onwards ( 37 ). These point to a decline in educational inequality across all regions, one that is particularly notable among younger age cohorts. Region-specific studies affirm this pattern \u2014 for example, for the period between 1970 and 2000, Ibourk and Amaghouss (2012) point to a decline in the education Gini index in all 15 MENA countries they explore, for men and women and for all age groups. Our own analysis of the country-level data assembled by Wail et al. (2011) shows that education inequalities have fallen for all income groups. Inequalities in education are highest in LICs and lowest in UMICs, but the reductions over time are fairly steady (Figure 4.16). LICs and LMICs experienced a change of.13 in their Gini between 1990 and 2010, which translated into changes of 19 % and 26 %, respectively. For UMICs, the corresponding change was 0.11 in the Gini, which translated into a 29 % reduction. ( 36 ) Note that the Gini for income and for education should not be directly compared relative to one another given that the former is a continuous variable and the latter is categorical and bounded. ( 37 ) The Thomas et al. data cover the 1960-2000 period; Wail et al. cover 1950-2010. ",

Source: Computed from data in Wail et al. (2011). 4.5.3 At a country level Analysis of the evolution of inequalities in education within countries points to a marked decline in the average country\u2019s education Gini between 1990 and 2010, from 0.49 to 0.37 \u2014 in other words by 25 % (Figure 4.17). The range of variation is striking: at one extreme, several, mainly ECA, countries have a Gini of less than.2 (including Albania, Armenia, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Romania, Tajikistan and Ukraine). At the other extreme, the Gini is in excess of 0.7 in several SSA countries, including Mali, Mozambique, Niger and Sierra Leone.

Patterns of education inequality are not correlated with levels or trends in income inequality (Figure 4.18). Countries with similar levels of income inequality exhibit marked differences in education inequality, and the generalised decline in education inequality was experienced whether income inequality rose or fell.

The decline in education inequality was experienced fairly evenly across countries \u2014 as indicated by the very high correlation between education inequality in 1990 and in 2010 (.92) and the lack of any significant deviation from the trend line (Figure 4.19). Figure 4.19: Education inequality among countries measured by the Gini coefficient, 1990 and 2010 Source: Elaborated from data from Wail et al. (2011). Along similar lines, the Human Development Report\u2019s Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) represents a first effort to compute inequality across income, health and education for a large sample of countries. Between 1990 and 2011, analysis of 66 countries found that worsening income inequality at the national level undermined large improvements in health and education inequality (UNDP, 2011). 4.5.4 By \u2018special status\u2019 Data represent a constraint to investigating fully levels and changes of education inequality in special status groups, but sufficient data are available to compute country averages for LDCs and FCAS (i.e. more than two thirds of the population are covered). Between these two groups a very similar tendency is evident \u2014 namely, higher education inequality for LDCs and FCAS circa 1990, a slightly larger absolute fall in these two groups relative to non-LDCs and non-FCAS \u2014 but a smaller percentage decline. The ",
        "73 average Gini in LDCs and FCAS fell about 0.14 (or about 20 %), whereas for the non- LDCs and non-FCAS the average fall was 0.10 (or 27 %) (Figure 4.20) ( 38 ). Figure 4.20: Average country education Gini in LDCs and FCAS, and other developing countries, 1990 and 2010 Source: Computed from data in Wail et al. (2011). These data hint that there may be particular barriers to reducing educational inequality among those countries facing special circumstances. Other evidence suggests this may owe to competing responsibilities, particularly for girls, who have lower enrolment rates than boys in the poorest countries because of gendered norms around early marriage and the division of household labour (Hunt and Samman, 2016). In FCAS in particular, patterns wrought by wars, natural disasters and other emergencies often bring about disruption \u2014 it was recently estimated that 75 million school-age children living in 35 crisis-affected countries were affected (Nicolai et al., 2016a). ( 38 ) These data show country-weighted tendencies \u2014 but, when population-weighted, the trends are similar, except that non-LDCs and non-FCAS have much higher inequality at the beginning of the period and it falls more sharply.

        "74 CHAPTER 5: Projections \u2014 the future geography of poverty The goal of ending absolute extreme poverty has been recognised as potentially reachable within the next 15 years. The first SDG establishes the ambitious agenda \u2014 \u2018to end poverty in all its forms everywhere\u2019 by 2030 \u2014 while the World Bank, under President Jim Yong Kim, has adopted this objective as one of its twin goals ( 39 ). This chapter assembles the available research and data to assess the realism of this ambition. The chapter is focused on medium-term projections of growth and inequality, and on their potential impact on income poverty. Based on the most reliable projections (and our own estimations of the available data), the aim is to evaluate the likely range of scenarios and to anticipate trends through 2030 (global, regional, for \u2018special status\u2019 groups and by country) and where poverty is likely to be concentrated. We also discuss potential shocks that could disrupt these projections, drawing on illustrative examples of climate change and conflict. Taken together, the evidence suggests the following, by 2030. \u2022 At a global level . To eliminate extreme poverty, higher rates of growth and/or greater efforts to make growth more pro-poor will be needed. Different assumptions regarding growth in particular result in different poverty forecasts (the average projected headcount for 2030 is 5.6 % at USD 1.25 a day in 2005 PPP). The most plausible scenario, in our view, suggests a poverty headcount of 6.5-7 % in 2005 PPP or 4-6 % for USD 1.90 in 2011 PPP. It is estimated that growth of the bottom 40 % would need to be 2 percentage points higher than mean to eliminate poverty at a global level if current growth levels continue. However, all these projections rest fundamentally on underlying assumptions about growth and inequality \u2014 and, if we expand the range of possible variations in these indicators, any headcount at or below 2010 levels is plausible in 2030. The IMF\u2019s recent downgrading of growth forecasts is itself likely to threaten what can be achieved by 2030. \u2022 By region, income group and special status . Income poverty is likely to be concentrated in SSA, in FCAS and in LICs/LDCs, although a sizeable share may remain in MICs, especially those that are FCAS. Poverty estimates for SSA in 2030 suggest a range between 19 % and 33 % (in 2005 PPP, potentially slightly lower in 2011 PPP) and the absolute number of poor people in SSA could rise. Poverty levels in south Asia are uncertain, given that many poor people are situated near the extreme poverty line. For FCAS, estimated headcounts range from 13 % to around 50 %, with an average of 22 %. \u2022 By country . The goal of reaching a 3 % global poverty level is compatible with much higher levels of extreme poverty in some countries. Even under the most optimistic assumptions, more than half the population in Madagascar and DRC will be poor in 2030. \u2022 Exogenous threats . Climate change and conflict could greatly disrupt poverty reduction scenarios that assume growth rates and inequality are the only ( 39 ) On the historical antecedents of this objective, see Chandy et al. (2015: 1-2). ",
        "75 parameters that change, and that they do so in line with past trends. Climate- related risks appear to be increasing whereas conflict-related risks may be diminishing. 5.1 Analysis of income poverty projections ( 40 ) Projections of extreme poverty decades into the future tend to include a caveat similar to that in Chandy et al. (2013a: 2), who assert that predicting poverty is a \u2018fool\u2019s errand\u2019. However, these estimates can be useful indications, particularly in assisting the allocation of resources towards countries that will be home to poor people for many years to come. The most widely accepted method of forecasting poverty rates is to project future levels of growth and inequality based on assumptions about how present average incomes and the income distribution are likely to change ( 41 ). If the average and/or relative income of those at the bottom of the distribution is predicted to rise, for any given poverty line, the share of people who are poor will fall. Estimates of income can be based on household surveys or national accounts data. This chapter emphasises income estimates from the former, although these are often adjusted to a common base year using growth rates from national accounts, but we present scenarios based on both given that the choice has implications for the future geography of poverty (Box 5.1) ( 42 ). Whether changes in the poverty headcount ratio will translate into a rise or fall in the number of people who are poor depends on additional assumptions regarding population growth. Box 5.1: Implications of using data from household surveys and national accounts to measure poverty Projecting poverty requires measures of mean income and the income distribution. While the latter must necessarily come from household surveys, the former can come from either household surveys or national accounts. Mean measures of income from the two sources differ, as does the change they record over time. While data from household surveys provide a better measure of the incomes of the poor, they may be less well suited to measuring those of the rich. As a result, income may be underestimated. However, data from national accounts may overstate consumption in the poorest countries and its growth over time. In practice, gaps in surveys and their frequency make it necessary to use information from national accounts to fill in gaps. Across countries, measures of national accounts and household surveys are highly correlated, but in some countries, there are discrepancies that are not well understood \u2014 for example, the ratio of survey to national accounts means was 0.57 in Ethiopia (1995) and 3.66 in Madagascar (1980). Of particular concern is India, where household survey measures suggest much higher poverty levels than do national accounts. The World Bank and other research take steps to reconcile systematic differences between the two sources, but these can lead to different projections regarding numbers of poor people and the geography of poverty. Source: Deaton (2005); Edward and Sumner (2013). Given that poverty forecasts hinge on the underlying assumptions regarding growth and its distribution, consideration of the range of scenarios commonly applied and their plausibility is warranted. Poverty forecasts are particularly sensitive to expectation of growth. Hillebrand (2009) writes, \u2018Forecasting poverty 40 years into the future is mainly a matter of forecasting economic growth\u2019 (p. 169). But this is notoriously complicated. Growth forecasts can be modelled on the basis of assumptions about long-term growth ( 40 ) The review of projections in this section draws in part on Hoy and Samman (2014). ( 41 ) Two other (less common) methods are the estimation of semi-elasticities \u2014 how changes in growth have corresponded with absolute changes in poverty \u2014 using historical data (Dercon and Lea, 2012) and complex models such as International Futures (IFS), which factor in the interaction of hundreds of variables based on historical trends (see CPAN, 2014). These approaches have not gained wide acceptance. The use of semi-elasticities of poverty on growth is considered less relevant over longer time periods, and complex models are often not overly transparent, which can generate scepticism over their reliability (Edward and Sumner, 2014b). ( 42 ) See World Bank (2014, Chapter 6) for more information about differences between these two sources and the ways in which researchers have sought to reconcile them, as well as Edward and Sumner (2013). ",
        "76 processes \u2014 often on the expectation of \u2018conditional convergence\u2019, reflecting differences in technology levels, capital intensity and human capital (Johansson et al., 2012). However, research has shown that such forecasts are often overly optimistic, especially for China and India, as they overlook the eventual tendencies of countries to revert to mean global growth rates (Ho and Mauro, 2014; Pritchett and Summers, 2014). Many projection studies assume the continuation of global or country-specific growth rates (over different time horizons) to illustrate a range of possible experiences. But Easterly et al. (1993) report that correlations for growth rates across decades in the past were generally low. Given the difficulty in knowing which period is most likely to be replicated, most research in this area seeks to \u2018derive a range of plausible poverty outcomes based on alternative scenarios\u2019, for growth of both mean incomes and inequality (Chandy et al., 2013: 3). The World Bank (2014) argues that a \u2018pragmatic\u2019 way to do this is to draw on a range of historical growth patterns (p. 149). Even over the past three decades, this suggests a wide array of poverty outcomes is possible (Figure 5.1). A frequent assumption of baseline scenarios is that within-country inequality will remain constant overall. This is not to imply it will stay the same within all countries, but rather that rises in some will offset declines in others (Hellebrandt and Mauro, 2015). This \u2018simplifying assumption\u2019 is \u2018driven by the fact that the distribution of income is affected by a multitude of factors that vary across countries and over time, making it very difficult to make even an informed guess about the likely future path of within-country inequality over a 20-year period for every country\u2019 (ibid.: 8). Other approaches are to assume inequality will vary in line with past trajectories or to fix inequality at upper or lower bounds based on each country\u2019s recent history (Lakner et al., 2015). Figure 5.1: An illustration of how different historical growth patterns affect poverty estimates Source: World Bank (2014: 150). The World Bank (2014) tests the sensitivity of different poverty forecasts to assumptions about growth and inequality. First, the researchers take 1 000 \u2018random draws\u2019 from the growth experiences of each country over 2000-2010 and determine the aggregate range of poverty outcomes suggested by the range of growth experiences, which vary from 5.1 % to 7.1 % (p. 152) (Figure 5.2, left panel). Complicating the picture further, they let inequality vary randomly in line with countries\u2019 recent past experience (Figure 5.2, right panel). This introduces additional uncertainty resulting in a possible poverty range of between 3.3 % and 7.7 % (p. 155). ",
        "77 Figure 5.2: Sensitivity of poverty reduction to estimates about growth and inequality Source: World Bank (2014: 153 and 155). Most existing studies include a baseline or \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 scenario, which attempts to estimate poverty on the basis of a growth model or by projecting forward historical growth rates, holding inequality (and the real value of the poverty line) constant. These studies typically then explore how poverty could change if growth and inequality deviated from this pattern (or if other parameters, say development assistance or institutional stability, were to change). Here, this report reviews the key projections made for poverty in 2030 globally, then by region and income group and for \u2018special status\u2019 countries. 5.1.1 Global poverty trends Most analyses of global poverty through 2030 rely on poverty headcounts based on 2005 PPP prices and an extreme poverty line of USD 1.25 a day. We review these studies, and where possible complement them using headcounts derived using prices in 2011 PPP and the USD 1.90 a day extreme poverty threshold. The baseline projections based on 2005 PPP exchange rates differ primarily in the data they use to project growth (see Box 5.2). These different data sources notwithstanding, the resulting extreme poverty projections vary only slightly. Estimates for 2030 tend to be in the range of around 3-7 % of the world\u2019s population (Figure 5.3). This means that approximately 200 million-550 million people would be in extreme poverty, compared with over 1 billion today. The average estimate among these studies with a 2030 endpoint is 5.6 % (Figure 5.4). Such estimates highlight that it will be a stretch for the world to achieve a 3 % poverty rate by 2030 ( 43 ). ( 43 ) For the Bank, ending global poverty is considered to be reducing global poverty to 3 % or less of the global population (see World Bank, 2014: 1, 24); we use this same concept in this chapter.

        "79 Box 5.2: Comparing underlying assumptions for baseline projections of global poverty Each of the baseline poverty estimates in Figure 5.3 relies on different projections regarding growth rates and the assumption that inequality does not change. The growth assumptions are as follows: \uf0b7 Brookings (Chandy et al., 2013a): Growth projections for each country to 2030 are from the Economist Intelligence Unit. \uf0b7 Centre for Global Development (CGD) (Edward and Sumner, 2013): Growth rates are taken from the 2012 IMF World Economic Outlook, which provides growth rates for 2010-2017 (growth for 2013-2017 is itself a projection). \uf0b7 World Bank (2014): This projection is based on the report\u2019s Alternative Three scenario, which uses average growth rates calculated from household survey data from the previous 10 years applied through 2030. Where there are gaps in data or problems with comparability across surveys, growth rates are based on national accounts estimates. \uf0b7 CGD (Karver et al., 2012): For assumed growth rates, CGD uses IMF World Economic Outlook growth data. The authors take growth rates from the period 2009-2014, minus 1 % (the average error historically observed in IMF growth projections), and apply this to incomes to 2030. This paper was produced prior to 2011 poverty data being released, so 2009-2014 data are projections rather than actual data. \uf0b7 Ravallion (2013a): Ravallion\u2019s projections are effectively produced in reverse, to see what growth rate would be needed to achieve 3 % poverty by 2030. He finds there would need to be an annual growth rate in household consumption per capita, if using 2008 consumption distribution, of 4.5 %. If assuming a 1999 distribution rate, growth would have to be lower, at just 3.4 %. \uf0b7 Kharas and Rogerson (2012): Growth rates are taken from the 2012 IMF World Economic Outlook through 2016 and extrapolated to 2025 using assumptions on capital accumulation, labour force and productivity experience. Source: Nicolai et al. (2015: 8). These baseline projections are often cited, but have also been criticised ( 44 ). In a recent review, Hoy and Samman (2014) argue that the World Bank (2014) baseline projection of extreme poverty in the order of 6.5-7 % of the worlds\u2019 population ( 45 ) (or around 500 million people) is particularly credible for three reasons. \u2022 It uses the (then) most recent World Bank poverty data (from October 2014). \u2022 Its reliance on growth rates based on the previous 10 years is arguably more defensible than using distant historical growth rates, as in many other projections. \u2022 It is based on changes in income (or consumption) as recorded in household surveys as opposed to national accounts \u2014 the latter may not adequately reflect changes in consumption for the poorest households, especially in south Asia, where they generate much lower estimates (see, e.g., Deaton and Kozel, 2005, on India). These so-called baseline scenarios are often accompanied by more and less pessimistic variants that assume different higher or lower growth rates and shifts in inequality. For example, in addition to the scenario just described, the World Bank (2014) provides a range of other possible scenarios based on different growth estimates (Figure 5.5, Table 5.1). ( 44 ) For example, Yoshida et al. (2014) find the analysis in Ravallion (2013a) overly optimistic. Edward and Sumner (2013) criticise the methodology and the findings in Kharas and Rogerson (2012). The projections in Karver et al. (2012) may not be credible owing to the use of pre-crisis growth forecasts. Chandy et al. (2013a) have not attracted such heavy criticism, but the slowdown in growth since publication is likely to lead to a higher rate of poverty in 2030 than they predicted. Edward and Sumner (2014) are careful not to identify a most likely outcome and instead provide a number of scenarios, based on different assumptions about growth rates, inequality and the use of national accounts or survey data. ( 45 ) This projection is alternative Scenario 3 in Table 1.5 in Chapter 1 of World Bank (2Figure 014). ",

So far, we have examined projected poverty figures holding inequality constant. However, most studies present a range of scenarios in which growth and inequality vary. Indeed, Chandy et al. (2013a) argue that changes in inequality can matter just as much as changes in growth. In fact, there is reason to believe that, as countries\u2019 poverty falls, the poverty rate becomes more sensitive to inequality (i.e. inequality elasticity rises) and less sensitive to growth (Gibson, 2016). Yoshida et al. (2014) argue that, if inequalities between and within countries continue to widen, eliminating extreme poverty will require unprecedented and virtually impossible growth in developing countries (ODI, 2014). On the other hand, it is also tenable that, over the next 15 years, consumption at the lower end of the distribution could grow faster than the average, particularly given the recent policy focus on increasing the incomes of the bottom 40 % of countries\u2019 populations relative to the average ( 46 ). The recent experience of the LAC region, discussed in Chapter 4, attests to this possibility. Projection exercises incorporate a range of assumptions regarding inequality (Table 5.2).

(2013a) Historical variation of Palma, subject to lower and upper bound World Bank (2014) Vary growth rate of mean of bottom 40 % relative to the mean Source: Adapted from Lakner et al. (2015). ( 46 ) The World Bank\u2019s newly adopted goal of \u2018shared prosperity\u2019, which it defines as growth that benefits the bottom 40 % of the population (http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/isp/overview#1), and the first inequality target under SDG 10, which stipulates \u2018income growth of the bottom 40 % of the population at a rate higher than the national average\u2019. ",
        "81 Lakner et al. (2014) project extreme poverty taking into account different inequality scenarios characterised in terms of the growth rate of the bottom 40 % of the income distribution relative to the average. They report that a 2030 global poverty rate of anywhere between 3 % and 9 % appears plausible depending on whether the bottom 40 % of the distribution were to grow by 1 to 2 percentage points faster or slower than the average growth rate (Table 5.3). Table 5.3: World Bank (2014) global estimates of extreme poverty based on changes in inequality (assuming 10-year historical growth rate) Projection 2030 global extreme poverty rate Optimistic (Bottom 40 % grows 2 % faster than average) 2.7 % Baseline (Inequality held constant) 4.7 % Pessimistic (Bottom 40 % grows 2 % slower than average) 9.0 % Source: Adapted from Lakner et al. (2014). Finally, some studies merge a range of assumptions on both growth and inequality \u2014 a \u2018best\u2019 scenario that combines high growth and an improving distribution, and vice versa (Figure 5.6). For example, Ravallion (2013a) highlights that there could be more than 30 years\u2019 difference in the timeline to end extreme poverty in comparing his optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. In the two studies that provide poverty headcounts, most variation is between \u2018best\u2019 and \u2018worst\u2019 case scenarios (some 1 billion people) rather than within scenarios (which vary by about 200 million people). The broader point is that, when we take into account the expanded range of possibilities, which include variations in growth and in inequality, any headcount at or below 2010 levels is plausible in 2030. There are also implications for global inequality (Box 5.3). Figure 5.6: Best and worst case scenarios for global poverty in 2030 NB: Chandy et al. (2013a) assume growth plus or minus 2 percentage points and inequality at upper or lower bounds based on country historical trends. Edward and Sumner (2013) (survey-based estimates) assume World Economic Outlook forecast growth (optimistic) and half that growth rate (pessimistic), whereas income distribution relies on best and worst country historical trends. The World Bank (2014) assumes country-specific national accounts growth rates over the previous 10 years plus 1 % additional growth in SSA and income distribution within each region of best regional performers. Source: Chandy et al. (2013a); Edward and Sumner (2013); World Bank (2014). ",
        "82 Box 5.3: What is likely to happen to global inequality? The most reliable estimate of future patterns of global inequality points to continued decline. Hellebrandt and Mauro (2015) make projections for 2035 on the basis of growth forecasts from 2014 to 2035 compiled from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), complemented by other sources, UN population forecasts and micro data from household surveys. On the assumption that within- country inequality, on average, will be constant, the authors analyse how growth is likely to affect between- country inequality, and the implications for global inequality. Their data show a decline in the Gini from 69 in 2003 to 65 in 2013 and their baseline scenario projects a further decline to 61 in 2035, owing to rapid growth in emerging economies. Under a more pessimistic growth scenario in which growth is assumed to align more closely with rates experienced between 1993 and 2013, inequality falls but more slowly \u2014 reaching 64 in 2035. Finally, under an optimistic scenario, in which China and India maintain rapid growth of 7 % annually over the next two decades, the Gini is expected to fall to 63 in 2035 \u2014 but with countervailing effects from these two countries. The rise in Indian incomes would contribute to lowering global inequality, while the rise in Chinese incomes would start to raise it given that incomes are now relatively high, compared with the global average. 5.1.2 Regional poverty trends Several of these studies also provide a regional breakdown of extreme poverty in 2030. The World Bank (2014) provides estimated headcount ratios for the scenarios explained in Table 5.1. For all regions excepting SSA, projected poverty rates are fairly close to 3 % or indeed well under; in SSA the projected range is between 19 % and 33 % (Figure 5.7). Several additional studies project the number of people who are likely to be poor in 2030, and point to a likely increase in SSA compared with a marked drop in south Asia (Figure 5.8). Figure 5.7: Estimated poverty headcount ratios in World Bank (2014) scenarios Source: Computed from data in World Bank (2014). ",
        "83 Figure 5.8: Estimated numbers of poor people in 2030 according to common projections studies NB: The World Bank scenario is household survey growth over the past 10 years; Karver et al.\u2019s is their \u2018moderate\u2019 scenario. Edward and Sumner\u2019s scenarios are their \u2018optimistic\u2019 and \u2018pessimistic\u2019 scenarios using household survey data. Source: Karver et al. (2012); Edward and Sumner (2013); World Bank (2014). The reason these trends diverge so markedly is the relative size of the poverty gap in SSA compared with in other regions, notably south Asia (home to the second largest share of people living in extreme poverty) (Table 5.4). A large share of the population lives around the extreme poverty line in south Asia, such that, at the margin, growth at the lower end of the distribution can push large numbers of people across the poverty line. In SSA, in contrast, many people are far from the extreme poverty line and a slight change in growth does not make a large difference to the overall headcount ratio (Chandy et al., 2013a) ( 47 ). It follows that the variation between exercises hinges somewhat on uncertainty about changes in growth and inequality in south Asia. While Chandy et al. (2013a) estimate that around 40 million people will live in extreme poverty in India in 2030, the World Bank (2014) estimates a figure of close to 50 million. Meanwhile, Edward and Sumner (2013) suggest a range of between none and 84 million people (their optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, respectively, using incomes from household surveys). Table 5.4: Average daily consumption of extremely poor people, 2011 EAP south Asia SSA Developing world Average daily consumption in 2011 of those living below USD 1.25 a day (2005 PPP) 1.23 1.19 1.01 1.19 Source: Hoy and Samman (2014). These debates notwithstanding, there is a common expectation in these studies that extreme poverty will be increasingly concentrated in SSA. In fact, our preferred World Bank scenario suggests the share of poor people in SSA in the global total could double, whereas the share in south Asia could fall by three quarters (Figure 5.9). Under this scenario, the number of poor people in SSA would increase by 55 million; in south Asia, ( 47 ) Chandy et al. (2013a) estimate that about 60 % of people in SSA that they project will be poor in 2030 will be poor because they are presently so far behind the USD 1.25 a day poverty line (rather than or in addition to because of sluggish growth). ",
        "84 in contrast, it would fall by some 350 million. However, the estimates from Edward and Sumner (2013) point to a wider array of possibilities (particularly comparing survey and national account differences) \u2014 notably that the extreme poor in south Asia could account for virtually none of global poverty in 2030 or as much as 20 % (Figure 5.10). Figure 5.9: Projected distribution of poor people globally according to World Bank (2014) EAP 16% ECA 0% LAC 3% MENA 1% South Asia 39% SSA 41% 2011 EAP 4% ECA 0% LAC 4% MENA 1% South Asia 8% SSA 83% 2030 Source: Based on 10-year survey scenario as per Table 5.1. Figure 5.10: Alternative geographies of poverty for 2030 Source: Edward and Sumner (2013). It is important to note that the World Bank\u2019s use of a 3 % threshold for \u2018ending global poverty\u2019 is compatible with far higher levels of poverty in some countries. For example, under the Bank\u2019s most optimistic scenario, which assumes that each country grows 4 % yearly through 2030, the 3 % global poverty goal would be reached but the poverty headcount would remain above 30 % in six countries: Haiti (33 %), Malawi (37 %), Burundi (39 %), Zambia (48 %), Madagascar (52 %) and DRC (57 %). If, instead, countries grew in line with national accounts growth experienced in the previous 10 years, 17 countries would have poverty above this level, whereas if growth rates are based on the previous 20 years there would be 23 countries (World Bank, 2014). World Bank (2014) forecasts identify 10 countries that are likely to house the largest numbers of poor people in 2030 (Table 5.5). Comparing the yearly (compound) rate of reduction experienced over the 2002-2011 period with the yearly rate of reduction that would be needed to eliminate poverty by 2030 makes clear the scale of the challenge. In the best case scenario (India), the ratio of the rate of reduction needed over 2011-2030 to that experienced between 2002 and 2011 is 1.7; at the other extreme, Burundi, it is 29 ( 48 ). It ( 48 ) We do not calculate the ratio of the rate of reduction that would be needed relative to recent rates of reduction for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Zambia given that poverty increased in these two countries during 2002- 2011. ",
        "85 also bears emphasising, as already noted in Chapter 2, that several of these countries (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia) are already MICs.

Column 4 and 5 are author calculations \u2014 the compounded rate of reduction is the constant yearly rate at which poverty has fallen recently (would need to fall to reach a 3 % headcount ratio in 2030). All of the studies discussed so far were released prior to the October 2015 release of poverty data in 2011 PPP. However, in a departure from past practice, the World Bank announced in October 2015 that the USD 1.25 a day poverty line would remain constant in real terms through 2030, at a value of USD 1.90 in 2011 PPP. Broadly speaking, this means projections that incorporate the update to the new PPP exchange rates do not affect the estimations a great deal. For example, based on new PPP data, Jolliffe et al. (2014) revise their global poverty headcount estimates from 14.5 % for 2011 and 4.7 % for 2030 to 12.8 % and 4.2 %, respectively. At time of writing of this report, the most up-to-date scenario using 2011 PPP prices is from Cruz et al. (2015). The three growth scenarios outlined here provide a reasonable basis for thinking about the range of possible poverty outcomes in 2030 (Figure 5.11). The first lower-bounds scenario assumes country-specific growth rates from the previous 20 years (1994-2013). The second scenario assumes country-specific growth rates from the previous decade (2004-2013). The most optimistic scenario assumes all countries will grow at the developing country average of the previous 10 years \u2014 which implies household income growth of 3.9 % (with no change in inequality). This final scenario is the only one under which the ambition of ending global poverty by 2030 would be realised \u2014 and even then poverty would remain at around 15 % in SSA. However, it is worth noting that the expectations for SSA are lower than those shown in Figure 5.7 above; this will be a function of different 10-year periods used to generate growth assumptions as well as the change in the PPP reference year.

        "86 Figure 5.11: World Bank forecasts of plausible poverty levels in 2030 based on different growth scenarios Source: Cruz et al. (2015). Finally, it should be noted that since many of these growth projections were made there has been a downgrading of growth in many developing countries, with potential implications for poverty forecasts (Box 5.4). ",
        "87 Box 5.4: Varying assumptions about growth Identifying the most likely growth forecast, even in the short term, is challenging. The differences between the best and worst scenarios across studies attest to this uncertainty. Over the past 3 years, growth prospects for the developing world have been downgraded (see figure). Growth estimates in 2012 for 2013 overshot actual recorded levels for most developing economies, by as much as 1.5 percentage points in the case of India. This can have big implications for future poverty reduction prospects. IMF estimates of 2013 growth rate Source: IMF World Economic Outlook (www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/index.htm). All of the projections discussed here would paint a more pessimistic picture of extreme poverty in 2030 if they used more recent IMF forecasts. To illustrate this, we estimate the difference in GDP per capita through 2030 by extrapolating 2012 IMF forecasts for 2013 and actual growth levels (see figure). This exercise highlights how even slight deviations away from growth forecasts can have significant implications over long time horizons. For India, there is a difference of over 25 % in income per person in 2030 when using 2012 forecasts for 2013 versus actual data. This has huge ramifications for estimates of extreme poverty in 2030 given that a large number of people live just below USD 1.25 a day (2005 PPP). Initial analysis suggests that, if these projections were repeated using the 2013 IMF growth forecasts, another 50 million people could potentially be in poverty in 2030. Difference in GDP per capita between 2012 IMF forecasts for 2013 and actual Source: IMF World Economic Outlook (www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/index.htm). The projections in this chapter have attempted to quantify the effect on extreme poverty in 2030 of lower growth for developing countries. But lower than expected growth could scupper these forecasts. For example, if for the next 15 years developing countries grow at half the rate of the 2000s then the poverty rate could still be above 10 % of the developing world\u2019s population in 2030.

        "88 5.1.3 Sub-regional poverty trends At the sub-regional level, Nicolai et al. (2016b, 2016c, 2016d) offer a range of scenarios based on poverty projections for 2030 that assume constant inequality and that rates of poverty reduction experienced over the past 10 years will be sustained. In SSA, they find no country is on track to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030. One in five countries is expected to reduce poverty by more than two thirds; in a similar number of countries extreme poverty is expected to worsen. On balance, southern Africa is performing better than east Africa and west and central Africa (Figure 5.12). Nonetheless, the authors estimate that 20 % of the region\u2019s population will remain poor in 2030. Rates of extreme poverty reduction would need to be two to three times higher to reach the target of eliminating extreme poverty in southern Africa, and three to four times higher in east, west and central Africa. Figure 5.12: Actual and projected poverty headcount in SSA through 2030 NB: EAF is east Africa, SAF is southern Africa, WCA is west and central Africa. Source: Nicolai et al. (2016b: 17). In LAC, the projections are more optimistic. Over half of the countries in the region are on track to reduce poverty by more than 80 % on current trends, and by 2030 the vast majority of countries in the region are projected to have poverty levels that are under 5 %. Countries projected to have headcount ratios above this level are Belize, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Saint Lucia and Suriname. In particular, half the population in Haiti is projected to remain in extreme poverty. Owing to high levels of poverty in the Caribbean (especially Haiti), the sub-region lags behind central and south America (Figure 5.13). ",

Nearly half the countries in Asia-Pacific are on track to reduce extreme poverty by 90 % or more by 2030. Indeed, some LMICs, including Vietnam, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, are set to eliminate extreme poverty. However, around a fifth of countries will fail to make even half the progress needed to reach this target: Kiribati, Laos, Micronesia, the Philippines and Tonga. On average, countries in east and south-east Asia, south Asia and the Pacific had fairly similar poverty rates in 2002. However, on current trends, the Pacific will lag behind the other sub-regions (Figure 5.14). In 2030, east and south-east Asia, as well as south Asia, are on track to have less than 5 % of their populations living in extreme poverty; in the Pacific, the percentage is set to be around three times higher than that. To eliminate extreme poverty by 2030 in the Pacific, progress will need to be around two to three times faster than current trends.

        "90 5.1.4 Income group trends Some research has also sought to identify the income groups in which future poverty will be concentrated. The most up-to-date analysis of current LICs and MICs and their expected trajectories through 2030 is from Edward and Sumner (2013). Three findings stemming from their analysis merit attention. The first is the clear difference in the trajectory of current LICs versus LMICs and UMICs. For the MICs, under all scenarios, the expectation is that the poverty headcount will fall, whereas it will very possibly increase in LICs (Figures 5.15-5.17). Figure 5.15: Poverty projections for current LICs through 2030 NB: Estimates marked S are based on household surveys; those marked NA are based on national accounts. Source: Edward and Sumner (2013). Figure 5.16: Poverty projections for current LMICs through 2030 NB: Estimates marked S are based on household surveys; those marked NA are based on national accounts.

        "91 Figure 5.17: Poverty projections for current UMICs through 2030 NB: Estimates marked S are based on household surveys; those marked NA are based on national accounts. Source: Edward and Sumner (2013). A second point concerns the future global distribution of poverty, a complicated question that emphasises disparities between surveys and national accounts. Edward and Sumner (2013) discuss at length the differences between these two data sources, particularly as national accounts data for India generate systematically lower poverty estimates than surveys do. However, they report that, under all scenarios, there are likely to be large shares of poor people living in MICs in 2030 \u2014 an estimated 60/40 or 70/30 split between LICs and MICs (Figure 5.18). In their view, after excluding China and India, \u2018the forecast poverty reductions in the remaining MICs are not so large, nor so certain, as to justify in themselves the view that poverty in the future will be a matter for LICs primarily. In fact, once re-categorisations are taken into account, it seems that poverty outside India and China will remain roughly evenly distributed across MICs and LICs\u2019 (p. 81). Figure 5.18: Different scenarios for the 2030 distribution of extreme poverty among LICs and MICs NB: Estimates marked S are based on household surveys; those marked NA are based on national accounts. Source: Edward and Sumner (2013). A third finding is that their forecasts stress the weak growth prospects facing today\u2019s LICs, which in turn will slow their transition into the middle-income category. Sumner ",
        "92 (2016) estimates that only four current LICs (of those with data) are likely to become MICs by 2030 \u2014 Cambodia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Rwanda \u2014 and that only 11 are likely to do so by 2100 (Figure 5.19). Figure 5.19: LICs (with data) that could become MICs in next 100 years based on 2010-2014 growth Source: Sumner (2016: 12, Figure 6). 5.1.5 Fragile and conflict-affected state trends Next, we consider future trends for FCAS and the extent to which these states are likely to concentrate poverty in the future. In their review of the major studies that address this issue, Burt et al. (2014) point to a wide range of variation in terms of projected headcount ratios and numbers of poor people for 2030 \u2014 which vary from fewer than 100 million people to around 300 million people \u2014 as well as trends (Figure 5.20). Across the studies with a 2030 endpoint, the average of projected headcount ratios is 22 %. The implications for the future distribution of global poverty are considerable: according to the most popular studies, the share of people living in FCAS could account for between 21 % and 62 % of the global poor (Table 5.6). The biggest difference in these studies is between the estimates of Chandy et al. (2013a) and the others, and a key difference is in the lists of fragile countries used \u2014 namely, use of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list versus the World Bank FCAS list. The former includes Bangladesh and Nigeria, where large numbers of people were clustered around the poverty line in 2010, hence the large anticipated reduction in numbers over time (Burt et al., 2014: 12). The remaining three studies considered all make use of the World Bank FCAS list but nonetheless arrive at different conclusions owing to variations in the growth and inequality parameters used \u2014 and the use of the International Futures (IFS) model in one case, which seeks to model the \u2018dynamic and often nonlinear path that countries follow\u2019 (ibid.: 9).

(2013a) and Edward and Sumner (2013) model have been covered above. Chen/World Bank (forthcoming) follows the same assumptions as Ravallion (2013a) as above ( 49 ). The IFS model embodies complex assumptions as per footnote 41. Source: Burt et al. (2014). On the basis of the IFS model, Burt et al. (2014) offer different future scenarios based on altering growth and income inequality. They find that changes in the latter, in isolation, do not alter the forecasts notably (perhaps because inequality in FCAS is already quite low to begin with). However, growth, and the combination of changes in growth and inequality, can have more a sizeable impact (Figure 5.21). But even their most optimistic scenario still results in a poverty rate of about 20 % in 2030. ( 49 ) On this assumption, Burt et al. (2014: 11, footnote 13) comment that the methodology for Chen/World Bank is based on personal correspondence, and we acknowledge that details regarding the methodology may change substantially in the coming months from what is presented here.

Burt et al.\u2019s study also provides disaggregated analysis for the 10 countries with the largest number of poor people under a number of scenarios, including improvements in institutions (as measured by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)) and security. The trajectory varies markedly between countries, in part as a result of institutional quality and the depth of poverty. For example, the decline in DRC is anticipated to be much higher than that in Somalia (Figure 5.22). Many countries (including Burundi, Chad, DRC, Myanmar/Burma, Sierra Leone, West Bank and Gaza and Zimbabwe) could attain more than half of their maximum expected poverty reduction through effective institutional reforms. For other countries, less than half of their poverty reduction would come from institutional reform because the growth effects are strong (Liberia is an example). Still other countries (Comoros, Haiti, Madagascar, Somalia and Yemen) are not expected to make any significant progress under any of the scenarios considered here and have little prospect for meeting any targets (Burt et al., 2014: 23). ",
        "95 Figure 5.22: Effect of alternative scenarios on country poverty forecasts in FCAS Source: Burt et al. (2014). Edward and Sumner (2013) in turn point to the need to consider the overlap between fragile countries and income levels: \u2018There is some sign that the fragile classification is useful, as it seems to identify a set of countries where poverty reduction may well prove difficult. However, we find little sign that this problem will be confined to low-income fragile states \u2014 poverty reduction seems equally unlikely in the middle-income fragile states\u2019 (p. 81). Indeed, comparing their forecasts of poverty in FCAS and non-FCAS MICs and LICs makes clear that the share of poor people in FCAS MICs is expected to increase over time, while that of poor people in FCAS LICs will diminish (Figure 5.23).

        "96 5.1.6 Least developed countries trend The only projections of LDC performance through 2030 are from Edward and Sumner (2013), who anticipate persistently high poverty and a relatively slow reduction rate. Even under their most optimistic scenario, 268 million people in these countries could still be poor in 2030; under their worst case, the figure is in excess of 650 million (Figure 5.24). The share of the LDC population in extreme poverty globally is expected to worsen \u2014 from about 62 % to 82 % under their static inequality scenario. The LDC categorisation, they conclude, is likely to remain useful in considering aid priorities (p.77).

Figure 5.25: Share of poor people in LDCs as a share of global poor (%) Source: Computed from data in Edward and Sumner (2013) (static inequality scenario). 5.1.7 Projections for ACP countries, for LLDCs and at a country level Through our review of the literature we have not identified any projections for ACP countries or for the LLDCs, or country-level projections. Here, we provide simple projections using the data and methodology in Nicolai et al. (2016b, 2016c, 2016d). ",
        "97 These extrapolate trends in poverty reduction over the 2002-2012 period ( 50 ). The results point to the difficulty of eliminating poverty among both LLDCs and ACP countries. On average, poverty is set to reduce by approximately a third across 56 ACP countries for which we have data \u2014 seven (13 %) are on track to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030, 41 are on track to decrease but not eliminate extreme poverty and eight are on track to increase their poverty. Ghana and Botswana are projected to do particularly well, reducing poverty by nearly 80 % (about one third of their populations were in extreme poverty in 2012 and these shares are expected to fall to less than 3 % by 2030). On the other hand, the poverty rate is expected to increase in Zambia and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, by 30 % and 11 %, respectively. In the Pacific countries, the rate of poverty reduction is much faster, 3.5 times the rate of Caribbean countries and almost double (1.8) times the rate of the SSA ACP countries (Figure 5.26). No Pacific countries are expected to increase poverty, while seven ACP countries in SSA are. Rates of poverty reduction in the Pacific countries would need to nearly triple to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030, while rates in Africa and Caribbean would need to be six and nine times higher, respectively. Figure 5.26: Actual and projected poverty headcount within ACP countries through 2030 NB: Data are available for 56 of the 79 ACP countries and are representative of SSA but not of the Caribbean or Pacific regions as data are available for fewer than half of countries in these groups. Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Turning to the LLDCs, about half (48 %, or 10 countries) are predicted to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030, and almost 60 % are expected to reduce poverty by over 50 %. Still, rates of reduction will need to nearly triple overall if LLDCs are to eliminate poverty by 2030 (Figure 5.27). As of 2012, 10 LLDCs had already eliminated extreme poverty; five more are expected to do so by 2030. Poverty is expected to increase in two countries, on current trend. For example, if Zambia maintains its recent performance, its poverty headcount ratio will reach 92 %. ( 50 ) Data are from the PovcalNet database. ",
        "98 Figure 5.27: Actual and projected poverty headcount for LLDCs through 2030 Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. Finally, we consider country-level projections and what they suggest about the global poverty landscape circa 2030. As of 2012, 34 or nearly one third of countries in the developing world \u2014 based on our sample of 109 countries \u2014 had already eliminated extreme poverty (i.e. headcounts were under 3 %) and 50 countries were on track to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030. Assuming current trends continue, further progress will be considerable but there will also be cases of regression. In 2012, a total of 41 countries, from every region besides MENA, had more than 20 % of their population in extreme poverty. By 2030, this is expected to fall to some 24 countries ( 51 ), with two in Latin America (Haiti and St Lucia) and 22 in SSA (at its most extreme in Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar and Zambia, with projected rates over 80 %) (Figure 5.28). While 25 (23 %) of our 109 developing countries are expected to reduce their poverty headcount by over 90 %, these rates are set to increase in 11 countries (10 %). Figure 5.28: Poverty headcount in 2012 and 2030 at a country level (%) Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. ( 51 ) In fact, it is predicted to exceed 20 % in 25 countries, but one country, Montenegro, currently has under 2 % poverty, up from 0.25 % in 2002, rendering the 2030 prediction of 23 % poverty unlikely. ",
        "99 5.2 Potentially disruptive shocks: climate change and conflict The analysis to date has reviewed projections that assume past trends continue subject to potential deviations that can be anticipated and modelled (e.g. changing inequality). However, other unpredictable shocks have potentially more disruptive impacts \u2014 for example climate change, conflict, natural disasters, health shocks and food price hikes (Zselecsky and Yosef, 2014). This section considers the potential impact of climate change and of conflict \u2014 two types of shocks that we explore further in subsequent chapters of this report. 5.2.1 Climate change and its impact ( 52 ) The nature of poverty leads individuals to be susceptible to even small shocks, but large shocks like those that result from climate change or natural disasters may not only keep poor people poor but also push more people into poverty (Gutierrez, 2014). It is estimated that climate change could render 10.1 million additional people poor by mid- century if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated (Cruz et al., 2015: 25). Until and beyond 2030, climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of extreme weather (IPCC, 2014). This could affect poverty in two ways. First, over the long term (i.e. by end-century), a changing climate may reduce access to potable water, decrease nutrients in crops and limit growing seasons, thereby changing the variety of livestock, habitats and crops. In SSA, climate change may reduce crop yields by up to 90 % (Schellnhuber et al., 2013). Second, more proximately, it is likely to increase natural disasters, resulting in loss of assets, income or livelihoods, in addition to causing injury and illness and damage to infrastructure (UNDP, 2008). Potential long- term consequences include the loss of educational opportunity, malnutrition and disease and reduced economic growth. The poor tend to suffer disproportionally from climate change, both because they tend to rely more heavily on the environment for their livelihoods (Angelsen et al., 2014; Carter et al., 2006) and because they may not be so able to protect themselves and recover from shocks (Hallegatte and Dumas, 2009). Jacoby et al. (2011) estimate that, in rural India, owing to rising food prices and reduced land productivity, an extra 5 % of people could remain on less than USD 2 a day by 2040 (2005 PPP). It follows that climate change is likely to exacerbate inequalities in income and other dimensions of human development. Disaster-related climate change will affect rural populations the most: between 176 million and 319 million extremely poor people living in 45 different countries will be most exposed to drought, extreme temperature and floods, the majority in south Asia and SSA (Shepherd et al., 2013). Shepherd et al. predict that, by 2030, 11 countries will have not only high numbers of people in poverty but also a high risk of multi-hazard exposure, as well as poor capacity to minimise the impacts of these risks: Bangladesh, DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. The potential macroeconomic effects and destruction of already limited infrastructure could reduce governments\u2019 capacity to address the needs of the poor. Furthermore, existing safety nets may not be well suited to address the needs of people affected by climate change. For example, climate change and disasters have the potential to change ( 52 ) This is adapted from Hoy and Samman (2014). ",
        "100 the composition of poverty, leaving safety nets poorly suited to address increasing poverty rates (de la Fuente and Dercon, 2009). Moreover, long-term support is likely to be needed for those suffering the greatest effects of disasters, and fragile or poorly equipped governments are not well placed to provide these services (ibid.). Furthermore, many countries with a high disaster risk are also at a high conflict risk, highlighting the vulnerability of poor people and the nearly poor in coming years (Harris et al., 2013). Econometric studies based on historical data about how changes in weather patterns have affected growth estimate a large impact from climate change. In the medium term, a 1 \u00b0 Celsius increase in temperature has translated into a reduction in growth rate by almost 2 percentage points, which would have had significant effects on poverty (Dell et al., 2012). Projecting these historical trends forward may not be reasonable, especially given that a country\u2019s ability to adapt is likely to change over time (World Bank, 2014). As such, a good deal of uncertainty surrounds the extent to which these studies are relevant for considering the effect of climate change on growth (and poverty) decades into the future. 5.2.2 Conflict and its impact Conflict causes poverty, and there is some evidence that the reverse also holds (Rohwerder, 2014). The impact of conflict is arguably more severe than that of other external shocks \u2018because of the deliberate destruction of livelihoods\u2019 (Goodhand, 2001: 4). However, the trends are more positive than those for climate change. Deaths from conflict have fallen by 90 % since the 1950s (Brown and Selvadurai, 2011). Predictions made about the future likelihood of conflict predict a sharp reduction. For example, Hegre et al. (2011) develop a complex model on the basis of a 1970-2009 dataset for 169 countries that establishes changes between no armed conflict, minor conflict and major conflict and a range of predictors. On the basis of this model, they predict that the share of the world\u2019s countries in conflict will fall by half. They point to: \u2026 a continued decline in the proportion of the world\u2019s countries that have internal armed conflict, from about 15 % in 2009 to 7 % in 2050. The decline is particularly strong in the Western Asia and North Africa region, and less clear in Africa South of Sahara. The remaining conflict countries will increasingly be concentrated in East, Central, and southern Africa and in East and south Asia (p. 1). The primary reason for the decline is that the most important predictors, the infant mortality rate and education levels, are expected to improve. In related work, Hegre et al. (2015) also point to the importance of UN peace-keeping missions. However, the story is not all positive. While traditional armed conflicts are declining, evidence points to an increase in organised crime and trafficking, civil unrest owing to global economic shocks and terrorism (World Bank, 2011b). Moreover, there is the potential for global circumstances to change in ways that accentuate the risk of conflict. Future risks include rivalry among great powers; the proliferation of weapons; low-cost wars; the failure of international governance to accommodate new powers; ageing populations and youth bulges; resource competition; and market volatility (Brown and Selvadurai, 2011). Moreover, the form conflict itself takes could change. For example, conflict could move into new domains such as cyberspace, space and robotics, and links between terrorist and criminal networks could increase (ibid.). ",
        "101 CHAPTER 6: Country categories and reasons for differential progress This chapter proposes new country categories based on existing criteria (income, LDCs, fragility etc.) and progress (both absolute and relative) in reducing extreme poverty as analysed in Chapters 2 and 3. It also explores, using these new categories, reasons for progress and persisting poverty at a country level. The analysis is based on the USD 1.25 a day extreme poverty line, expressed in 2005 PPP. This means there may be some minor discrepancies between figures quoted in this chapter and previous chapters, which used the USD 1.90 a day (2011 PPP) extreme poverty line. Each of the existing country categories has its uses but also drawbacks. As a whole, they produce groups of countries that are rather too large and heterogeneous. Finer distinctions may be more useful for international policymakers. This is not a matter of dividing developing countries against each other or undermining solidarity; the smaller categories are simply a basis for developing guides on appropriate policies for different groups of countries. As Chapter 1 discussed, issue-based categories (LDCs, FCAS) are useful in motivating international policy actions, since they draw attention to common impediments to development for groups of countries. The LDC category draws attention to growth, economic vulnerability and human asset constraints, the FCAS category to institutions and the risk of conflict. However, this chapter argues for an additional, more focused, category of SCAPS, as FCAS is a very wide category with significant definitional problems attached. As Section 6.3.1 shows, SCAPS are countries whose performance in poverty reduction is way behind that of other FCAS, which in turn have performed more like developing countries as a whole. The MICs is an especially large category of countries, without the commonalities of the issue-based categories, beyond having a common national income bracket. The chapter explores the utility of further breaking down this category by levels of income as well as introducing an element of progress in poverty reduction. The advantages of this proposed country categorisation are that it draws attention to countries that are systematically and over a long period doing better or worse in terms of poverty reduction at similar levels of income. This can help decision-makers decide which countries to focus on; when they understand the reasons for progress or the lack of it, they can then strategise as to what sort of focus they should have and how. This analysis is ideally carried out at country level, and in collaboration with national authorities. However, given the number of developing countries, it will help national analysts to have a starting point and an idea of where a particular country fits into the global landscape on poverty. Arguably, the world needs to pay less attention to countries that have made and continue to make good progress and more to those lagging behind. A caveat, from a poverty eradication point of view, is that there may be subnational areas where extreme poverty stubbornly persists, even in countries that are otherwise doing well. These may warrant continued attention. ",
        "102 Compared with other new country categories produced in recent years, this approach has the advantage of being comprehensive and systematic, rather than selective or ad hoc ( 53 ). Subsequent sections (6.2, 6.3, 6.4) explore progress on poverty in MICs, FCAS and LDCs in greater depth, and look for reasons for progress or the lack of it. There is also a brief exploration of \u2018commodity exporters\u2019 \u2014 a category that overlaps with the others (Section 6.5). In searching for reasons for progress or the lack of it, we investigated the following factors (see Annex 10 for definitions): \u2022 key economic indicators , such as GNI per capita; FDI net inflows; government revenue as a percentage of GDP; and median aid per poor person; \u2022 key governance indicators , such as government effectiveness; voice and accountability; political stability and the absence of violence/terrorism (PSAV); and the World Bank\u2019s CPIA score; \u2022 human development indicators , including U5MR; government expenditure on health; government expenditure on education; and gender equality; \u2022 key environmental indicators , such as the Environmental Protection Index (EPI); countries\u2019 exposure to climate change score; their vulnerability to climate change score; and their sensitivity to climate change score; \u2022 quality of a country\u2019s policy framework , as measured by the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network (CPAN) Poverty Eradication Policy Preparedness Index (Bird et al., 2017). This indicator is currently available for only 26 countries, and even though these cover around 90 % of the world\u2019s extreme poor people, they are only used to discuss individual countries. It is important to stress a caveat about this analysis: it investigates associations, convergences and divergences between trends and, on this basis, develops conclusions about the most important plausible driving factors in distinguishing countries making solid progress from those making less or regressing. The analysis shows that several groups of countries should be of significant concern to international decision-makers as they seek to support implementation of the SDGs. These include L-LMICs, FCAS and commodity exporters regressing or making little progress on poverty. L-LMICs and FCAS making weaker progress or regressing on poverty include over a quarter of the world\u2019s extreme poor (251 million people). L-LMICs and FCAS making stronger progress account for almost half of the extreme poor (481 million). Within the FCAS category, the 14 SCAPS \u2014 severely conflict-affected LDCs \u2014 are especially worthy of increased attention. While governance improvements will be critical in FCAS, governance is also a key issue for weaker progress L-LMICs, not all of which are FCAS. There is a potential environmental \u2013 growth trade-off, especially in south Asia. However, in general, there is a large variation in relationships between environmental protection and progress on poverty. This does not hold for vulnerability to climate change, which is ( 53 ) Other groupings have been specific to a few countries \u2014 for example the Asian Tigers, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), the Civets (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, South Africa), the \u2018frontier economies\u2019 and so on. ",
        "103 a characteristic, and often a deepening one, of countries making no or little progress on poverty across FCAS and LDCs. 6.1 New categories combining income with progress In this chapter, to measure progress, we consider how countries have fared in terms of both absolute and relative progress in reducing extreme poverty. In Chapter 1, we showed that how we assess country performance varies depending on whether we look at absolute change over time (countries where initial poverty levels were high have had more scope for change, and therefore have tended to perform better) or relative reductions in poverty (countries with lower initial deprivations have tended to perform better given that we measure change relative to initial levels). One way to integrate the insights from these two measures is to rank countries according to both relative and absolute measures, as in Table 6.2. Absolute progress is the (annualised) percentage point reduction in the poverty ratio; relative progress is the annualised percentage progress on the starting level. The period of time this chapter covers is 2000-2012. Table 6.1 shows what proportion of the world\u2019s extreme poor are in each income-based category of country. LMICs include 63 %, of which a quarter are in India \u2014 clearly still not a viable category for analysis as it stands. L-LMICs are perhaps a particular concern, because in many cases they have only just made it out of low-income status and this achievement may be fragile and because, including India, they account for nearly half of poor people in developing countries. Without India they still account for almost a quarter. Table 6.1: Proportion of the world\u2019s extreme poor per income categories and subcategories Income group (threshold as GNI) % of poor (USD 1.25, 2005 PPP) Number of countries MIC (less than USD 12 736, more than USD 1 045) 75.27 84 UMIC (less than USD 12 736, more than USD 4 125) 11.98 41 LMIC (less than USD 4 125, more than USD 1 045) 63.29 43 L-LMIC 46.23 22 L-LMICs excluding India 22.06 21 U-LMIC 17.05 21 LIC (less than USD 1 045) 24.73 25 VLIC (less than USD 525) 11.20 9 NB: This is as a share among the 109 developing countries with comparable data for the 1990s and 2000s. Any discrepancies with earlier chapters may stem from the use of 2005 rather than 2011 PPP figures. Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database. The use of a combined measure produces groups that appear plausible based on general knowledge about development progress. The majority of developing countries (out of a total of 82 in this analysis) figure in the moderate (subtotal 34) or weak progress (subtotal 26) categories, with a smaller number also in the strong progress (12) category; relatively few are in the regression group (10). The regression group, interestingly, is not entirely made up of FCAS, indicating there are other sources of vulnerability at a national level. In addition, there is a group of countries without adequate data on progress (15). Since this analysis was made using the USD 1.25 poverty line and 2005 PPP, we re-present the results using the USD 1.90 line and 2011 PPP, and make a comparison between the two analyses, in Annex 9. We then investigate the relationship with modified country income-based categories, and overlay this with LDCs, FCAS and SCAPS. ",
        "104 The modified income categories include: \u2022 very low-income countries (VLICs), which are a subset of LICs and which are significantly poorer than the low-/middle-income threshold of USD 1 045: VLICs have a GNI per capita of less than USD 525 ( 54 ); \u2022 lower and upper LMICs (L-LMICs and U-LMICs): This distinction is considered useful because it acknowledges the arbitrary nature of the low-/middle-income distinction, which divides countries that share structural and other characteristics, such as share of employment in agriculture or income levels ( 55 ). Table 6.2 groups countries based on progress on poverty reduction as well as income. Moreover, it also includes VLICs (in red letters), FCAS (in italics) and SCAPS (in capital letters). Some observations stemming from the analysis of Table 6.2 are as follows. \u2022 Few LICs feature in either the strong progress or the regression groups. This is partly a function of a number of them having become LMICs. \u2022 Few LDCs feature in the strong progress category, but they constitute a majority of the regress countries, perhaps a confirmation of the slow process of graduation from LDC status. We return to the analysis of progress in LDCs in Section 6.4 below. \u2022 VLICs tend to be in the bottom two progress categories, though there are some exceptions. \u2022 LMICs are spread across all four progress categories. This is a very wide grouping, and looking at (and understanding the causes of) progress in poverty reduction may be particularly useful for policymaking. To do this more sensitively the following analysis divides LMICs into two groups: U-LMICs and L-LMICs. \u2022 UMICs are concentrated in the top two progress categories, consistent with a picture of UMICs as \u2018take-off\u2019 countries and with the fact that some have been promoted from lower-middle-income status during the period since 2000, and are therefore by definition doing well. There may still be a \u2018middle-income trap\u2019 affecting some UMICs, but this is not discussed here. ( 54 ) As of 1 July 2015, low-income economies were defined as those with a GNI per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method, of USD 1 045 or less in 2014; middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than USD 1 045 but less than USD 12 736; high-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of USD 12 736 or more. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income economies are separated at a GNI per capita of USD 4 125. ( 55 ) The IMF has made this latter distinction in identifying what it calls low-income developing countries (LIDCs) (IMF, 2014). Of course, the LIDC category postpones the arbitrary threshold to a higher level. It also acknowledges the very wide range of national incomes in the large MIC category of 107 countries, which makes it difficult to use the category for analytical and policy purposes. The LIDC threshold is twice the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association threshold, and was defined in 2014 as a GNI per capita of USD 2 390. ",

        "106 Among both LICs and LMICs, average poverty rates across progress subcategories diverge considerably over time (Figure 6.1). This divergence would be even more marked if the data were population weighted. However, these graphs point to the extent of the differentiation among progress groups over time.

Most remaining LICs are also FCAS (italics in Table 6.2) or SCAPS (capitals): the exceptions (those not SCAPS or FCAS) are Benin (regression), Malawi and Togo (weak progress), Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Tanzania (moderate progress) and Cambodia (strong progress). Not ",
        "107 surprisingly, the SCAPS are concentrated among the weaker performers. Among VLICs (in red), only Malawi is not a SCAPS or a FCAS. This would suggest our first group could be composed of low-income FCAS states and other regress/weak progress LICs. A second group could comprise the rest of the LICs, which are making better progress. These include both VLICs and other LICs. Similarly, a third group could comprise the weak and regressing L-LMICs and a fourth the moderately and strongly progressing L-LMICs. Groups 5, 6, 7 and 8 are the corresponding groups among the U-LMICs, and among UMICs ( 56 ). Group 1: LICs making weak progress: Benin, Burundi, CAR Comoros, DRC, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Togo. Group 2: Higher-progress LICs: Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda.

Group 4: Higher-progress L-LMICs: Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Vietnam. Group 5: Lower-progress U-LMICs: Cape Verde, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Nigeria, Philippines, Swaziland, Timor-Leste. Group 6: Higher-progress U-LMICs: Bhutan, Bolivia, Congo, El Salvador, Indonesia, Morocco, Sri Lanka. Group 7: UMICs making little progress: Belize, Gabon, Saint Lucia, Suriname. Group 8: UMICs making moderate or strong progress: Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Fiji, Iraq, Maldives, Mexico, Namibia, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, South Africa, Thailand. As eight groups may still be too many to better understand constraints and challenges, we could propose the following. \u2022 The LIC/L-LMIC division could break down partially and Group 1 could also include weakly progressing L-LMICs (Group 3 above). This partially follows the IMF\u2019s LIDC categorisation but differentiates its L-LMIC group by progress. Section 6.2 explains how this group of MICs is especially worthy of strong attention from the international community as it is experiencing a much greater set of challenges than other L-LMICs. \u2022 Higher-progress L-LMICs and higher-progress U-LMICs (Groups 4 and 6 above) could be merged into one category if the countries have an adequate policy ( 56 ) Large federal countries like India and Nigeria would ideally need to be divided into their constituent parts, and these redistributed across these categories. However, this has not been undertaken for this exercise. ( 57 ) As noted under Table 6.2, Yemen is unlikely to remain in the moderate progress category, given sustained conflict. ",
        "108 framework on poverty eradication ( 58 ). If there remains work to be done in this regard, they could remain in the lower-performing countries category. \u2022 Most UMICs now have little extreme poverty or deprivation, or, like Brazil or China, have an end to these firmly in their sights. The major exception is Angola, also an LDC, which is making moderate progress in poverty reduction but from a very high base. As such, it could be considered in a category on its own \u2014 or may be better considered in the cross-cutting category of commodity exporters (see Section 6.5). Given the small populations and numbers of poor people involved we can discount Group 7 for the purposes of this analysis. And, while there are countries in Group 8 with still high numbers (if not incidence) of extreme poverty, these have generally made good progress historically. If they also have an adequate policy framework in place (as, e.g., Brazil, China and South Africa all do) (Bird et al., 2017), such progress can be expected to continue, if not necessarily at the same rate as previously. So finally, we have four important groups, with SCAPS a fifth subcategory. Group 1: LICs making weak progress: Benin, Burundi, CAR, Comoros, DRC, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Togo. Lower-progress L-LMICs: Cameroon, Djibouti, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Laos, Lesotho, Mauritania, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Senegal, Yemen (placed here given its protracted conflict), Zambia. Group 2: Higher-progress LICs: Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda. Group 3: Lower-progress U-LMICs: Cape Verde, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Nigeria, Philippines, Swaziland, Timor-Leste. Group 4: Higher-progress L-LMICs: Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Vietnam. Higher-progress U-LMICs: Bhutan, Bolivia, Congo, El Salvador, Indonesia, Morocco, Sri Lanka. Note that SCAPS would form an important subgroup (see Section 6.3.1): Afghanistan, Burundi, CAR, Chad, DRC, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Timor-Leste. 6.2 Progress in middle-income countries MICs are placed across all progress categories. For the group as a whole, there are associations between several of the indicators investigated and stronger and weaker progress on poverty: growth in national income per capita and human development indicators such as gender equality, education expenditure and the U5MR. Analysis of policy frameworks suggests stronger-progress countries typically have stronger policy frameworks as of 2015, but there is no analysis of trends prior to this (Bird et al., 2017). ( 58 ) This can be assessed using a baseline policy database for 2015 prepared by CPAN for the 31 countries with more than 5 million extreme poor in 2011, or from first principles. ",
        "109 There is divergence between groups of MICs having made higher and lower progress on poverty, in the following domains: \u2022 FDI trends (with greater FDI in lower-progress countries); \u2022 government revenue as a percentage of GDP (with lower-progress countries having lower revenues, though in recent years to 2014 there was a sudden convergence produced by high commodity prices); \u2022 aid per poor person (lower in lower-progress countries); \u2022 government effectiveness (lower in lower-progress countries). There is also divergence on: \u2022 health expenditure; \u2022 two out of three environmental indicators where it was possible to make a comparison (see Figure 6.2). Thus, there are several potential reasons for the greater progress some MICs have made. For example, greater FDI in weaker-progress countries, often invested in mineral resources, linked with lower government revenues as a percentage of GDP, may be constraining growth as a source of progress on poverty reduction. Conversely, higher aid per poor person linked with greater government effectiveness and stability, since aid often tracks the latter, may be an especially facilitating factor for poverty reduction. Aid also often supports increased government health expenditure, which is important in reducing impoverishment. It might be thought that FCAS status combined with mineral dependence would provide an adequate explanation for lesser progress on poverty reduction, but we suggest below that it is not. As shown below in Section 6.3.1 (Table 6.4), six out of the 10 regress countries presented previously in Table 6.2 are FCAS, and this would appear to be a major potential explanation for regress among MICs. Seven out of the 10 regress countries are MICs. Zambia is a regressing MIC that is not an FCAS, but it is a commodity exporter (copper). Taking this into account, it is tempting to suggest that a combination of high dependence on natural resource-based exports and the poor governance records typical of FCAS (lower government effectiveness and/or lower revenues, as mentioned above) explains the regression in the middle-income FCAS and in Zambia, but other explanations may also be relevant, such as the existence of pockets of persistent or worsening poverty in some parts of a country. But even this may be linked to resource dependence, governance issues and the redistribution of natural resource revenues ( 59 ). Weakly progressing LMICs include Kenya and Nigeria (which are FCAS, with Nigeria also a major commodity exporter) but also several substantial non-FCAS such as Laos, the Philippines and Senegal (of which only Laos is highly mineral-dependent). At the same time, the moderately progressing LMICs include several FCAS and there is one FCAS among the strongly progressing LMICs (Pakistan). ( 59 ) Zambia scores low on the Poverty Eradication Policy Preparedness Index, for example (see Bird et al., 2017). ",

As such, it is hard to explain lack of progress on poverty among some MICs by FCAS or commodity exporter status alone. Other things clearly matter. As pointed to above, quality of policy frameworks in terms of focus on the drivers of poverty reduction (CPAN, 2014) may be a factor (see Bird et al., 2017). For example, Kenya and Nigeria still have ",
        "111 some room for improvement in this regard, whereas the Philippines has quite a strong poverty reduction policy framework (ibid.). We can confirm the inability of FCAS status to explain progress by scanning the major LMICs that have made greater progress: Bangladesh, Congo, Sudan and Sri Lanka are indeed all FCAS, with two of them that are or have been also mineral exporters. However, most LMICs making greater progress are not FCAS, and only one (Indonesia) is a major mineral exporter. Of the strongest LMIC performers, Bhutan, Bolivia and Vietnam are major mineral exporters, Pakistan is a FCAS and Papua New Guinea is also a mineral exporter (gold, copper and oil). Therefore, neither FCAS status nor mineral exporting is by itself a bar to progress on poverty in MICs. A further factor is the level of challenge or disadvantage facing MICs, as discussed in Section 2.3, although this analysis was not disaggregated by country income category. MICs that were also LDCs, FCAS, landlocked or in SSA were more likely to be making less progress than other MICs. 6.2.1 Further disaggregating to U- and L-LMIC, and UMIC progress groups As the large number of MICs may obscure critical differences among poorer and richer countries, and in order to generate a more precise picture, we also investigate the associations between a number of development indicators ( 60 ) and trends on poverty by disaggregating MICs into L-LMICs, U-LMICs and UMICs. A key point that has emerged is that governance issues are fundamental to progress on poverty for the L-LMICs with weaker progress on poverty. In the UMICs , GNI per capita, U5MR and gender equality have converged between countries with weaker progress and those with moderate and stronger progress on poverty, suggesting weaker-progress countries are catching up. On the other hand, trends in government revenue (as a percentage of GDP) and government expenditure on health diverge in favour of stronger-progress countries \u2014 which could help explain the lower progress some UMICs continue to make on poverty. Among UMICs, weaker-progress countries do better on FDI inflows, but also, unexpectedly, on government effectiveness and aid per poor person; they also do increasingly better over time. In the case of FDI inflows, weaker-progress UMICs overtook stronger-progress UMICs in 2007 and then diverged significantly. FDI flows tend to have been linked to investment in mineral extraction, which is generally capital intensive and not particularly pro-poor. It is also the weaker-progress UMICs that generate higher revenues. However, translating higher levels of government revenues and aid into stronger progress on poverty is clearly not straightforward; some countries at this level do it, others do not. As mentioned above, the LMICs contain a very large proportion of the world\u2019s extreme poor (63 %, or 731 million people in 2011), and are therefore a critical part of the analysis. We have disaggregated LMICs into U-LMICs and L-LMICs (using the IMF LIDC threshold of twice the LIC/MIC threshold) and by stronger or weaker progress on poverty. On this basis, we have deepened our investigation of possible drivers of ( 60 ) GNI per capita, FDI flows, U5MR, government effectiveness, PSAV, revenues as a percentage of GDP, aid per poor person, environmental protection, gender equality and health and education expenditure. ",
        "112 progress on poverty. One particular country group, L-LMICs with weaker progress, should receive special attention from the international community. \u2022 For L-LMICs, neither growth nor human development is the primary issue. In general, all lower-middle-income groups have been growing or improving their levels of human development at similar average rates. (Clearly this is not the case at country level and for every year, where there is more variety in growth performance. For example, within L-LMICs making weaker progress or regressing, Lesotho in 2012 recorded GNI per capita annual growth of -0.2 % over 2011, compared with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s 9.0 %.) \u2022 L-LMICs with weaker progress on poverty have less government revenue (as a percentage of GDP) over time than other LMICs, and end the period at the bottom of the range of MICs\u2019 performance on revenue, having started the period at the top. They also have stagnant levels of aid, compared with rising aid for higher- progress LMIC groups (both U- and L-LMICs) and low and diverging levels of government effectiveness. Like the weaker-progress LDCs and FCAS, they have stronger FDI growth as a percentage of GDP. FDI is driven by mineral extraction opportunities. So, for example, the highest level of FDI as a proportion of GDP in 2012 among L-LMICs making weak progress or regressing was in Mauritania (28.6 %), highly dependent on minerals (30-50 % of its GDP in 2011-2014); the lowest was in Kenya (0.3 %), barely dependent (less than 5 % of its GDP in 2011- 2014). \u2022 Which are these L-LMICs making weak progress on poverty or regressing? Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mauritania, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and Zambia (regress); Djibouti, Kenya, Laos, Lesotho and Senegal (weak progress). Several of these are strong mineral exporters \u2014 Laos, Mauritania and Zambia; Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Myanmar/Burma are medium-level mineral exporters. In some of these cases, the proportion of GDP derived from minerals has been in decline over the past few years of declining commodity prices ( 61 ). \u2022 However, five of these L-LMICs making weaker progress have less than 5 % of GDP dependent on mineral extraction, so weak progress on poverty cannot be blamed on mineral extraction alone. The combination of lower and diverging government revenue as a proportion of GDP, lower aid and weaker government effectiveness, in some cases underpinned by greater FDI in minerals, suggests governance issues are fundamental to progress on poverty for the L-LMICs with weaker progress on poverty. Section 6.5 discusses this issue further in the context of mineral-dependent countries. 6.2.2 A trade-off between environmental and poverty progress? Poverty varies markedly in relation to the EPI (Figure 6.3, left hand panel), and this is true for progress on growth and the level of environmental performance achieved as well. But countries that on average are increasing their per capita growth rates in general appear to have better EPI scores (Figure 6.3, right hand panel) ( 61 ) Data from the World Bank\u2019s Total Natural Resource Rents as a percentage of GDP: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.TOTL.RT.ZS ",

On the disaggregated analysis of MICs, the EPI is generally positively associated with income level, except in the case of L-LMICs making strong progress, which have a low EPI. This can suggest some trade-offs in some countries: Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Vietnam and Yemen, some of which are marked on the second graph in Figure 6.3. Low EPI scores in this group are mainly in south Asia \u2014 pinpointing a location for an environmental\u2013growth trade-off. An additional finding is that there is a general association between reducing climate vulnerability and income level, but that L-LMICs with lower progress on poverty are reducing their higher levels of vulnerability more slowly than other groups and their exposure and sensitivity is stagnating while those of other groups are declining (Figure 6.4). This suggests a really pressing need to bring together climate change and poverty reduction discourse and policies at international and national levels, especially, again, for this group of countries.

These are not related with growth or human development, but rather with a ",
        "114 combination of low government revenue and aid per poor person, relatively weak government effectiveness and significant environmental challenges, especially in south Asia. Some but not all depend significantly on FDI in mineral extraction. 6.3 Fragile and conflict-affected states We have already observed that FCAS status influences progress on poverty, especially among LICs, and to a lesser degree among the poorer LMICs as well. It is therefore critical to unpack what it is about this status that particularly influences progress, but also where an absence of progress on poverty has been a factor in promoting conflict. Box 6.1 briefly reviews what the literature has to tell us on this issue. Box 6.1: Poverty, fragility and conflict in the development literature Studies of fragility and poverty have long emphasised a mutually reinforcing dynamic: poverty contributes to fragility and fragility deepens poverty. As Lockhart and Vincent (2013) state, \u2018vicious cycles of weak governance, poverty and violence\u2019 may perpetuate conflict traps and fragility outcomes. On the one hand, an increase in poverty may increase the likelihood of civil conflict as populations attempt to gain redress for profound deprivation and societal inequalities. Indeed, low incomes and slow growth have been found to be key variables in predicting the onset of war and so acting as a trigger for fragility, with the poorest 10 % of countries as much as 18 times more likely to experience conflict in a decade relative to the richest 10 % (Roesch, 2014). On a country level and using panel data, Deininger (2003) corroborates these links, finding that a lack of economic development in Uganda was associated with an increase in the incidence of civil strife between 1992 and 2000. Similarly, Justino (2004) finds that public expenditure on social services in India helps mitigate civil unrest, mainly through its effect on poverty reduction. These relationships can be especially strong when poverty coincides with ethnic or other identity derived from birth. Such \u2018horizontal inequalities\u2019 have been frequent drivers of intra-state conflict (Stewart, 2008; Langer et al., 2012). Fragility can also directly and indirectly exacerbate poverty. A seminal study by Collier (1999) spanning 92 countries between 1960 and 1989 found national incomes following a 7-year civil war were 15 % lower compared with in situations of no war. On a micro level, previous studies have also observed that livelihood outcomes and household poverty in turn are sometimes a function of geography (Pain and Lautze, 2002), perceptions of risk in the immediate and surrounding area (Block and Webb, 2001; Rockmore, 2011) and actual exposure to conflict. Several studies show experiences of conflict are closely associated with lower educational attainment (see Mallett and Slater, 2012: 16-17; Shields and Paulson, 2014; Diwakar, 2015), which is in turn associated with worse poverty and livelihood outcomes in many instances. Justino (2009) notes effects of civil war including destruction of assets and employment opportunities, forced displacement and changes in household composition that may also result in lower human capital and income. Household savings in these situations may be exhausted as families have increased pressures stemming from both a lower productivity base and increased spending to care for those injured by conflict (Justino, 2009). A single episode of violence could thus provoke descents into poverty and the intergenerational transmission of poverty. In this way, experiences of war and exposure to physical violence can have significant detrimental effects on well-being outcomes, sometimes for many years after the event. Source: Diwakar et al. (2016). Definitions of FCAS have varied a great deal, and different definitions have produced different groups and lists of states, extending to over 100 in total. However, there is some consensus on a core group of 45 FCAS \u2014 which we have made use of for this report, as explained in Chapter 1 and Annex 4. The substantial overlap between the focused list of 45 FCAS and other analytical definitions \u2014 LDCs, SSA, VLICs and most climate-vulnerable countries \u2014 is striking and underlines the importance of multiple simultaneous causes of fragility (see Figure 6.5) ( 62 ). It also suggests the potential value of focusing attention on a smaller subset of the most fragile within even this list of 45. ( 62 ) This is a theme developed by the 2015 OECD States of Fragility Report. However, this is not made use of here because its categorisations have come under question. See Scherer (2015), who argues that over half the countries have been misallocated. ",
        "115 A focused approach to the analysis of FCAS is based on the classic political regime/governance characteristics: authority, capacity and legitimacy. This issue-based approach helps identify structural similarities and makes it easier to draw out the policy implications for external actors. This analysis identifies one group of 15 countries of the over 110 countries analysed that have low scores for all three characteristics: Afghanistan, CAR, DRC, Equatorial Guinea, Haiti, Iraq, Lesotho, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Turkmenistan and Yemen (Ziaja et al., 2012). Most of these are in the overlapping areas in Figure 6.5. This group also accounts for the largest numbers of extreme poor among FCAS and has experienced a relatively slow rate of poverty reduction. Their poor governance is also associated with extremely volatile economic growth and a steep reduction in aid over time. The growth volatility suggests the pertinence of preoccupation with economic vulnerability and could be one basis for international policymaking for FCAS, as it is for LDCs. Figure 6.5: Intersections between fragility, geography, climate vulnerability and LDC status Legend: Red = climate-vulnerable countries, as scored by their disaster risk management capacities (bottom 20 in world rankings for 2014). NB: Papua New Guinea is the only country in the bottom 20 rankings to not feature in this Venn diagram. Source: Authors. 6.3.1 Severely conflict-affected poor states There are 14 SCAPS (defined by the recent presence of a UN or regional military peace mission) that are also LDCs: Afghanistan, Burundi, CAR, Chad, DRC, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan and Timor-Leste. Eleven out of fourteen SCAPS are included in the central overlap between FCAS, LDCs and SSA in Figure 6.5; the others are not in SSA but are LDCs (Afghanistan, Haiti, Timor- ",
        "116 Leste). One out of the 14 SCAPS is a new country, South Sudan, which was admitted as an LDC in 2012. All four of these sit in the relevant overlap areas of the Venn diagram. Since SCAPS are defined as FCAS LDCs, the interesting part of this overlap is with SSA. When we focus on the subset of SCAPS only, the picture changes quite markedly. First, the share of people who are poor at the start of the period of the analysis is much higher than for all FCAS \u2014 about 16 percentage points for extreme poverty and 20 percentage points for ultra poverty. The gap when we look at simple country averages is similar. Indeed, this group alone accounts for most of the difference in poverty rates between FCAS and non-FCAS. The average for the non-SCAPS countries is very close to the average for all non-FCAS (Figure 6.6).

Source: Computed from data in PovcalNet.org database and WDI. A second key point is that SCAPS have still been able to reduce poverty. While they started with higher levels of poverty, the rate of poverty reduction has been broadly similar to that for all other groups \u2014 that is, all FCAS and all non-FCAS. The final key point is the lack of convergence that might be expected, given that SCAPS start from such a high level of poverty. One possible explanation is that the depth of poverty ( 63 ) is much greater in SCAPS \u2014 22.8 % of the poverty line in SCAPS, compared with 10.4 % in FCAS non-SCAPS and 4.56 % in other developing countries (non-FCAS, non-SCAPS). This makes it harder to take people out of poverty. The group average may also obscure the reality that some countries may be making rapid progress on poverty reduction whereas others, still in the middle of a conflict, or with intermittent conflict, may experience increased poverty. Turning to further analysis of the differences between SCAPS and other FCAS, growth in the former is lower than in other FCAS, perhaps because it takes a longer time to rebuild ( 63 ) The average level of consumption of those below the poverty line. ",
        "117 with lower revenues and aid, and growth has also been especially volatile. This is especially the case for Liberia and Timor-Leste, which between them have four out of the five highest and lowest growth rates since 2000. Annual GNI per capita growth rates vary from -76 % (Liberia in 2003) to +188 % (Liberia in 2004), with all the other top and bottom scores either -15 % or less or +35 % or more ( 64 ). There have been large differences between average SCAPS and other FCAS and non- FCAS average country scores on government effectiveness and PSAV, although the PSAV scores have converged with FCAS as a whole, indicating the resolution of some SCAPS conflicts in recent years. Government effectiveness is also converging, albeit more slowly. There is some overlap between countries with the weakest governance indicators, and the SCAPS (six out of 14 SCAPS are among the weakest in terms of governance indicators), but eight of the weakest governance countries are not SCAPS and eight SCAPS are not among the weakest governance countries. This suggests weak governance is one feature underlying extreme fragility but that there are others.

Analysis also points to relative under-aiding of SCAP countries (see Figure 6.11 below) when compared with other groups. This, despite improving governance, may come as a surprise to some policymakers. Most are well aware that aid levels in Afghanistan were very high. Even recently, aid was over USD 400 per poor person. However, Afghanistan was an exception among the SCAPS.

Source: Computed from WDI 2015 and https://data.oecd.org/ A consequence of the under-aiding of SCAPS is the failure to invest sufficiently quickly in the rehabilitation of infrastructure. This remains a key policy challenge. While the third Financing for Development conference in Addis Ababa in 2015 stressed the need for infrastructure, conflict-affected countries were the only group not specially mentioned as needing particular support, though the outcome document does give some weight to conflict and the financing of conflict-affected countries ( 65 ). Our analysis also reinforces the view that climate vulnerability is a key factor in the poverty\u2013conflict nexus. SCAPS are on average much more vulnerable to climate change than other FCAS. The fact that the average vulnerability for FCAS non-SCAPS is close to the average for non-FCAS suggests the need for a strong focus of effort on reducing climate vulnerability in the SCAPS. The case for this is even stronger given the picture of divergence shown in Figure 6.8, which shows SCAPS becoming relatively more vulnerable to climate change over time \u2014 as others become less vulnerable. Current mechanisms for accessing dedicated climate funds seem to favour countries with strong national planning capacities, which would exclude SCAPS, for example. This might make the case for their reform all the more urgent, as Bird et al. (2015) argue. ( 65 ) UNGA (2016), paras 66 and 67, for example. ",

These countries are both LDCs and FCAS, thus face more impediments to development than other FCAS. Many of the FCAS making stronger (strong and moderate) progress in poverty reduction are in South and West Asia, but some are in SSA. Many of those without adequate data to assess progress on poverty are likely to fall in the weak or regress categories.

The diverging performance of these two groups on these two indicators is notable. This suggests low-progress FCAS is a group to focus on together with the SCAPS: not all are SCAPS (and none of the SCAPS is in the regression group). The FCAS that have regressed on poverty include several countries with substantial populations. Combining FCAS that regressed with those that had weaker progress gives 24 % of the global extreme poor (234 million), compared with 17 % (169 million) in FCAS with stronger progress.

Lower-progress FCAS have a higher level and diverging trend on FDI as a percentage of GDP, and a somewhat lower but converging trend on government revenues as a percentage of GDP. However, increases in revenue lag behind FDI, which could be an interesting point for further analysis, suggesting that these countries may require additional capacity in terms of negotiating decent revenue packages with investors. In 2011, when the difference in FDI net inflows as a percentage of GDP between the lower- and higher-progress FCAS was highest, Liberia (85 % of GDP constituted by FDI inflows) and Sierra Leone (32 %) led the group of regress/weak performers. It is important to ",
        "121 note that there are also moderate/strong poverty performers with reasonably high FDI to GDP ratios: top of the list was Congo, which registered just over a fifth of its GDP in the form of FDI net inflows. Others are at lower levels. Quality of governance is generally a critical variable determining how well FCAS are able to perform in poverty reduction. There are mixed results in this area. Government effectiveness diverges in the expected direction between FCAS progressing more and less strongly on poverty. However, PSAV scores are better among FCAS experiencing weak progress or regressing on poverty over the period (see Figure 6.10). The median for the group of moderate/strong performers (-1.2) is much lower relative to that of the regress/weak performers (-0.8). This result is driven by high-instability/violence countries like Iraq, Pakistan and Sudan, which have nevertheless progressed on poverty, and a number of small population-stable countries plus Zambia, which have not. If Iraq, Pakistan and Sudan are removed from the analysis, there is little difference between the two groups.

Median aid per poor person has been higher for low-progress FCAS, despite their lower and diverging government effectiveness ( 66 ). This is in a context where aid per poor person in FCAS overall has been significantly lower than for non-FCAS, with this diverging since 1990 from a ratio of 2:1 to a ratio of 5:1. For every USD 1 of aid to non- FCAS, only USD 0.20 is being provided to FCAS, despite the rhetoric of stronger focus and commitment to FCAS of many donors. Aid to FCAS is also very uneven across countries (OECD, 2014). SCAPS receive no more aid than other FCAS (Figure 6.11). An analysis of environmental indicators suggests higher-progress FCAS are less vulnerable to climate change whereas lower-progress countries are becoming more exposed and sensitive to climate change \u2014 similar to the difference mentioned earlier between SCAPS and other FCAS. ( 66 ) The highest aid per poor person recipient in 2013 among weaker-progress FCAS is low-progress Timor- Leste (USD 532). However, there are some exceptions among stronger-progress FCAS: USD 1 114 for Iraq and USD 997 for Yemen. ",

This looks like a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of driving factors \u2014 volatile growth, poor government effectiveness, low aid and environmental vulnerability \u2014 that will make it next to impossible for these countries to progress in the future. One conclusion from this analysis of FCAS is to confirm the developing consensus that the FCAS category has become too broad a group to be analytically useful. The new insight is that the breadth of the FCAS category may also be obscuring the need to focus on a much smaller set of countries where much of the need is concentrated \u2014 the SCAPS ( 67 ). On the other hand, aid has concentrated in FCAS making lower progress on poverty, which indicates a degree of focus on where there is greatest need. 6.4 Least developed countries The LDC category is useful because in its definition it draws attention to some of the structural constraints facing poor countries \u2014 economic vulnerability and human assets. Countries with a population of more than 75 million are not eligible, on the (questionable) assumption that large economies are not structurally constrained. The LDC category has its own built-in dynamic of graduation. Graduation is, however, a prolonged process, and there can be relapses. The key technical criteria for graduation are thresholds of national income, economic vulnerability and a human assets index. The threshold for inclusion in the LDC category was USD 1 035 in the 2015 review. The threshold for graduation is set at 20 % above the inclusion threshold, USD 1 242 in the 2015 review. This is combined with a threshold on an Economic Vulnerability Index and a Human Assets Index. The income-only graduation threshold was twice this \u2014 this enables countries to graduate when the other two criteria are not met. The Human ( 67 ) It may also be obscuring the need to focus on climate-vulnerable countries. ",
        "123 Assets and Economic Vulnerability Indices are composite scores, with the inclusion and graduation threshold now set permanently at 2012 levels ( 68 ). A recommendation then goes to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) for decision, often being resisted by the government of the country concerned. Botswana graduated in 1994, Cape Verde in 2007, Maldives in 2011 and Samoa in 2014. UNGA has also decided that Equatorial Guinea will graduate in 2016 and Vanuatu in 2017. Kiribati was reviewed in 2015 but a decision on whether it would graduate was deferred to 2018, given its high vulnerability. Angola was recommended to graduate as it met the criteria for graduation for the second time in a row in the 2015 meeting. Graduates do have much lower levels of poverty than other LDCs. However, with the exception of Angola, they are all very small countries in population terms. The apparent incentive for countries to remain LDCs may lead countries to argue they should remain LDCs despite progress being achieved. Alternatively, the slow process of graduation may correctly represent the stagnation of LDCs, which have \u2018bumped along the bottom of many graphs\u2019. Here, we examine the extent to which progress has been varied among these 49 countries, and whether we can construct subcategories that are useful to policymakers. As Chapter 3 demonstrated (Section 3.2.3), LDCs have diverged from non-LDCs in terms of progress on reducing poverty. However, whether the LDCs represent a useful category from a poverty eradication angle is questioned by the absence of systematic divergence between graduating countries ( 69 ) and the remaining LDCs in terms of the absolute rate of poverty reduction, and no divergence at all on population in poverty, when population- weighted figures are used. Graduating countries have seen lower rates of poverty, but have reduced these at the same speed as non-graduates. They have also experienced lower U5MRs, but in this case have reduced them less rapidly than non-graduates (Figure 6.12). 6.4.1 LDC progress groups Among the LDCs, rates of progress on poverty and other development indicators have varied greatly. Only three LDCs have seen strong progress on poverty and, of those with data, 22 have experienced weak progress or regress, compared with 16 that have exhibited moderate or strong progress (Table 6.6). ( 68 ) See http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/cdp/ldc/ldc_criteria.shtml ( 69 ) Defined as those that have graduated, or are scheduled by the UN to graduate by 2018. \u2018Income graduates\u2019 are those LDCs that could graduate based on the income criterion alone applied for LDC graduation, ignoring the vulnerability and human assets criteria. This is included purely for interest sake. See http://unohrlls.org/about-ldcs/criteria-for-ldcs/ and Unctad (2014) for details. ",

This confirms that weaker-performing LDCs are struggling with many challenges (along with the weaker-progress FCAS in Section 6.3). This does ",
        "125 not appear to be related to government expenditure on health and education, which diverges in favour of weaker-progress LDCs, as do gender equality outcomes. As with FCAS, the U5MR is higher and reducing more slowly for lower-progress (compared with higher-progress) LDCs, and diverging, even though weaker performers have been spending slightly more on health than the group of better performers. Among the regress/weaker-progress countries, Senegal has the largest relative annual decline (5 %) in U5MR over the period; CAR, Comoros, Lesotho and Mauritania all have relative annual declines of less than 2 %. In contrast, Rwanda (6.1 %) and Cambodia (5.4 %) have made the largest annual relative declines among the moderate/strong performers. Spending on health as a percentage of GDP diverged slightly among the two groups starting from 2000, with weaker-progress countries spending more. Growth is around 2 % lower in lower-progress LDCs, and somewhat more volatile, but is converging slowly with that of higher-progress LDCs. Low-progress countries received FDI at almost double the rate of higher-progress countries by the end of the period, and government revenues were somewhat higher and increasing, converging with those of higher-progress countries. Aid per poor person has been higher in lower-progress countries, as with FCAS, and, again, despite their lower government effectiveness scores. Interestingly, and as with FCAS, these lower-progress countries have higher PSAV and CPIA scores. This is in a context where overall aid to LDCs per poor person has been much lower than aid to non- LDCs, and is diverging (Figure 6.13). Table 6.8 illustrates these points for LDCs that are making the most and least progress on poverty.

Although few LDCs have graduated from this special status, about a third are doing relatively well in terms of progress on poverty. Although there is substantial overlap with FCAS ( 70 ), LDCs experiencing regress or weaker progress on poverty do not face quite the same \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of factors inhibiting poverty reduction: while they exhibit lower and more volatile growth, higher vulnerability and sensitivity to climate change and divergence on under-five mortality, government revenues are a little higher, as are FDI and aid flows and education and health expenditure. The fact that aid is higher to lower-progress countries despite their (on average) lower government effectiveness (though higher PSAV) suggests that donors have recognised the plight of these countries, at least in relative terms. However, when aid per poor person to LDCs is compared with aid to other developing countries, there is a massive and diverging gap, suggesting a lot more could be done to address LDC issues through aid. 6.5 Commodity exporters Minerals occupy an important position in the exports and GDP of many developing countries, though this position has been in decline with the reducing commodity prices of recent years, as recorded by the World Bank\u2019s Total Natural Resource Rents (as a percentage of GDP) dataset ( 71 ). The analyses above repeatedly show that greater amounts of FDI are associated with lower progress on poverty and more volatile growth, and sometimes lower government revenues. FDI is strongly associated with growth in oil and metals, ores and mineral ( 70 ) Weaker-progress countries that are FCAS but not LDCs are Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Guatemala, Kenya and Nigeria. Weaker-progress countries that are LDCs but not FCAS are Benin, Djibouti, Laos, Lesotho, Malawi, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Senegal, Togo and Zambia.

        "127 exports, for example, which account for three quarters of Africa\u2019s growing exports during the period 2000-2011, heavily dependent on selling to the Chinese market (World Bank, 2013b). But FDI in minerals is capital intensive, is often enclave based and does not reduce poverty much directly, unless it is artisan based, as for example in Ethiopian gold mining. The potential indirect benefits depend on how mineral revenues are collected and then spent, both of which are highly political issues. Very few countries in Africa will not be strongly involved in mineral exploitation by 2020 (ibid.). Few countries are as dependent on minerals as Congo (48 % in 2014, down from 69 % in 2011), but 14 developing countries (excluding the former USSR) had over 40 % of GDP from minerals, and 36 had over 20 % during 2011-2014. Among countries with weaker progress on poverty, there is substantial overlap between LDCs, FCAS and commodity exporters, as Table 6.9 indicates. This is much less the case for countries with stronger progress on poverty. The countries listed in red belong to all three country categories. All but three of the commodity exporters belong to all three groups; the exceptions (Malawi, Nigeria, Zambia) are either FCAS or LDCs.

Yellow highlighted countries appear only once; red countries appear three times; the rest appear twice. Growth is highly volatile for groups of commodity exporters, but those with higher levels of progress on poverty have seen higher and increasing levels of growth since 2005, compared with the lower and stagnant growth rates of countries with weaker progress. As such, average growth rates would seem to be a big driver of progress on poverty for commodity exporters. FDI net inflows have been higher in countries with higher levels of progress on poverty and diverge from other commodity exporters\u2019 inflows. Interestingly, higher-progress commodity-exporting countries are the only higher-progress group where education expenditure is consistently higher than for weaker-progress countries, and diverging. ",
        "128 This is a different picture to that obtained from the analysis of FCAS and LDCs, where higher levels and increases in FDI have often been associated with weaker progress on poverty. This all goes to confirm it is not mineral dependence per se that restricts poverty reduction, but the way revenues are collected and used. Aid per poor person is significantly greater towards the commodity exporters with higher progress on poverty and government effectiveness is higher (though converging with weaker-progress countries). Aid per poor person to commodity exporters with weaker progress on poverty actually declined over the period. This big difference is largely on account of aid per poor person to Papua New Guinea (USD 3 019 in 2013), Yemen (USD 997) and Bolivia (USD 729) \u2014 all cases of moderate/strong progress on poverty during the period analysed. In contrast, the highest aid per poor person allocated to a regress/weak-progress country is in Mauritania (USD 337) in the same year and the lowest is in Nigeria (USD 26). While mean and median values of government effectiveness remain higher for the group of moderate/strong performers, convergence is clearly visible over time. This is on account of deteriorating scores among moderate/strong performers, such as a decline of -0.44 points by Chad over the period and a decline of between -0.26 and -0.32 for Guinea, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Sudan and Yemen. In contrast, even though Mauritania displays a larger decline over the period (-0.92 points), only three of 10 regress countries/weak performers show a decrease in their government effectiveness scores overall. Instead, Burundi (best performer in the group), CAR, Malawi and Sierra Leone all display improvements in their scores by around 0.31-0.36 points. Commodity exporters with lower progress on poverty, where government effectiveness and education expenditure are lower and which overlap with FCAS and LDCs, represent another group that should receive more international attention (Table 6.10).

        "129 CHAPTER 7: Challenges and opportunities This chapter identifies the challenges and opportunities for the international community and national policymakers that emerge from the report\u2019s analysis and puts forward recommendations about these in the context of the 2030 agenda. Recommendations are in bold text. While we do not imply that all the stakeholders involved in international development need to evolve in precisely the same direction, we do believe they will need to ask themselves how better to respond to the changing geography of poverty and inequality and work more intensively and better in difficult environments, in particular in the poorest FCAS and in SSA. They also need to look at how to address the issue of better- off countries in Asia where large numbers of extremely poor people nonetheless remain. As earlier chapters identified, SSA and south Asia are the locus of major global challenges with respect to the eradication of poverty now and in the future. Within this, significant attention to FCAS and LDCs, especially those with the \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of challenges identified in Chapter 6, will be necessary. The SCAPS also merit a greater degree of emphasis. These are all overlapping categories. A further challenge is to maintain an adequate focus on the MICs, where a high proportion of today\u2019s poor live \u2014 especially those LMICs making weak progress on poverty. The most successful Chinese \u2018model\u2019 is one of massive job creation, improving job quality and skills over time and intense private sector development alongside FDI. An additional challenge is to extend aspects of this model to other developing countries. Major opportunities, by contrast, lie in the way the international community has developed a principled approach to its support for developing countries; its consistent support for human development, which now needs to be leveraged for a greater impact on income poverty; and the increasing number of especially poor developing countries with significant mineral exports \u2014 which do not have to be a \u2018curse\u2019. The slowdown in global (and Chinese) growth will reduce the potential impact of the latter, however. 7.1 Challenges 7.1.1 Extending China\u2019s successes The first challenge is whether the immense progress on poverty and human development made in China and elsewhere in east Asia can be extended to other regions and countries. While some other countries in south-east Asia (e.g. Vietnam) appear to be following in China\u2019s footsteps, many specific circumstances in China\u2019s trajectory are unlikely to be repeated elsewhere. However, lessons can be learnt from China, in particular about its sequencing of economic reforms: getting the conditions for smallholder agricultural growth first before attempting to diversify into manufacturing and services; investing at least moderately in human development, especially education, early in the development trajectory; but also then developing strong economic strategies to provide the job opportunities graduates need. These economic strategies in China have included developing industrial infrastructure in export processing zones (EPZs) and ",
        "130 the facilitation of industrial clusters so companies can share costs; sound macroeconomic management; and investment in broad-based infrastructure. All these lessons are in principle applicable elsewhere ( 72 ), and countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mauritius and Vietnam have developed the labour-intensive manufacturing and invested in human development to match, and have stellar or good levels of poverty reduction as a result. The model is also being tried in one or two countries in SSA (Ethiopia, Rwanda), though as yet without the same level of success (Shepherd et al., 2016). Diversification can be achieved partly through macroeconomic policy \u2014 for example avoiding periods of currency overvaluation, which inhibits exports and reduces incentives to invest in manufacturing \u2014 and partly through more deliberate policies designed to encourage it. There is plenty of evidence that countries that have diversified have employed deliberate policies, but the extent to which governments should engage in \u2018industrial policy\u2019 remains contested. Such policies include developing industrial parks, EPZs, tax and regulation incentives and strategies to attract investment in particular sectors. China has used such measures extensively (Lin and Yu, 2016). The environmental costs have been substantial, of course, and the possibilities of developing \u2018industries without smokestacks\u2019 are now preoccupying policymakers. 7.1.2 Ultra poverty and SSA Another challenge is to make faster progress with ultra and moderate poverty. The former requires a stronger focus on measures to bring the poorest nearer the poverty line: social protection \u2014 especially cash transfers and employment guarantees and programmes \u2014 has begun to do this, especially in Latin America, where such programmes have contributed to reduced inequality, as discussed in Box 4.1, Section 4.1.3. Even more powerful can be the effect of rising casual and other wage levels, occurring widely across Asia as a result of buoyant demand for agricultural commodities and competition for labour from the nonfarm economy, and partly a result of demographic changes that have tightened the labour market (Wiggins and Keats, 2014). Furthermore, it is in SSA that it is politically and financially most difficult to develop the social protection systems that will help address ultra poverty, although there are countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Rwanda) that have joined the southern African MICs in taking social protection systems to scale. This remains a major challenge both for national governments. A further challenge in SSA is to develop the integrated, multisectoral approaches needed to address extreme poverty, given the limited government capacities evident in much of the sub-continent. Social protection will work to keep children in school and raise attendance at health facilities only if the health and education services are adequate and responsive. Employment and agricultural policies need to be developed in conjunction with social protection. Ethiopia is an example of a country that has achieved this to a significant degree (see Box 3.2, Section 3.2.1). Working to improve government effectiveness \u2014 a key variable in the analysis of this report \u2014 should be seen as enhancing the links between sectors and programmes as much as it is about improving the performance of individual sectors. ( 72 ) This paragraph is based on a discussion of this issue between Martin Ravallion and Maoije Yu at the UN. This is partially written up in Lin and Yu (2016); see also X. Li (2013). ",
        "131 7.1.3 Moderate poverty and south Asia The growth in the share of both extreme and moderate poverty in south Asia in global poverty (where the share of ultra poverty has reduced) reported in Chapter 2 means that many people are clustered around the poverty line and between the extreme and moderate poverty lines. This requires attention to modalities to sustain escapes from extreme poverty, avoid transitory escapes and develop policies that support poor people\u2019s trajectories away from vulnerability to extreme poverty. Major issues relate to how to extend social protection to the vulnerable and working poor in the informal economy (see below) and develop pro-poor growth strategies, including ensuring that regional development policies integrate poorer regions with national growth. Land tenure policies are also needed to make sure the more successful farm households can access the land they need to expand through renting it, and other households can rent out land without feeling insecure about getting it back (CPAN, 2014). Box 7.1 summarises recent work on the policy requirements for sustaining escapes from poverty. In Bangladesh, for example, sustained escapes have been found to predominate over impoverishment or chronic poverty. Bangladesh therefore requires a continuity in policy frameworks as well as some additional focus on ensuring that escapes from poverty continue to be sustained. This may involve programming that targets the \u2018less poor\u2019, or support to health insurance and savings, as health shocks have emerged as a key driver in pushing people back below the poverty line (Scott et al., 2016). Box 7.1: Sustaining escapes from poverty A recent analysis of Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Uganda identifies the importance of a \u2018portfolio response\u2019 covering multiple interventions in a coordinated fashion. Some of these are well known and relatively well resourced \u2014 family planning, education, women\u2019s empowerment, affordable healthcare, savings and access to financial services, livestock markets and competitive agricultural markets. But four other areas are important but less well supported: social assistance and insurance, promoting the rural nonfarm economy, improving the functioning of rural labour markets and making legal migration and mobility\u2019 systems fairer for migrants. Source: Scott et al. (2016). 7.1.4 Vulnerable employment in the informal economy Rates of vulnerable employment, where informal workers do not have access to social protection, declined somewhat through to 2014, but are forecast to barely improve in developing and emerging economies in the next 5 years. While the shares of working poor declined during the MDG period (at both the extreme and the moderate poverty lines), progress in reducing the absolute number has now stalled, especially in LICs. One strong recommendation from the International Labour Organisation\u2019s (ILO\u2019s) work is to link strategies for employment generation and decent work with social protection policy and programming (ILO, 2016). Where employment is largely in the informal economy, finding innovative ways of extending social protection through social insurance for the informally employed will be a priority. Many donors have already moved in the direction of supporting economic growth through Aid for Trade and other mechanisms, but they could do more to focus this work on the poorest, for example by working to improve conditions in the informal economy (Mariotti et al., 2016). Donors need to work with countries to harness the benefits of growth and make these inclusive, also by strengthening tax systems, domestic resource mobilisation and redistribution through fiscal system development. ",
        "132 7.1.5 MICs MICs as a group now contain the largest number of poor people, with several of these countries in south Asia. There is a tendency to concentrate aid in LICs, and the FCAS among the MICs. A number of international agencies use the low-/middle-income classification to change the way they engage with developing countries. For example, the United Kingdom has stopped bilateral support to India and South Africa, as it was seen as controversial to provide financial support to countries that already had significant domestic resources. Some development partners are moving from grant aid to subsidised loans. For example, France\u2019s aid to MICs is guided by three principles, and one of those is that it should incur no cost to France, which suggests there will be no grant aid. The Netherlands has a strategy of phasing out aid for MICs and moving toward a trade relationship. As donors have reduced the number of recipient countries in recent years, many have tended to focus on poorer countries and to reduce aid to MICs. The EU, for example, has applied the principle of differentiation by graduating 16 UMICs and large MICs out of its bilateral cooperation. It has also reduced the allocations to seven UMICs as a step towards phasing them out. Among the selected countries are India and Indonesia, which continue to be home to large numbers of extreme poor and may possibly remain so towards 2030. Given the proportion of the world\u2019s poor in MICs, agencies with an overarching commitment to the eradication of poverty may need to review such policies. This is not to suggest, however, that they should necessarily be reversed. 7.1.6 The growth slowdown Forecast rates of growth for the next few years have been diminishing worldwide, a result of the long post-financial crisis economic slowdown, especially in China. Finding alternative sources of demand growth will therefore be critical. More rapid regional integration may be one source, promoting cross-border trade, investment and migration, especially in regions where barriers are still substantial, and especially emphasising legal migration and mobility options for unskilled workers. Another source of income growth for the poor, but not in aggregate terms, may be to boost the incomes of the poorest people directly, through cash transfers, which will grow markets for food and locally produced consumer goods where they are or can become competitive. A recent International Energy Agency (IEA) report forecasts investment in renewable energy to be a major source of growth during 2014-2020, with significant growth possible in developing countries if the policy environment improves. Changes needed include: more certainty over the credible implementation of ambitious long-term policy frameworks in some markets (e.g. India); greater measures to reduce regulatory barriers and improve the system and grid integration of variable renewables (e.g. China, South Africa), particularly distributed solar photovoltaics; improved market access and strengthened financial sustainability in the power sector through, for example, the removal of fossil fuel subsidies and the use of well-designed price competition mechanisms to help spur cost reductions; improved financing conditions with greater stakeholder consultation during policy design; and development institution participation to reduce off-taker risks and concessional financing (IEA, 2015). The pessimistic conclusions about poverty and inequality of Chapter 5, however, may be modified in practice if there is greater emphasis on redistribution, though this is politically more difficult when growth is lower. Cash transfers and other forms of social ",
        "133 protection and greater public investments in human capital can help redistribute opportunity and savings, but so can asset distribution and redistribution measures. Opportunities for land redistribution, perhaps the classic approach, are politically limited and challenging to make effective. The government of India has long focused its rural development efforts on asset distribution through loans and grants, but this remains inadequately evaluated for policy transfer purposes. A more thoroughly evaluated approach is that of BRAC\u2019s graduation programming (Box 7.2). Box 7.2: BRAC\u2019s graduation approach The \u2018graduation\u2019 approach developed by the non-governmental organisation BRAC is one approach to asset redistribution currently receiving wide discussion. This focuses on the combination of asset distribution, participation in a group, business and skills training and intensive mentoring for a period of time. This is now a widely tested and evaluated approach. The process involves: \uf0b7 poverty mapping to ensure inclusion of the ultra poor, wealth ranking to produce categories of well- being house surveys and participant selection; \uf0b7 asset transfers; these could be of livestock, seeds and tools, a sewing machine, the inventory to start a shop, etc. These can be soft loans, with a grace period and a low interest rate, or grants. There is guided utilisation of loans to procure the asset. Youth programming (e.g. in Uganda) has focused on vocational training, or a job guarantee; \uf0b7 a stipend to smooth consumption, which may include a food component, since it has been found that a cash stipend is saved rather than consumed; \uf0b7 a savings account and support for what local savings practices exist (e.g. savings groups); \uf0b7 technical skills training, in a group; \uf0b7 hands-on coaching \u2014 this may be the core of the approach, something yet to be evaluated. This delivers psychosocial guidance, checking-in, visioning and basic numeracy. It challenges the \u2018poverty of hope\u2019 and supports the ability to envision upward mobility, extending a person\u2019s time horizon beyond the same day or the next meal; \uf0b7 support in facing healthcare shocks; \uf0b7 social integration \u2014 clients increase social standing and have a voice. In Bangladesh, a project asks respected people, who would include former graduates, to sit in a bimonthly committee (voluntarily) to support ultra-poor clients. There is good anecdotal evidence that these committees continue beyond the intervention period. Graduation is assessed by a household achieving three sources of income; assets that have doubled in value; greater food security with at least two nutritional meals a day; the participant being engaged in household decision-making; home improvements, including access to water and sanitation; attendance at social or community events; all children at school; and no under-age marriage. The cost varies hugely, from a low of USD 300 for a loan in Bangladesh or USD 500 for an asset transfer over 2 years up to USD 1 800 in Kenya. Given that the poorest 30 countries have a total of USD 500 per person public expenditure ( 73 ), this is an indication of the steep challenge that lies ahead, and the importance of including the poorest in growth, as this report emphasises. The lessons from BRAC\u2019s experience across seven countries include the following: a big-push intervention is required to bring the ultra poor over the extreme poverty line; there needs to be a high enough \u2018value kick\u2019 over a long enough time to see sustained change; some combination of interventions is needed, though these can vary by context; when assessing costs there is a need to do this with nuance and a long-term perspective; and this is certainly only one possible approach. The model is now being developed to go to scale with implementation by government. Source: IGC and BRAC (2015). 7.1.7 Leave no one behind The goal of reaching a 3 % global poverty level is compatible with much higher levels of extreme poverty in some countries. Even under the most optimistic assumptions, more than half the population in Madagascar and DRC will be poor in 2030. The implication of this is that it will be very challenging to \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 in achieving the SDGs. ( 73 ) Government spending per person is less than PPP USD 1 500 per person in 58 developing countries, home to 83 % of people living in extreme poverty. In 30 countries, it is less than PPP USD 500 per person. This compares with an average PPP USD 17 485 per person in DAC countries (and PPP USD 2 170 per person in developing countries as a whole). ",
        "134 There is therefore a premium for the international community on identifying these countries and focusing international attention on them. Focusing on the lower poverty line will be crucial to leave no one behind and therefore also to address poverty in SSA (Chandy et al., 2013a). Here, the focus of international aid and policy work on poverty is more likely to be on lifting the ultra poor up to the poverty line, through social protection; smallholder agricultural development; boosting the nonfarm rural economy; asset-building and returns; and facilitating migration and mobility. There also needs to be a focus on sustaining those gains once made. It may also require overcoming the structural constraints that characterise countries where most of the ultra poor live, such as providing support in areas like conflict resolution; climate adaptation; rural development including infrastructure and institutional development; value chain development; and enhancing access for the poorest people to basic healthcare and education and financial services. 7.1.8 Disrupters Exogenous threats like climate change and conflict could greatly disrupt poverty reduction scenarios based only on changes in poverty and inequality that look at past trends, and reinforce impoverishment processes. Climate-related risks appear to be increasing while conflict-related risks may be diminishing. Global attempts to reduce carbon emissions remain highly significant for the many developing countries that will be highly affected by climate change, as will collaborative work to manage the effects of climate change. Resolving existing conflicts and preventing future ones also remains a priority. Countries like Bangladesh, DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda risk having not only high numbers of people in poverty in 2030 but also high exposure to several natural hazards, as a result of climate change, as well as poor capacity to minimise the impacts of these risks. Disaster risk management capabilities are a critical area for focus and, in many countries, improvement. The countries listed above have highly varied quality in this regard (Shepherd et al., 2013). 7.1.9 Education inequalities Beyond income inequality, there are also challenges in reducing human development inequalities, despite their greater decline compared with income inequality in recent decades. For example, such inequalities have fallen for all \u2018special status\u2019 groups but remain much higher in these countries than in other developing countries. However, there are still barriers to reducing inequality: for example, the early marriage of girls constrains the extent to which they pass through the education system and wars, natural disasters and other emergencies disrupt education in a big way and tend to affect specific groups. Both of these are amenable to policy, as discussed below. Countering early child marriage is not a new topic (IPPF, 2006), and legislation to raise the minimum age of marriage to implement the human rights commitments countries have already made is one aspect of this. The more difficult aspect of this issue lies in creating the enabling environment to change the social norms around early marriage. And the integrated policy and programme approach required to prevent child marriage \u2014 including educational measures to encourage girls to stay and parents to keep girls in school, with livelihood options for adolescent girls to counter the view that marriage is ",
        "135 the only option \u2014 is challenging in LICs especially. Since 2000, many international agencies have made operational commitments on these issues. A systematic review in 2011 (Malhotra et al., 2011) found many programmes that were having useful impacts, especially those fostering information, skills and networks for girls in combination with community mobilisation. But few had been scaled up. As such, supporting scaled-up programmes to counter early child marriage would be a way of reducing gender inequalities in education. A more recent multi-country study indicates that progress on gender equality in primary schools has not yet carried through to secondary levels, and this needs policy measures. Norms around gender and marriage are difficult to change, with both demand and supply measures required. Supportive family contexts and community role models are important (Watson, 2014). Governments and international agencies can also make special efforts to maintain access to education during crises, which would otherwise lead to children dropping out and increased inequality of access. A number of humanitarian agencies linked together in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Education Cluster now take education much more seriously than in the past in programming for emergencies. The 2010 UNGA Resolution on the right to education in emergency situations established an important implementation framework for all states, humanitarian actors and UN agencies (see Education Cluster Unit, 2014). However, despite these advances, children in conflict- affected countries are more than twice as likely to be out of school as those in other countries, and much less likely to complete primary education. Inequality of access between children from poor and rich households also remains much greater. Education continues to be neglected in humanitarian as well as development funding in conflict- affected countries and in emergency appeals. Most of the low levels of funds received are used for classroom construction and textbooks and equipment purchases, and not for educational access. There are now proposals for a Global Emergency Education Fund to improve the situation (Unesco, 2015). 7.2 Opportunities 7.2.1 Institutional infrastructure The Paris Declaration, the Accra Agenda for Action, the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation and the New Deal provide the international community with the strategic, principled and organisational foundations with which to contribute to development effectiveness. Key principles in these agreements include working for results in alignment with national government strategies, harmonisation and simplification of donor efforts, partnership, trust and transparency, which should be critical drivers of progress on poverty, inequality and human development. While these can be grand commitments, the latest expression of these principles was in the g7+ New Deal on FCAS, which at least some donors have taken on board (g7+ Secretariat, 2016). 7.2.2 Stronger-progress countries Despite progress, in several cases among the LICs and LMICs making stronger progress, there are still large numbers (or proportions) of poor people, including the ultra poor. Sustaining progress through to 2030 and beyond will be a challenge politically and economically, and requires substantial continued support from the international community across a wide range of public policy actions. This would involve continued ",
        "136 technical and financial support for human development and social protection, infrastructure and other inputs into economic growth, especially to push growth in a pro- poor direction through a focus on employment generation and decent work. Stronger-progress LDCs ( 74 ) differ from lower-progress LDCs in that they have lower child mortality, better government effectiveness, higher (if converging) and somewhat less volatile growth and lower climate vulnerability, all of which perhaps might be expected. But, intriguingly, they also have lower FDI, lower revenues as a proportion of GDP and lower aid per poor person, and lower and diverging (from lower-progress LDCs) expenditure on health and education as a proportion of GDP from that of lower-progress countries. International policy dialogue and aid to these countries could focus especially on raising revenues, and pro-poor public expenditure, bringing aid levels to a level commensurate with the better government effectiveness that may be driving their stronger progress. However, sustaining growth also remains a challenge, partly because their economies are increasingly sensitive to the effects of climate change, albeit less vulnerable than countries making less strong progress. As greater numbers of people escape extreme poverty across the range of stronger- progress countries, the emphasis of the policy agenda shifts to policy measures that reduce people\u2019s vulnerability to poverty and sustain their upward mobility away from extreme poverty towards and beyond an upper poverty line. This entails a focus on social insurance against major risks and, where conflict is a risk, as in several of these countries, institutional development for conflict prevention as well as disaster risk management. It also covers regional development, urbanisation and infrastructure and other economic policies and programmes, which will spread opportunities for upward mobility and match opportunities to improvements in human development. UMICs are generally capable of sustaining their own progress on poverty, especially where they have good policy frameworks. Where there is not yet an adequate policy framework for the eradication of poverty (e.g. Angola), sustaining progress will be more challenging. U-LMICs with stronger progress may fall into the same category, where their policy frameworks and institutional and financial underpinnings show promise. 7.2.3 The growing knowledge base Lifting people out of poverty will require very different national and international policy priorities and aid programmes depending on whether the targeted population is ultra or moderately poor, what ratios there are between impoverishment and escapes from poverty and what levels of chronic poverty exist (CPAN, 2014). These differentiated policies should be informed by the much greater knowledge base that exists in the SDG era compared with the MDG era. This is true for most countries, as well as for cross- country comparative analysis, as in this report. The kind of analysis advanced in Chapter 6 would enable international agencies to decide more precisely how they want to contribute to the eradication of extreme and moderate poverty and to gear up accordingly in terms of instruments and expertise. ( 74 ) These include Angola, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Yemen. The data used for this assessment may be out of date for countries that have experienced conflict recently, which may well have reduced progress on poverty significantly, such as Yemen. On the other hand, Chad progressed despite years of civil war (2005-2010). ",
        "137 As we have seen, among the categories identified, three groups of countries are especially worthy of increased attention from international policymakers: countries making weak progress or regressing on poverty among the L-LMICs, the FCAS and the LDCs. The international community should invest in understanding country contexts, working locally and adopting a learning-by-doing approach so as to learn from past failures as well as any successes. Providing development assistance through multilateral channels may also reduce the public pressure bilateral donors face (Gulrajani, 2016). Other options are to reduce the burden on national institutions (e.g. less project-based aid and more budget support), to create incentives for progress (e.g. enhance civil society capacity to hold governments to account) and to support actors other than government when this proves more effective (e.g. civil society, the private sector, decentralised authorities) (UNDESA, 2010; ETTG, 2014). 7.2.4 L-LMICs making weak progress L-LMICs making weak progress on poverty or regressing have experienced a combination of low government revenue and aid per poor person, relatively weak government effectiveness and significant environmental challenges. The latter is especially applicable in south Asia, where there may have been a trade-off between growth and environmental protection. Some of these weaker-progress L-LMICs, but not all, are significantly dependent on FDI in mineral extraction and experience the volatility associated with this. The combination of lower and diverging government revenue as a proportion of GDP, lower aid and weaker government effectiveness, in some cases underpinned by significant FDI in minerals, suggests governance issues are fundamental to progress on poverty for the L-LMICs with weaker progress on poverty. International agencies focused on the eradication of extreme poverty and deprivation could prioritise these LMICs ( 75 ) in terms of aid and policy dialogue focused on or linked to raising domestic revenue levels and pro-poor public expenditure, on improving government effectiveness, especially in services used (or that should be used) by poor people, and on reducing the trade-off between growth and environmental protection. 7.2.5 FCAS making weak progress FCAS making weak progress or regressing ( 76 ) face an especially \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of development-inhibiting factors: volatile growth, poor government effectiveness, low aid and environmental vulnerability. There is also the group of 14 SCAPS (or conflict-affected LDCs) that have been making a markedly lower level of progress compared with other FCAS. Progress on poverty is clearly possible even in FCAS: outside the SCAPS, progress in FCAS has been at a similar level to that in non-FCAS developing countries across a range of indicators. Governance is often thought to be fundamental to the prospects of FCAS, and government effectiveness is associated with progress on poverty in these countries. However, countries with lower progress on poverty surprisingly score higher on the WGI\u2019s PSAV dimension \u2014 a finding that is counter-intuitive and difficult to interpret. It may be ( 75 ) Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Djibouti, Kenya, Laos, Lesotho, Mauritania, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Senegal, Zambia and countries without adequate progress data, including Myanmar/Burma, Solomon Islands and Syria. ( 76 ) Burundi, Cameroon, CAR, Comoros, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, DRC, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, The Gambia and Timor-Leste. Countries without adequate progress data that may be in this category are Afghanistan, Egypt, Eritrea, Kosovo, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, West Bank and Gaza and Zimbabwe. ",
        "138 that in many states violence is limited to particular regions, and this does not prevent others regions progressing at the same time. Uganda during the 1990s and early 2000s would be an example of this. In any case, working to prevent conflict recurring is important and measures to improve government effectiveness, especially in providing services useful to the poor, are indicated. Given the low domestic revenues and aid allocations that weaker-progress FCAS experience, these would also be important areas for additional effort. Poor governance is a factor long associated with conflict, as both a driver and a result of it. Ensuring the continuity of essential state functions (e.g. paying police, military, teachers) and providing basic services (e.g. water, electricity) is an area where development assistance can make the most difference to allow the state to function and economic life to go on. Donors should consider carefully the consequences before pulling out of such countries or cutting relations with the government in place, as guaranteeing essential state functions is vital to avoid further instability ( 77 ). Policy actions focused on reducing the volatility of growth, and vulnerability to climate change and other environmental challenges, are also called for. The former may be to do with policies to achieve both macroeconomic stability and macroeconomic diversification, especially away from mineral dependence (see below). Growth and volatility of growth also play a major destabilising role in SCAPS. Not only have SCAPS experienced slower growth compared with other developing countries but also their growth has been much more volatile. The behaviour of external actors can intensify this volatility. Donor countries have a certain responsibility to limit their negative impact on SCAPS\u2019 growth volatility by ensuring their domestic policies in the areas of trade and investment will not have negative impacts on the SCAPS in particular. Aid and aid predictability are another way in which donors can limit uncertainty in SCAPS. While donors\u2019 rhetoric has moved toward a focus on FCAS, aid data suggest FCAS receive less aid per poor person compared with non-FCAS countries and that this imbalance has become worse over time. In addition to reassessing the share of aid going to SCAPS and FCAS, donors should invest more in preventive measures rather than intervening or stopping aid once a crisis has occurred. Reduction of vulnerability to climate change can be achieved at this stage mainly through urgent measures in the industrialised world (including many developing countries) to cut carbon emissions and keep temperature change low and then, increasingly over time, as growing climate extremes bring and spread greater disaster-proneness than exists currently, through \u2018adaptation\u2019 and disaster risk management. SCAPS have significantly higher (and diverging) vulnerability to climate change than other FCAS and non-FCAS (see Figure 6.8). This is an important aspect of the perfect storm facing SCAPS that are also LDCs. These countries should be a special focus for conflict management, disaster risk reduction and management and access to climate funding (Bird et al., 2015). ( 77 ) http://icai.independent.gov.uk/report/transition/ ",
        "139 7.2.6 LDCs making weaker progress Although few LDCs have graduated from this special status, about a third are doing relatively well in terms of progress on poverty. The rest overlap substantially with FCAS making weaker progress, so the analysis is similar, though the storm is not quite so perfect. The focal policy areas are therefore also very similar. 7.2.7 Promoting further convergence and capitalising on human development gains Improvements in human development have been more uniform across countries and country categories than have improvements in income poverty. Nevertheless, progress has still been varied, as Chapter 2 explains. Given these differential rates of progress, governments and international actors can learn lessons from countries reducing child mortality (and other human development outcomes) at faster rates than those making slower progress. Box 7.3 presents some lessons from \u2018fast-track\u2019 countries. Box 7.3: Lessons on reducing child mortality from \u2018fast-track\u2019 countries Fast-track countries achieve rapid progress by adopting a triple planning approach that focuses on: (1) quick wins with targeted or emergency strategies to address immediate, urgent needs; (2) longer-term gains from building strong, sustainable systems to achieve a long-term vision; and (3) adaptation to address change and sustain progress. After the genocide, in 1994, Rwanda deployed community health workers and volunteers for urgent health needs. At the same time, the country promoted investments in a long-term vision to build its professional health workforce and health facilities with medical colleges, referral hospitals and international academic and professional collaborations. Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Thailand initially focused on improving primary and community-based healthcare in rural areas. As their health systems became stronger, the emphasis shifted to quality improvements and then to macro-level health reforms for universal health coverage, which all contributed to improved maternal and child health outcomes. The progress that accrues over time from strengthening systems and adaptive strategies should not be undervalued by measuring a country\u2019s progress only by the initial rates of decline in mortality. Fast-track countries use guiding principles to chart their own pathways to progress. These principles are not a panacea, but they nevertheless shape government strategies, align stakeholder action and orient progress towards agreed results. The principles are continually being defined, tested and reformed. Some fast-track countries have explicitly adopted human rights-based principles to guide their health and development strategies. For example, Nepal\u2019s interim constitution is founded on human rights. The secretary of the Ministry of Health and Population affirmed that, \u2018Many government strategies and policies related to safer motherhood, neonatal health, nutrition and gender are anchored in the principles of human rights.\u2019 Other fast-track countries have used principles aligned with frameworks for effective development, for example the Paris Principles and the Accra Agenda for Action. In these countries, the government\u2019s interaction with health and development partners is defined by principles of national ownership of policies and programmes, and alignment of partners with country priorities. Principles based on different political systems and models of economic and social development also steer progress. China has experienced a clear evolution of different political philosophies and systems. Currently, it aims to address the challenge of achieving harmonisation and balance across five axes of national development: rural\u2013urban, western\u2013eastern regions of the country, national\u2013international, economic\u2013social and human development\u2013natural development. Source: Kuruvalla et al. (2014). More even progress on human development presents a massive opportunity, if only these gains can also be made use of for economic development. Finding ways to translate human development into broad-based economic progress centrally involves strategies for employment generation and decent work in a rapidly changing global economic environment, with a specific focus on poverty. ",
        "140 There appears to have been a disturbingly and puzzlingly weak link between education expenditure and progress on poverty. Education expenditure is lower and increasing less rapid on average in countries making faster progress on poverty than in countries making weaker progress. This could be because higher-progress countries have invested more in growth-related infrastructure and health, which is also good for poverty reduction in the short term, whereas education expenditure is for the longer term. Or it could be because weaker-progress countries are less unequal in terms of income, and this translates into higher expenditure on education, because investment in education is a major route to maintaining equality. The ILO (2016) documents the growing difficulty of achieving such public expenditure and other social objectives in the context of the global economic downturn. Thus, translating education expenditure into poverty reduction is part opportunity but also part challenge. 7.2.8 Capitalising on mineral exports One emerging opportunity in SSA is that most countries will have diversified into significant mineral exploitation by 2020. Minerals can be a resource curse, but many countries have managed to integrate a minerals sector into their economies in such a way as to support reducing poverty and deprivation, and lessons can be learnt from these. This is politically and economically challenging. Many of the countries with weaker progress on poverty and those regressing are mineral exporters. Dependence on natural resources tends to promote bad institutions, such as corruption, civil wars, inflation and neglect of education (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012). However, from our analysis of the data on progress on poverty, mineral dependence does not prevent developing countries from progressing on poverty: it is government effectiveness in particular that influences whether this is possible. There are both political and technical aspects to this. History would suggest that countries that develop stable and well-functioning institutions are better able to manage the challenges of a minerals-based economy (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012). For those countries that do not yet have the institutions to support economic diversification, development of a natural resource or stabilisation fund, transparency and accountability and the direct distribution of revenue shares to the general population \u2014 the solutions often suggested for the \u2018resource curse\u2019 \u2014 may be difficult. One proposal has been to promote the national private sector\u2019s involvement with the mineral economy. The aim of this is to create demand for a better policy environment and to foster institutions to constrain political leadership (Weinthal and Jones, 2006). The interesting aspect of this proposal is that it focuses on the demand for better public institutions rather than the supply, and on the private sector rather than civil society as the mechanism for articulating that demand. This message has now been well absorbed in much international development work, where multi-stakeholder platforms and public\u2013 private dialogue and partnership have become widespread. Multi-stakeholder platforms could be supported in mineral economies. Commodity exporters show a declining PSAV score and are converging with FCAS \u2014 a worrying trend, suggesting the resource curse is alive and well at least for some (relatively) poor countries. In view of this, particular (or focused) efforts should be made ",
        "141 to ensure that revenues from commodity exports are directed towards financing of services and infrastructure necessary to include to poor people in development. Moreover, donors could support these countries to diversify their economies. For instance, donors with relevant experience could assist commodity exporters to set up mechanisms such as sovereign wealth funds that allow for revenues to be invested in a sustainable manner and to contribute to the country\u2019s development. Such instruments could be used to stimulate growth by attracting and directing investment in relevant sectors: \u2018governments may see the sovereign wealth fund as a means to improve the quality of public spending and attract private investors to strengthen investment discipline\u2019 (Gelb, 2014). Nevertheless, such instruments can pose a risk if the conditions are not ripe to ensure fund money is not hijacked to pursue political interests. International actors could more directly enhance the diversification of the economy, since \u2018concentration in sectors with limited scope for productivity growth and quality upgrading, such as primary commodities, may result in less broad-based and sustainable growth\u2019 (IMF, 2012). Aid for trade, for instance, could be used to help improve standards, quality, accreditation capacities, certification and regulatory measures in developing countries and to provide assistance to strengthen and upgrade companies\u2019 capacities to produce and export in other sectors (Djemmo, 2010). However, the politics underlying all this can often be difficult, as regimes use commodity revenues and other means to boost their own dominant party position and exclude others from power. Political analysis is critical, and engagement on a political front is necessary, with a view to supporting fair political competition among parties as democracies mature. 7.2.9 Data and methodological issues Both country- and population-weighted data are important to assess trends and projections in poverty and inequality and in developing aid allocation criteria. Measuring country achievements by using equal weights (such that each country has equal value) and by population (such that each individual has equal value) gives a very different picture of progress. As donors strive to eradicate extreme poverty and \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 by 2030, they will need to use metrics that focus on poor people as well as poor countries, so as to be able to provide assistance to those most in need. Aid allocations could be informed by data on poor people rather than data on poor countries; this would ensure that large countries with significant pockets of poverty are not discriminated against. The divergence between disadvantaged countries and the rest of the developing world is more acute when we take country populations into account rather than \u2018weighting\u2019 each country\u2019s performance equally because a few populous countries have fared particularly well in poverty reduction (such as China and Vietnam) while several others have performed particularly poorly (notably DRC and Nigeria). To support populous countries that perform poorly, donors could emphasise (more) the within-country poverty ratio in their allocation formula to avoid an overrepresentation of small countries that may then be over-aided compared with less efficiently governed populous countries. Ideally, a subnational analysis should also inform donor policies where in-country levels of poverty vary greatly from one region to the next, especially but not only in countries that are highly decentralised, like Ethiopia and India. ",
        "142 Disaggregating data on poverty to distinguish the ultra poor (now USD 1/day) from the rest of the extreme poor (now USD 1.90/day) lets us access a more complete picture of where the poor live and the severity of their situation. This knowledge could help donors differentiate their assistance in line with the needs of the people they are targeting. It will also be particularly important to achieve the \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 call of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Measures of progress between and within countries over time are useful to detect constraints to progress and identify appropriate policies. However, there is no perfect method to measure progress. This report has used a combination of absolute and relative progress on extreme poverty. Agencies committed to a multidimensional approach to poverty may wish to use a multidimensional measure for countries, where governments would value this. This should be used alongside income-based measures, and should be capable of disaggregation into its constituent parts, so the relationships among its components can be easily investigated. Weak data availability and limited survey coverage constrain knowledge of where the poor live and of the severity of their poverty, especially in the regions most affected, like SSA. The international community should continue to invest in data collection and encourage more initiatives like the World Bank\u2019s plan to conduct household surveys every 3 years. A significant hike in investment in data collection is required in any case to monitor implementation of the 2030 agenda adequately. Moreover, to monitor who is being left behind, surveys will need to be larger, so that they can be more easily disaggregated into groups, regions and subnational units, and can include panels and links to qualitative work. ",
        "143 CHAPTER 8: Conclusions This report has proposed a more forensic and differentiated approach than the usual analytical approach to global poverty in order to improve the chances of eradicating extreme poverty. It has done this by exploring both country- and population-weighted data, to enable a focus on both the poverty seen in countries and that experienced by poor people across the world. It has also explored progress on poverty and human development across different categories of countries, by income, by geographical region (including the ACP countries) and by \u2018special status\u2019 categories (LDCs, LLDCs, SIDS, FCAS). As requested by the terms of reference, the report has laid a special emphasis on MICs, FCAS and LDCs. This report has further explored the possibility of developing subcategories of these larger country categories based on progress on poverty, and the degree to which such subcategories face common situations and factors explaining progress or the lack of it. This takes account of the substantial variation in progress across developing countries, but attempts to go beyond individual country context, to small groups of countries with similar progress and at similar levels of income, so that it is possible to nuance international policies for groups of countries with different progress trajectories. International agencies can decide more precisely how they want to contribute to the eradication of extreme and moderate poverty and gear up accordingly in terms of instruments and expertise. The exercise has allowed for more precise identification of which groups of countries the international community needs to focus less on from an extreme poverty perspective \u2014 these include UMICs, stronger-progress U-LMICs with more effective policy frameworks and SIDS. However, some of the latter category are very vulnerable to climate change, the effects of which could be impoverishing. And all these categories still have many moderately poor people. Nevertheless, most are arguably capable of addressing moderate poverty themselves, perhaps with some South\u2013South technical cooperation. The exercise has also identified where more effort and creativity is needed \u2014 this is in the weaker-progress LMICs, FCAS and LDCs, many of which are in SSA. Many of these are ACP countries. Many face a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of vulnerabilities and challenging trends. Finally, it has identified countries where continued and adapted support is needed over the period to 2030 \u2014 in the stronger-progress LICs and LMICs. Surprisingly, and despite results and higher average government effectiveness scores, these countries are less aided (per poor person) than lower-progress countries at the same levels of income, with lower government effectiveness. There is thus arguably scope for increasing aid. Adaptation in support for these countries is needed over time to allow poor people to escape extreme poverty, to prevent them from returning into extreme poverty and to sustain their upward trajectory through moderate poverty and out of poverty altogether. There are two major caveats to this analysis. One is that each individual country has a unique context, and of course international strategies should be designed with respect to this. However, it may be rational for agencies to specialise somewhat in particular ",
        "144 categories of countries so they can gear their institutional knowledge, instruments and expertise accordingly. Second, analysis in this report is at national level. This misses the subnational dimension, which may be critical especially in larger countries, but also in geographically smaller but high-population-density countries, and countries where regional inequalities are significant. This would be a topic for further exploration. India, where a quarter of the world\u2019s extreme poor are today, is an illustration. Its major states range from low- income to upper-middle-income country levels, with a variety of different patterns of progress in income poverty and human development. Even within some of these states there is significant geographical variation in incomes and progress. The analysis could usefully be deepened (as suggested in the last paragraph) and updated every few years as a contribution to monitoring progress towards the SDGs, identifying problem areas as well as (some of) the solutions that could be applied. ",
        "145 ANNEX 1: World Bank 2011 PPP adjustments and beyond the international extreme poverty line New PPP numbers The concept of purchasing power parity seeks to adjust prices for differences over time and across countries. Applied to poverty, the objective is to hold the real value of the poverty line constant. In theory, USD 1 PPP in Botswana should offer the same command over resources as USD 1 PPP in Malaysia. The first set of poverty numbers (in 1985 USD PPP) were released in the 1990 World Development Report based on Ravallion et al. (1991). Since then, they have been revised every 5 to 10 years in line with new cost of living data from the International Comparison Programme (ICP), which collects data on the price of goods and services, presently from close to 200 countries. In October 2015, the World Bank released new poverty numbers in 2011 PPP. The series in use until then \u2014 and on which we base much of our analysis \u2014 was released in 2008 using 2005 PPP (Chen and Ravallion, 2008). Analysis of the 2005 PPP numbers led to the estimate that 1.01 billion people were poor in 2011 according to the USD 1.25 a day metric, or 14.5 % of the global population (Jolliffe and Prydz, 2015). When the ICP released its new data in 2014, initial speculation suggested poverty numbers could fall precipitously: the ICP data pointed out that prices in poor countries were in fact much lower than had been previously thought ( 78 ). In fact, the World Bank poverty data revealed much more muted change, \u2018primarily because of the removal of the 2005 urban-bias adjustments in the 2011 PPP data\u2019 in China, India and Indonesia (Jolliffe and Prydz, 2015: 21). With the superior quality of spatially disaggregated price data in the 2011 ICP, this correction was no longer felt to be needed (ibid.). The 2005 PPP figures were updated in two ways, using (1) updates of inflation and of the purchasing power of households across countries based on new ICP data and (2) a newly set poverty line at USD 1.90 (in 2011 PPP) ( 79 ). The global poverty count rose slightly to 1.038 billion following this revision, whereas the poverty headcount at a regional level remained relatively unchanged (Figure A1.1). There are some substantial changes at a country level and the World Bank has argued that they are more useful for aggregating the number of poor people globally than for country-specific counts (Prydz, 2015). Moreover, in those countries where changes in PPP prices were not aligned with national changes in inflation \u2014 namely, Bangladesh, Cape Verde, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Yemen \u2014 poverty estimates continue to be based on 2005 PPP prices (Cruz et al., 2015: 11). ( 78 ) This prompted sensational headlines such as \u2018Global absolute poverty fell by almost half on Tuesday\u2019 (Dykstra et al., 2014b), though these estimates relied on the \u2018old\u2019 poverty line of USD 1.25 a day PPP. ( 79 ) This can be arrived at through three methods: by inflating the poverty lines of the 15 countries used to set the 2005 PPP line of USD 1.25, and taking their average; by measuring average inflation in the 101 countries for which data were available and applying this to the USD 1.25 a day line; and by raising the poverty line using the new PPP indices so that the incidence of global poverty remains unchanged (Basu, 2015). ",
        "146 Figure A1.1: Estimates of income poverty in the world and by region in 2005 and 2011 PPP Source: Jolliffe and Prydz (2015). Beyond USD 1.25/USD 1.90 This report focuses on international poverty lines to assess poverty levels and trends. However, whether this is the most apt approach to measuring poverty is actively debated, and several modifications and/or extensions have been proposed. Three issues deserve mention: the relationship between international and national poverty lines; the value of relative as well as absolute measures of poverty; and the potential utility of additional international poverty lines. Several concerns have been expressed with respect to international poverty lines ( 80 ). First, the decision to update the 2005 PPP line in 2011 PPP prices marks a departure from past practice. Previous international poverty lines had been constructed based on national poverty lines in the world\u2019s poorest countries \u2014 the original USD 1 a day measure (1985 PPP) was based on an average of the world\u2019s eight poorest countries, whereas the USD 1.25 a day measure (2005 PPP) was based on an average of the world\u2019s 15 poorest countries (Table A1.1). However, given the strategic imperative of the Bank (embodied also in SDG 1) to eliminate extreme poverty, the decision to hold the poverty line constant was a necessary precondition (Kenny, 2015). Using the previous approach, \u2018extreme poverty will never end \u2026 For as long as the poorest countries in the world set a national poverty line that identifies some of their population as poor then there will always be people in extreme poverty\u2019 (Hoy, 2015b). World Bank Chief Economist Kaushik Basu justifies this decision as follows: \u2018Because there is no unique definition of poverty, what matters is to draw a line at some reasonable place and then hold the line constant in real (inflation-adjusted) terms so that we can track the performance of the world and individual countries over time\u2019 (Basu, 2015). But this change also means that poverty may become increasingly divorced from the changes in living standards and expectations that national poverty lines ought to reflect \u2014 it is fixed in place and time. This concern is all the more acute given that national ( 80 ) This section draws in part on Samman (2013). ",
        "147 poverty lines, on average, are updated at one third the rate of changes in national mean income (Chris Hoy, personal communication).

A second issue concerns how internationally comparable poverty lines are constructed \u2014 namely, the way in which they account for different consumption patterns across countries and over time (Klasen et al., 2016). Data on trends are much more reliable than those on levels, but even then international lines may not be identifying the absolute poor consistently. A recent study to compare poverty figures derived from international and national poverty lines (Gentilini and Sumner, 2012) echoes some international figures. It reports that 1.5 billion people were poor as measured by national poverty lines (22.5 % of the world\u2019s population), only slightly above the 1.3 billion poor identified by the USD 1.25 international measure. However, the two measures lead to similar estimates of poverty only in certain countries and often the differences are considerable \u2014 for India they were as high as 55 percentage points, or 45 million poor people. According to national poverty lines, 10 % of poor people worldwide live in HICs. The inherent problems in constructing international poverty lines and the argument that we should also consider deprivation in relation to national standards suggest national poverty lines could be used in setting targets and monitoring poverty reduction efforts in any post-2015 global agreement. But for this we would need to formulate them consistently. One recent proposal advocates setting national poverty lines using an internationally consistent procedure (Klasen et al., 2016). Another strand of work has focused on incorporating a relative as well as an absolute dimension into the measurement of extreme poverty (Chen and Ravallion, 2008). The justification for a focus on relative poverty is that deprivation exists not only in absolute terms but also in relation to social norms (e.g. Townsend, 1962). While the eradication of extreme deprivation is clearly fundamental to human well-being, people also value consumption relative to prevailing standards and to their ability to participate fully in their societies (Chen and Ravallion, 2012). This harkens back to the importance Adam ",
        "148 Smith placed on having the fundamental means \u2018to appear in public without shame\u2019. In other words, social context and custom shape welfare and well-being (Sen, 1983). In Europe, where there is far less extreme poverty than in developing countries and regions, the concept of relative poverty has been widely adopted \u2014 below half of the mean or median income is a common delimiter. In developing countries, the concept of relative poverty is not so widely used and how poor people regard extreme poverty versus relative consumption is debated. Chen and Ravallion (2012) argue for a concept of \u2018weakly relative poverty\u2019 \u2014 that absolute needs are more important at low levels of consumption but, as countries become richer, people attach higher value to their relative position in society. Using measures that are bounded below by the extreme poverty line and above by a relative poverty line, they apply this concept to 116 countries. Their analysis finds a fall in the incidence of relative poverty (from 65.1 % in 1990 to 47 % in 2008), but an increase in the number of relatively poor (by some 210 million people), despite progress in reducing extreme income poverty (Chen and Ravallion, 2012). Ravallion (2015) recommends complementing the USD 1.25 a day poverty line with a \u2018weakly relative\u2019 line. Finally, it is clear that, because the extreme and moderate international poverty lines capture only the most abject poverty, they become fairly meaningless in richer countries. To address the limited applicability of the poverty lines to other parts of the world, researchers have proposed a much higher international poverty line \u2014 for example, Lant Pritchett has proposed complementing the extreme poverty line with a USD 12.50 poverty line in 2005 PPP (Pritchett, 2013).

As noted in the main body of the report, in Chapter 2 above we report on World Bank regional estimates, which include SSA. As described in Chapter 1 (Box 1.3), the Bank uses a different approach to compute these regional averages \u2014 it takes as its point of departure any country that was considered developing in 1990 (rather than the present set of developing countries) and imputes country poverty headcount ratios, where these are missing, as the average headcount for that region. For these reasons, the figures presented here will differ from these estimates. ",

        "164 ANNEX 9: Progress on poverty reduction by country, 2000-2012, 2011 PPP Chapter 6 presents an analysis of country progress on absolute and relative poverty reduction income categories by progress on USD 1.25 poverty at 2005 PPP. The rest of the report uses the USD 1.90 extreme poverty line and the 2011 PPP. This annex updates Table 6.2 using these data, and discusses the difference between the two. For the 93 countries with data for 2000 and 2012, we assess performance in terms of whether or not their poverty reduction was above or below average in absolute and relative terms since 2000, or whether they regressed (Table A9.1). Table A9.1 shows that a relatively large number of countries managed to make rapid progress according to both absolute and relative criteria (32 of 93), whereas 31 made above-average progress according to one or the other criteria. Poverty increased in a smaller number of countries (eight of 93). Compared with Table 6.2, a significant group of countries (20) have done better than previously thought. There are more countries with strong or moderate progress, including a number (eight) with below average progress in Table 6.2. A number of countries (three) regressing in Table 6.2 are no longer. Another 56 countries\u2019 trajectories have not changed. The degree of change suggests that the adoption of the more up-to-date data on prices and a nominally higher poverty line (though one judged to be equivalent to USD 1.25 at the new prices) allows a significantly more optimistic picture to be painted. If the poverty line is similar, why should the new data on prices have made such a difference? It is partly because when different countries are included, or the degree of poverty reduction changes, then the mean of the group changes as well, and ultimately so do the countries that are found to make different categories of progress. Since this is a mean-derived categorisation using a limited number of countries, methodologically at least it makes sense that the categorisation would change when the \u2018inputs\u2019, i.e. countries\u2019 poverty reduction rates etc., also changes.

The second is that, while on average the developing world outperformed these countries (except for the LLDCs, which performed especially well), the gaps are not large. We also look at the effect for a country of having multiple geographic/special status designations \u2014 considering being in SSA and an LDC, a FCAS and/or a landlocked country. We do not include being an ACP country (since this category is largely African). Through these intersections, a clearer picture emerges. Countries with more than one of these designations performed worse than those with zero or one such designations, but the trend is not straightforward. In particular, a larger share of those countries with all four designations than those with two or three designations registered stronger performance, and no countries with all four designations regressed (Figure A9.2). This is another reason for optimism \u2014 these special status designations do not even in combination necessarily prevent countries from making progress on poverty.

        "167 NB: A designation could involve geography (being part of SSA) and/or being a group facing special circumstances: FCAS, LDC, and LLDC. Note ACP is not included because most countries that are part of this group are in SSA. Each country can have none of these designations or up to four.

WDI Country Policy and Institutional Assessment + i.e. IDA Resource Allocation Index, obtained by calculating the average score for each cluster and then by averaging those scores. For each of 16 criteria countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). WDI Political stability and absence of violence ( 81 ) + Reflects perceptions of the likelihood that the government will be destabilised or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including politically motivated violence and terrorism. WGI Voice and accountability + Reflects perceptions of the extent to which a country\u2019s citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association and a free media. WGI GNI per capita growth rate + Annual percentage growth rate of GNI per capita based on constant local currency. Aggregates are based on constant 2005 US dollars. GNI per capita is gross national income divided by midyear population. GNI (formerly GNP) is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. WDI Government expenditure on education (% of GDP) + General government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers) is expressed as a percentage of GDP. It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to government. General government usually refers to local, regional and central governments. WDI Government expenditure on health (% of GDP) + Public health expenditure consists of recurrent and capital spending from government (central and local) budgets, external borrowings and grants (including donations from international agencies and nongovernmental organisations) and social (or compulsory) health insurance funds. WDI Government revenues (% of GDP) + Revenue is cash receipts from taxes, social contributions and other revenues such as fines, fees, rent and income from property or sales. Grants are also considered as revenue but are excluded here. WDI Gender Equity Index + Measures the gap between women and men in education, the economy and political empowerment Social Watch Vulnerability score - Vulnerability measures a country\u2019s exposure, sensitivity and ability to adapt to the negative impact of climate change ND-GAIN Foreign direct investment (% of GDP) + Foreign direct investment [is] the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 % or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. This series shows net inflows (new investment inflows less disinvestment) in the reporting economy from foreign investors and is divided by GDP. WDI ( 81 ) PSAV is a dimension of governance in the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project by the World Bank Group that reflects perceptions of the likelihood that the government will be destabilised or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including politically motivated violence and terrorism.
