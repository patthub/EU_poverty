        "Introduction to the ESSPROS System 1.1 0 6 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 1 Introduction to the ESSPROS System 1 EU Treaties identify the promotion of social protection and the development of the economic and social cohesion of the Member States as tasks of the Union. In order to monitor the progress of these tasks, the European Commission needs access to detailed and up-to-date information on the organisation, current standing and developments of social protection in the Member States and beyond. 2 The European System of integrated Social PROtection Statistics (ESSPROS) was developed in the late \u201870s by Eurostat jointly with representative of the Member States of the European Union in response to the need for a specific instrument of statistical observation of social protection in the EC Member States. 3 The first ESSPROS methodology was published in 1981. In 1993, Eurostat undertook a general revision of the ESSPROS, in close co-operation with the Members States. The ESSPROS Manual 1996 was the outcome of this revision process. 4 In April 2005, Eurostat proposed to introduce a legal basis for the ESSPROS project. The legal basis was proposed as a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council ( 1 ) (frame Regulation) supplemented by Commission Regulations ( 2 ) implementing in particular: ESSPROS core system (including qualitative information by schemes and detailed benefits), the module on pension beneficiaries and the pilot data collection on Net social protection benefits. 5 Simultaneously, an update of the ESSPROS Manual 1996 was undertaken because it was necessary to adjust its structure in order to incorporate some methodological clarifications. The ESSPROS Manual published in 2008 did not contain significant changes in respect to 1996 version, but mainly adjustments in the definitions and classifications. The first two parts of the Manual deal with the Core System. It consists of a stable, annually collected set of data on the receipts and expenditures of social protection schemes in the European Union. Supplementary sets of statistical information (modules), whose subjects were determined on the basis of the needs expressed, were introduced by the EP and Council ESSPROS Regulation: the module on Pension beneficiaries and the module on net social benefits. At the time of updating the manual, as the module on pension beneficiaries has already been planned, the methodology was added to the text. The second module, on net social benefits, was to be developed 6 A pilot data collection on net social protection benefits was launched in year 2008, and an EU synthesis report revealed positive results for a large majority of pilot studies. The report was presented to the Task Force (TF) on net social benefits in November 2009. All TF members agreed ( 1 ) Regulation (EC) No 458/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 April 2007 on the European system of integrated social protection statistics (ESSPROS) published in OJ L113, 30.04.2007, p.3.

        "1.1 Introduction to the ESSPROS System 7 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition that the report provided the requisite backing for moving towards a full data collection. In the 2010 ESSPROS WG a Gentlemen's agreement was set up in order to collect data on the module for years 2007, 2008 and 2009 on a voluntary basis according to the so-called restricted approach. Two Commission Regulations implementing the full net data collection were approved in year 2011 ( 3 ). As the methodology on the module on the net social protection benefits (restricted approach) was finalised at the same time, an update of the ESSPROS Manual was undertaken in order to include this new methodology. On the other hand a pilot study on the net social benefits according to the so- called enlarged approach was launched at end of 2010. The current Manual is equivalent to the previous version but complemented by the methodology on the module on net social protection benefits (restricted approach) finalised during the work on the pilot data collection. The ESSPROS Manual is the reference document in the four Commission Regulations implementing the EP and Council ESSPROS Regulation. It contains all detailed definitions and classifications. Concurrently, an extended Manual (or the \"ESSPROS Manual and user guidelines\") was produced. Its nature is serving as a User's Guide for compiling and using ESSPROS. The \"ESSPROS Manual and user guidelines\" contains in addition examples, further explanations and a complete list of schemes for each country. These specific items will be updated if necessary. 7 The objectives of ESSPROS are to provide a comprehensive and coherent description of social protection in the Member States: \u2022 covering social benefits and their financing; \u2022 geared to international comparability; \u2022 harmonising with other statistics, particularly the national accounts, in its main concepts. 8 ESSPROS, the integrated system of social protection statistics, provides a coherent comparison between European countries of social benefits to households and their financing. Social benefits are transfers to households, in cash or in kind intended to relieve them from the financial burden of a number of risks or needs. 9 The risks or needs of social protection refer to the ESSPROSS functions that are comprehensive, but do not include education unless it is a support to indigent families with children. The functions are disability, sickness/health care, old age, survivors, family/children, unemployment, housing and social exclusion. 10 Social benefits are made through collectively organised schemes by government and/or collective agreements. The schemes do not necessarily refer to institutions, although they are in many cases. These schemes can be defined solely for ESSPROS as a classification of schemes exists, where schemes are grouped by criteria. All schemes that are solely based on individual arrangements or where simultaneous reciprocal agreements exist are not regarded as social protection.

        "Introduction to the ESSPROS System 1.1 0 8 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 11 The scheme concept of social protection is straightforward as it starts from the point of view of the beneficiaries and therefore differs from other concepts that concentrate on institutional units spending or budgetary costs. The schemes are defined nationally according to the ESSPROS framework. 12 There are links with National Accounts, although there is not a complete conceptual match between the ESSPROS system and National Accounts. Particularly, the achievement of ESSPROS is its accounting structure similar to the National Accounts (benefits and their financing) at the level of the statistical unit of ESSPROS system (the scheme). There is also a link to the risks or needs to social benefits in the National Accounts. 13 Whereas the Core system corresponds to the standard information on social protection receipts and expenditures, the modules contain supplementary statistical information on particular aspects of social protection. Each module has its own methodology and is based on a particular Commission regulation. The introduction of any additional modules shall require extensive preliminary consultations with the Eurostat Working Party for social protection statistics and shall require a specific EP and Council Regulation. 14 The subjects covered by the modules were determined on the basis of the needs expressed by the Commission and the Member States. Currently included in ESSPROS are modules that cover: \u2022 the number of pension beneficiaries; \u2022 net social protection benefits, i.e. the influence of fiscal systems on social protection by the taxes and social contributions paid on benefits by beneficiaries and the extent to which social benefits are provided in the form of tax rebates or tax reductions. At the moment this module is implemented via the restricted approach in order to maintain the scope of the Core System.

        "1.2 The conventional definition of social protection 9 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 2 The conventional definition of social protection 2.1 Introduction 15 There is no universally accepted definition of the scope of social protection, nor does there exist one that suits all purposes (including the compilation of statistics). It is therefore necessary to formulate a conventional definition of the scope of social protection which meets as well as possible the needs of social policy analysis and data collection on an international level. This chapter begins with a general definition, relevant to both the Core system of the ESSPROS and its modules, that is further explained and specified for use in the Core system in the following paragraphs. 2.2 General definition 16 Social protection encompasses all interventions from public or private bodies intended to relieve households and individuals of the burden of a defined set of risks or needs, provided that there is neither a simultaneous reciprocal nor an individual arrangement involved. The list of risks or needs that may give rise to social protection is, by convention, as follows ( 4 ): 1. Sickness/Health care 2. Disability 3. Old age 4. Survivors 5. Family/children 6. Unemployment 7. Housing 8. Social exclusion not elsewhere classified. 2.3 Further explanation 2.3.1 Types of intervention 17 The word intervention in the definition should be understood in its broadest sense to cover the financing of benefits and related administration costs, as well as the actual provision of benefits. 18 Benefits granted within the framework of social protection can take many forms; however, in the Core system, they are limited to: (i) cash payments to protected people (ii) reimbursements of expenditure made by protected people (iii) goods and services directly provided to protected people. ( 4 ) There are a number of differences between the ESSPROS and the national accounts in the list of risks or needs giving rise to social benefits. The most important one is that the national accounts include the need \"Education\". See Appendix 1. ",
        "The conventional definition of social protection 1.2 10 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 2.3.2 Provision by public and private bodies 19 The condition that the intervention must come from public or private bodies excludes from the definition of social protection all direct transfers of resources between private households or individuals in the form of gifts, help to relatives and so on, even if their purpose is to protect the recipient from the risks or needs listed in paragraph 16. For practical reasons, small-scale, informal and incidental types of support such as whip-rounds, Christmas collections, ad-hoc humanitarian aid and emergency relief in the event of natural disasters, which do not require regular management and accounting, are also excluded from the definition. 2.3.3 The risks or needs 20 The list of risks or needs given in paragraph 16 has two purposes. On the one hand it restricts the scope of social protection to the areas which are felt to be most relevant in the European context. On the other hand, it is a tool for producing comparable statistics where the institutions, regulations and social traditions of the Member States diverge widely. The various risks and needs define the primary purposes for which resources and benefits are provided, irrespective of legislative or institutional structures behind them. In this context, it is customary to use the term functions of social protection. 21 Functions are defined in terms of their end-purpose, not in terms of given branches of social protection or pieces of legislation. For instance, the benefits granted by a pension fund cannot simply be classified in their entirety under the Old age function, as some benefits may have the purpose to relieve the beneficiary from needs related to the death of a breadwinner (which belong to the Survivors function) or to the loss of the physical ability to engage in economic and social activities (which are to be classified under the Disability function). The ESSPROS applies the functional breakdown exclusively to social protection benefits, and not to receipts. It is recognised, in fact, that a single type of receipts can be used to finance benefits under several different functions. 22 Paragraph 110 briefly describes the functions distinguished in the ESSPROS. Part 2 of the Manual contains a detailed specification of the types of benefits covered by each function and gives further guidance to their interpretation. 2.3.4 Absence of a simultaneous reciprocal arrangement 23 The conventional definition of social protection stipulates that the intervention does not involve a simultaneous reciprocal arrangement. This should be conceived as excluding from the scope of social protection any intervention where the recipient is obliged to provide simultaneously something of equivalent value in exchange. For instance, interest-bearing loans granted to households are not social protection because the borrower commits himself to paying interest and to refund the capital sum ( 5 ). Likewise, the portion of the full cost of health care and other provisions that beneficiaries are required to meet personally falls outside the field of social protection. This does not preclude that social protection benefits may be conditional on some action to be undertaken by the beneficiary (such as taking part in a vocational training programme), provided that this action does not have the character of salaried work or sale of services. ( 5 ) Still, if the loan is interest-free or granted at an interest rate well below the current market rate for social protection reasons, the amount of interest waived qualifies as a social benefit. ",
        "1.2 The conventional definition of social protection 11 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 24 The principle that the intervention should not involve a simultaneous reciprocal arrangement is particularly important for distinguishing social protection provided directly by employers to employees from the flows which make up gross wages and salaries. 25 However, where the reciprocal arrangement from the employee is not simultaneous, the expenditure is classified as social protection. For example, retirement and survivors' pensions paid by an employer, free housing to retired employees and so on are social benefits (even if the right to the benefit arises from the previous period of service with the employer, that is, work during active life being the reciprocal arrangement). Following the same reasoning, the continued payment of wages and salaries while an employee is unable to work during sickness, maternity, disability, redundancy and so on is classified as social protection provided by the employer. 26 Furthermore, in line with national accounts\u2019 definitions, social protection does not include expenditure by employers which is to their own benefit as well as to that of their employees because it is necessary for the employers' production process. 27 In practice, therefore, social protection provided directly by employers to their employees is limited to: (i) the continued payment of normal, or reduced, wages and salaries during periods of absence from work as a result of sickness, accident, maternity etc.; (ii) the payment of statutory special allowances for dependent children and other family members; (iii) health care which is not related to the nature of the work. 2.3.5 The exclusion of individual arrangements 28 Social protection excludes all insurance policies taken out on the private initiative of individuals or households solely in their own interest. For instance, the payment of a capital sum or an annuity to the holder of a private life insurance policy is not considered to be social protection. 29 This rule should not be interpreted as meaning that all individual policies are excluded from social protection. When social protection is provided by the employer in the form of insurance, it is sometimes allowed, or even required, that the policies be taken out in the names of the individual participants. 30 Nor does this rule imply that all collective contracts must be classified as social protection. Insurance policies that are taken out collectively with the sole purpose of obtaining a discount, as for example, a joint sickness policy covering a group of people travelling together, are not classified as social protection. 31 An insurance policy is included in the scope of the ESSPROS if it is based on social solidarity, whether or not it is taken out on the initiative of the person insured. An insurance policy is based on the principle of social solidarity if, as a matter of policy, the contributions charged are not proportional to the individual exposure to risk of the people protected ( 6 ). 32 It is noted that social solidarity is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for an insurance scheme to be classified as a scheme of social protection. Specifically, (i) where by law or by regulation certain groups of the population are obliged to participate in a designated insurance scheme, or; ( 6 ) This definition pertains exclusively to insurance schemes. The principle of social solidarity is also applied elsewhere and is, for instance, a feature of all non-contributory schemes. ",

        "1.3 Accounting structure and classifications in the core system 13 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 3 Accounting structure and classifications in the core system 3.1 Introduction 33 This chapter provides an overview of the Core system of the ESSPROS. It introduces a number of concepts and classifications which will be discussed further in the following chapters, and in Part 2 of the Manual. 3.2 Delimitations of the Core System 34 There are three essential differences between the Core system and the full ESSPROS. Firstly, as stated in paragraph 18, the Core system deals only with social protection given in the form of cash payments, reimbursements and directly provided goods and services to households and individuals. Secondly, the statistical description is confined to receipts and expenditures of social protection schemes. Finally, the Core takes only distributive transactions into account. 35 The social protection scheme is a unit specially defined for the ESSPROS, and must be clearly distinguished from legal entities or other types of statistical units in common use. Chapter 4 will define a scheme as a distinct body of rules, supported by one or more institutional units, governing the provision of social benefits and their financing. The scheme should be as specific as possible as to the risk or need for which protection is provided and the categories of people protected, without being so small that it becomes impossible to draw up an account of receipts and expenditures. The schemes are characterised according to the following five criteria: (i) Which unit takes the main decisions? (ii) Is membership of the scheme enforced by government? (iii) Are entitlements to benefits conditional on the payment of contributions? (iv) Is the scheme protecting the full population or only particular sections of it? (v) What is the level of protection provided by the scheme? All relevant definitions are contained in chapter 4. 36 The Core system records receipts and expenditures of social protection schemes, but only in the form of: (i) distributive transactions, whether current or capital; (ii) administration costs charged to the scheme. Any receipts or expenditures relating to production activities (for instance, the production of administration services or of goods and services for direct provision to beneficiaries) are excluded. Likewise, no financial transactions by the scheme (such as the issue of a loan or bonds) are recorded. ",
        "Accounting structure and classifications in the core system 1.3 14 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 3.3 The accounting structure 37 There are various ways of presenting the main categories of receipts and expenditures of social protection schemes. The most straightforward method is by listing them one under the other, beginning with receipts, as in Table A below. Table A: Transaction categories of social protection schemes in the Core system Receipts 1 Social contributions 2 General government contributions 3 Transfers from other schemes 4 Other receipts Expenditure 1 Social benefits 2 Administration costs 3 Transfers to other schemes 4 Other expenditure 38 The description of receipts and expenditures of social protection schemes is the subject of chapters 5 and 6 respectively. 39 Social benefits are a main focus of the ESSPROS. They are broken down by function (see paragraphs 20 to22) and by type (the form in which the protection is given). The classification of social benefits by type contains two levels: an aggregate level which allows cross-functional analysis (e.g., benefits in cash and in kind, see section 7.2) and a detailed level which defines categories usually only relevant to one function (i.e., old age pensions, unemployment benefits). Part 2 of the Manual contains a detailed description of the various benefit categories. 40 The ESSPROS contains extensive classifications of both schemes and transactions of schemes, covering the many ways in which social protection is organised within the European Union. ",
        "1.4 Definition and grouping of social protection schemes 15 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 4 Definition and grouping of Social protection schemes 4.1 The statistical unit 41 The Core system presents data on benefits provided, and their financing, as expenditures and receipts of the units that are responsible for providing social protection. This method has a number of advantages. Firstly, the statistical information can be structured in a single accounting framework covering both the provision of social protection and its financing. Secondly, the data can easily be grouped according to the main characteristics of the providing units, making it easier to compare and analyse the ways in which the Member States organise their systems of social protection. Thirdly, the method allows to exploit in a coherent way the administrative files of the Member States, which are reliable and low-cost sources of statistical data ( 7 ). 42 The statistical unit in the ESSPROS is called social protection scheme. It is defined as follows: A social protection scheme is a distinct body of rules, supported by one or more institutional units, governing the provision of social protection benefits and their financing. This definition calls for further clarification: (i) Social protection schemes should at all times meet the condition that it must be possible to draw up a separate account of receipts and expenditures. (ii) Preferably, social protection schemes are chosen in such a way that they provide protection against a single risk or need and cover a single specific group of beneficiaries. 43 Social protection schemes are concerned exclusively with redistribution and not with production. They are supported by institutional units and are not themselves institutional units. Some institutional units support social protection schemes as their main activity; for example, social security funds, pension funds, welfare funds or mutual benefit societies. Others run social protection schemes only as a subsidiary activity; for example, employers, insurance companies or trade unions. Goods and services provided in kind to beneficiaries are considered to be produced by the institutional unit (or units) which support the scheme in question, or else to be purchased from other institutional units. Institutional units can support more than one social protection scheme, when they administer and provide very diverse types of social benefits. On the other hand, a single social protection scheme can be supported by several institutional units, where each is responsible for, say, a specific geographic region, group of enterprises or category of workers. 44 The body of rules referred to in this definition may be established de jure, by virtue of laws, regulations or contracts, or de facto, by virtue of administrative practice. De facto schemes are, for ( 7 ) A full understanding of social protection, however, requires information that cannot be exclusively obtained from the administrative files of the providing units. For example, when no administrative data are available on benefits provided by employers in the form of continued payment of wages in case of sickness, information can be gathered from labour cost surveys. ",
        "Definition and grouping of social protection schemes 1.4 16 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition example, set up by employers to provide their employees with extra-legal benefits, often topping up benefits provided by existing basic schemes. 45 A separate account of receipts and expenditures means the availability of a full and itemised set of records on resources and uses during the accounting period. Such account of receipts and expenditures may be derived directly from administrative sources or else be constructed by means of estimation. It should be noted that the resources of some schemes include imputed receipts. This is particularly the case with government social assistance schemes (which are financed implicitly through imputed government contributions) and non-autonomous schemes run by employers (which draw on imputed employers' contributions). 46 The conventionally agreed list of risks or needs - the social protection functions - is given in paragraph 11 above. The wish to define schemes in such a way that they provide protection against a single risk or need for a single specific group of beneficiaries could produce a multitude of units. The tendency to fragmentation, however, is kept within boundaries by the need to be able to compile information on both receipts and expenditures for each scheme. In practice, therefore, many schemes provide benefits which come under several functions. 47 In several Member States, a specialised agency is set up for the financing of public social protection and the distribution of resources among the institutional units which are responsible for the granting of benefits. In such cases, a fundamental choice has to be made whether to: (i) combine the financing and provision of benefits in a single social protection scheme, or: (ii) distinguish several schemes of social protection, among which one that finances the others through transfers between schemes . It is recommended to choose the second option, as this provides more opportunities for analysing the structure of social protection. 4.2 Grouping of Social protection schemes 4.2.1 No single classification 48 The ESSPROS does not contain a single classification of schemes, but instead defines a number of characteristics which can be freely combined to produce different groupings of schemes as required by analysis. For instance, schemes managed by social security funds are usually both government -controlled (ref. 11) and contributory (ref. 31). The categories are defined on the basis of (i) the type of unit which takes the essential decisions, (ii) the existence or absence of a legal obligation, (iii) the way entitlements are established, (iv) the scope of the scheme, (v) the level of protection provided. For each of these criteria, the schemes are allocated to the group which agrees with their predominant character. This implies that each scheme is classified into one single category per criterion.

Level of protection 51 Basic schemes 52 Supplementary schemes 4.2.2 Decision-making 49 Decision making refers to the unit that takes the most important decisions: the level of benefits, the terms on which they are paid and the ways in which the scheme is financed. Schemes may be government-controlled or not government-controlled. 50 Government-controlled schemes (ref. 11) consist of social protection schemes which are controlled by government. The definition of general government is given in paragraph 92. Controlled implies that the government takes all the principal decisions about the level of benefits, the terms on which they are paid and the ways in which the scheme is financed. It is not sufficient to classify a scheme as government-controlled simply because the government has a formal (but unexercised) right to determine the policy of a given scheme or the scheme's managers have an obligation to submit certain decisions for broad approval to the public authorities. Government-controlled social protection is usually established by law or regulation. It includes all schemes that provide protection to public servants on the same lines as that provided to the general population by government-controlled schemes, but excludes schemes that government may set up in its role of employer and which have no government-controlled counterparts in the private sector. These schemes are classified as not government-controlled schemes for employees. 51 Government-controlled social protection may be further subdivided by level of government into: ",
        "Definition and grouping of social protection schemes 1.4 18 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition (i) Central government schemes and social security funds (ref. 111), (ii) State or local government schemes (ref. 112). 52 Not government-controlled schemes (ref. 12) are all social protection schemes which are not controlled by government in its role of public authority. 53 The ESSPROS sub-classifies not government-controlled schemes into not government-controlled schemes for employees and other not government-controlled schemes. Not government-controlled schemes for employees (ref. 121) are social protection schemes organised (but not necessarily run) by employers for their employees, former employees and their dependants. Two groups are distinguished: (i) Contractual not government-controlled schemes for employees (ref. 1211) provide social protection decided via bargaining between the social partners (employers and employees). The terms of such schemes are fixed by collective agreement and cannot be unilaterally changed by employers; (ii) Non-contractual not government-controlled schemes for employees (ref. 1212) provide social protection to employees at the discretion of the employer. Other not government-controlled schemes (ref. 122) are all not government-controlled schemes other than those organised by employers for their employees, former employees and their dependants. They may be organised, for instance, for the general public or specific groups such as the self- employed. 4.2.3 Legal enforcement 54 Legal enforcement refers to the rules laid down by legislation concerning the membership of the protected people. Membership of a social protection scheme may be compulsory or non-compulsory. In the framework of the ESSPROS the concepts compulsory and voluntary are interpreted from the point of view of the people protected. 55 Compulsory schemes (ref. 21) are social protection schemes where membership is made compulsory by the government. 56 non-compulsory schemes (ref. 22) are all social protection schemes where membership is not made compulsory by government. Two subgroups of non-compulsory schemes are distinguished separately: (i) Schemes available by law (ref. 221) consists of schemes established by law or regulation and available for voluntary membership to specific groups such as low-income self-employed workers, or people who choose to remain protected after a period of compulsory cover comes to an end); (ii) The other subgroup consists in the other non\u2013compulsory schemes (ref. 222). ",
        "1.4 Definition and grouping of social protection schemes 19 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 4.2.4 Establishment of entitlements 57 Establishment of entitlements refers to the basis on which the protected person is eligible for benefits: conditional or not conditional on payment of contributions. 58 Contributory schemes (ref. 31) are social protection schemes that require the payment of contributions, by the protected persons or by other parties on their behalf, in order to secure individual entitlement to benefits. 59 Non-contributory schemes (ref. 32) are social protection schemes in which eligibility to benefits is not conditional on the payment of contributions by the protected persons or by other parties on their behalf. 4.2.5 Scope of the scheme 60 Scope of the scheme refers to the part of the population which is protected (the whole population , all or the majority of workers or specific sections of the population). 61 Universal schemes (ref. 41) are schemes which apply to the whole population, implying that all residents or nationals, irrespective of their socio-professional status, are eligible to receive social benefits upon materialisation of specific risks or needs. 62 General schemes (ref. 42) are those which apply to the totality or the preponderance of the economically active population. 63 Special schemes (ref. 43) are schemes designed to protect a specific, restricted section of the population. 64 The ESSPROS defines four separate sub-groups of special schemes. Schemes for public servants (ref. 431) are those reserved for established and acting public servants, other members of general government staff and officials of public corporations insofar as they have official status under public law. Schemes for the self-employed (ref. 432) are schemes set up to provide protection for the self- employed and their dependants. Other occupational schemes (ref. 433) are schemes created for certain categories of workers on the basis of occupation or profession, other than special schemes for public servants and the self- employed. Other schemes (ref. 434) groups all remaining special schemes. 4.2.6 Level of protection 65 Level of protection refers to whether social protection schemes offer a basic or a supplementary level of protection. Various criteria are used for classifying, including some of the distinctions defined earlier in this chapter, so that interpretations may vary slightly from country to country. The following paragraphs explain the concepts in current use rather than try to provide standard definitions for international comparison. ",
        "Definition and grouping of social protection schemes 1.4 20 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 66 Basic schemes (ref. 51) are social protection schemes that guarantee a basic level of protection. A basic level of protection means the lower level of protection (based on the number of years of contributions/work and/or residency), without it being strictly understood as the level of resources allowing only the minimum socially acceptable standard of living. Basic old age schemes, for instance, typically guarantee either a flat-rate pension and/or a limited percentage of former earnings which may or may not be, supplemented by other provisions. In respect of medical care, basic schemes can either take charge of the lowest class of health care or compensate for only a specific fraction of its cost. 67 Supplementary schemes (ref. 52) are social protection schemes that: \u2022 top up cash benefits granted by the basic scheme, or; \u2022 extend the coverage of the basic scheme, or; \u2022 replace the basic scheme where conditions for entitlement to the basic scheme are not fulfilled.

        "1.5 Receipts of social protection schemes 21 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 5 Receipts of Social protection schemes 5.1 Introduction 68 The ESSPROS Core system classifies receipts of social protection schemes by type and origin. The type indicates the nature of, or reason for, a payment; the origin specifies the institutional sector from which the payment is received. 69 When a single type of receipts finances benefits in different functions, it is difficult to tell what fraction of the receipts pays for which benefit and, therefore, for which function. This is the main reason why social protection schemes cannot always meet the requirement to provide protection against a single risk or need (see paragraph 46 above). 5.2 Types of receipts Table C: Classification of receipts of social protection schemes by type 1 Social contributions 11 Employers' social contributions 111 Actual employers' social contributions 112 Imputed employers' social contributions 12 Social contributions by the protected persons 121 Employees 122 Self-employed persons 123 Pensioners and other 2 General government contributions 21 Earmarked taxes 22 General revenue 3 Transfers from other schemes 31 Social contributions re-routed from other schemes 32 Other transfers from other schemes 4 Other receipts 41 Property income 42 Other 70 Social contributions (ref. 1) means the costs incurred by employers on behalf of their employees or by protected persons to secure entitlement to social benefits. 71 Employers' social contributions (ref. 11) are the costs incurred by employers to secure entitlement to social benefits for their employees, former employees and their dependants. 72 Employers' actual social contributions (ref. 111) are payments made by employers to insurers to secure entitlement to social benefits for their employees, former employees and their dependants. The term insurers includes: ",
        "Receipts of social protection schemes 1.5 22 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition (i) social security funds; (ii) non-profit institutions running contributory schemes (such as autonomous pension funds); (iii) commercial insurance companies; (iv) employers running non-autonomous schemes and maintaining segregated reserves in their balance sheets for that purpose. 73 Employers' imputed social contributions (ref. 112) are the costs incurred by employers by granting social benefits or by promising social benefits payable in future, to their employees, former employees and their dependants, (i) without involving an autonomous insurer, and; (ii) without maintaining segregated reserves for that purpose in their balance sheets. 74 The valuation of employers' imputed social contributions may pose problems if the associated benefits are due in future (old age pensions, for example). In principle, the net current value of such promised future benefits must be determined. 75 Social contributions paid by protected persons (ref. 12) are payments made by individuals and households to social protection schemes in order to obtain or keep the right to receive social benefits. 76 Social contributions paid by protected persons are broken down by category into: (i) Social contributions paid by Employees (ref. 121); (ii) Social contributions paid by Self-employed persons (ref. 122); (iii) Social contributions paid by Pensioners and other persons (ref. 123). 77 General government contributions (ref. 2) consists of: (i) the cost to general government of running government-controlled non-contributory schemes, and; (ii) financial support provided by general government to other resident social protection schemes. 78 The category of General government contributions is broken down into Earmarked taxes and General revenue . 79 Earmarked taxes (ref. 21) are the proceeds from taxes and levies which, by law, can be used only to finance social protection. 80 General revenue (ref. 22) are general government contributions from sources other than earmarked taxes. 81 Transfers from other schemes (ref. 3) means unrequited payments received from other social protection schemes. These are broken down in two categories. 82 Re-routed social contributions are payments that a social protection scheme makes to another scheme in order to maintain or accrue the rights of its protected people to social protection from the recipient scheme. Even if such payments only involve one transaction from one scheme to another, the ESSPROS records the following two flows of equal value: (i) in the expenditure of the paying scheme, the amount of transfers to other schemes on behalf of protected people ( Social contributions re-routed to other schemes; see paragraph 104); (ii) in the receipts of the recipient scheme, social contributions paid by the paying schemes on behalf of protected people ( Social contributions re-routed from other schemes ref. 31). ",
        "1.5 Receipts of social protection schemes 23 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 83 Other transfers from other schemes (ref. 32) An example of other transfers from other schemes is contributions made by one scheme to reduce the deficit of another. 84 Other receipts (ref. 4) means miscellaneous current receipts of social protection schemes. They are broken down into receipts of property income and other. 85 Property income (ref. 41) is the income receivable by the owner of a financial asset or a tangible non-produced asset in turn for providing funds to, or putting the tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of, another institutional unit. In practice, it refers mainly to actual interest and dividends. Receipts from property income also include any entrepreneurial income, such as the proceeds from the exploitation of dwellings, credited to the scheme by the institutional unit that runs it. Note that, as social protection schemes by definition do not undertake production activities, they cannot themselves generate entrepreneurial income. 86 The category Other (ref. 42) groups miscellaneous receipts not otherwise attributable, such as proceeds of collections (mainly gifts from households), net proceeds from private lotteries, claims on insurance companies and large gifts such as legacies from the private sector. This category does not include any direct payments made by beneficiaries towards the cost of social benefits in kind by way of cost-sharing. Such payments are receipts of the institutional units that sell these goods and services and not of social protection schemes. 5.3 Classification of institutional sectors from which receipts originate Table D: Classification of institutional sectors from which receipts of social protection schemes originate 1 All resident institutional units 11 Corporations (non-financial and financial) 12 General government 121 Central government 122 State and local government 123 Social security funds 13 Households 14 Non-profit institutions serving households 2 Rest of the world 87 The definitions of the institutional sectors from which the receipts of social protection schemes originate are the same as those for the national accounts. 88 The institutional unit is defined as an elementary economic decision-making centre characterised by uniformity of behaviour and decision-making autonomy in the exercise of its principal function. A resident unit is regarded to constitute an institutional unit if it has decision-making autonomy in the exercise of its principal function and either keeps a complete set of accounts or is such that it would ",
        "Receipts of social protection schemes 1.5 24 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition be possible and meaningful, from both an economic and legal viewpoint, to compile a complete set of accounts if required. In order to be said to have autonomy of decision in the exercise of its principal function, a unit must: \u2022 be entitled to own goods or assets in its own right, and therefore be able to exchange the ownership of goods or assets in transactions with other institutional units; \u2022 be able to take economic decisions and engage in economic activities for which it is held to be directly responsible and accountable at law; \u2022 be able to incur liabilities on its own behalf, to take on further obligations or commitments and to enter into contracts. A complete set of accounts means accounting records covering all economic and financial transactions carried out during the accounting period, as well as a balance sheet of assets and liabilities. Households are held to always enjoy autonomy of decision in respect of their principal function and must therefore be regarded as institutional units, even though they do not keep a complete set of accounts. 89 Institutional sectors are aggregations of institutional units on the basis of similar economic behaviour. 90 The category All resident institutional units (ref. 1) groups all institutional units that are resident in the country. The principles of residence are set out in Chapter 9. 91 The sector Corporations (ref. 11) consists of institutional units whose distributive and financial transactions are distinct from those of their owners, whose principal activity is the production of goods and services and which are market producers. Included in this sector are co-operatives, limited liability partnerships and quasi-corporations (that is, market producers without independent legal status that have an economic and financial behaviour different from that of their owners, implying that the de facto relationship with their owners is one of a corporation to its shareholder). Corporations may run social protection schemes in their role as insurance companies or by operating non-autonomous schemes for the benefit of their employees. They secure benefits for their employees by paying actual or imputed employers' social contributions. 92 The sector General government (ref. 12) consists of: (i) all the resident distinct types of legal entities established by political processes which have legislative, judicial or executive authority over other institutional units within a given area, to the extent that their main output consists of collective services or individual goods and services which are provided free or at prices which cover less than 50% of production costs; (ii) resident non-profit institutions that provide most of their output to other institutional units free or at prices which cover less than 50% of their production costs and that are controlled and financed by the type of units mentioned in (i); (iii) all resident social security funds, that is, institutional units whose principal activity is to provide social benefits and which fulfil each of the following criteria: \u2022 by law or by regulation certain groups of the population are obliged to participate in the scheme or to pay contributions; ",
        "1.5 Receipts of social protection schemes 25 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition \u2022 government is responsible for the management of the institution in respect of the settlement or approval of the contributions and benefits independently from its role as supervisory body or employer. 93 The sub-sector Central government (ref. 121) covers all general government institutional units of type (i) above whose authority extends over a whole national territory and all units of type (ii) they control and finance. The sub-sector State and local government (ref. 122) covers all general government institutional units of type (i) mentioned above whose authority is restricted to a part of the national territory and all units of type (ii) they control and finance. State (regional) governments occur in countries with federal constitutions such as Belgium, Germany, and Austria. The sub-sector Social security funds (ref. 123) combines all general government units of type (iii) irrespective of the geographical area in which they are active ( 8 ). Within the framework of social policy, general government usually runs a variety of contributory and non-contributory schemes. It may also grant current and capital transfers to other institutional units, in particular non-profit institutions, to finance and support the social protection schemes they administer. Government secures benefits for public servants and its other employees by paying actual employers' social contributions. Normally, it will also provide certain social benefits directly to its employees. Finally, government may provide social protection through other channels (such as by granting fiscal benefits and paying subsidies to market producers), but these are not recorded in the Core system of the ESSPROS. 94 The sector Households (ref. 13) covers individuals or groups of individuals as consumers and possibly also as entrepreneurs producing market goods and non-financial and financial services provided that, in the latter case, the corresponding activities are not those of separate entities treated as quasi-corporations ( 9 ). It also includes individuals or groups of individuals as producers of goods and non-financial services for exclusively own final use. Households as consumers are defined as all resident small groups of persons, not necessarily related, who share the same living accommodation, who pool some, or all, of their income and wealth and who consume certain types of goods and services collectively, mainly housing and food. Domestic employees living on the employer's premises do not belong to the employer's institutional household. Persons living permanently or for a very long time in an institution and having no or little autonomy of action or decision in economic matters are treated as belonging, together, to a single institutional household, that is, a single household. Examples are members of religious orders living in monasteries, long-term patients in mental hospitals, prisoners serving long sentences and old people living permanently in retirement homes. In modules based on micro data, the sector Households may be sub-sectored according to criteria such as the composition of the household, the level and largest source of its income and the type of area in which the household has its accommodation. Households appear in the system as recipients of social benefits and contributors to social protection schemes by paying employers' contributions (if they are market producers or employers of paid domestic staff) and social contributions paid by the protected person. ( 8 ) The ESSPROS does not define the concept of \"social security scheme\". Social securit y funds are institutional units that may run schemes with widely diverging characteristics. The transactions of quasi-corporations are recorded in the sector Corporations. ( 9 ) The transactions of quasi-corporations are recorded in the sector Corporations. ",
        "Receipts of social protection schemes 1.5 26 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 95 The sector Non-profit institutions serving households (ref. 14) consists of all resident non-profit institutions that provide most of their output to households free or at prices which cover less than 50% of their production costs, except those which are controlled and mainly financed by government authorities. Their principal resources, apart from those derived from occasional sales, are derived from voluntary contributions in cash or in kind from households in their capacity as consumers, from payments made by General government and from property income. (Compare the definition of General government in paragraph 92 (ii)). Many social protection schemes are run by Non-profit institutions serving households. In their role as employers, they may pay actual employers' social contributions or provide social benefits directly to the employees working in these institutions. 96 The category Rest of the World (ref. 2) consists of all non-resident institutional units. The ESSPROS covers the transactions of the Rest of the World only insofar as they relate to resident social protection schemes. Examples are social contributions paid by non-resident households into resident social protection schemes. The definition of residence is given in Chapter 9. ",

The first is expenditure on social benefits, that is, resources which are transferred to beneficiaries in the form of cash or goods and services. The description of this type of expenditure is one of the main aims of the ESSPROS; Part 2 of the Manual is entirely devoted to the description of the various types of social benefits. The second category of expenditure relates to administration costs charged to the scheme. The third and fourth categories deal with transfers to other schemes and miscellaneous expenditure. 6.2 Types of Expenditure Table E: Classification of expenditure of social protection schemes by type 1 Social benefits 2 Administration costs 3 Transfers to other schemes 31 Social contributions re-routed to other schemes 32 Other transfers to other schemes 4 Other expenditure 41 Property income 42 Other 99 Social benefits (ref. 1) consists of transfers, in cash or in kind, by social protection schemes to households and individuals to relieve them of the burden of a defined set of risks or needs. The conventionally agreed list of risks or needs - functions - is given in paragraph 16 above. 100 In the Core system, social benefits refer exclusively to cash payments, reimbursements and directly provided goods and services. These are all direct benefits in the sense that they are advantages that imply an equivalent rise in the (adjusted) disposable income of the beneficiaries. 101 Resident social protection schemes may provide social benefits to both resident and non-resident protected people. Conversely, resident households and individuals may receive social benefits from non-resident schemes. These latter benefits are not recorded in the accounts, as they do not relate to resident social protection schemes (see chapter 9). 102 Administration costs (ref. 2) means the costs charged to the scheme for management and administration thereof.

The function of a social benefit refers to the primary purpose for which social protection is provided, irrespective of legislative or institutional provisions (see paragraphs 16 and 17). The type of benefit refers to the form in which the protection is provided. 7.1 Classification by Function 110 Eight functions of social protection are distinguished in the ESSPROS (see Table F). Table F: Definitions of the functions of social protection Function Brief description 1. Sickness/Health care Income maintenance and support in cash in connection with physical or mental illness, excluding disability. Health care intended to maintain, restore or improve the health of the people protected irrespective of the origin of the disorder. 2. Disability Income maintenance and support in cash or kind (except health care) in connection with the inability of physically or mentally disabled people to engage in economic and social activities. 3. Old age Income maintenance and support in cash or kind (except health care) in connection with old age. 4. Survivors Income maintenance and support in cash or kind in connection with the death of a family member. 5. Family/children Support in cash or kind (except health care) in connection with the costs of pregnancy, childbirth and adoption, bringing up children and caring for other family members. 6. Unemployment Income maintenance and support in cash or kind in connection with unemployment. 7. Housing Help towards the cost of housing. 8.

This chapter presents the general classification; the definitions of the categories on the detailed level are contained in Part 2 of this Manual. Table G: General classification of social benefits by type 1 Social benefits 11 Cash benefits 111 Periodic 112 Lump sum 12 Benefits in kind The general definition of Social benefits is given in paragraph 99 above. 112 A cash benefit (ref. 11) is a benefit: (i) paid in cash, and; (ii) that does not require evidence of actual expenditure by the recipients. Benefits that require evidence of actual expenditure by the beneficiaries are reimbursements that the System classifies as Benefits in kind (ref. 12). 113 Periodic cash benefits (ref. 111) are cash benefits paid at regular intervals, such as each week, month or quarter. 114 Lump sum benefits (ref. 112) are cash benefits paid on a single occasion or in the form of a lump- sum. 115 Benefits in kind (ref. 12) are benefits granted in the form of goods and services. 7.3. Means-testing 116 Social benefits are broken down between means-tested and non means-tested benefits. 117 Means-tested social benefits are social benefits which are explicitly or implicitly conditional on the beneficiary's income and/or wealth falling below a specified level.

        "1.8 Accounting conventions 31 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 8 Accounting conventions 8.1 Introduction 118 This chapter discusses a number of general accounting conventions. It deals with the principles of exhaustiveness and consistency, valuation, time of recording and the accounting period, netting and consolidation and the recognition of the principal party to transactions. 8.2 The principles of Exhaustiveness and Consistency 119 All transactions that fall within the scope of the ESSPROS must be recorded in the accounts. The principle of exhaustiveness is of primary importance for the international comparability of social protection data. 120 Special attention should be given to schemes that provide considerable benefits in terms of aggregate value, but for which there are little administrative data (such as unfunded company early retirement schemes and continued payment of wages and salaries by employers during sickness). If available sources do not provide clear data, appropriate estimates must be made. This could be done by comparison with similar schemes for which sufficient information is available. 121 At all times, consistency must be ensured in the accounts. For example, if a certain type of benefit is entered in the accounts, the relevant financing transactions must be included under the receipts of social protection schemes. Another example is expenditure on Transfers to other schemes which must have, somewhere in the system, the same value as the receipts from Transfers from other schemes. Finally, the recorded transactions of all the individual social protection schemes should add up exactly to the national totals. 8.3 Valuation 122 The ESSPROS values transactions at current exchange value , that is, the value at which flows and stocks are, or could be, exchanged for cash. In certain cases, when it is not possible to establish current exchange valued, goods and services are valued at their production cost . Normally, most social protection transactions are cash flows whose valuation does not pose any difficulties. The valuation of social benefits in kind directly provides to households is more difficult. 123 If a scheme buys goods and services for provision to its beneficiaries from producer units, the social benefit is valued at the actual price agreed by the two parties. There should be no, or only a relatively small, time lag between the time of purchase by the scheme and the time of supply to the beneficiaries. When this is not the case, the prices originally paid may no longer represent the real value of the benefits in kind provided. Under these circumstances, the benefits should, in principle, be valued at the price that the same or similar goods and services would fetch on the market at the time they are supplied to the beneficiaries. ",
        "Accounting conventions 1.8 32 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 124 If the institutional unit that manages the scheme produces the goods and services itself, there are two possibilities. If the institutional unit is a market producer ( 10 ), the benefits in kind are valued at the current market price for the same type of goods or services. If the providing unit is a non-market producer ( 11 ), the benefits in kind are valued as the sum of the costs incurred in their production and supply to the beneficiaries, that is, the sum of: (i) Intermediate consumption ( 12 ) (ii) Compensation of employees ( 13 ) (iii) Consumption of fixed capital ( 14 ) (iv) Taxes on production and imports less subsidies ( 15 ). Other categories of costs, such as interest costs, are not taken into account. The element Compensation of employees refers exclusively to personnel involved in the provision of social benefits. So, for example, the salaries of doctors and nurses of State hospitals are included, but the salaries of personnel in the Ministry of Health are excluded because they produce collective rather than individual services. 125 Any portion of the full cost of goods and services which is met personally by the beneficiary is excluded from the value of social benefits in kind. The share paid by the beneficiary is household consumption expenditure - not social expenditure. It is a receipt for the producer of the goods and services in question, not a receipt for the scheme. 126 To summarise: \u2022 social benefits produced by market producers are valued at the price that the same goods and services fetch on the market minus the share paid by the beneficiaries themselves to the scheme; \u2022 social benefits produced by non-market producers are valued at the cost of production and supply minus the share paid by the beneficiaries themselves to the scheme. 127 If retirement homes, social housing corporations and similar are financed solely by the government, it would be more convenient to value their services on the basis to the actual government transfers, rather than according to the principles above. In this case, the following two conditions must be observed: (i) only that part of the government transfer that applies to the actual social benefits should be taken into account, excluding any contributions towards administration costs or other expenditure; ( 10 ) A \"market producer\" is a unit that produces goods and services and whose production costs are for 50% or more covered by income from sales. Private non-profit institutions and government units may be market producers. All private producers other than non-profit institutions are classified as market producers by convention. ( 11 ) I.e., a private non-profit institution or a public unit whose production costs are for 50% or less covered by income from sales. ( 12 ) Intermediate consumption is the value of goods and services consumed as inputs in the production process, excluding fixed assets whose consumption is recorded as consumption of fixed capital. ( 13 ) Compensation of employees is the total remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable by an employer to his or her employees in return for work done. Compensation of employees can be broken down into Wages and salaries and Employers' social contributions. ( 14 ) Consumption of fixed capital represents the amount of fixed assets used up during the period under consideration as a result of foreseeable economic obsolescence and normal wear and tear, including a provision for losses of fixed assets as a result of normal accidental damage. Its value may deviate considerably from the values calculated via normal business depreciation methods or as allowed for taxation purposes, especially when there is inflation. ( 15 ) Taxes on production and imports consist of compulsory, unrequited payments, in cash or in kind, which are levied by general government or by the Institutions of the European Union in respect of the production and import of goods and services, the employment of labour, the ownership or use of land, buildings or other assets used in production. Subsidies are defined as current unrequited payments which general government or the Institutions of the European Union make to producers with the objective of influencing their levels of production, their prices or the remuneration of the factors of production. ",
        "1.8 Accounting conventions 33 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition (ii) the time span during which the benefits are provided must be taken into account. For example, if the government makes contributions in the shape of a substantial lump-sum (capital transfer), its amount should be allotted to the number of individual accounting periods during which benefits are provided. ( 16 ) 128 Social benefits in the form of interest-free or low-interest loans are valued at the amount of interest waived by the scheme in comparison with the current market value. 129 The Core system records social benefits without any deduction of taxes and other obligatory levies payable on benefits by beneficiaries. 130 With regard to the valuation of administration costs (see paragraphs 102 through 104), it is important to distinguish between the types of units which administer the schemes. If the scheme is run by a commercial insurer, for instance a life insurance company, administration costs are valued by the actual fees that the commercial insurer charges (plus any other management costs incurred by the scheme, such as attendance fees for the board of governors). If the scheme is managed by government units or non-profit institutions, administration costs are valued at the sum of the costs incurred in administering the scheme (that is, intermediate consumption, compensation of employees, consumption of fixed capital and taxes on production and imports less subsidies; see paragraph 124). For reasons of simplicity, the value of administration costs is not imputed when such costs form an inseparable part of intermediate consumption of the institutional unit that runs the scheme. This is the case for all unfunded employer's schemes and possibly for certain government-controlled non- contributory schemes and funded employers' schemes. 131 Transactions denoted in foreign currency are converted into their value in local currency at the rate prevailing when they are entered in the accounts. The midpoint between the buying and selling rate should be used, and any service charge must be excluded. 8.4 Time of Recording and the Accounting Period 132 In principle, all transactions are recorded on an accrual basis, that is, at the time the events which create the related claims and liabilities occur. For instance, employer's contributions are recorded at the time the work that gives rise to the liability to pay the contributions is done. Social benefits in cash are recorded at the time the beneficiaries obtain the right to receive them. Reimbursements are recorded at the time the household makes the relevant purchase. Other types of benefits in kind should normally be recorded at the times the goods are transferred or the services provided. 133 In theory the accounting period can refer to any period of time. For their own purposes, the countries may prefer periods that coincide with administrative years or intervals during which the scales for social benefits and contributions remain unchanged. However, for the purpose of international comparisons, the calendar year seems the most appropriate accounting period. The transactions recorded in the ESSPROS must therefore refer to the calendar year ( 17 ). ( 16 ) For example, a social housing corporation annually receives 210 units from government, of which 10 units are a contribution to administration costs, and also received, a few years previously, a single capital transfer of 1000 units, allowing rents charged to be reduced over a period of 10 years. In this case, the benefits in kind provided by the social housing corporation over a single year can be approximated as (210 - 10) + 1000/10 = 200 + 100 = 300 units. ( 17 ) If it proves impossible to make the required adjustments, the data for a financial year should be presented for the calendar year in which the greater part of the financial year falls. ",
        "Accounting conventions 1.8 34 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 8.5 Netting and Consolidation 134 Netting occurs when the values of certain transactions arising in both receipts and expenditure are cancelled out against each other, leaving only a net balance shown either under receipts or expenditure. Otherwise, the recording is said to be gross. 135 The ESSPROS recommends gross recording; for instance, interest received and interest paid by a scheme must not be offset against each other. However, the ESSPROS does not record separately any transaction which corrects an earlier erroneous or unauthorised one. In that case, the value of the rectifying transaction is netted against the value of the previous transaction, as if neither had taken place. Examples of rectifying transactions are the refund of overpaid social contributions and the repayment of benefits granted in error. If the government claims excess reserves of government-controlled social protection schemes, this is recorded under (negative) General government contributions for those schemes. 136 Consolidation refers to the mutual cancellation of transactions among schemes in the same group, for example, among resident government-controlled schemes or among the whole of schemes operating in the country. The ESSPROS recommends not to use consolidation in its accounts. 8.6 Recognising the Principal Party 137 When a unit carries out a transaction on behalf of another unit, the transaction is recorded only in the accounts of the unit on whose behalf the transaction is made. Some service charge may appear in the accounts of the unit serving as intermediary. 138 In some cases it is not clear on whose behalf a transaction is carried out. For instance, in case the central government makes payments to a lower government in order to enable the provision of social benefits at a local level, who is running the social protection scheme, the central government or the local one? The answer is important, both in order to avoid double counting in the System and for classifying all transactions correctly. The general rule in such circumstances is that the unit which is dealing directly with the households must be held to be running the scheme. In the example given above, this implies that local government is running the scheme, which is (partially) financed by contributions from central government. The only exception to this rule is when the unit dealing directly with the households has no authority whatsoever over the terms of the benefits (for example, level of benefit or eligibility). In this case, that unit is held to be acting on behalf of another unit. In the example above, the central government payment would then be recorded as a social benefit, and no transactions would be recorded for the local government unit. 139 If the local government receives social contributions that it passes on to central government, the general rule is again that the unit directly dealing with the contributors is held to receive the social contributions on its own behalf, except when it has no authority whatsoever over the terms under which the contributions must be made).

The Rest of the World is a grouping of units without any characteristic functions and resources; it consists of non-resident units insofar as they are engaged in transactions with resident institutional units, or have other economic links with resident units. 141 The ESSPROS records transactions with the Rest of the World only insofar as they are carried out between resident social protection schemes and non-resident units. In the receipts of a social protection scheme, transactions with the Rest of the World can concern the categories Social contributions and Other receipts. Examples of the former are social contributions paid by non-resident households or by non-profit institutions serving households. However, no breakdown by sector of origin is required in respect of receipts of social protection schemes from the Rest of the World. In the expenditure, transactions with the Rest of the World can concern the categories \"Social benefits\" and \"Other expenditure\". 9.2 The definition of Residence 142 The concept of residence in the ESSPROS is the same as used in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the national accounts. The main definitions are summarised here. 143 An institutional unit is considered to be resident in a country when there exists some location - dwelling, place of production or other premises - within the territory of that country on, or from, which the institutional unit engages and intends to continue to engage for at least one year in activities and transactions on a significant scale. The territory of a country consists of the geographic space administered by a national government within which persons, goods and capital circulate freely. It includes the airspace, territorial waters and so on under the jurisdiction of the country and also clearly demarcated areas of land located in other countries which are used by government with the formal political agreement of the host country. Examples are embassies, consulates, military bases and scientific stations. Similar areas within its own borders used by foreign governments and international organisations whose members are national states are excluded. Social protection schemes 144 Social protection schemes have the same residence as the institutional units that manage them. This rule implies that Member States should report on social protection schemes which are run by local offices of foreign insurance companies. By the same token, the Member State's reports should exclude any social insurance schemes run by foreign branches or subsidiaries of that Member State's insurance companies. Social protection schemes which are financed by means of development aid are considered to be resident of the developing countries in which they operate. ",
        "The rest of the world 1.9 36 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition Corporations 145 Corporations are resident in the country where they are engaged in the production of goods and services on a significant scale, or where they own land or buildings located there. When a corporation maintains a branch, office or production site in another country in order to engage in a significant level of production over a long period of time but without creating a subsidiary corporation for that purpose, the branch, office or site is considered to be a resident institutional unit of the country in which it is located. General government 146 The legal entities established by political processes as having legislative, judicial or executive authority over other institutional units are resident in the country in which they have jurisdiction. Social security funds and government non-profit institutions are resident in the country where they are located. International organisations whose members are national states, such as the European Union or the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, are not considered resident in any country, including those in which they are located or conduct their affairs. Households and individuals 147 Households are resident in the country where their principal common accommodation is located. All individual members of a household have the same residence. If the members of a household live in different countries for more than one year, that particular institutional household is split into two or more households resident in different countries. The residence of households and individuals is therefore not determined by nationality or legal status, but by normal location. Some specific rules are: \u2022 cross-border workers are resident in the country in which their households have their principal accommodation; \u2022 travellers, visitors and seasonal workers remain residents of their home country, provided they return to that country within one year; \u2022 students remain residents of their country of origin however long they study abroad, provided they do not start a family in the host country; \u2022 employees of international organisations are residents of the country in which they are expected to have their abode for one year or more; \u2022 on the other hand, military personnel, diplomats and other public servants whom a government posts abroad have the same residence as the employing government however long they stay abroad in this capacity; \u2022 locally recruited staff of overseas military bases, embassies, consulates and so on are residents of the country in which they live. Non-profit institutions serving households 148 Non-profit institutions serving households are resident in the country under whose laws and regulations they were created and where their existence as a legal or social entity is officially recognised and recorded. If a non-profit institution is engaged in charity or relief work on an international scale and maintains a branch for one year or more in a foreign country, that branch should be considered as a resident of the foreign country.

        "Part 2 Classification of benefits in the core system ",
        "Introduction 2.1 38 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 1 Introduction 1 Part 2 of the ESSPROS Manual ( 18 ) defines the various types of benefits classified by function of social protection. 2 The great detail of types of benefits introduced with the present Part allows a better understanding of the social protection systems in the Member States and permits the users of the statistics to form groupings of benefits according to their analysis needs. Data can be analysed by function of social protection, but also according to other criteria, for example by grouping all the benefits paid in the transition from work to retirement. It can be said therefore that, although this Manual groups benefits by function (that is, by their finality), the types of benefits have been defined in such a way that they can be easily regrouped according to other criteria. This introduces a great level of flexibility in the system. The user of the statistics, however, must be warned against carrying out cross-country comparisons at the level of single types of benefits. Such comparisons in fact can be very misleading, as the Member States may use different types of benefits to fulfil the same objectives. For this reason, it appears advisable to carry out cross-country comparisons at more aggregated levels. The general classification of benefits presented in Part 1, chapter 7, which distinguishes benefits in cash and benefits in kind, periodic benefits and benefits paid once only (lump sums), as well as means-tested and non means-tested benefits, can be very valuable. The tables presented in this part do not repeat these general classification categories (except the distinction cash benefits - benefits in kind). The cross-classification of all the benefit types presented in the Core of the ESSPROS is presented in the attached ESSPROS questionnaire (Appendix 1). 3 Another aspect of flexibility introduced with the revised ESSPROS is the fact that the content of this Part can be modified without affecting the general principles of the ESSPROS Core system set down in Part 1 if new types of benefits or new modes of social protection provision emerge in the national systems. 4 Social benefits either emerge from a purpose (wherefore?) or a reason (why?). Each function has a definition of contents and there surely is an overlap between different functions for certain benefits, e.g. a family or child component often exists, while benefits are granted for a specific purpose either as a risk (unemployment) or need (old age). In these cases the more specific function is generally preferred, e.g. unemployment instead of family/children. 5 In terms of the functional classification of benefits, the following general principles apply: \u2022 all medical care is included in the Sickness/health care function, benefits in kind, irrespective of the reason why medical care is provided; \u2022 no minimum or maximum age are used to define the concepts of old age in the Old age function and of children in the Family/children functions. Therefore, data will reflect, to a certain extent, national practices. 6 An important concept to distinguish clearly between the old-age function and others is the concept of a standard/legal retirement age. Old age benefits are generally granted to beneficiaries above the standard/legal retirement age. Disability is then limited to the integration into the workforce and early retirement benefits are only benefits paid to recipients below the standard/legal retirement age.

        "2.1 Introduction 39 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition specific age is mostly defined for each scheme separately or in a few cases determined by a reference scheme. 7 The present Manual does not define a function for the event of occupational accidents and diseases. Statistical data on this type of expenditure are not comparable, as they reflect the definition of occupational hazard adopted by each Member State in its own legislation and practice. Furthermore, benefits provided in the event of occupational accidents or diseases may range from sickness cash benefits to health care provision, from rehabilitation benefits to disability pensions. These benefits are covered by the functions in the Core system, where no distinction is made as for the causes of sickness or disability. However, where the risk of occupational accidents and diseases is covered by specific regulations, it is recommended to identify one or more separate schemes providing the relevant benefits. This ensures that information on the value of benefits as well as on their financing will be available for those countries where specific regulations on protection against occupational accidents and diseases exist.

        "Social benefits in the Sickness/Health care function 2.2 40 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 2 Social benefits in the Sickness/health care function 2.1 Introduction 8 The Sickness/health care function covers: \u2022 cash benefits that replace in whole or in part loss of earnings during temporary inability to work due to sickness or injury; \u2022 medical care provided in the framework of social protection to maintain, restore or improve the health of the people protected. 9 The scope of cash benefits in this function is rather limited. Cash benefits that replace loss of earnings during temporary inability to work in case of pregnancy or disability are recorded under the Family/children or Disability functions respectively. Benefits provided by employers in the form of continued payment of wages and salaries during sickness are taken into account. 10 All medical care falls under this function irrespective of the need or risk against which it is provided. For example, specific medical care provided to expectant mothers and disabled persons is included here and not under the Family/children and Disability functions. In particular, medical care covers the following goods and services used in prevention, cure or rehabilitation: \u2022 Services : medical and paramedical services provided by general practitioners, specialists and other health care personnel; laboratory tests and other examinations; dental care; physiotherapy; thermal cures; transport of sick people; preventive treatment such as vaccinations; accommodation in the case of a stay in hospital or other medical institution. Medical services as defined here cover those provided outside medical institutions as well as within. \u2022 Goods : pharmaceutical products; medical prosthesis (optical and acoustical aids; orthopaedic; dental and other prosthesis); dressings and medical supplies. 11 Only preventive measures through which an individual benefit (for example, a medical check-up) is provided to a protected person or household fall under the Sickness function and in general within the scope of ESSPROS. Preventive campaigns to alert the general public to health hazards (for example, smoking, alcohol or drug abuse) are not recorded by the ESSPROS. 12 Health care provided within the frame of the work environment by the employer aimed at guaranteeing safety at work or necessary for the production process of the enterprise is not included in the ESSPROS (see paragraph 26 of Part 1 of the Manual). 13 The way in which health care systems are organised varies considerably from one Member State to another. Data relating to in-patient and out-patient health care are broken down into directly provided benefits and reimbursements. A definition of the concepts of reimbursement and directly provided appears in paragraph 115, Part 1 of the Manual. Here below are described more in detail the circumstances under which health care benefits should be considered as directly provided or as reimbursements. ",
        "2.2 Social benefits in the Sickness/Health care function 41 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition There are three main patterns of health care provision: \u2022 under the indirect system, the social protection scheme provides medical care benefits for protected people by paying all or part of the cost of the medical care supplied by the providers. The patient pays the medical bill, all or part of which is then reimbursed by the social protection scheme. The benefits therefore take the form of reimbursements. \u2022 under the direct system, the institutional unit running the social protection scheme owns, operates and controls the necessary medical facilities and employs the medical, para- medical and administrative staff. In this system benefits are directly provided to the protected people. \u2022 in an alternative pattern of provision, intermediate between the two above - known as direct settlement system , the social protection scheme enters into a variety of contracts or agreements with health care providers. The medical care is provided to the beneficiary free or at the contractual rate (below its cost) by the providing unit (which is not a social protection scheme). The providing unit is then reimbursed by the social protection scheme. This type of benefit is also recorded as directly provided. 14 Cost sharing is an important aspect of health care provision. In these cases, the patient is required to meet part of the cost of medical treatment received. Various methods of cost-sharing exist in the Member States, for example: \u2022 the beneficiary pays either a fixed percentage of the cost of services and goods received, or a flat rate contribution towards those goods and services; \u2022 there is a cost threshold below which medical costs must be borne by the protected people (franchise levels); \u2022 there is a cost threshold above which medical costs must be borne by the protected people; \u2022 the patient must pay a fixed fee if he or she goes directly to a provider on a higher level of care than the designated entry level, for example by consulting a specialist without seeing a general practitioner first; \u2022 a defined range of goods or services is excluded from the social protection scheme. The cost of these goods and services must be borne in full by the patient. As the ESSPROS is intended to record the cost of social protection, and not the cost of total medical care, any part of the full cost of medical care which is met by the beneficiary himself under cost- sharing arrangements must be deducted from the value of the social benefit.

These benefits may be paid by autonomous social protection schemes, but they may also be provided by the employer in the form of continued payment of wages and salaries during the period of sickness. For reasons of convenience, paid leave in case of sickness or injury of a dependent family member (in most case a child) is also reported under this heading. 16 Other cash benefits: miscellaneous payments made to the protected people in connection with sickness or injury.

These payments normally cease when the beneficiary becomes entitled to an old age pension. 26 Care allowance: benefit paid to disabled people who need frequent or constant assistance to help them meet the extra costs of attendance (other than medical care). The benefit must not be a reimbursement of certified expenditure, which would be classified as benefit in kind. 27 Economic integration of the handicapped: allowances paid to disabled people when they undertake work adapted to their condition, normally in a sheltered workshop, or when they undergo vocational training. 28 Other cash benefits: periodic and lump-sum payments not falling under the above headings, such as occasional income support and so on. If it concerns a lump-sum, the benefit is normally granted instead of a periodical disability pension, the beneficiaries usually only having a low level of disability. 3.2.2 Benefits in kind 29 Accommodation: provision of lodging and possibly board to disabled people in appropriate establishments. 30 Assistance in carrying out daily tasks: practical help provided to disabled people to assist them with daily tasks. Home help is included in this category, as well as the payment of an allowance to the person who looks after the disabled person. 31 Rehabilitation: provision of specific goods and services (other than medical care) and vocational training to further the occupational and social rehabilitation of disabled people. These services may be provided in specialised institutions. Goods and services may be provided by an employer, but if they are mainly to service the production process of the enterprise, they should not be included (see also paragraph 26, Part 1). Medical rehabilitation - such as physiotherapy - is included in the Sickness/health care function. 32 Other benefits in kind: miscellaneous services and goods provided to disabled people to enable them to participate in leisure and cultural activities, or to travel and/or to participate in community life, including reduced prices, tariffs, fares, and so on granted to disabled people expressly for social protection reasons.

Medical care of the elderly is not taken into account, as all health care expenditure is reported under the Sickness/health care function. The Old age function covers benefits that: \u2022 provide a replacement income when the aged person retires from the labour market; \u2022 guarantee a certain income when a person has reached a prescribed age; \u2022 provide goods or services specifically required by the personal or social circumstances of the elderly. 34 Benefits excluded from the Old age function are: \u2022 medical care specific to old age, which is reported under the Sickness/health care function; \u2022 family allowances for dependent children where the beneficiary is also in receipt of an old age benefit; this is reported under the Family/children function. \u2022 early retirement benefits paid for labour market reasons or in case of reduced capacity to work, which are reported under the functions Unemployment and Disability respectively.

This may occur with or without a reduction of the normal pension. 37 Partial retirement pension: periodic payment of a portion of the full retirement pension to older workers who continue to work but reduce their working hours or whose income from a professional activity is below a set ceiling. The partial pension is converted into a full pension and recorded under the item old age pension when the beneficiary retires completely or when he or she ceases to earn professional income above the defined level. 38 Care allowance: benefit paid to old people who need frequent or constant assistance to help them meet the extra costs of attendance (other than medical care). The benefit must not be a reimbursement of certified expenditure, which would be classified as benefit in kind. 39 Other cash benefits: periodic or lump-sum benefits paid upon retirement or on account of old age that do not fall under the above headings, such as capital sums paid to people who do not fully meet the requirements for a periodic retirement pension, or who were members of a scheme designed to provide only capital sums at retirement. 4.2.2 Benefits in kind 40 Accommodation: provision of lodging and sometimes board to retired people either in specialised institutions (old people's homes, nursing homes) or staying with families. The provision can be of temporary or indefinite duration. 41 Assistance in carrying out daily tasks: practical help provided to old people to assist them with daily tasks. Home help is included in this category, as well as the payment of an allowance to the person who looks after an elderly person. 42 Other benefits in kind: miscellaneous goods and services for retired people to enable them to take part in leisure and cultural activities, to travel and/or participate in community life. These include reductions in prices, tariffs and fares for old age pensioners where they are expressly granted for social protection. 4.2.3 Legal/standard age of retirement for old age benefits 43 The legal retirement age for old age benefits means the age at which old age benefits become payable, if laid down legislation or by contract. This age can vary both between countries and within Member States, depending on the sector of activity, occupation, gender and so on. When no legal retirement age exists, a standard retirement age is to be used, which means the retirement age offered by the scheme that paid the pension to the beneficiary. ",

Survivors eligible for benefit may be the spouse or ex-spouse of the deceased person, his or her children, grandchildren, parents or other relatives. In some cases, the benefit may also be paid to someone outside the family. 45 Benefits excluded from the Survivors function are: \u2022 family allowances for dependent children where the beneficiary is receiving a survivor's benefit; these are reported under the Family/children function. 46 A survivor's benefit is normally granted on the basis of a derived right, that is, a right originally belonging to another person whose death is a condition for granting the benefit. However, some social protection schemes treat this right as a direct one, that is, there is no connection between the survivor's benefit received and any benefit that the deceased would have been able to claim.

The benefit may also be paid to the father. These benefits may be paid by autonomous social protection schemes, but they are also provided by employers in the form of continued payment of wages and salaries during absence from work. When there are no administrative data on the value of these payments, estimates must be based on other sources, such as labour cost surveys. 54 Birth grant : benefits normally paid as a lump sum or by instalments in case of childbirth or adoption.

These benefits may be paid periodically or as a lump-sum. 6.2.2 Benefits in kind 58 Child day care: shelter and board provided to pre-school children during the day or part of the day. The age limit for pre-school is defined by national legislation. Financial assistance towards the payment of a nurse to look after children during the day is also included here. Child day care services provided by the employer should not be taken into account, according to paragraphs 24 to 27 of Part 1. 59 Accommodation: shelter and board provided to children and families on a permanent basis (such as in nursing homes and foster families). 60 Home help: goods and services provided at home to children and/or to those who care for them. 61 Other benefits in kind: miscellaneous goods and services provided to families, young people or children (holiday and leisure centres), including reductions in prices, tariffs, fares and so on for children or large families, where expressly granted for social protection.

        "2.7 Social benefits in the Unemployment function 51 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 7 Social benefits in the Unemployment function 7.1 Introduction 62 The Unemployment Function includes benefits that: \u2022 replace in whole or in part income lost by a worker due to the loss of gainful employment; \u2022 provide a subsistence (or better) income to persons entering or re-entering the labour market; \u2022 compensate for the loss of earnings due to partial unemployment; \u2022 replace in whole or in part income lost by an older worker who retires from gainful employment before the legal retirement age because of job reductions for economic reasons; \u2022 contribute to the cost of training or re-training people looking for employment; \u2022 help unemployed persons meet the cost of travelling or relocating to obtain employment; \u2022 provide help and relief by providing appropriate goods and services. 63 Family allowances paid for dependent children to recipients of unemployment benefits are reported under the Family/children function, not under Unemployment. 64 A distinction currently applied to employment policies is between passive and active measures . The former simply try to mitigate the disadvantages of unemployment, while the latter aim to prevent unemployment or achieve shorter periods of unemployment. The Unemployment function contains mainly passive measures (especially unemployment pay and early retirement benefits), but also some active measures, such as benefits related to training programmes. In practice, the distinction between passive and active spending is not very practical from a statistical point of view. There are a number of measures which are hard to classify under one category or the other. For example, vocational training may be provided to recipients of unemployment benefits. Some partial early retirement benefits are conditional on the recruitment of young unemployed people, combining the effects of active and passive expenditure or making passive expenditure active. Some active employment measures in Member States are not within the scope of social protection in the Core system of ESSPROS, particularly expenditure that is not a direct advantage to households, in the sense that it does not raise their disposable income by cash transfers or the provision of goods and services (see paragraph 100, Part 1 of the Manual). The main examples are wage subsidies, exemptions from paying employers' social contributions and similar measures aimed at business with the purpose of combating unemployment. A common characteristic of these measures is that they help both business and the unemployed. ",

These payments normally cease when the beneficiary becomes entitled to an old age pension. 68 Vocational training allowance: payments by social security funds or public agencies to targeted groups of persons in the labour force who take part in training schemes intended to develop their potential for employment. 69 Redundancy compensation: capital sums paid to employees who have been dismissed through no fault of their own by an enterprise that is ceasing or cutting down its activities. This benefit may be paid either directly by the employer or by a fund set up for the purpose. 70 Other cash benefits: other financial assistance, particularly payments to the long-term unemployed, such as start-up incentives in the form of payment of unemployment benefit.

        "Social benefits in the Housing function 2.8 54 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 8 Social benefits in the Housing function 8.1 Introduction 75 The Housing Function is made up of interventions by public authorities to help households meet the cost of housing. Housing policies are widespread in the Member States and their purpose often goes beyond that of social protection: they may be aimed at encouraging the building industry, ownership of dwellings, saving and so on. These wider measures are not within the scope of ESSPROS. An essential criterion for defining the scope of the Housing function is the existence of a qualifying means-test for the benefit. 76 Even when housing benefits are paid in cash as a supplement to old age pensions or minimum guaranteed income benefits, they are classified in the Housing function as benefits in kind. The object of the benefits in this function is to help households meet the cost of housing: by definition, housing is considered certified expenditure (see paragraph 115 of Part 1 of the Manual). Table G: Classification of benefits in the Housing Function Benefits in kind Rent benefit of which : Social Housing Benefit to owner-occupiers 8.2 Description of the types of benefit 8.2.1 Benefits in kind 77 Rent benefit: a current means-tested transfer granted by a public authority to tenants, temporarily or on a long-term basis, to help with rent costs. 78 Social housing: sub-category of rent benefit. Loss of rental income due to the current imposition of non-commercial rents (that is, rents below the normal market price) by public bodies or private non- profit institutions that own low-cost or social housing. The assignment of housing at non-commercial rents must be determined by a test on the households' income and/or wealth. 79 Benefit to owner-occupiers: a means-tested transfer by a public authority to owner-occupiers to alleviate their current housing costs: in practice often help with paying mortgages and/or interest. All capital transfers (in particular investment grants) are excluded. ",
        "2.9 Social benefits in the function Social Exclusion not elsewhere classified 55 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 9 Social benefits in the function Social exclusion not elsewhere classified 9.1 Introduction 80 The need or risk against which social protection benefits are provided in this area is not easily defined. The concept of social exclusion is multidimensional: it refers firstly to an insufficient level of income (poverty), but also to precarious situations in the field of health, education and employment. It follows that the content of this function, or rather group of benefits, is fairly heterogeneous. However, the borderlines of this function are traced by the definition of social protection itself in chapter 2 of Part 1, and by the following principles: \u2022 small-scale, informal and incidental types of support that do not require regular management and accounting are conventionally excluded from the scope of ESSPROS. This is the case, for example, of whip-rounds, Christmas collections, ad-hoc humanitarian aid and emergency relief in the event of natural disasters; \u2022 all social benefits related to a risk or need for which ESSPROS defines a specific function are reported under that function. For example, all non-contributory and means-tested public schemes providing a minimum entitlement in the case of old age, disability or unemployment must be incorporated in the corresponding functions and not under the present function. The residual character of this function may lead to differences in cover among Member States depending on the main system of social protection they apply; \u2022 while the other functions refer to people subject to clearly identifiable risks or needs (the elderly, the disabled, the unemployed and so on), this function refers to the \"socially excluded\" or to \"those at risk of social exclusion\". General as this is, target groups may be identified (among others) as destitute people, migrants, refugees, drug or alcohol addicts, victims of criminal violence.

Conditions for entitlement may be related not only to the personal resources but also to nationality, residence, age, availability for work and family status. The benefit may have a limited or an unlimited duration; it may be paid to the individual or to the family, and provided by central or local government. 82 Other cash benefit: support for destitute and vulnerable persons to help alleviate poverty or assist in difficult situations. These benefits may be paid by private non-profit organisations. 9.2.2 Benefits in kind 83 Accommodation: shelter and board provided to destitute or vulnerable people, where these services cannot be classified under another function. This may be short term in reception centres, shelters and so on or on a more regular basis in special institutions, boarding houses, reception families and so on. 84 Rehabilitation of alcohol and drug abusers: treatment of alcohol and drug dependency aimed at reconstructing the social life of the abusers, making them able to live an independent life. The treatment is usually provided in reception centres or special institutions. 85 Other benefits in kind: basic services and goods to help vulnerable people, such as counselling, day shelter, help with carrying out daily tasks, food, clothing, fuel, etc...

        "III Appendix III: Methodology of the module on Pension beneficiaries 75 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition APPENDIX III: Methodology of the module on pension beneficiaries 1 Scope of the pension beneficiaries module 1 According to the EP and Council Regulation 458/2007 (Annex II), pension beneficiaries are defined as recipients of one or more of the periodic cash benefits of a social protection scheme falling within seven pension categories (disability pension; early retirement benefit due to reduced capacity to work; old-age pension; anticipated old-age pension; partial pension; survivors' pension; early retirement benefit due to labour market reasons). A social protection scheme is defined in the same Regulation as: \"a distinct body of rules, supported by one or more institutional units, governing the provision of social protection benefits and their financing\". 2 The aim of the module on pension beneficiaries is to calculate the total number of beneficiaries within: \u2022 Each of the previously mentioned seven categories of pensions; \u2022 Each of the four functions grouping these categories (disability, old-age, survivors' and unemployment); \u2022 and, at total level, for the aggregation of the four functions. 2 Statistical units and data collection requirements 3 Data, i.e. the number of beneficiaries, expressed exclusively in units (not thousands, millions\u2026of pensioners), must be provided by social protection scheme (\"scheme\" level) and for the total of schemes (\"all schemes\" level). Each of the 7 pension categories in the definition is further split into two subcategories, non means- tested and means-tested pensions, so that the total number of elementary (they are not obtained by aggregation of other items in the questionnaire but rather directly from data sources) items for which figures are to be provided is 14. 4 At \u201call schemes\u201d level (see paragraph 3.1), the information must be broken down by gender while this breakdown is optional at \u201cscheme\" level (see paragraph 3.2.). At both levels, figures on pension beneficiaries (standard table Benefits/Schemes of the questionnaire), are integrated by information concerning legal aspects with direct impact on data (qualitative information) and complementing statistics (quantitative data), from here on defined \"Supplementary information\". For both the kinds of information (standard table and supplementary information) compulsory and optional elements are distinguished. 5 In general, the number of pensions received by pensioners differs from the number of pensioners as many pensioners might receive more than one pension. The total number of beneficiaries is, so, defined as the number of persons receiving at least one pension (i.e. a person who receives more than one pension is counted only once). Double counting is to be avoided. Calculating the number of beneficiaries entails gradual aggregation in shifting from a unit (scheme) level to an overall (all schemes) one. Double counting must be spotted and treated at all stages of this gradual process of aggregation. Some guidance for detecting, estimating and eliminating double counting is given in paragraph 4.2. ",
        "Appendix III: Methodology of the module on Pension beneficiaries III 76 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 3 Definitions and classifications 6 General definitions of categories and classification of the beneficiaries included as mandatory in the module are laid down in the Commission Regulation (EC) No 10/2008, Section 2 of Annexes I and II, respectively. For optional information this appendix has to be referred. 7 Detailed definitions of the benefits included under the seven categories of pension (disability, early retirement benefit due to reduced capacity to work, old-age, anticipated old-age, partial, survivors\u2019 and early retirement due to labour market reason) and subcategories (breakdown according to mean- testing), and here mentioned by item-codes, are defined in the ESSPROS Manual, Part 2 (where categories are grouped by function). 3.1 All schemes (total) level 3.1.1 Compulsory data 8 Special items and codes have been created for the pension beneficiaries' module in order to report, compulsorily at all schemes level, on the total number of beneficiaries without double counting for the seven categories and the four functions involved (see their nested classification in Table A).

It is the number of persons in the country receiving at least one pension. It is obtained as aggregation of the totals for the four functions (1120110, 1130110, 1140111, 1160113), treating for type 6 double counting. ",

It is the number of pension beneficiaries obtained as aggregation of the elementary items 1121111 and 1122111, treating for type 3 double counting; Beneficiaries receiving early retirement benefits due to reduced capacity to work (1120112). It is the number of pension beneficiaries obtained as aggregation of the elementary items 1121112 and 1122112, treating for type 3 double counting. 11 Total pension beneficiaries in old-age function (1130110). It is the number of pension beneficiaries obtained as aggregation of the 3 following categories classified under the Old age function treating for type 4.2 double counting: Old-age pension beneficiaries (1130111). It is the number of pension beneficiaries obtained as aggregation of the elementary items 1131111 and 1132111, treating for type 3 double counting; Anticipated old-age pension beneficiaries (1130112). It is the number of pension beneficiaries obtained as aggregation of the elementary items 1131112 and 1132112, treating for type 3 double counting; Partial pension beneficiaries (1130113). It is the number of pension beneficiaries obtained as aggregation of the elementary items 1131113 and 1132113, treating for type 3 double counting. 12 Total pension beneficiaries in survivors' function (1140111). It is the number of pension beneficiaries classified under the Survivors\u2019 function obtained as aggregation of the elementary items 1141111 and 1142111, treating for type 3 double counting. 13 Total pension beneficiaries in unemployment function (1160113).

For any scheme qualitative information has to be provided with respect to: (a) Legal or standard retirement age by gender. A legal/standard retirement age by gender must be indicated for each scheme providing old-age benefits according to the definitions given in the Commission Regulation (EC) No 10/2008. Further on this in paragraph 4.1; (b) Reference date / mode of calculation. Under Annex II, point 2 of the EP and Council Regulation 458/2007 data provision is established with reference to the end of the calendar year. This figure refers to the number of beneficiaries on 31 December/1 January. Further on this in paragraph 4. 3.2.2 Optional data 17 The information by scheme could be further integrated by the gender breakdown of data (the questionnaire is structured so to include these figures) and by the following supplementary information: (c) Total number of pension beneficiaries by scheme (and by gender). It may be defined as the number of persons receiving at least one pension provided by the scheme, i.e. a person who receives more than one pension is counted only once. (d) Total number of pension benefits by scheme (and by gender). Linked to the value under c), this information, basic for a better assessment of the importance of double counting, may be defined as the total number of benefits provided by the scheme, (i.e. a person who receives more than one pension is counted several times). 4. Guidelines and issues 18 The layout of the questionnaire to be used for the pension beneficiaries' module is as the one in annex 3.1 in ESSPROS Manual and user guidelines. Its format is developed in compliance with the rules on transmission set by the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1322/2007, implementing ESSPROS (Annex I, Section 2). 19 The ESSPROS Manual to the Core system has to be referred for general principles in filling in the questionnaire. Though, the two main aspects defining recording in the pension beneficiaries\u2019 module are: 1) Recording of benefits paid to beneficiaries over the legal/standard retirement age, as established in the reference scheme, has to be dealt differently on the basis of the category of benefit formerly participated. More details are given in paragraph 4.1; 2) Calculating the number of pension beneficiaries necessitates the identification of double counting and if double counting exists, its elimination at all stages of aggregation. Guidelines are given in detail in paragraph 4.2. ",
        "III Appendix III: Methodology of the module on Pension beneficiaries 79 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 20 Alternative practices follow for issues that are likely to be met by countries when filling in the questionnaire: 21 The data required concern the number of beneficiaries. In the impossibility to supply this information at scheme level, the number of benefits should be supplied, by explicitly indicating the value concerns the benefits and not the beneficiaries. In this case, calculating the number of beneficiaries, at \"all schemes\" level, would require estimates for the sum of double counting ( Number of beneficiaries = Number of benefits \u2013 Sum of double counting). 22 The values at \"all scheme\" level have to be supplied broken down by gender. If this breakdown is not known, or supplying it would represent a very hard work or would involve a worsening on the data, an estimation of the figures concerning the two genders has to be provided. 23 The questionnaire sent to any Member State would contain white cells for those benefits for which expenditures (quantitative data in ESSPROS Core system) were recorded the year before the one pension beneficiaries' collection refers to. The values should be inserted only in these \"white cells\". In case some schemes are missing (for instance, a new scheme has started up), it is possible to add them, maintaining the same format in the questionnaire. 24 In case of discovering inconsistencies between expenditure figures and data on pension beneficiaries due to an imperfect classification of expenditure data (e.g. expenditures on disability pensions above the legal/standard retirement age not recorded under old age), it is recommended to revise and improve the classification of expenditure data rather than classifying data on the number of beneficiaries in the wrong way. So again, there might be the need to revise the questionnaire (including a short comment indicating these revisions would be very helpful). 4.1 Legal/standard age of retirement 25 The concepts of legal and standard retirement age, defined in the Commission Regulation (EC) No 10/2008, Annex I, are necessary, as stated in the Part 2 of Manual, to distinguish clearly between the old-age functions and other functions. 26 Regardless the country-specific practice, in order to respect the principle of the functional classification of the ESSPROS, pensions paid to beneficiaries over the legal/standard retirement age, as established in the reference scheme, must be recorded under the item old-age pension in case the benefit provided was formerly classified as disability pension; not the same applies to survivors\u2019 pensions keeping their classification regardless the age of the pensioner. 27 The concepts are better explained in the user guidelines integrating the ESSPROS Manual where further guidance to practical issues is given. Countries specifying a standard retirement age should indicate the methods or the reasons for selecting a specific age. 4. 2 Treatment of double counting 28 Stages of the gradual aggregation process where double counting could arise have been individuated (Table B).

At cell level inside a scheme 2. At one pension category level between schemes 3. At item level between Non Means and Means-tested subcategories 4. At intra-function level 5. At inter-function level (Old-age plus Survivors) 6. At total pension beneficiaries level Different double counting types are numbered according to the implicit ordered steps followed in the data aggregation process leading to the total number of pension beneficiaries. Double counting when aggregating at scheme level is not included in the methodology as its treatment is not finalized to obtain data as in the aim of the module. A. Double counting for a pension category inside a scheme (cell level): type 1 29 The first step in filling in the questionnaire is the aggregation of all benefits included under the same heading; a cell can include either different types of benefits (case 1.1) or beneficiaries from two or more schemes (case 1.2). 30 case 1.1) If the cell refers to a category including different types of benefits, in most cases the number of beneficiaries cannot be obtained by a simple aggregation of the beneficiaries of the benefits included in the cell because a person can be beneficiary of different benefits at the same time. 31 case 1.2) Sometimes, because of the lack of information, it is impossible to know how many beneficiaries receive one specific type of benefits from a scheme, and how many from another one. In this case an estimate/imputation of the breakdown between the schemes should be made. B. Double counting between schemes (pension category level): type 2 32 The second step is horizontal aggregation: the same pension category is aggregated through schemes. Double counting between schemes has to be eliminated since, in general, the number of beneficiaries given under a social benefit (pension), cannot be obtained by a simple aggregation of the beneficiaries for all the schemes. For a given benefit, pensioners might be beneficiaries of: 33 case 2.1) several basic schemes (e.g., public and private). If this the case and each person has an own personal identification number (that is, for instance, given to everyone soon after birth), the double counting can be easily avoided. Otherwise, a correction coefficient, showing the relationship between pensions and pensioners, could be used. 34 case 2.2) several supplementary schemes. The same methods mentioned for case 2.1 could be used. 35 case 2.3) one basic and one supplementary scheme. Each pensioner gets benefits from a basic scheme and from a supplementary scheme: the beneficiaries of the supplementary scheme should not be aggregated. ",
        "III Appendix III: Methodology of the module on Pension beneficiaries 81 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 36 case 2.4) several basic schemes and one supplementary scheme. One should first deal with double counting between supplementary and basic (see case 2.3) and then with double counting between the basic schemes (case 2.1). 37 case 2.5) one basic scheme and several supplementary schemes. It is necessary first to treat double counting between supplementary schemes (see case 2.2) and then proceed as indicated in case 2.3. 38 case 2.6) several basic schemes and several supplementary schemes. It is necessary first to treat double counting between supplementary schemes (see case 2.2) and then proceed as indicated in case 2.4. C. Double counting between non-means-tested and means-tested pension categories (item level): type 3 39 Third step, set at all-schemes level, is the aggregation of non means-tested and means-tested subcategories of any benefit. At this step, generally it is the case where no double counting arises, but in some countries different situations may deserve attention: 40 case 3.1), all the beneficiaries of means-tested benefit also get a non means-tested benefit. In this case, the number of beneficiaries without double counting is the number of beneficiaries of the non means-tested benefit. 41 case 3.2) if a beneficiary of a means-tested benefit does not get necessarily a non means-tested benefit as well, the methods to estimate the total number of beneficiaries (non means-tested + means- tested) for that benefit should be indicated. D. Double counting between categories in aggregation 42 In the last step, namely vertical aggregation at all-schemes level, double counting treatment has to be dealt with differently according to degrees of aggregation (intra-function aggregation, inter-function aggregation, total aggregation). D.1 Double counting in intra-function aggregation: With respect to the two functions involved: Double counting in Disability function: type 4.1 43 There should be no double counting between the pensions categories falling under the disability function, because the conditions for granting these pensions are different (see \u00a7 24 and 25 in ESSPROS Manual \u2013 Part 2). Hence, if it is the case, the number of beneficiaries can be easily calculated by adding the beneficiaries of these two pension categories. For countries meeting problems in distinguishing between \"disability pensions\" and \"early retirement benefits due to reduced capacity to work\" references and clarifying examples could be found in the ESSPROS Manual and user guidelines.

Following the ESSPROS methodology, there should be no double counting between the three pension categories falling under the old-age function, because, as specified in the ESSPROS Manual, the anticipated and partial pensions are converted into old age- pensions when the beneficiary reaches the retirement age or when he/she retires completely. Still exceptions to this general principle could be met by countries: in this case references and clarifying examples could be found in the ESSPROS Manual and user guidelines. D.2 Double counting in inter-function aggregation Double counting between total old age and survivors' pension beneficiaries: type 5 45 Whether the case of a country without a national pension system integrating old age, disability and survivors\u2019 functions and without a conversion system transforming disability and survivors\u2019 pensions into old age pensions at the legal retirement age, double counting might be present when aggregating pensioners under \u201cold-age pension\u201d and those under \u201csurvivors\u2019 pension\u201d. Double counting in total number of pensioners: type 6 46 The total number of pensioners, previously indicated by the code 1000000, is defined as in \u00a7 9 of this Appendix. Generally speaking, the number of the total of pension beneficiaries is not assumed to be equal to the sum of the beneficiaries of each pension category even though it is obtained as aggregation of them. Further difficulties are expected to appear for some countries, when double counting has to be eliminated at this final stage. In these cases, the value for total pensioners might be obtained from other sources (e.g. administrative data). 47 Double counting between beneficiaries in disability and old-age functions does not need to be eliminated, if disability cash benefits paid after retirement age are recorded in the old-age function under the old-age pensions as required in the methodology. Still, double counting might arise between survivors' and disability pensions and between the category partial pensions and other pension categories. ",
        "IV Appendix IV: Methodology of the module on Net Social protection benefits (restricted approach) 83 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition APPENDIX IV: Methodology of the module on net social protection benefits (restricted approach) 1 Introduction 1 According with the decision taken at the April 2009 Working Group meeting on net social benefits, Eurostat decided to implement the net benefits module according to the so-called restricted approach, explained in the following. The module on net social protection benefits should be obtained using this approach, in order to have the same population of beneficiaries of the gross social protection benefits collected in the ESSPROS Core System. 1.1 Background 2 The ESSPROS Core system consists of a stable, annually collected set of data on the receipts and expenditures of social protection schemes in the European Union. ESSPROS data are collected according to the Regulation 458/2007 and two supplementary Commission Regulations. The first Regulation provides the basis for the development of a module on net social protection benefits. Following this provision, other two Commission Regulations were introduced as legal basis for the module on net social protection benefits. 3 The methodology of the Core system is defined in the first two parts of this manual, which is the reference document for the four Commission Regulations implementing the EP and Council ESSPROS Regulation. It contains all detailed definitions and classifications for the ESSPROS Core system. This appendix dedicated to the module on net social protection benefits (restricted approach) should be seen as an extension to the first two parts, following all definitions given therein and providing additional definitions and clarifications where necessary. 4 The ESSPROS Core system collects data on the expenditure on social protection benefits provided by public and private bodies to individuals and households without any deduction of taxes and other obligatory levies payable on social benefits by beneficiaries. This expenditure is therefore considered as gross . It represents the value of social benefits disbursed by resident social protection schemes and the value of benefits received in cash or in kind by beneficiaries. 5 However, the cross-country comparability of data on gross expenditure is limited by the fact that in some cases the benefits paid to recipients are liable to taxes on income and/or social contributions, whilst in others they are not. Taxes and social contributions levied on social benefits have the effect of reducing the gross expenditure of general government on social protection and reducing the extent to which social benefits increase the disposable income of recipients. 6 The aim of the ESSPROS module on net social protection benefits is to collect information that measures the impact of the fiscal system on gross expenditure and thereby provide data on net social protection expenditure that are more comparable between countries. 1.2 The restricted and enlarged approaches to measuring net social protection benefits 7 Article 2 of the ESSPROS Regulation (EC) No 458/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council defines net social protection benefits to be \u201cthe value of social protection benefits excluding ",
        "Appendix IV: Methodology of the module on Net Social protection benefits (restricted approach) IV 84 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition taxes and social contributions paid by the benefits\u2019 recipients complemented by the value of fiscal benefits\u201d where fiscal benefits are defined to be \u201csocial protection provided in the form of tax breaks that would be defined as social protection benefits if they were provided in cash, excluding tax breaks promoting the provision of social protection or promoting private insurance plans\u201d. This definition marks out two separate elements to net benefits. 8 The first \u2013 social protection benefits less taxes and social contributions paid on those benefits by their recipients \u2013 implies no change to the scope of the Core system. It represents a strict conversion from gross expenditure to net expenditure after taking into account the value of taxes and social contributions paid on gross benefits. By definition, the population of recipients of net and gross benefits must be the same. This is known as the \u201crestricted approach\u201d to measuring net benefits. 9 The second element \u2013 fiscal benefits \u2013 potentially enlarges the scope of the net benefits module compared to the Core system because it includes the value of social benefits implemented solely through the fiscal system, which are not included in the Core system. Fiscal benefits reduce the amount of taxes and/or social contributions paid on all forms of income (e.g. from employment) and therefore increase the disposable income of beneficiaries in addition to the social benefits recorded in the Core system. Moreover, fiscal benefits may accrue to persons who receive no social benefits paid in cash or in kind who are therefore not members of the population of benefit recipients covered by the Core system. Adding the value of fiscal benefits to the value of net benefits according to the restricted approach is known as the \u201cenlarged\u201d approach to measuring net benefits20. The two approaches can be summarised as follows ( 21 ): F.1 Net social benefits (restricted) = Gross social benefits \u2013 Taxes & social contributions paid on benefits by recipients F.2 Net social benefits (enlarged) = Net social benefits (restricted) + Fiscal benefits 1.3 Development of the net benefits module (restricted approach) 10 In accordance with the timetable laid out in Article 5 of the ESSPROS Regulation (EC) No 458/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Eurostat launched in 2007 a programme of work to implement a pilot collection of data on net social protection benefits referring to 2005. 11 Following consultation with a Task Force meeting in January 2008, Eurostat decided to implement the net benefits module according to the restricted approach. 12 A pilot data collection of net social protection benefits according to the restricted approach was launched in April 2008 for all EU-27 countries plus Iceland and Norway, with a deadline for submission of data by the end of October 2008. Preliminary results were presented to a full Working Group on net benefits in April 2009. In accordance with the procedure outlined in Article 5.2 of the regulation, the meeting voted in favour of progressing work towards the implementation of the module on net social protection benefits (restricted approach) as a routine data collection. ( 20 ) Note that part of the value of fiscal benefits is in fact included in the restricted approach since any relief on the levies paid on income from social benefits will be accounted for in the actual value of taxes and social contributions deducted from the gross benefits. See the section on residual fiscal benefits . ( 21 ) Both definitions are given for matter of clarification. According to the decision taken by Member States, the approach to be used for compiling net social protection benefits is the restricted approach. The enlarged approach is at an experimental stage only. ",
        "IV Appendix IV: Methodology of the module on Net Social protection benefits (restricted approach) 85 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 2 The definition of net social protection benefits (restricted approach) 2.1 The concepts of gross and net social protection benefits 13 Expenditure recorded in the Core system ( 22 ) covers gross social protection benefits (paragraph 99, 100 and 129 of the first part of this manual)\u2013 it refers to the value of social benefits disbursed by general government before the deduction of any taxes or social contributions paid on social benefits by their recipients. 14 The ESSPROS module on net social protection benefits (restricted approach) records social benefits after the deduction of taxes or social contributions paid on cash social benefits by their recipients. \u21d2 Net social benefits (restricted) = Gross social benefits \u2013 Taxes & social contributions paid on benefits by recipients 2.2 Obligatory levies: Taxes and social contributions 15 The net benefits module (restricted approach) determines the final net value of social benefits by deducting from gross social benefits the part of the combined value of two forms of obligatory levy applied by general government to the income of fiscal units that relates to liable cash social benefits: (i) Taxes on income (ii) Social contributions 2.3 Definitions 16 Taxes on income refers to taxes on individual or household income from employment, property, entrepreneurship, social benefits, etc., including taxes deducted by employers (pay-as-you-earn taxes)( 23 ). (In the remainder of the document Taxes on income are often referred to simply as taxes .) 17 Social contributions refers to compulsory social contributions paid by protected persons as defined in this manual, first part, par. 75. 18 Social contributions refer only to compulsory contributions paid by employees, self-employed persons and non-employed persons. Non-compulsory contributions to private schemes are not included. 19 Social contributions in the net benefits module should never include employers' contributions - either actual or imputed - since these are not levies applied to income from social benefits actually received by individuals or households. ( 22 ) The ESSPROS Core system collects data on the expenditure of social protection schemes broken down into four main categories: social benefits, administration costs, transfers to other schemes and, finally, other expenditure. ( 23 ) See ESA definition of Taxes on income (D.51) ",
        "Appendix IV: Methodology of the module on Net Social protection benefits (restricted approach) IV 86 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition 2.4 Principles of valuation 20 For the assessment of the taxes and social contributions payable by fiscal units, income from liable social benefits is typically cumulated with other sources of income (primarily from employment) to form a tax base (or social-contribution base). Since the final liability is determined by the value of the tax base as a whole, the liabilities cannot be attributed directly to particular components of the tax base and are therefore considered to be distributed according to the proportion each income component represents within the tax base. 21 The part of the total liability related to benefits is therefore calculated as: \u21d2 Taxes on benefits = ( Value of benefits liable to taxes / Tax base ) * Total tax payable \u21d2 Social contributions on benefits = ( Value of benefits liable to social contributions / Social contribution base ) * Total social contributions payable 22 The value of taxes and social contributions to be taken into account should always be the final liability, taking into account any post year-end adjustments and, where relevant, the impact of any fiscal benefits as they apply to liabilities derived from social benefits. In the case that this is not possible, residual fiscal benefits may be reported as complementary amounts (see below). 23 Social benefits that are not liable to taxes or to social contributions do not form part of a tax base or social contribution base. The net value of benefits not liable to levies will always be the same as the gross value. 2.5 Further clarifications 24 Withholding taxes are taxes due on income from social benefits that are calculated in advance of payment, withheld by the payment authority and paid directly to the tax authority on behalf of the recipient. Withholding taxes should not be taken into account when calculating taxes paid on social benefits in the case they are not included in the gross amount paid to the recipient, which is effectively already net of these taxes. In this case to include withholding taxes in the net module would therefore introduce a double counting. 25 The same applies to re-routed social contributions, which are not included in gross benefits paid to recipients but transferred directly to the appropriate social protection scheme. 2.6 Residual fiscal benefits 26 Fiscal benefits are social protection provided in the form of tax breaks that would be defined as social protection benefits if they were provided in cash, excluding tax breaks promoting the provision of social protection or promoting private insurance plans( 24 ). 27 A tax break is an advantage granted to fiscal units in the form of a total or partial reduction in the compulsory levies (taxes on income, social contributions) applied by general government and which is granted for the purposes of social protection. 28 Fiscal benefits increase the net disposable income of fiscal units by reducing taxes and other obligatory levies that they would otherwise have to pay. Fiscal benefits give relief to levies paid on all forms of income (not just benefits) and, in some cases, to indirect taxes on expenditure (e.g. reduction in VAT). They may also be granted to persons that do not receive any social benefits paid ( 24 ) Article 2 of the ESSPROS Regulation (EC) No 458/2007. ",
        "IV Appendix IV: Methodology of the module on Net Social protection benefits (restricted approach) 87 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition in cash or in kind. The main value of fiscal benefits is therefore outside the scope of the restricted approach to net social protection benefits and should not be included. 29 Fiscal benefits typically take the form of adjustments to the regular fiscal system and the value of the relief that applies to levies payable on social benefits should therefore be taken into account in the assessment of the actual taxes and social contributions paid on social benefits. Exceptionally, if the impact of a fiscal benefit is not taken into account in this assessment then the value of net benefits should be complemented by the residual value of the fiscal benefit. In this case the conceptual definition of net benefits (paragraph 0) is modified to make a practical definition as follows: F.3 Net social benefits (restricted) = Gross social benefits \u2013 Taxes and social contributions paid on cash benefits by recipients + Residual fiscal benefits 30 A residual fiscal benefit is the fraction of the total value of a fiscal benefit that relates to relief on levies applied to social benefits (as opposed to the part that relates to relief on levies applied to all other forms of income, which is outside the scope of the restricted approach). 31 Fiscal benefits that relate to relief on indirect taxation are always outside the scope of the restricted approach. 32 A tax break that is deducted directly from the tax liability and is given to the beneficiaries of a certain social protection benefit should be treated consistently with its actual role in the fiscal system. In this respect, two main cases can be envisaged: a. the tax break is alternative to other tax breaks (i.e. the tax unit, in case of other sources of income, can choose among different tax breaks, typical of each source of income, the one that is more convenient for him); b. the tax break is added to the standard tax breaks normally applied (i.e. the standard ones apply and this tax break is additional and specific for the beneficiaries of that benefit). In the first case, in the estimation of the net social protection benefits, the tax break should as a rule be considered like a tax break not related to the benefit (except for the fact that the value is different) and covering all the sources of income. Conversely, in the second case, the tax break should decrease only the taxation on the benefit for which it is allowed. Borderline cases can be treated according to countries\u2019 choice. ",

This could be obtained by collecting data on the amount of taxes and social contributions actually paid by recipients on the cash gross social protection benefits received and applying the F.1 (or eventually the F.3 , if there is any residual fiscal benefit). 35 In order to summarise the information on net social protection benefits, it would then be possible to determine ex post the average tax and social contribution rates that are applied to ESSPROS benefits by scheme and/or by function. In most of the countries data sources do not allow to obtain such a direct estimation. 36 Where direct measures are not available the application of average itemised tax and social contribution rates to gross expenditure on social protection benefits (like in F.4 ) allows the estimation of the module. 37 This chapter provides an overview of the accounting structure within which data are recorded in order to derive the final value of net benefits.

This method is the minimum requirement in order to achieve acceptable figures on net social protection benefits. On the basis of availability of more detailed information, more precise methods can be applied by the countries provided that: a. they respect the definitions set in this manual for the restricted approach; b. they improve the accuracy of the final results; c. and, they preserve the comparability among countries. 42 In practice, taxes and social contributions are levied on groups of income of different types. For example, income from (taxable) social benefits is typically aggregated with income from employment and other sources for the assessment of liability to taxes on income. 43 A tax base or social contribution base refers to the sum of all income, irrespective of its source, that is subject to the same rules of liability. The income of any fiscal unit may be divided into one or more tax or social contribution bases. 44 In the case that particular social benefits are subject to distinct liability rules then AITRs and/or AISCRs should be calculated on a separate tax or social contribution base. For example, if selected benefits are subject (in the final assessment) to flat-rate levies independent of other income (typically taxed progressively) then income from these benefits should be aggregated in a separate tax or social contribution base for which the AITR/AISCR will be the flat-rate fixed by regulation. The income from these benefits will then normally be excluded from the tax or social contribution base used to calculate levy rates for the remaining income, though there may be exceptions \u2013 for example in the case that the income reduces the tax threshold for the regular assessment. 45 Note that it is also possible for a social benefit to be included in two tax bases \u2013 for example if there are taxes on income levied by regional government as well as by national government. In this case the tax rates applicable to each tax base should be summed to generate the overall tax rate for that benefit. 46 In the typical case that obligatory levies are applied to income aggregated from multiple sources it is not feasible or realistic to prioritise the application of levies and then measure, for each recipient, the amounts paid in respect of a particular social benefit. The net benefits module therefore treats all income within the same tax or social contribution base equally. As a result, for a fiscal unit that receives one or more benefits liable to taxes on income, the tax rate applicable to each of those benefits is the same as the overall rate of taxes paid by the fiscal unit (total tax paid / tax base). Benefits received by the same fiscal unit that are not liable to taxes do not form part of a tax base and will always have an AITR of zero. The same applies to social contributions. 47 For a fiscal unit receiving n social benefits liable to taxes on income and y social benefits that are not liable to taxes: Taxable benefits 1 to n: TR TR TR TR n i i i = = = = = = = K 2 1 ",

Net values at the detailed level are then aggregated by function and by main type of benefit (mean-tested, non-means-tested, periodic, lump-sum, etc.) in exactly the same way as in the Core system. 51 The collection of tax and social contribution rates at the most detailed level allows different tax and social contribution rates to be applied to each benefit disbursed by a scheme or to similar benefits provided by different schemes. This is important because even when similar benefits are subject to the same liabilities, if they are issued to different groups of recipients that have different income characteristics then the effective tax/social contribution rates applicable could vary. 52 In the case that it is not practical (or worthwhile in terms of cost/benefit) to collect information on taxes and social contributions at this level of detail it is acceptable for AITRs and AISCRs to be calculated at a more aggregated level and applied to each of the individual benefits/schemes within that aggregate. For example, rates may be applied to all benefits within a scheme or to all benefits of a particular type (across schemes). However, the reliability of results may be compromised if rates are applied to groups of benefits that are issued to recipients with very different income and household characteristics or which are subject to different liability regimes and rates should always be provided at a level of detail that ensures good quality results. 53 When rates are calculated at an aggregated level and applied to each benefit within the aggregate, it is important to ensure the correct treatment of any benefits within the group that are not liable to taxes by the application of a zero rate to relevant benefits. 54 In the case that it is not practical (or worthwhile in terms of cost/benefit) to collect information on taxes and social contributions for AITRs and AISCRs on an annual basis, the technique of applying AITRs and AISCRs on a biennial basis can be followed. ",
        "Appendix IV: Methodology of the module on Net Social protection benefits (restricted approach) IV 92 1 ESSPROS Manual \u2013 2011 edition In such a case net data referred to year N+1 are obtained by applying to gross data of year N+1 the AITRs and AISCRs calculated for year N. This technique can be followed provided that: 1. in the country the rules of taxation for social protection benefits are stable over the two years involved; 2. AITRs and AISCRs for year N are calculated as provided for in the above paragraph 3.2; 3. the reliability of results is not compromised. 55 In case of regular application of the technique of AITRs and AISCRs on a biennial basis, corrections to the AITRs and to AISCRs calculated for year N are allowed before the application of the rates to the gross data of year N+1. These corrections can be introduced by the country provided that the quality of the final results for year N+1 is improved. 3.4 Complementary amounts: Residual fiscal benefits 56 The major part of fiscal benefits belongs only to the enlarged approach to measuring net social protection benefits (paragraph 9). In the restricted approach, the part of the total value of fiscal benefits that pertains to reduced liabilities on social benefits should normally be taken into account in the levies calculated from AITRs and AISCRs. However, when this is not the case, any further amounts accruing to recipients as a result of reduced liabilities on benefits can be reported as residual fiscal benefits. Amounts reported are then added to the net value after deduction of levies to give a final value of net benefits. 3.4.1 Calculation of residual fiscal benefits 57 The subchapter describes the typical method used by compilers to obtain residual fiscal benefits in case they are not accounted for in the levies calculated from AITRs and AISCRs. This method is the minimum requirement in order to obtain acceptable figures on net social protection benefits. On the basis of availability of more detailed information, more precise methods can be applied by the countries provided that: a. they respect the definitions set in this manual for the restricted approach; b. they improve the accuracy of the final results; c. and, they preserve the comparability among countries. 58 The calculation of residual fiscal benefits shall always be limited to the portion of fiscal benefits that is lowering the liability to taxes or to social contributions on social protection benefits. 59 A fiscal benefit has the effect of reducing the tax and/or social contribution liabilities of a fiscal unit and the value should be calculated using the revenue forgone method ( 25 ). In the typical case, the net benefits module applies the relief provided by fiscal benefits equally to the different components of the liabilities due, similar to the application of levies to different sources of income. A residual fiscal benefit can therefore be calculated as follows: A fiscal unit tu has income I (tax base) that includes income from social benefits ( SB ) and other sources ( O ): ( 25 ) The revenue foregone method measures the amount by which the revenues of the tax (or social contribution) collecting authority are reduced as a result of the application of a fiscal benefit and assuming no change in behaviour of the tax-payer. In other words, it measures the value of taxes or social contributions that would have been received by the collecting authority had the fiscal benefit not been applied. ",

If residual fiscal benefits have to be calculated it may be simpler to make an estimation by applying the share of liable social benefits in the total tax or social contribution base of the population to the total value of the fiscal benefit. 61 If a certain fiscal break is designed to reduce the taxes and/or social contributions paid by the fiscal units on a specific social protection benefit (say j ) and if it is not taken into account in the calculation of AITRs and AISCRs; the amount of the corresponding residual fiscal benefit RF j is equal to the value of the allowed fiscal break calculated on the set of fiscal units receiving that social protection benefit (say FU j ): \u2211 \u02db = j FU tu tu j F RF . 3.4.2 Application of residual fiscal benefits 62 Residual fiscal benefits are collected and applied at function level only. The value of residual fiscal benefits at function level and at aggregate (total) level is added to the net value of expenditure after deduction of taxes and social contributions to give the final value of net benefits. 3.4.3 Further clarifications 63 In the case that a social benefit has a cash part and a fiscal part then it should be treated as two separate benefits with the cash part included in the gross benefits and the fiscal part treated as any other fiscal benefit. 64 Fiscal benefits which are granted to individuals who are not recipients of social benefits recorded in the ESSPROS Core system or which are applied to income from sources other than social benefits are not within the scope of the ESSPROS net benefits module (restricted approach). This includes all fiscal benefits that provide relief to indirect taxes (e.g. VAT). ",
