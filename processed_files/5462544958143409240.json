The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development SDGs (SDGs), adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015, gives a new impetus to global efforts to achieve sustainable development. The EU is committed to playing an active role to maximise progress towards the SDGs, as outlined in its Communication (COM (2016) 739) \u2018Next steps for a sustainable European future\u2019 (1). Regular monitoring of progress towards the SDGs in an EU context is essential for this purpose. EU SDG indicator set This regular monitoring builds on the EU SDG in- dicator set, developed in cooperation with a large number of partners and stakeholders. The indica- tor set comprises 100 indicators and is structured along the 17 SDGs. 41 multi-purpose indicators are used to monitor more than one goal.

EU indicator trends This brochure presents a first statistical overview of trends relating to the SDGs in the EU over the past five years (\u2018short-term\u2019); the specific years depend on data availability for the specific indi- cators. Studies and reports which consider cur- rent status, different indicators or different time spans may come to different conclusions. Indicator trends in the brochure are described on the basis of specific quantitative rules. For indica- tors for which EU policy targets exist, the brochure looks at progress towards those targets. This applies to 16 out of the 100 indicators, mainly in the areas of climate, energy consumption, educa- tion, poverty and employment. Indi- cators for which a quantitative policy target exists are marked with a frame. All other indicators are analysed according to the direction and speed of change. Indicator trends are presented visually in the form of arrows. The arrows show whether an indicator has moved in the desired direction or away from the sustainable development objec- tive, as well as the speed of the movement.

        "Eurostat supports the SDGs 2 3 The methodology applied and a detailed analysis of progress for the individual indicators can be found in Eurostat\u2019s 2017 publication \u2018Sustainable development in the European Union - 2017 moni- toring report on progress towards the SDGs in an EU context\u2019. How has the EU progressed towards the SDGs? Over the past five years, the EU made progress to- wards all SDGs. Progress in some SDGs has been faster than in others, and within SDGs, movement away from the sustainable development objec- tives also occurred in specific areas. The EU has made significant progress towards the overall achievement of SDG 7 \u2018affordable and clean energy\u2019, SDG 12 \u2018responsible consump- tion and production\u2019, SDG 15 \u2018life on land\u2019, SDG 11 \u2018sustainable cities and communities\u2019 and SDG 3 \u2018good health and well-being\u2019 . It should be noted that progress towards a given SDG does not necessarily mean that the status of that SDG is satisfactory for the EU. For example, in the case of SDG 15, which focuses on terrestrial ecosystems, the indicators chosen mostly show good progress, but this should not lead to the conclusion that ecosystems or biodiversity in the EU are in good health. Over the last five years, the EU made moderate progress in eight SDGs. Such moderate trends can be seen in SDG 4 \u2018quality education\u2019, SDG 17 \u2018partnership for the SDGs\u2019, SDG 9 \u2018industry, innovation and infrastructure\u2019, SDG 5 \u2018gender equality\u2019, SDG 8 \u2018decent work and economic growth\u2019, SDG 1 \u2018no poverty\u2019, SDG 2 \u2018zero hun- ger\u2019 and SDG 10 \u2018reduced inequalities\u2019 . In the case of four SDGs \u2013 SDG 6 \u2018clean water and sanitation\u2019, SDG 13 \u2018climate action\u2019, SDG 14 \u2018life below water\u2019 and SDG 16 \u2018peace, justice and strong institutions\u2019 \u2013 trends cannot be cal- culated due to insufficient data over the past five years ( 2 ). The following pages of the brochure present each of the 17 SDGs in more detail, by: \u2022 framing the UN and EU context of each SDG; \u2022 showing the short-term trends in the EU for most indicators (represented by arrows); \u2022 providing up-to-date figures for each individu- al indicator, including all multi-purpose indica- tors under all their respective SDGs.

        "Eurostat supports the SDGs 4 5 SDG 1 calls for an end to poverty in all its manifestations, including extreme poverty, over the next 15 years. It envisions shared prosperity, basic standard of living and social protection benefits for people everywhere, including the poorest and most vulnerable. In order to empower people to raise them- selves out of poverty, SDG 1 seeks to ensure equal rights and access to economic and natural resources as well as technology, property and basic and financial services. It also calls for supporting commu- nities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters and empha- sises policy commitment and mobilisation of resources as essential levers for accelerating poverty eradication. The EU focuses on monitoring progress in alleviating multidi- mensional poverty and on ensuring that the basic needs of EU citizens are met.

        "Eurostat supports the SDGs 6 7 SDG 2 seeks to end hunger and malnutrition, and ensure access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. Sus- tainable and resilient food production systems are a key factor in achieving this SDG. Implementing sustainable agricultural practic- es can help ensure future food security in a scenario of increasing demand and changing climate. Realising these SDGs is largely de- pendent on increased investment in rural infrastructure and agri- cultural research and development. Even with favourable increases in agricultural production, however, food security and improved nutrition will be elusive for many if price and information distor- tions in world agricultural markets persist. Policy makers have a role to play in promoting sustainable production systems and ensuring proper functioning of food commodity markets and access to mar- ket information. The EU focuses on monitoring progress in fighting against malnu- trition, fostering sustainable agricultural production and reducing the adverse impacts of agricultural production.

        "Eurostat supports the SDGs 8 9 SDG 3 aims to ensure health and well-being for all at all ages by improving reproductive, maternal and child health; ending the epidemics of major communicable diseas- es; reducing non-communicable and mental diseases. SDG 3 also calls for reducing behavioural (drugs and alcohol abuse, tobacco) as well as environmental health risk factors (traffic accidents, chem- icals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination). Main prerequisite for meeting these objectives are universal health cov- erage; access to sexual and reproductive health-care services and to safe, affordable and effective medicines and vaccines for all. Other crucial steps for addressing persistent and emerging health issues that SDG 3 emphasises are support for research and development of vaccines and medicines, increased health financing and health workforces in developing countries and strengthened capacity for early warning and management of health risks. The EU focuses on monitoring progress in enabling EU citizens to live healthy lives, by monitoring health determinants, causes of death and access to health care.

        "Eurostat supports the SDGs 10 11 SDG 4 seeks to ensure access to equitable and quality ed- ucation through all stages of life. Apart from formal qualifications, SDG 4 also aims to increase the number of youth and adults having relevant skills for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, SDG 4 envisions the elimination of gender and income disparities in access to education. The achieve- ment of universal literacy and numeracy and the acquisition of knowledge and skills to promote sustainable development are also considered crucial for empowering people to live independent, healthy and sustainable lives. To accelerate progress with all these objectives, SDG 4 calls for building and upgrading educational facil- ities, expanding the number of higher education scholarships avail- able to developing countries and increasing the supply of qualified teachers. The EU focuses on monitoring progress in basic education, tertiary education and adult education.

It also recognises the importance of universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights for combating gender inequality. SDG 5 calls for equal rights, recognition and value of un- paid care and domestic work, and access to economic and natural resources, technology, basic and financial services, and proper- ty for women. It also calls for their full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of political and economic decision-making. The adoption of sound policies and legislation to promote gender equality are seen as essential for eliminating gender discrimination and fostering women\u2019s empow- erment in all societal spheres, as is the enhanced use of enabling technologies.

This includes the safeguarding of marine and coastal ecosystems, con- serving at least 10 % of coastal and marine areas as well as pre- venting and reducing marine pollution and the impacts of ocean acidification. The conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources also requires an end to overfishing, destruc- tive and/or illegal fishing practices and the abolition of fisheries subsidies, which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing. SDG 14 seeks to increase economic benefits to small-island developing states and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources and to provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets. It also highlights the im- portance of increasing scientific knowledge, research capacity and marine technology for improving ocean health.
